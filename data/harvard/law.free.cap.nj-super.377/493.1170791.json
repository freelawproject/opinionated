(TA) appeals from a December 19,2003 order enforcing a settlement of litigation between it, other plaintiffs, and defendant Jackson-Hewitt, Inc. (JHI). The settlement was negotiated on behalf of all plaintiffs by a Steering Committee and was submitted for approval to the individual plaintiffs consistent with their individual but identical retainer agreements with the same attorney. Those agreements contained a provision whereby each individual plaintiff agreed to a settlement approved by a weighted majority of plaintiffs. Defendant filed a motion to enforce the settlement when such a weighted majority of plaintiffs accepted the settlement. We hold that the retainer agreement containing the weighted majority provision for settlement of the litigation is contrary to <em>RPC 1.8(g) of </em>the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPCs) and is unenforceable. Consequently, the order enforcing the settlement over plaintiffs objection is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The plaintiffs in the underlying litigation were 154 entities that own and operate franchises of JHI, a nationwide tax preparation service. As part of their business, plaintiffs make loans to tax filers in anticipation of the filer receiving a refund from the Internal Revenue Service. Thus, during the 2002 tax season, plaintiffs processed over $25 million in Refund Anticipation Loans (RALs). Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">Prior to Tax Season 2000, an established course of dealing was created between the parties by which the defendants distributed monetary rebates, called \u201cPerformance Incentive Rebates,\u201d to the plaintiffs and other eligible JHI franchisees following each and every Tax Season in which a positive balance of funds remained in a reserve account, known as the \u201cRisk Pool,\u201d after all delinquent RALs had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>paid. In fact, JHI and SBBT [Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust] <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and/or other participating banks distributed those funds to the plaintiffs and other eligible JHI franchisees in the form of Performance Incentive Rebates following each and every Tax Season prior to Tax Season 2000 in which the defendants announced that a positive balance of funds remained in the Risk Pool after all delinquent RALs had been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">Despite their extensive course of dealing with the plaintiffs and despite repeatedly making specific oral and written representations that such Performance Incentive Rebates would continue to be paid following each and every Tax Season in which a positive balance of funds remained in the Risk Pool, beginning in Tax Season 2000, the defendants quietly discontinued their pattern and practice of issuing Performance Incentive Rebates. Instead of distributing rebates to JHI franchisees, on information and belief, the defendants converted the balance of funds that remained in the Risk Pool following Tax Seasons 2000, 2001 and 2002 to their own respective accounts and/or the accounts of their respective affiliates. On information and belief, as much as $26 to $32 million remained in the Risk Pool after all delinquent RALs had been paid following the 2002 Tax Season alone. The defendants have refused to fully disclose their respective revenue or that of their respective affiliates in connection with JI-II\u2019s Bank Product Programs, and the defendants have failed to provide an accounting concerning the Risk Pool and other funds generated from the sales of RALs during Tax Seasons 2000, 2001 and 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Essentially, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was that they were entitled to share in rebates from the Risk Pool \u201cto the extent that funds remained in the Risk Pool after delinquent RALs had been paid following each Tax Season beginning in Tax Season 1994 ... to each of the plaintiffs that maintained or maintains a low RAL delinquency ratio during the Tax Season.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 three causes of action against JHI were based on breach of express contract, contract implied-in-fact, and contract implied-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">In their individual franchise agreements, plaintiffs had agreed that any legal action against JHI would not be in the form of a class action. As a result, the complaint named each of the 154 franchisees individually as a plaintiff. The plaintiffs collectively hired Eric Karp, Esq. of Witmer, Karp, Warner &amp; Thoutte (Witmer Karp) of Boston, to represent them. Each plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>entered into an attorney-client fee agreement with the firm on or about May 30, 2002. Each fee agreement provided that \u201cthe Matter will be pursued by the Attorney on a collective basis with other similarly situated franchisees (hereafter the \u2018Co-Plaintiffs\u2019) of Jackson Hewitt, Inc.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fee agreement also appointed a Steering Committee, consisting of four individuals: Robert Phillips, Robert Schiesel, George Alberici, and Kenneth Leese. Leese is the owner of TA, the sole appellant on this appeal. \u201cIn order to streamline the matter,\u201d the Steering Committee was \u201cempowered to make decisions for the Co-Plaintiffs on all strategic and similar procedural matters other than the decision to settle the matter [as provided in the agreement].\u201d According to a certification of Karp, \u201c[t]he terms and provisions of the fee agreement, including the development of the voting mechanism, were the subject of much discussion and negotiation\u201d between he and the Steering Committee, discussions in which Leese \u201ctook the lead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">As to settlement, the fee agreement provided that \u201c[t]he client agrees that the Matter may be resolved by settlement as to any portion or all of the Matter upon a vote of a weighted majority of the Client and all of the Co-Plaintiffs,\u201d a quorum being 60% of the votes eligible to be cast. The weighting came about as a result of a provision in the agreement which allowed \u201c[e]ach Plaintiff ... [to] have one vote for each funded RAL for the 2002 Tax Season,\u201d and provided that a plaintiff was only eligible to vote if it was current on all its payments pursuant to the fee agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The fee agreement went on to provide for specific circumstances in which the attorney and his firm could terminate their representation of the client, but did not, however, set out the circumstances under which a client could terminate the relationship. Finally, the agreement also provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">The Client has been given the opportunity to consult with an attorney outside the Firm about any aspect of this Agreement prior to signing. The Client acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>edges having read this Agreement and signs it freely and voluntarily and accepts the terms hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Plaintiffs collectively filed their complaint in August 2002. That same month, Schiesel passed away. His position on the Steering Committee was not filled as the fee agreement did not provide for any such substitution. None of the plaintiffs contested the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The parties subsequently agreed to mediate the dispute. The mediation took place on June 30 and July 1, 2003 and was mediated by Eric Van Loon (the mediator), an attorney at a Boston firm, JAMS. On July 1, 2003, JHI and the Steering Committee agreed to a settlement in principle, embodied in a single-page agreement (the JAMS Settlement), setting out thirteen specific items comprising the settlement. JHI\u2019s representatives and the Steering Committee members, including Leese, signed the JAMS Settlement that same day. Consistent with the attorney-client fee agreement, the JAMS Settlement provided that it was \u201csubject to Plaintiffs Steering Committee obtaining plaintiffs\u2019 overall approval as per their agreement,\u201d as well as to approval by JHI\u2019s Board of Directors. In its brief, JHI asserts that \u201c[d'Juring the mediation, JHI was informed of the existence of the \u2018Majority Buies Agreement\u2019 when its representatives expressed concern about ensuring that all plaintiffs would be bound by any settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">After July 1, Leese asserted that his \u201cinvolvement with Mr. Karp and the Steering Committee changed,\u201d continuing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">6. I began to challenge Mr. Karp regarding certain issues concerning the settlement in principle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">7. Once I began to challenge Mr. Karp, I learned that the remaining members of the steering committee were meeting with Mr. Karp without my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\">8. As a result, I believe that the plaintiff body did not have full representation once the steering committee began meeting without my knowledge or participation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-12\">9. When I learned of this development, I terminated my relationship with Mr. Karp and was no longer a member of the steering committee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">The record does not reveal the date Leese terminated his relationship with Karp and the Steering Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Ultimately, a weighted majority did approve the JAMS Settlement, with TA abstaining from the vote. On October 30, 2003, Karp posted a formal, detailed, nineteen-page Settlement Agreement (the Agreement), which had been negotiated between him and counsel for JHI, on a password protected website, and emailed a copy of the Agreement to each plaintiff. Karp requested that each plaintiff return a signed duplicate copy of the Agreement to him by November 12, a deadline later extended to November 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">On November 21, Karp posted a bulletin on the website, informing his clients that any plaintiff who did not submit a response by December 1 would be presumed to have declined to do so. The communication further stated that it would then be necessary for Karp to seek leave to withdraw as counsel due to a conflict between those plaintiffs that had signed the Settlement Agreement and those that had not. A copy of this memorandum was also e-mailed to each plaintiff on November 21. A November 24, posting to the website reiterated the December 1 deadline and warned that a motion for leave to withdraw as counsel for those who did not sign the Agreement would be filed on December 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">As promised, on December 2, Karp filed a motion for leave to withdraw as counsel for those plaintiffs who had not returned the signed Agreement as of that date. The twenty-six plaintiffs in question constituted 16.88% of the plaintiffs and 22.64% of the weighted votes. In seeking withdrawal, Karp stated that the interests of those plaintiffs who had not signed the Agreement had become \u201cdirectly adverse\u201d to those who had signed and that his continued representation would violate <em>RPC </em>1.7(b) and <em>RPC </em>1.16(b)(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 3, 2003, JHI filed a motion to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the settlement. On December 19, the court, after hearing argument, granted both motions, relieving Karp as counsel for the non-signing plaintiffs* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and enforcing the settlement over the objection of TA and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">TA raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">A The proposed settlement is void because plaintiffs\u2019 counsel violated the Rules of Professional Conduct in connection with the settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">B. The plaintiff group is not bound by the proposed settlement because plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not have the authority to bind the plaintiff group, and the \u201cmajority rules\u201d provision of the retainer agreement does not cure this defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">C. The settlement agreement cannot be enforced as to the plaintiff group because JHI\u2019s reliance on plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s representations regarding the majority rules provision was not reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">D. The trial court\u2019s decision is internally inconsistent to the extent that it recognizes the constructive discharge of the attorney, but nonetheless forced The Tax Authority to abide by the attorney\u2019s advice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">E. In violation of public policy, JHI deprived plaintiffs of the right to participate in class action litigation and therefore should not be rewarded by imposing finality upon unwilling plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">F. <em>The </em>plaintiffs\u2019 agreement with their <em>attorney was </em>also unenforceable as contrary to public policy, and frustrated by events and conditions arising during the course of representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>TA argues that it is not bound by the settlement because counsel for the plaintiffs \u201calbeit unintentionally,\u201d violated <em>RPC </em>1.8(g) which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">[a] lawyer who represents two or more clients shall not participate in making an aggregate settlement of the claims of or against the clients ... unless each client gives informed consent after a consultation that shall include disclosure of the existence and nature of all the claims ... involved and of the participation of each person in the settlement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">TA contends that the settlement with JHI violated this RPC. As noted, a vote on the proposed settlement was not unanimous, though a majority voted to accept it. As a result, according to TA, though counsel did not have the consent of \u201ceach client,\u201d he proceeded to participate in effectuating the settlement rather than immediately withdrawing from the representation as required by <em>RPC </em>1.16(a)(1) or withdrawing from the JAMS Settlement. TA argues that as a result of this alleged breach, \u201ccounsel\u2019s acts in concluding the settlement are not binding on and cannot be enforced against the Plaintiff Group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In finding that the settlement should be enforced, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">[Tjhis is a case where the clients, the plaintiffs clearly entered into an agreement with time to reflect. They consulted with Mr. Karp. They could have gone to another attorney and consulted with another attorney, but they clearly agreed that they were going to move forward and they were going to be governed by the majority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">And the majority, the other plaintiffs had a right to rely on that agreement also. They had a right to enter into a representation agreement with Mr. Karp based on a belief that this ease was not going to go on for 15 years until [every] last one of them agreed to a settlement, but that when a majority of them agreed, this was going to be over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">And there\u2019s a distinctive difference between that kind of a representation agreement and a type where 90 percent have to consent, or as <em>Hayes [v. Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc. </em>513 F.2d 892 (10th Cir.1975)] seems to say, 100 percent. And it would really be flying in the face of the consenting plaintiffs to allow the dissenters to hold them up after they all agreed, after a chance to reflect and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>seek independent representation, they all agreed that they were going to move forward in this way, and they\u2019ve paid Mr. Karp, I hope. And they have moved the ease forward this way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">And to change the mode of operating at this point in the litigation seems to me to be eminently unfair to those other plaintiffs, and it is not fair to J.H.I. either, whether or not they\u2019re a third-party beneficiary of this agreement \u2014 of the majority rules agreement, they certainly did participate in the settlement of this case thinking that once they got 51 percent or over 50 percent of the plaintiffs to agree with them, that the ease was going to be done, and they could write out their checks or whatever it is that they\u2019re doing and put this behind them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">Now as I said, there\u2019s a substantial amount of money, not only paid in counsel fees on both sides, but also paid for the mediator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">Now the plaintiffs also say that they agreed to do this with the steering committee composed of four people, one of whom died and that this fourth person who unfortunately died, was their person. Now I\u2019m not sure how that changes anything because that person, although maybe [sic] been able to change the settlement agreement had he been there, certainly couldn\u2019t have outvoted the steering committee, and certainly couldn\u2019t have, with his vote added, certainly couldn\u2019t have changed the ultimate outcome. It\u2019s also unclear as to when the gentleman died, whether it was before this was negotiated or after, because some of the papers say 2002 and then another set of papers say 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">And at any rate, that position was brought up very late in the game, just the last week, I think, as a matter of fact, it hadn\u2019t been asserted as a view previously. And for what it\u2019s worth, although the issue here is not whether or not to exonerate Mr. Karp, I do want to say for the record that implicit in my ruling is that he did not do anything improper in his representation because if I was of the opinion that he did, then my opinion about the enforceability of the settlement would be different, because I would be making an opinion saying that Mr. Karp did not give his clients the right to object at the appropriate time, but I\u2019m going to enforce it anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">And I just want it to be clear that even though Mr. Karp\u2019s compliance with the RPCs is not an issue before me that my issue rests on my finding for the purposes of this motion that Mr. Karp did comply with 1.8(g)____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">The fee agreement and the ultimate settlement are, of course, inextricably linked due to the inclusion in the agreement of the weighted-vote, majority rules mechanism. We agree with TA that such an agreement is improper. The potential for conflict of interest on the part of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney was built into the arrangement. Indeed, the representation of more than one client in litigation presents \u201cclassic danger zones for conflicts of interest.\u201d Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. &amp; W. William Hodes, <em>The Law of Lawyering </em>\u00a7 12.16 at 12-47 (Supp.2004). In our view, the agreement violated the spirit, if not the letter, of <em>RPC </em>1.8(g). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>settlement mechanism clearly contemplated that there could or would be those plaintiffs that did not agree with the settlement terms. Notwithstanding their disagreement, the views of such dissenters could be overridden by the majority. In such instance, there could be no consent, or informed consent, by the dissenting client, as the RPC requires. We reject JHI\u2019s suggestion that, by entering into the fee agreement, each plaintiff consented \u201cin advance\u201d to any settlement that was approved by the majority. Such a fiction is not appropriate to a proper interpretation of standards designed to guide the ethics of the legal profession. <em>But see Scott v. Randle, </em>697 <em>N.E.2&amp; </em>60, 68 n. 4 (Ind.App.1998) (suggesting that individual group members could \u201ccommunicate their consent through a unanimously agreed upon spokesperson and decision-maker\u201d). Of course, in this case, the potential for mischief was realized since there was a minority opposed to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">TA relies on <em>Hayes, </em>which the motion judge found distinguishable. On appeal, defendant again attempts to distinguish <em>Hayes. </em>While we agree that there are distinguishing features, as there are between most eases, we conclude that the Tenth Circuit\u2019s rationale is sound. In <em>Hayes, </em>as here, there was a prior agreement between the clients and their attorney that a \u201cmajority rule would govern acceptance of a settlement,\u201d although three plaintiffs claimed \u201cthey had never agreed to be bound by the majority.\u201d <em>Hayes, supra, </em>513 <em>F.</em>2d at 892. On the eve of trial, there was a settlement offer which was accepted by a vote of thirteen to five, the settlement was announced in open court and reduced to a judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 893. After initially vacating its judgment due to the protest of the non-consenters, the District Court judge reconsidered and reinstated the settlement, finding that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney had apparent and actual authority to accept the settlement on behalf of his clients. <em>Ibid. </em>The Circuit Court reversed. It ruled that an agreement \u201cwhich allows a case to be settled contrary to the wishes of the client and without his approving the terms of the settlement is opposed to the basic fundamentals of the attorney-client relationship,\u201d since \u201cthe attorney is merely an agent for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>client in negotiation and settlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 894. The court was further troubled by the fact that since the majority vote agreement was entered into before the settlement negotiations,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">[i]t is difficult to see how this could be binding on non-consenting plaintiffs as of the time of the proposed settlement and in light of the terms agreed on. In other words, it would seem that plaintiffs would have the right to agree or refuse to agree once the terms of the settlement were made known to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The <em>Hayes </em>court also perceived an ethical dilemma for plaintiffs\u2019 attorney in light of the applicable ethics rule which required \u201cthe attorney to refrain from participating in a settlement on behalf of two or more clients unless each of them consents to it. In view of this, it was untenable for the lawyer to seek to represent both the clients who favored the settlement and those who opposed it.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">We hold that the arrangement presented allowing the majority to govern the rights of the minority is violative of the basic tenets of the attorney-client relationship in that it delegates to the attorney powers which allow him to act not only contrary to the wishes of his client, but to act in a manner disloyal to his client and to his client\u2019s interests. Because of this, it is essential that the final settlement be subject to the client\u2019s ratification particularly in a non-class action ease such as the present one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 894-95.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">JHI and the motion judge distinguish <em>Hayes </em>from the present case in several respects. Here, the plaintiffs had authorized the Steering Committee to negotiate a settlement, a fact not present in <em>Hayes. </em>We find that distinction to be of no moment. It is not the use of a steering committee which we find objectionable but the manner in which the result achieved by the committee is turned into settlement, i.e., by majority vote. Indeed, the fee agreement itself provided that the Steering Committee was not empowered to settle on behalf of the plaintiffs. In addition, in <em>Hayes, </em>nearly a quarter of the plaintiffs objected to the settlement, which took place on the eve of trial, while a much smaller percentage disagreed here. We fail to discern how the number of dissenters or the timing of the settlement bear on the principles involved. Most important, according to the motion judge, was that the Kansas ethics rule applicable in <em>Hayes, </em>differed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>RPC </em>1.8(g) in that it required the client to be advised of \u201cthe total amount of the settlement, and of the participation of each person in the settlement,\u201d Model Code of Professional Responsibility <em>DR </em>5-106, before consenting to an aggregate settlement. <em>RPC </em>1.8(g), on the other hand, only speaks to the client being advised of the nature of \u201call the claims ... involved and of the participation of each person in the settlement.\u201d Here, as defendant points out, all of the plaintiffs, and particularly TA, through Leese, knew the essential terms of the settlement, as spelled out in the JAMS Settlement. This difference between the Kansas and New Jersey ethics rules misses the point.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The critical provision of the RPC is that the client consent to the final settlement. Even assuming sufficient disclosure in this case, the fact remains that the fee agreement settlement mechanism in theory, and as it played out in this case, permitted settlement without consent as to those in the minority. As one court has noted, it is the fact that not all of the clients had consented to the settlement which was critical to the outcome in <em>Hayes. Petition of Mal de Mer Fisheries, Inc., </em>884 <em>F.Supp. </em>635, 639-40 (D.Mass.1995). We find <em>Hayes </em>persuasive on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\"><em>Knisley v. City of Jacksonville, </em>147 Ill.App.3d 116, 100 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>705, 497 N.E.2d 883 (1986), <em>appeal denied, </em>113 <em>Ill.2d </em>575, 106 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>47, 505 N.E.2d 353 (1987), also followed <em>Hayes </em>to the same conclusion. There, the court faced a trial court ruling enforcing settlement of a dispute between sixty-one homeowners as plaintiffs and a construction company and housing authority as defendants, in which plaintiffs claimed that construction of certain buildings would violate applicable zoning ordinances. <em>Id. </em>at 884. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney entered into settlement negotiations with defendants and eventually agreed to a settlement, believing that he had authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>from his clients to do so after a meeting with most of them. According to the attorney, the few that did not attend the meeting later agreed to settle. The attorney claimed that the plaintiffs had agreed \u201c\u2018that a majority would control the actions of the group.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 885. As a result, after defendants rejected an initial settlement proposal, he contacted a majority of the plaintiffs who agreed to a second settlement proposal. However, \u201c \u2018some people who had been opposed earlier remained opposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>At a second meeting with plaintiffs, a \u201ccontroversy arose as to whether the case should be settled,\u201d causing the attorney to seek leave to withdraw as plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. <em>Ibid. </em>A motion to enforce the settlement was filed by defendants and the attorney was given leave to withdraw. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">At the hearing on the petition to enforce the settlement, several plaintiffs testified that they and others (a total of six) had voted against the settlement and had not authorized the attorney to settle. Indeed, one of the plaintiffs testified that the vote in favor of majority rule was itself not unanimous. <em>Ibid. </em>The appellate court reversed the trial court\u2019s enforcement of the settlement as to those appealing plaintiffs that had opposed it, but affirmed as to those who consented to the settlement, as well as to those who opposed but did not appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the majority rule could not bind plaintiffs who had never consented to it. <em>Id. </em>at 886. More importantly, the court observed that enforcement of the settlement against those who had not agreed to it would be \u201ccompletely at odds\u201d with <em>DR </em>5-106, the same rule applicable in <em>Hayes. Id. </em>at 887. Indeed, the court placed considerable reliance on <em>Hayes </em>in reaching its conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 886-87. In an action joining many plaintiffs, unlike a class action which requires court approval, \u201ca party should not be bound [to a settlement] unless he has specifically agreed to it. Fundamental fairness is violated when a settlement is allowed to bind parties who object and no safeguards have been added to protect their interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Of course, <em>Knisley </em>is distinguishable as well in that the plaintiffs\u2019 group had not even been in agreement with respect to the majority rule. Further, the opinion could be read to suggest that the majority rule, if adopted by all plaintiffs, might have estopped the plaintiffs from denying their attorney\u2019s apparent authority to settle. <em>Id. </em>at 886. To the extent that <em>Knisley </em>endorses a unanimously agreed to majority rule, we decline to follow it. In general, however, and particularly with regard to its endorsement of <em>Hayes, </em>we find the decision supportive of the result we reach. <em>See also Abbott v. Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., </em>42 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>1046, 1050-51 (D.Colo.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We find further support in Joint Opinion 666/14 of the Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics and the Committee on Attorney Advertising. <em>N.J. Ethics Opinion 666, </em>132 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>210 (1992). There, the Committees addressed a direct mail solicitation sent to targeted real property owners inviting them to consider an appeal of their tax assessments. One of the terms contained in the solicitation was that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">[bjecause of the large number of property owners involved, it will be impossible to present for your review and approval any proposed settlement of your ease. Therefore, by signing this agreement, you authorize us to settle your case upon such terms and conditions as we, in our professional judgment, deem to be in your best interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">\n<em>[Ibid,]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The Committees found this condition to be improper, in violation of <em>RPC </em>1.8(g), rejecting the attorney\u2019s argument that obtaining client approval of a settlement proposal would, under the circumstances, be impractical and cost-prohibitive. \u201cNo matter how laudable the intentions or seemingly exigent the circumstances\u201d the client must be the one to decide whether to accept a settlement offer. According to the Committees, a lawyer could not ethically seek the client\u2019s advance approval for a settlement even though the attorney deemed the settlement to be in the client\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Nevertheless, it has been persuasively argued that the prohibition on agreed-in-advance majority rules settlement authority, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>interpreted in <em>Hayes, </em>represents neither good law nor good policy. Silver &amp; Baker, <em>supra, </em>32 <em>Wake Forest L. Rev. </em>at 768-73. The authors argue that litigants should be free to waive the unanimity requirement of <em>RPC </em>1.8(g); indeed, \u201cit is perverse to deny mass action plaintiffs this option.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 769. They undertake to demonstrate the error in the position taken by the <em>Hayes </em>court, and others, \u201cthat nonwaivability derives from agency law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770-73. In fact, as they argue, \u201cagency law leaves co-principals free to use any decision rule they please.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771. <em>RPC </em>1.8(g)\u2019s \u201cunanimous consent requirement is probably the most significant barrier to settlement in mass lawsuits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 767. As Judge Weinstein has said, \u201c[t]oo rigid an adherence to formal ethical-legal rules constitutes a violation of the basic rule of ethics itself, requiring a practical regime in which the needs of the public, the parties, and the law are in reasonable balance.\u201d Jack B. Weinstein, <em>Ethical Dilemmas in Mass Tort Litigation, </em>88 <em>Northwestern Univ. L.Rev. </em>469, 492 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The authors of a leading text have suggested that whether an advance agreement that majority rules is effective \u201cmay depend on how the relationship between the clients themselves is understood. If each client is thought of as an individual only, then <em>RPC </em>1.8(g) would seem to require the informed consent of each client <em>at the time of the settlement. </em>On the other hand, if it can be said that each client has (validly) agreed to \u2018limited\u2019 representation under <em>RPC </em>1.2(c), or that it is really the <em>group </em>that has retained the lawyer, then the arrangement could perhaps withstand challenge by a disgruntled dissenter.\u201d Hazard &amp; Hodes, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.16 at 12.50; <em>see also id. </em>at 12.50-51. The <em>Restatement </em>would allow a lawyer to represent a client notwithstanding a conflict of interest \u201cif each affected client ... gives informed consent to the lawyer\u2019s representation. Informed consent requires that the client ... have reasonably adequate information about the material risks of such representation to that client.\u201d <em>Restatement of the Law, The Law Governing Lawyers </em>\u00a7 122 (2000). However, \u201c[cjlient consents to conflicts that might arise in the future is</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>subject to special scrutiny, particularly if the consent is general.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment d. <em>See also id. </em>at \u00a7 128. Clearly, there are advantages to the client in simultaneous representation, as exemplified by this case. <em>See </em>Nancy J. Moore, <em>Conflicts of Interest In The Simultaneous Representation of Multiple Clients: A Proposed Solution To The Current Confusion and Controversy, </em>61 <em>Tex. L.Rev. </em>211, 226-27 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Notwithstanding these strong arguments to the contrary, we decline to carve out an exception to the unanimity requirement for mass action suits such as the one under review. Rather, we agree with the formulation of the appropriate rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">During the negotiation of an aggregate settlement, the lawyer with multiple clients must confer with all clients and fully disclose sill details of the proposed settlement. Every client must then consent before the settlement may be finalized. The lawyer may not seek advance consent or consent by way of a majority vote of the lawyer\u2019s multiple clients. The requirements of consultation, disclosure, and consent are intended to prevent lawyers from unduly favoring some clients over others in group settlements, to enable clients to block package deals that benefit the lawyer more than the clients, and to bolster client autonomy in settlement decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\"><em>[Lawyers\u2019 Manual on Professional Conduct </em>(ABA/BNA) 51:375 (1999).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Given the \u201cdeeply ingrained\u201d doctrine \u201cthat a lawyer must respect a client\u2019s decision not to settle,\u201d Silver &amp; Baker, <em>supra, </em>at 773, any change should come from our Supreme Court, which has primary responsibility for attorney ethics, as reflected in the RPC. <em>See Cohen v. Radio-Elec. Officers Union, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>140, 155, 679 A.2d 1188 (1996); <em>Jacob v. Norris, McLaughlin &amp; Marcus, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>10, 17, 607 A.2d 142 (1992). \u201c[A]n attorney\u2019s fi\u2019eedom to contract with a client is subject to the constraints of ethical considerations and our supervision.\u201d <em>Cohen, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 155, 679 A.2d 1188. The RPCs \u201cestablish the state\u2019s public policies with respect to attorney conduct. Contracts that violate the RPCs violate public policy, and courts must deem them unenforceable.\u201d <em>Jacob, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 17, 607 A.2d 142; <em>see also Cohen, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 156, 679 A.2d 1188 (\u201cAn otherwise enforceable agreement between an attorney and client would be invalid if it runs afoul of ethical rules governing that relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ship.\u201d). As a result, we conclude that the majority rules settlement provision in the fee agreement signed by plaintiff is invalid and enforcement of the settlement on that basis cannot stand.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Nevertheless, defendant contends that plaintiff is estopped to withdraw from the settlement. Indeed, estoppel seemed to be at the heart of the motion judge\u2019s decision when she spoke of the unfairness to both defendant and the settling plaintiffs and of the \u201csubstantial amount of money\u201d paid in counsel fees and for mediation. Before addressing this issue, we note our disagreement with defendant\u2019s attempt to restate plaintiffs\u2019 argument as being that \u201cgoverning ethics rules require that a party who participates in a collective settlement must be advised of the amount he will receive <em>before </em>he consents to the settlement, or the party will not be bound by the settlement.\u201d From this premise, defendant argues that since Leese, as a member of the Steering Committee, knew what TA\u2019s share of the settlement would be when he \u201capproved the settlement and signed the JAMS Settlement Agreement,\u201d he is estopped to withdraw from the settlement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not agree. Clearly, to give an informed consent to a settlement, even in the context of a majority vote provision, a client must either know the amount he will receive or be able to calculate that amount by reference to some previously agreed upon formula. TA\u2019s argument is not, as we understand it, that Leese did not have that essential knowledge but that TA ultimately declined to accept the JAMS Settlement to which, as a member of the Steering Committee, Leese had agreed in principle on July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>1,2003. That, in turn, leads to the question whether Leese, by his conduct, is estopped to eschew the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Equitable estoppel, sometimes referred to as estoppel <em>in pais, </em>requires conduct by one party done \u201cintentionally or under such circumstances that it was both natural and probable that it would induce action. Further, the conduct must be relied on, and the relying party must act so as to change his or her position to his or her detriment.\u201d <em>Miller v. Miller, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>154, 163, 478 A.2d 351 (1984). \u201cIt is a doctrine designed to prevent a party\u2019s disavowal of previous conduct if such repudiation \u201cwould not be responsive to the demands of justice and good conscience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carlsen v. Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots Pension Plan Trust, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>334, 339, 403 A.2d 880 (1979) (quoting <em>W. Jersey Title &amp; Guar. Co. v. Indus. Trust Co., </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>144, 153, 141 A.2d 782 (1958)). Stated differently, it is \u201can equitable doctrine, founded in the fundamental duty of fair dealing imposed by law, that prohibits a party from repudiating a previously taken position when another party has relied on that position to his detriment.\u201d <em>Casamasino v. City of Jersey City, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>333, 354, 730 A.2d 287 (1999) (quoting <em>State v. Kouvatas, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>417, 425, 678 A.2d 1178 (App.Div. 1996)). Thus, it is not necessary that fraudulent intent be shown but only that the conduct \u201cworks an unjust or inequitable result to the person it was designed to influence.\u201d <em>Widmer v. Tp. of Mahwah, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 85, 376 A.2d 567 (App.Div.1977) (quoting <em>N.J. Suburban Water Co. v. Harrison, </em>122 <em>N.J.L. </em>189, 194, 3 A.2d 623 (E. &amp; A.1939)). <em>See also Miller v. Bd. of Tr. of Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>473, 477, 432 A.2d 560 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>502, 443 A.2d 714 (1981). However, the doctrine is applied \u201conly in very compelling circumstances,\u201d <em>Palatine I v. Planning Bd., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>546, 560, 628 A.2d 321 (1993) (quoting <em>Timber Prop., Inc. v. Chester Tp., </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>273, 278, 500 A.2d 757 (Law Div.1984)), <em>disapproved of on other grounds, D.L. Real Estate Holdings v. Point Pleasant Beach Planning Bd., </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>126, 134-35, 820 A.2d 1220 (2003), \u201cwhere the interests of justice, morality, and common fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>clearly dictate that course.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Gruber v. Mayor and Tp. Comm. of Raritan Tp., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>1, 13, 186 A.2d 489 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">We see no basis for an estoppel based upon Leese\u2019s conduct in signing the JAMS Settlement and then disavowing it. We do not construe Leese\u2019s signing on July 1, 2003 as an irrevocable acceptance of the settlement terms on behalf of TA. The fee agreements signed by each plaintiff explicitly stated that the Steering Committee could decide all matters other than the decision to settle. As a result, the signing of the JAMS Settlement by the Steering Committee members could only be seen as a decision to submit the terms proposed by the mediator to the plaintiffs for their vote. Contrary to JHI\u2019s assertion, the Steering Committee had no authority to bind the plaintiffs to a settlement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, the JAMS Settlement explicitly recognized that fact, as well as the fact that the settlement was subject to approval of JHI\u2019s Board of Directors. Thus, the JAMS Settlement was tentative at best and defendant could not have been misled into thinking otherwise. It was always a real possibility that the weighted majority would not approve the settlement. And it was clear quite soon after the voting deadline had passed that a small number of plaintiffs did not agree to the settlement terms as proposed in the JAMS Settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Nor do we view Leese\u2019s conduct, on behalf of TA, as constituting a repudiation of a previously taken position, such as to give rise to an estoppel. Further, we see no detrimental reliance by JHI on Leese\u2019s conduct in signing the JAMS Settlement. It is true that JHI proceeded to negotiate the final Settlement Agreement with Karp, but that was in reliance upon the majority vote approving the settlement, which we have determined is unenforceable, not on Leese\u2019s conduct as a member of the Steering Committee. JHI refers to \u201cthe cost and potential distraction of resuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>litigation with [TA].\u201d But that consequence, as we have noted, was always a possibility if the settlement was not approved. In that respect, Leese stands in no different position than any other plaintiff that voted against the settlement. We see nothing in these facts to constitute the \u201cvery compelling circumstances,\u201d <em>Palatine I, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 560, 628 A.2d 321 (quoting <em>Timber Prop., Inc., supra, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 278, 500 A.2d 757), in which estoppel is \u201cclearly dictate[d]\u201d by the \u201cinterests of justice, morality, and common fairness,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Gruber, supra, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>at 13,186 A.2d 489).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">As a result of our disposition, we see no need to address TA\u2019s argument that the provision in its franchise agreement with JHI that required it to forego class action litigation against JHI violated public policy. We note, however, that we have previously rejected the argument that a similar provision contained in an arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it had a \u201cdetrimental impact on consumers\u2019 rights.\u201d <em>Gras v. Assoc. First Capital Corp., </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42, 51-52, 786 A.2d 886 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>445, 794 A.2d 184 (2001). Similarly, we need not address TA\u2019s argument that this case should be treated as a de facto class action, requiring a fairness hearing. <em>See R. </em>4:32-4; <em>see also Chattin v. Cape May Greene, Inc., </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>618, 626-28, 524 A.2d 841 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>148, 526 A.2d 209 (1987). While we have earlier expressed the view that plaintiffs counsel should have withdrawn as attorney for all plaintiffs, <em>see infra </em>note 4, counsel for the plaintiffs in a class action is not similarly constrained, and may continue to represent the class even in the face of dissenters from the class, a subject exhaustively discussed in <em>In re M &amp; F Worldwide Corp. Shareholders Litigation, </em>799 A.2d 1164, 1172-77 (Del.Ch.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">To summarize, the judge bound TA to a settlement to which it did not consent, pursuant to a majority vote agreement which we conclude is unenforceable. While it is indeed regrettable that one of 154 plaintiffs may possibly upset a settlement as to which all others have now agreed, we see no principled basis upon which to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>require TA to settle when it does not wish to do so, nor does the conduct of its representative compel that result. Our strong public policy in favor of settlements, <em>Nolan v. Lee Ho, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>465, 472, 577 A.2d 143 (1990), is in this instance outweighed by the public policy embodied in <em>RPC </em>1.8(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\"> Pacific Capital Bank, N.A., a National Banking Association d/b/a Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust (SBBT) was named as a defendant, along with JHI, in plaintiffs' complaint.

Although not raised by TA, we are of the view that Karp should have withdrawn as counsel for <em>all </em>plaintiffs since his position favoring settlement had placed him in an adverse relationship to some of his former clients. <em>See RPC </em>1.16(a)(1), 1.7(a), 1.9(a).
