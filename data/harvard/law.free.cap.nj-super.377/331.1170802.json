There was no penalty phase because the jury did not unanimously find that he committed the murder by his own conduct, and he received an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>aggregate prison sentence of life plus twenty years with forty-five years of parole ineligibility. The dispositive issue is whether the trial judge improperly denied Figueroa\u2019s motion to represent himself at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Over six months before trial, a hearing occurred on Figueroa\u2019s request to represent himself. Appearing with him were the two attorneys assigned by the Public Defender. The judge\u2019s initial questioning revealed that Figueroa, who was over thirty years old, had a ninth grade education and that he was particularly focused on conducting his own cross-examination of witnesses, although he had never done so, and was unfamiliar with the trial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">As the questioning continued, Figueroa admitted that he had never read a DNA report before or cross-examined a DNA expert, although the DNA evidence was critical in this case. He recognized that \u201c[his] life [was] on the line,\u201d but firmly believed that he knew his \u201ccase and [his] discovery better than anybody in here.\u201d When asked whether he had tried to \u201cenlighten\u201d his attorneys about his case, this colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Enlighten them. I just told you. I want, I want to do the cross-examining myself. I don\u2019t know, what would be the problem with me doing the cross-examining? If they want to be there, represent me right next to me, they can but I want to do the cross-examine. What\u2019s so hard about me given the opportunity to cross-examine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">THE COURT: Because I want to be able to have you represented effectively. I don\u2019t believe that you fully understand what rights you give up when you say I want to waive the right to counsel. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">THE DEFENDANT: I understand that____What I\u2019m trying to say is I have no</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">problem with their representation, you understand? But I would like to be able to cross-examine, to speak out, you know, do the cross-examining on the witnesses. Why can I not do that? They can be in there in case there\u2019s something I have no knowledge of, you know, to represent me but I would like to do the cross-examination. I want to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-12\">THE COURT: And you don\u2019t feel it could be effectively done by you coordinating with counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-13\">THE DEFENDANT: No. I would like to do it myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>After acknowledging that defendant appeared to be acting voluntarily, the judge expressed doubt about whether the waiver was knowing and intelligent, and then suggested that Figueroa\u2019s request was \u201cmore an emotional response.\u201d In response, Figueroa said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">It\u2019s not emotional. I\u2019m perfectly, I\u2019m perfectly fine when it comes to emotional. I\u2019m the one sitting here facing a capital murder case. Does it look like I\u2019m emotional? I\u2019m not emotional. I want to be able to represent myself and speak out. What\u2019s so hard about me speaking out?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">After expressing concern about whether Figueroa understood the difference between testifying, arguing, and cross-examining, the judge then questioned him on the subject of mitigating and aggravating factors, demonstrating that Figueroa was confused about them. Figueroa acknowledged that his knowledge on those subjects was limited, but added \u201cI guess I got time to go to the law library and study, don\u2019t I?\u201d and \u201cIf I\u2019m going to represent myself, then I be going back to prepare myself, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The judge\u2019s ruling denying the motion included these observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">I believe you voluntarily want to give up your right to counsel but I don\u2019t believe you knowingly and intelligently want to give up. [ ] I think you\u2019re acting more from emotion than you are from intellect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">You have a ninth grade education and although you do appear quite articulate, I still don\u2019t believe you fully comprehend what it is counsel does for you so you can\u2019t understand what it is you\u2019re giving up. Despite the fact you may have had some contact with the criminal justice system historically, <em>I would feel more comfortable that you knowingly gave up your right had you been through a trial at some point \u2022in time in your past but you\u2019ve never been through a trial. ... </em>Your mental capacity\u2019s never been a question. I don\u2019t believe that you fully comprehend the defenses or possible defenses available to you or avenues of defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">[(Emphasis added.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-12\"><em>In </em>addition, the judge expressed concern about Figueroa\u2019s inability to effectively cross-examine the prosecutor\u2019s DNA expert, particularly since the defense lawyers had stated that there would be no defense DNA expert, and his lack of knowledge about procedure. Finally, the judge expressed concern about Figueroa\u2019s confusion on the meaning of mitigating and aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Criminal defendants have a constitutional right \u201cto dispense with counsel and to proceed <em>pro se.\u201d State v. Crisafi, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>499, 509, 608 A.2d 317, 323 (1992) (citing <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 <em>U.S. </em>806, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>2525, 45 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>562 (1975)). Exercise of the right depends on a knowing and intelligent waiver. <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>168, 173, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>944, 948, 79 L.Ed.2d 122, 130 (1984)). The right applies as well in the context of capital cases, with two provisos: standby counsel must be appointed, and if defendant refuses to prove mitigating factors in the penalty phrase, standby counsel must do so. <em>State v. Reddish, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>553, 603-06, 859 A.2d 1173, 1203-05 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Before ruling, a trial judge must engage in a searching inquiry, which <em>Crisafi </em>said should include explanation of the nature of the charges, possible defenses, and the range of punishment; the technical problems arising from self-representation, and the risks taken if the defense is unsuccessful; the requirement that the defense be presented in compliance with the rules of criminal procedure and evidence; and the inadvisability of proceeding without assistance of counsel. <em>Crisafi, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 510-12, 608 A.2d at 323-24. In <em>Reddish, </em>the Court expanded on the nature of the required inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">We encourage trial courts to esqjlore subjects that are inherent in, or offshoots of, those identified in <em>Crisafi. </em>By way of illustration, those additional areas would include whether defendant will experience difficulty in separating his roles as defendant and counsel; whether defendant understands that he not only has the right not to testify, but also the right not to incriminate himself in any manner; whether he understands that he could make comments as counsel from which the jury might infer that he had knowledge of incriminating evidence (and the difficulty in avoiding such comments); and whether he fully understands that if he crosses the line separating counsel from witness, he may forfeit his right to remain silent and subject himself to cross-examination by the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">In its discussion with defendant, the trial court also must advise defendant that if the court allows him to represent himself, he will thereby waive any and all later claims that his self-representation constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Further, as with all areas of inquiry regarding the decision to waive counsel, the trial court must question defendant to ascertain whether he actually understands the nature and consequences of his waiver. The trial court must explore fully the bona fides of a defendant\u2019s claim of \u201cknowingness.\u201d It must determine whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>defendant\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d is real or feigned. Courts must be sensitive, as this trial court was, to attempts by a defendant to claim \u201cknowingness\u201d merely to assuage the court\u2019s concerns about the consequences of pro se representation. To that end, beyond a defendant\u2019s mere yes or no response, the court must make appropriate credibility determinations bottomed on specific facts, observations, and conclusions. The court must ask appropriate open-ended questions that will require defendant to describe in his own words his understanding of the challenges that he will face when he represents himself at trial. For example, a defendant may be required to explain what difficulties he believes he will confront or create when he examines or cross-examines witnesses. Accordingly, the trial court must conduct separate inquiries concerning waiver of counsel before both the guilt and penalty phases in the event defendant seeks to appear pro se in both phases. The court should adjust its questions and analyses to meet the circumstances and exigencies in each instance. Its inquiry before the penalty phase may warrant questions beyond those posed before the guilt phase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">We stress that we are not requiring defendants to \u201chave the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligent!y to choose self-representation.\u201d <em>Faretta, supra, </em>422 <em>U.S. </em>at 835, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2541, 45 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 581-82. Nor are we even requiring any \u201ctechnical legal knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 836, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d at 582.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">As our opinion recognizes, a defendant who waives counsel jeopardizes his constitutional right, against self-incrimination, and, thus, his liberty. The requirement that a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel be \u201cknowing\u201d would ring hollow if courts did not take extensive prophylactic measures to assess a defendant\u2019s understanding of those rights. In offering this additional guidance, we have confidence that our courts will exercise sound discretion in determining whether the waiver is knowing and intelligent given the unique circumstances of each case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\"><em>[181 N.J. </em>at 593-95, 859 A.2d at 1197-98 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">The judge\u2019s inquiry fell well short of the searching inquiry required by <em>Crisafi </em>and <em>Reddish. </em>In addition, Figueroa\u2019s comments suggested that he was interested in hybrid representation, reserving to himself only the conduct of cross-examination, while leaving others matters to his counsel. We have noted that \u201chybrid representation may be foreclosed and is to be avoided wherever possible[,]\u201d <em>State v. Roth, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>152, 165-66, 673 A.2d 285, 292 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>68, 679 A.2d 655 (1996) (citations omitted), but may be granted in the trial judge\u2019s discretion. <em>State v. McCleary, </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 80, 373 A.2d 400, 401 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>26, 379 A.2d 257 (1977). In this ease it was a subject that required exploration under the principles described in <em>Crisafi </em>and <em>Reddish.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>With these principles in mind, we return to the judge\u2019s opinion. The record supports his findings only to the extent that he determined that Figueroa was acting voluntarily and was articulate. The record provides no support for the judge\u2019s finding that Figueroa was moved by emotion rather than intellect. But, and this is critical, the judge\u2019s finding that Figueroa failed to adequately \u201ccomprehend what it is counsel does,\u201d and the \u201cdefenses or possible defenses available,\u201d must be seen as arising from the judge\u2019s failure to meet his duty of explaining those matters, as is required by <em>Reddish, </em>which was decided after this case was over, and <em>Crisafi. </em>The judge\u2019s concern, we should add, about Figueroa\u2019s confusion about mitigating factors was irrelevant for two reasons. There must be \u201cseparate inquiries concerning waiver of counsel before both the guilt and penalty phases in the event defendant seeks to appear <em>pro se </em>in both phases[,]\u201d <em>Reddish, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 595, 859 A.2d at 1198; and even if a defendant is permitted to represent himself in the penalty phase, standby counsel has the obligation of presenting mitigating evidence if defendant fails or refuses to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 605, 859 A.2d at 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">As the Court re-iterated in <em>Reddish, </em>a defendant who wants to proceed <em>pro se </em>need not \u201c\u2018have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose self-representation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, 859 A.2d at 1198 (citation omitted). \u201cNor [need he have] any \u2018technical legal knowledge.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citation omitted). While Figueroa obviously lacked the indicated skills and knowledge, the trial judge was wrong in denying him the right to proceed <em>pro se </em>on those grounds, which is, we believe, what he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Reversed and remanded for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
