After merging the weapons conviction into the murder conviction, defendant was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment with a thirty year period of parole ineligibility. This was defendant\u2019s second trial on these offenses; we reversed his prior convictions on both charges. Regrettably, we must again reverse and remand for a new trial. We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>that the prosecutor engaged in an inappropriate and harassing line of questioning in his cross-examination of defendant\u2019s primary expert witness on the insanity issue, which was the sole issue on trial, thereby unfairly impugning the witness\u2019 credibility in the eyes of the jury. Despite timely objection to this line of attack, the trial judge permitted it to continue. We cannot find the resulting error harmless in the context of this \u201cbattle of the experts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We will set out only so much of the tragic and horrific details of the crime as are necessary for an understanding and resolution of the issue we find dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On January 11, 1993, defendant was released from the hospital after a nearly month-long stay for treatment of a chronic psychiatric illness. Shortly thereafter, defendant learned that his sister, Noreen, was pregnant and involved in a relationship with a Mexican man.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Laurie Bleefeld, a co-worker and close friend of the victim, testified that Noreen had gone on vacation to Canc\u00fan, Mexico in the spring of 1992. While there, she entered into a romantic relationship with a man she met in Canc\u00fan, Luis Hernandez. In the fall of 1992, Noreen again traveled to Canc\u00fan and returned to the United States with Hernandez. Noreen and Hernandez lived with Bleefeld for a short time until they found their own apartment. Bleefeld knew that Hernandez was in the United States illegally. She was concerned that Hernandez might have hepatitis because his skin and the whites of his eyes were \u201cyellowish\u201d and he \u201cseemed to be dragging.\u201d Noreen became pregnant by Hernandez. She was excited about the pregnancy, discussed it with Bleefeld, and spoke about it openly at social gatherings.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">On January 14, 1993, shortly before midnight, defendant summoned the police to his parents\u2019 home, stating that he needed to be transported to the hospital. Police Officer Daniel Murdoch, of the Middletown Township Police Department, picked defendant up at about 11:33 p.m. Defendant appeared depressed, but was dressed neatly and \u201cotherwise calm.\u201d On the way to the hospital, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>defendant told Murdoch that \u201che was having dreams, bad dreams and hearing voices and he wanted to go [to the hospital] and speak with someone because he didn\u2019t want to hurt anybody.\u201d Murdoch left defendant with hospital security.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Shortly thereafter, defendant left the hospital \u201cagainst medical advice,\u201d apparently before seeing a physician or a crisis-unit worker. Defendant later explained that he left the hospital \u201cbecause it was taking too long.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The following morning, January 15, defendant went to a friend\u2019s apartment where he drank coffee and removed two knives from a kitchen drawer. Noreen picked him up at his friend\u2019s apartment and they proceeded to the West End Post Office on Brighton Avenue in Long Branch. Defendant asked Noreen whether she knew what she was doing to their parents as a result of her relationship with Hernandez. They entered the post office between 11:00 and 11:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">According to Adrienne Smith, a postal clerk, defendant looked \u201cscary creepy ... because he had on a big heavy coat with his hands curled up.\u201d Noreen completed her transaction and then walked to one of the utility tables inside the post office. There were five or six customers in the post office at that time. Defendant left the post office by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">After most of the customers had left, defendant re-entered the post office. He approached the service window and bought two stamps from Smith, the only remaining postal employee. There was only one other customer present. After purchasing the stamps, defendant approached the tables where Noreen was working. Defendant stood behind her, blocking Smith\u2019s view of Noreen. Smith was assisting the other customer when she heard the victim say, \u201cstop____ [Y]ou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d Smith tried to see what was happening but defendant was blocking her view. It looked like defendant was hitting the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">In fact, in full view of passersby, who could see the events through the front window of the post office, defendant stabbed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>sister numerous times. Eventually, an off-duty police officer entered the post office and managed to get defendant away from his sister and to drop one of the two knives he was holding. While the officer restrained defendant on the floor, defendant said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt her, that\u2019s my sister. I love her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Defendant was taken to police headquarters and processed. Because of a cut on his finger, the police took defendant to Monmouth Medical Center where his sister had also been taken for treatment. In the course of questioning at the hospital, defendant stated that he was upset with his sister, \u201cthat she was dating an illegal foreigner who had hepatitis, and he didn\u2019t want her to ruin the family in any way. So he had to take care of it and stop her.\u201d Defendant was examined by two psychiatrists at the hospital, one of whom recommended that he be taken to Trenton Psychiatric Hospital apparently based upon a suicide threat, defendant\u2019s need to be medicated and his general mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">However, rather than being taken to the Psychiatric Hospital, defendant was questioned by a Long Branch detective after being given his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>warnings for a second time. The detective asked defendant what had happened. Defendant replied: \u201cMy sister is going with a foreigner. She wouldn\u2019t listen. I had to stop her.\u201d When asked why, defendant stated, \u201cTo keep the family together.\u201d When asked what the problem was with dating a foreigner, defendant replied: \u201cHe\u2019s a Mexican. He\u2019s in the country illegally. She\u2019s pregnant. He had hepatitis. The baby was going to be born sick.\u201d Napoletano asked defendant what he had done to stop his sister, defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I blacked out, and I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d The detective described defendant\u2019s demeanor during questioning as \u201ctense,\u201d \u201cagitated,\u201d and \u201cvery edgy.\u201d He paced around the room and did not stay still. However, defendant\u2019s answers were responsive to the officer\u2019s questions, and he made no comments that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>tangential to the subject matter discussed. Defendant appeared to \u201cperfectly understand\u201d everything that was said to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Throughout his stay at the hospital, defendant repeatedly asked the officers about his sister\u2019s status. When Noreen arrived at the emergency room, she had no pulse and was not breathing. The emergency trauma team managed to resuscitate her only after they surgically opened her chest and manually pumped her heart. She died in an operating room later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">When the officers learned that the victim had died, it was decided that defendant would not be told unless he again asked about her status. When defendant next asked about his sister\u2019s status, he was tense and edgy. However, when the detective told him that his sister had died, defendant visibly relaxed, sat down on a gurney, and appeared relieved. Defendant said: \u201cGood, this is what I wanted to do.\u201d He then \u201cmade the sign of the cross\u201d and added, \u201cI\u2019m happy. I\u2019m in a good mood because that\u2019s what I wanted. I wanted to kill her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">At this juncture, the detective re-advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and asked whether he understood them. Defendant responded, \u201cyeah, I had to do it to save my family.\u201d Defendant was again asked whether he understood his rights, and he again confirmed that he did. When asked why he had to save his family, defendant stated that the victim went to Canc\u00fan and got involved with a Mexican, \u201can illegal alien.\u201d Defendant further explained that he \u201chad to stop her,\u201d because \u201cit was an unhealthy baby\u201d and \u201can unhealthy situation.\u201d Asked whether he followed the victim to the post office, defendant stated: \u201cNo, we went together. I had to do what had to be done.\u201d Defendant again made the sign of the cross and stated, \u201cgood. That\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d The detective asked defendant why he wanted that result, and defendant replied, \u201cI told you, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">An autopsy of the victim\u2019s body revealed that she had been stabbed thirty-three times. The medical examiner confirmed that the victim was two-months pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>At trial, defendant relied upon an insanity defense. As Ms primary psycMatric expert, defendant presented Dr. Steven Simring. In addition, Dr. John J. Verd\u00f3n testified as defendant\u2019s expert on surrebuttal. The State produced one expert, Dr. Timothy Miehals. All three experts agreed that defendant had a mental illness; specifically, chronic paranoid scMzophrema. All three experts further agreed that defendant understood the nature and quality of Ms conduct when he stabbed and Mlled the victim. The experts also agreed that schizophremc persons are capable of formulating criminal intent. Further, they agreed that a scMzophrenic person is capable of strong emotions such as anger, jealousy and rage, just as are persons who are not mentally ill. The experts also agreed that a schizophrenic person\u2019s symptoms can be more or less severe at various times, and that a schizophrenic person can be deluded in one area of thought while intact in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The issue upon wMch the experts differed was whether defendant knew that stabbing the victim was wrong. The defense experts opined that defendant did not know his conduct was wrong, while the State\u2019s expert opined that he did. Thus, the issue for the jury was whether, at the time he killed the victim, defendant\u2019s illness was so acute or \u201cout of control\u201d that he did not know killing the victim was wrong, or whether, despite his illness, he did know the wrongfulness of Ms conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">There is no need to detail Simring\u2019s testimony, wMch was based on an interview he conducted with defendant in January 1994; Ms review of defendant\u2019s medical history as evidenced by hospital records dating from the early 1980s; psychiatric reports by various treating doctors; records of medications prescribed; police reports; witness statements; defendant\u2019s statements to the police; the autopsy report; and letters written by defendant prior to the offense. In Simring\u2019s view, at the time of the stabbing and for many years prior, defendant was suffering from chronic paranoid scMzophrema. He opined that at the time of the offense, defendant\u2019s illness was in a state of \u201cflare-up,\u201d and that he was \u201cacutely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ill,\u201d \u201cpsychotic\u201d and suffering from a profound thinking disorder. Defendant had been hospitalized for his schizophrenia in 1984, 1987, 1988 (for eighteen months), and 1991. Most recently, in 1992, defendant was twice admitted to hospitals as a result of delusions and agitation. In December 1992, about six weeks prior to the homicide, defendant was admitted to Jersey Shore Medical Center because of anxiety and delusional thinking. He complained of vision problems that he attributed to \u201cJudge Milberg and Steven King, the author, [who] were putting substances into his eyes.\u201d Defendant was released from the hospital on January 11, 1993, four days prior to the stabbing. Upon his release, defendant first learned of the victim\u2019s pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">On January 15,1993, hours before the stabbing, defendant went to the emergency room at Riverview Medical Center complaining of insomnia. Simring surmised that hospital personnel \u201capparently wanted to admit him,\u201d but that defendant refused. Simring opined that defendant\u2019s insomnia and attempt to obtain relief by visiting the hospital were signs that his schizophrenia was \u201cbreaking through again.\u201d There was considerable other evidence upon which Simring also relied, including bizarre, delusional letters defendant wrote in 1986 and 1991, which need not be detailed. Simring concluded that defendant did not know it was wrong to kill the victim, because defendant \u201cthought he was acting in a bizarre form of self defense.\u201d Defendant \u201cgenuinely did believe based on his internal psychotic thinking, that he was doing the right thing and the legal thing\u201d when he stabbed and killed the victim. Simring acknowledged on cross-examination that notwithstanding defendant\u2019s statement to the police upon apprehension that the victim \u201cwas his sister\u201d and he would not \u201churt her,\u201d defendant knew that he had stabbed the victim and understood the nature and quality of his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The State\u2019s expert, Michals, agreed that at the time of the stabbing, defendant suffered from a mental illness. However, in his view, defendant knew he was killing the victim and that causing her death was wrong. In formulating his opinion, Michals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>analyzed the police reports and witness statements, documentation of defendant\u2019s psychiatric history, hospital records, and information culled from his own examination of defendant on June 20, 1994. Again, we do not set out the great detail provided by Michals in support of his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The other defense expert, Verd\u00f3n, interviewed defendant on June 23, 1999, and again on September 1, 1999, and found him competent to stand trial. Although defendant continued to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia at that time, he was receiving medication and was \u201crelatively organized and intact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">During both interviews, defendant discussed his delusional beliefs concerning Judge Milberg and Steven King. However, defendant reported that he no longer felt that the judge was possessing his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Verd\u00f3n testified that between the June and September interviews, defendant\u2019s thinking became more disorganized. He attributed this to the relatively low dosage of antipsychotic medication defendant was taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">In forming his opinion that defendant did not know his actions were wrong, Verd\u00f3n found particularly significant defendant\u2019s hospital visit the night before the stabbing, as well as his transfer to the Vroom Building shortly after his arrest. Verd\u00f3n noted that in the commitment papers authorizing defendant\u2019s transfer to Vroom, Dr. Phillips, a psychiatrist at Monmouth Medical Center, described defendant as \u201can acutely psychotic man who had impaired judgment at the time and who was thought to be actively deluded having a fixed false belief.\u201d Also, in Verdon\u2019s opinion, the fact that defendant committed the stabbing in front of many witnesses, reflected the marked impairment of his judgment. Further, defendant\u2019s statement immediately after the stabbing to the effect that he loved his sister and would not hurt her, was indicative of his psychotic condition and demonstrated his ambivalence, a cardinal symptom of schizophrenia. According to Verd\u00f3n, defendant\u2019s subsequent expression of relief upon learning of the victim\u2019s death, signified his \u201cpsychotic resolution\u201d and also demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>strated that defendant did not know that it was wrong to stab the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">As noted, the jury rejected the insanity defense and found defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">On this appeal, defendant raises the following issues for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">DEFENDANT\u2019S ORAL STATEMENTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT VOLUNTARY AND BECAUSE THE POLICE DID NOT SCRUPULOUSLY HONOR HIS RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">A. <em>Miranda </em>Hearing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">B.

At the first trial, defense counsel questioned Simring regarding the basis of his expert opinion that defendant\u2019s act of stabbing his sister was the direct product of his mental illness. In relating various aspects of defendant\u2019s background that he had considered in formulating his opinion, Simring stated that defendant was unable to join the Marines because of \u201chis criminal history.\u201d It was revealed that when defendant was twenty, he assaulted the brother of a former girlfriend when she refused to see him. Simring subsequently stated that he was unable to form an opinion as to whether or not defendant was suffering from sehizo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>phrenia at the time of that assault, or whether such an illness had any role in his commission of that crime, noting that defendant had not yet been diagnosed. However, he would not rule out the possibility that defendant was suffering from schizophrenia at that time and he stated that the assault was part of a \u201csuggestion of an impending psychiatric problem\u201d and that \u201cthere might have been some ... preliminary signs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">On his prior appeal, defendant argued that the testimony regarding his criminal record, including the factual basis underlying the assault conviction, was improperly admitted into evidence. <em>State v. O\u2019Brien, </em>No. A-7308-95T4 (App.Div. Feb. 18, 1999), slip op. at 2-3. We did not address this issue other than to observe that in the course of his direct examination of the expert witness, defense counsel elicited evidence of defendant\u2019s 1980 conviction of aggravated assault, arising from the incident described above, as well as other evidence of prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 7. There was also testimony that defendant was hospitalized for treatment of a psychiatric condition in 1984, while still incarcerated for this crime. <em>Ibid,. </em>We stated that we were \u201csure the doctor\u2019s testimony could have been guided to avoid reference to such plainly prejudicial evidence,\u201d and noted, that \u201cat the least, it should have been accompanied by a carefully tailored limiting instruction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, we stated that \u201c[bjecause there must ... be a new trial ... a more effective assistance of counsel might preclude some of the more damaging evidence\u201d introduced by the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Consequently, at the retrial it was agreed that all references to defendant\u2019s prior convictions by the experts would be precluded. Cognizant of this restriction on his testimony, Simring did not mention defendant\u2019s 1980 assault conviction when testifying on direct examination regarding the basis of his opinion. Instead, in relating the significant aspects of defendant\u2019s history, Simring stated that defendant came from an \u201cachieving family,\u201d yet, unlike his three siblings, he dropped out of high school and \u201ctried to join the U.S. Marine Corps but he couldn\u2019t do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Defendant now takes issue with the following excerpts from the prosecutor\u2019s ensuing cross-examination of Simring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">Q. You also made mention, Dr. Simring, when you were discussing I believe the defendant\u2019s history, you made mention of the fact that he tried to enlist in the Marine Corps, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">Q. And that he couldn\u2019t, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">Q.

[PROSECUTOR]: One of the issues before this jury is credibility of this witness. They have to determine, whether or not, despite the fact that he\u2019s an expert, whether or not he is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The court ruled that the prosecutor could continue with this line of questioning, with the restriction that there would be no mention of defendant\u2019s prior conviction. The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">Q. Doctor, in terms of the Marine Corps in your previous answer, you gave one reason and one reason only for his rejection, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">A. Pm not sure. Pm sure I gave a reason in my previous answer in direct testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">The prosecutor then showed Siniring his testimony from the first trial and asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">Q. And in that portion of your sworn testimony have, as you\u2019ve described it, you indicate the defendant tried to join the Marine Corps, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-13\">A.

Your attorney will certainly supplement the question with other records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">[SIMRING]: I might need an instruction from the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Defense counsel renewed his objection to this line of questioning on the ground of relevance, but was again overruled. The prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">Q. Doctor, when you were listing the history at that previous time, sworn testimony, you mentioned defendant tried to join the Marines but was not allowed to and you list a specific reason, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">A.

In that sentence out of context that specific reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-17\">PROSECUTOR: Your Honor, can I ask the Court to direct the witness to answer the question and answers only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-18\">THE COURT: The answer was it does not use those words. If there\u2019s reason to explain that, I\u2019m sure [defense counsel] during redirect will ask the appropriate question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-19\">At this point, the prosecutor moved on to a new line of questioning. However, during the next break in Simring\u2019s cross-examination, Simring asked the judge to provide him with an instruction regarding the proper parameters of his responses to the prosecutor\u2019s repeated questions concerning defendant\u2019s rejection from the Marines. In addition, Simring complained that although he had \u201cbeen asked by defense counsel to redact large portions of my report based on the Appellate Division decision,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s questioning was \u201cmaking it look as if [he was] not credible or hiding things____\u201d Simring explained that he resisted answering the prosecutor\u2019s questions because it was his \u201csuspicion that the 1980 assault was because of an undiagnosed mental illness.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Defense counsel renewed his objection and noted that the entire line of questioning was irrelevant to the issue of defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the incident herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In an oral ruling encompassing four pages of the transcript, the judge explained his rationale for overruling the defense objections and not issuing any curative instruction. Essentially, he found that Simring\u2019s direct testimony \u201cleft the inference that [defendant] was rejected because of a mental disease ... to corroborate Dr. Simring\u2019s opinion,\u201d and that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination was appropriate to negate this inference. The judge did not agree with Simring\u2019s claim that his credibility had been adversely and unfairly affected. Eather, based upon his own observations of the proceedings, the judge found that the challenged cross-examination, which only \u201ctook a matter of seconds\u201d following two hours of Simring\u2019s testimony, did not \u201chave any material consequence to the jury\u2019s overall ability to make reasonable judgments as to credibility.\u201d Like the prosecutor, the judge had initially assumed that since Simring testified at the first trial that the Marines rejected defendant because of his criminal record, Simring would respond in the affirmative when asked if defendant was rejected for reasons unrelated to any psychiatric illness. He further explained that \u201c[w]hat no one could anticipate was that [Simring] related the prior aggravated assault in 1980 to a mental condition. So his ... answer perhaps was that the rejection was for criminal history, yes, but that prior criminal history was ... related to defendant\u2019s mental disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Defendant also refers to the following summation remarks by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">Simring does what Simring wants to do, and he doesn\u2019t care about anything else, and I submit to you that came out in terms of his demeanor and the way he did things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">He wouldn\u2019t concede even the most obvious questions. They weren\u2019t trick questions. They weren\u2019t surprise questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">If I asked him: His suit was black that day, he would have said: You don\u2019t understand, you have to take into consideration the concept of the defendant\u2019s prior medical history and whether or not he prefers black. He wouldn\u2019t answer anything straight up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>He does what he wants to do. He\u2019s not a reliable witness. He wouldn\u2019t answer questions straightforward. He doesn\u2019t do things in a professional manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Defendant contends that this line of cross-examination, as well as the related summation remarks, were improper because they were designed to make his expert appear deceitful and the defense of insanity a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>611(b), \u201c[c]ross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.\u201d We acknowledge that \u201c[cjonsiderable latitude is customarily allowed in the cross-examination of a witness,\u201d and the trial court is vested with particularly \u201cbroad discretion to determine the proper limits of cross-examination\u201d where the credibility of a witness is at issue. <em>State v. Steele, </em>92 <em>N.J.Super. </em>498, 503, 224 A.2d 132 (App.Div. 1966). \u201cAdditionally, as a general rule, any fact which bears against the credibility of a witness is relevant to the issue being tried, and the party against whom the witness is called has a right to have that fact\u201d presented to the jury to aid them in determining credibility. <em>State v. Pontery, </em>19 <em>N.J. 457, 472, 117 </em>A.2d 473 (1955). Despite these general principles, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Simring in the manner quoted above went well beyond the bounds of proper questioning, and, with the court\u2019s approval, degenerated into badgering of such a degree as to unfairly undermine the credibility of defendant\u2019s main expert witness, indeed his main witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The record is quite clear that in his testimony at the first trial Simring did suggest that there might be a tie between defendant\u2019s assault conviction, that directly led to his Marine Corps rejection, and his subsequently diagnosed mental illness. While it is true that on direct examination in the first trial, in the course of reciting defendant\u2019s history, Simring stated that defendant \u201ctried to join the Marines, was not allowed to because of his criminal history,\u201d on redirect examination, he testified that at the time of the 1980 assault, \u201cthere\u2019s suggestion of an impending psychiatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>problem, but he had not been hospitalized and there\u2019s no evidence that he had yet at that point been diagnosed.\u201d Nevertheless, the doctor went on to state that he could not rule out the possibility that defendant was suffering from an underlying psychiatric condition at the time of the assault. \u201c[I]n retrospect ... [o]ne can pick up signs and symptoms which suggest that there may have been something more wrong than just a boyfriend/girlfriend fight. But it\u2019s hard to go back and do this at that point.\u201d Finally, he noted that while there might have been \u201csome proemial or preliminary signs [at the time of the 1980 assault],\u201d there was no documentation that defendant \u201chad delusional bizarre ideas, overtly bizarre ideas about any of the individuals involved in that crime.\u201d On reeross, in response to further questioning about the 1980 crime, Simring stated that \u201cin retrospect, to scope, looking backward as you look at this crime, there were elements that you could say even then suggested that there might be something wrong with this young man. Even lay witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Thus, the trial judge\u2019s statement, in justification of his ruling that the cross-examination was proper, that \u201cno one could anticipate ... that [Simring] related the prior aggravated assault in 1980 to a mental condition,\u201d was in error. Indeed, in seeking the judge\u2019s intervention Simring himself told the judge that he had so testified in the first trial. From the prosecutor\u2019s questioning, it is clear that he had reviewed the testimony at the first trial at which he had also been the prosecutor. As a result, his suggestion that Simring had not testified to a possible relationship between the criminal conviction and mental illness represented at best a misrecollection, at worst an intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The witness\u2019 reluctance, indeed inability, to answer the prosecutor\u2019s question in simple yes or no terms was, in our view, justified. However, rather than intervene to protect the witness from an unfair inference that he was unwilling to answer the questions, when in fact he was attempting to abide by a court ruling, the judge placed his imprimatur on the unfair line of cross-examination and allowed it to continue unchecked. Simring\u2019s reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the Marine Corps was brief and, if allowed to pass, likely inconsequential. The prosecutor, however, with the judge\u2019s sanction, was permitted to make the proverbial mountain out of a molehill. The defense objected and even requested a curative instruction, to no avail. This was error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We cannot determine how much the Marine Corps incident may have affected the jury\u2019s evaluation of Simring\u2019s credibility and, consequently, of his opinions. For all that appears, when the prosecutor told the jury that Simring would not \u201cconcede even the most obvious questions,\u201d would not \u201canswer anything straight up,\u201d would not \u201canswer questions straightforward,\u201d the jury may well have had this line of questioning in mind. Of course, in his charge, the judge delivered the standard instruction that in judging a witness\u2019 credibility \u201cyou may ask yourselves whether he or she seems to be straightforward and forthright or whether he or she did not. Did the witness strike you as being fair and candid.\u201d That charge, in the context of the prosecutor\u2019s cross examination and summation, leaves us unable to conclude that the jury was not affected by the prosecutor\u2019s improper conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Improper conduct by the prosecutor that unfairly tarnishes a defense expert cannot be countenanced. <em>State v. Smith, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>167 N.J. 158, 182-85, 770 A.2d 255 (2001). When, as here, a defendant\u2019s guilt depends \u201centirely on which experts the jury believed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 187, 770 A.2d 255, we conclude, as did the Court in <em>Smith, </em>\u201cthat the inappropriate [conduct] by the prosecutor could have improperly swayed the jury and denied defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also State v. Farthing, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58, 79, 751 A.2d 123 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>530, 760 A.2d 784 (2000). Unlike our dissenting colleague, we reject the State\u2019s suggestion that any error was harmless. It is no answer to suggest that the evidence was adequate to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Indeed, even if the evidence were overwhelming, which it was not, at least on the insanity issue, that \u201ccould never be a justifiable basis for depriving a defendant of his or her entitlement to a constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair trial. The impact of violating a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial cannot be measured by or weighed against, the quantum of evidence bearing upon his or her guilt.\u201d <em>State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 87, 727 A.2d 1 (1999). In this case, there was timely objection to the line of inquiry, the questioning was not withdrawn, nor did the court instruct the jury to disregard the objectionable material. <em>Id. </em>at 83, 727 A.2d 1. <em>See also State v. Pillar, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 278-79, 820 A.2d 1 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>572, 832 A.2d 322 (2003)(the proper inquiry is whether the objectionable material could have influenced the jury). Rather, the misconduct we have identified had the clear capacity to substantially prejudice defendant\u2019s right to have the jury fairly evaluate the merits of his insanity defense. The fact that the incident was brief, when viewed in light of the entire trial, is of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Sji <em># % </em># \u2756</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Defendant claims that the court erred in refusing to ask potential jurors on voir dire whether they could accept that, if defendant were acquitted by reason of insanity, procedures were in place to provide for defendant and to protect the public\u2019s safety. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>In defendant\u2019s view, this ruling was error because it \u201cunfairly interfered with [his] ability to make informed challenges\u201d given our Court\u2019s \u201cacknowledged concern over society\u2019s ability to consider insanity a viable defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Prior to jury selection, defense counsel urged the court to ask potential jurors on voir dire whether they could accept that, if defendant was found NGRI, procedures were in place to provide for defendant in order to protect the public\u2019s safety. The trial judge declined to ask this question, reasoning that it was inappropriate to interject a post-judgment dispositional issue, which was outside the jurors\u2019 adjudicative function, into the preliminary voir dire examination. He also found that the question was unnecessary to expose bias, and noted that the public safety issue would be adequately addressed in the final charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In its final charge, the court instructed the jury that \u201cprocedures exist to adequately provide for the defendant and to protect the public in the event defendant is found not guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">It is well established that \u201can impartial jury is a necessary component of a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Papasavvas, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>565, 584, 751 A.2d 40, <em>mod on other grounds, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>553, 753 A.2d 1148 (2000). \u201cThe purpose of voir dire is to ensure an impartial jury\u201d by detecting jurors who cannot fairly decide a matter because of partiality or bias. <em>State v. Martini, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 210, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993); <em>State v. Manley, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>259, 281-83, 255 A.2d 193. A probing voir dire aids the trial court in disclosing \u201ccause\u201d for dismissal of prospective jurors, and assists the parties in exercising peremptory challenges. <em>State v. Horcey, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>415, 421, 629 A.2d 1367 (App.Div.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\u201cVoir dire procedures and standards are traditionally within the broad discretionary powers vested in the trial court and \u2018its exercise of discretion will ordinarily not be disturbed on appeal.\u2019\u201d <em>Papasavvas, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 595, 751 A.2d 40 (citations omitted). \u201c[T]here is no particular litany required for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the jury voir dire,\u201d and the court is not obligated \u201cto ask any particular question or indulge the defendant\u2019s requests absolutely.\u201d <em>State v.

Appellate review is generally limited to determining whether \u201cthe overall scope and quality of the voir dire was sufficiently thorough and probing to assure the selection of an impartial jury.\u201d <em>State v. Biegenwald, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>13, 29, 524 A.2d 130 (1987); <em>State v.

Moore, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>420, 429, 585 A.2d 864 (1991), where the defendant was found guilty of capital murder for the \u201chammering killing\u201d of his pregnant wife and their eighteen-month-old child. There, the trial court declined to inquire regarding the jurors\u2019 willingness and ability to consider an insanity defense, among other things. <em>Id. </em>at 453-56, 585 A.2d 864. Although the defendant\u2019s conviction was reversed on other grounds, the Court offered guidance on the conduct of voir dire where an insanity defense is raised. <em>Ibid. </em>In this regard, the Court observed that \u201cit is well established that many laypersons have a great deal of difficulty in understanding the insanity defense, and many people might not be able to consider it as a viable defense, particularly to such a heinous act as the lolling of a wife and child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453-54, 585 A.2d 864. Accordingly, an appropriate voir dire should endeavor to \u201cscreen out prospective jurors who could not consider an insanity defense due to their prejudices or biases against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 585 A.2d 864. Inquiry may be made to determine \u201cwhether a juror can judge the testimony of psychiatric witnesses by the same standard that he or she would apply to the testimony of any other witness.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">For further guidance, the Court referenced our opinion in <em>Murray, supra, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 392, 573 A.2d 488. <em>Moore, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>at 454, 585 A.2d 864. The Court in <em>Moore </em>noted that the trial court in <em>Murray </em>\u201crejected several voir dire questions proposed by the defendant and instead asked its own questions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>which probed whether the prospective jurors had read or studied about psychology, psychiatry, medicine, or related fields, and inquired about the jurors\u2019 views on those sciences and whether those views would hinder their ability to follow the law as instructed by the court.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>According to the Court, in asking only these questions, \u201cthe trial court in <em>Murray </em>acted properly within its discretion and sufficiently determined any juror bias or prejudice.\u201d Ibid.; <em>see also State v. Jasuilewicz, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>558, 569, 501 A.2d 583 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>467, 511 A.2d 649, (1986)(\u201csearching\u201d judicial inquiry on juror attitudes toward insanity defense required in circumstances of the ease).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Similar to the questions approved of in <em>Murray, </em>the trial judge here asked the jurors (1) whether they had \u201cany education in psychology or psychiatry beyond the standard High School or college courses,\u201d and (2) whether they could \u201caccept the concept that psychiatry is a credible medical science\u201d or, not accept it \u201cas a result of any life experience or otherwise.\u201d The court went beyond the questioning deemed sufficient in <em>Murray, </em>by further inquiring whether any juror, family member or acquaintance had \u201c[a]ny good or bad experience with a psychologist or psychiatrist ... that would possibly influence [his or her] ability to fairly weigh and judge such expert opinions?\u201d The court also inquired whether there was any juror that could not \u201cfollow the law when it provides that insanity is a potential defense to a criminal act[.]\u201d Additionally, the court advised the jurors that they would have to \u201capply the law of the case despite personal feelings\u201d they \u201cmight have\u201d about it; the court questioned whether anyone had a \u201cphilosophical problem with that concept\u201d; and the court posed the open ended question whether the jurors \u201charbor[ed] any private reason at all, as a result of any life experience or otherwise\u201d that could cause partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">We conclude that the foregoing voir dire questions adequately addressed the concern in <em>Moore </em>that jurors be asked questions to ascertain their ability to fairly and impartially consider insanity as a defense. <em>Moore, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>at 454, 585 A.2d 864.

The court properly limited the voir dire to questions designed to discern whether the jurors held \u201cbiases that would interfere with their ability\u201d to follow the law and fairly decide the issues that would be posed for their determination. <em>Martini, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 210, 619 A.2d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s proposed question, regarding whether jurors could \u201caccept the proposition that procedures are in place to protect the public,\u201d was not instrumental to expose potential bias. Thus, the trial court soundly exercised its discretion in refusing to pose defense counsel\u2019s proposed \u201cpublic safety\u201d question. <em>See, e.g., Murray, supra, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 393, 573 A.2d 488 (\u201c[w]hether or not to inquire of prospective jurors about attitudes concerning substantive defenses or other rules of law which may become implicated in a trial or in the charge is within the discretion of the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">In sum, consistent with <em>Moore </em>and <em>Murray, </em>the jury voir dire was sufficiently probing and thorough to secure an unbiased jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">$ $ * * $</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\"> <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 <em>L.</em>Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\"> We respectfully disagree with our dissenting colleague\u2019s suggestion that that prosecutor \"was walking a fine line\" in his questioning of Simring. In our view, he crossed over the line separating vigorous but proper cross-examination from an improper over-zealous attack. Nor is it fair to suggest that Simring could have answered the prosecutor\u2019s questions with a simple \"yes or no,\u201d and \"that if further clarification was required, counsel could address the issue on redirect examination.\" We do not perceive how defense counsel could have clarified the issue on redirect, presumably by eliciting Simring\u2019s redirect from the first trial, without getting into the 1980 conviction, a topic that properly had been barred. However, without bringing up the conviction, all the \"Marine Corps incident\u201d answers from that first trial would be left floating without a context within which the jury could understand and evaluate them. We disagree with the view that Simring was doing \"what experts are adroit at doing.\u201d Rather, in the context of complex psychiatric testimony, we find the witness\u2019 answers and conduct to have been consistent with his prior testimony while avoiding mention of the prior conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b445-10\">CARCHMAN, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"ApB\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">I respectfully disagree with the conclusion reached by my colleagues as to the impact of the cross-examination of Dr. Simring and the judge\u2019s failure to sustain defense counsel\u2019s objections to the cross-examination. Accordingly, I dissent, in part. As to the other issues raised, I join with the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">The majority concludes that the confrontation of Dr. Simring with his prior testimony regarding defendant\u2019s inability to join the Marines was so unfair as to deny defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. While I agree that the prosecutor was walking a fine line when confronting the witness as to his prior testimony and his reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>for concluding that defendant was rejected by the Marines, the inquiry was proper to demonstrate that the witness had earlier opined that the reason for such rejection was not mental illness but some other unidentified reason. The \u201cother\u201d reason was defendant\u2019s prior record, an area of inquiry that we had proscribed in our prior decision reversing the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination consisted of narrow, directed and pinpoint questions that could have been answered \u2018Tes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d The inquiry was whether \u201cmental illness\u201d was identified as a basis for the rejection. The prosecutor never mentioned or alluded to defendant\u2019s prior record. The judge correctly observed that if further clarification was required, counsel could address the issue on redirect examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">This was in my view a classic example of use of prior testimony for impeachment purposes, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>613, and the prosecutor carefully phrased the inquiry to avoid mention of defendant\u2019s prior record. That the witness suggested to the judge during colloquy that his \u201c140 pages of testimony were tied into other answers and that reason that I gave was itself, in my opinion, related to mental illness at that time,\u201d was an answer to a question that was not asked. The witness was asked specifically whether he cited mental illness as a basis for the rejection. He did what experts are adroit at doing and that was not responding to the question but deflecting to the \u201c140 pages\u201d of his prior testimony. The question was proper and not prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">I note further that this issue and the exchange came in the context of an extended trial where defendant\u2019s sanity was in issue. I cannot agree that this brief and fleeting exchange, even with the later commentary by the prosecutor during summation challenging Dr. Simring\u2019s credibility, was such as to deprive defendant of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">I need only cite the same authority as do my learned colleagues regarding the significance of cross-examination, <em>State v. Pontery, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>457, 472, 117 A.2d 473 (1955) (discussing the limits of cross-examination as encompassing any fact which bears on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>credibility of a witness); <em>State v. Steele, </em>92 <em>N.J.Super. </em>498, 503, 224 A.2d 132 (App.Div.1966) (vesting the trial judge with broad discretion to determine the proper limits of cross-examination). I conclude that the cross-examination was narrowly conceived, was fair and appropriate and did not amount to misconduct on the part of the prosecutor or error by the judge. Even if there was such misconduct or error, I cannot agree that any perceived misconduct or error precluded defendant from receiving a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">As to this issue, I dissent; in all other respects, I concur with the thoughtful and thorough opinion of the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
