The trial judge thereafter granted the State\u2019s motion to sentence defendant to an extended term as a persistent offender, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a, and defendant was sentenced to fifty years in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections, with a twenty-five year period of parole ineligibility, on the attempted murder. A ten-year consecutive sentence was imposed on count nine. The conviction on second-degree aggravated assault on count two was merged into the conviction for attempted murder on count one, and concurrent sentences were imposed on the remaining counts. The aggregate sentence of sixty years imprisonment, with a twenty-five year parole ineligibility term, was made consecutive to a sentence defendant was then serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">On this appeal, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">POINT I DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION FOR FIRST DEGREE ATTEMPTED MURDER MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO INSTRUCT THE JURY WITH REGARD TO ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY ON THAT COUNT, AND THUS PRECLUDED THE JURY FROM CONSIDERING THAT DEFENDANT COULD BE FOUND GUILTY OF SECOND DEGREE OR THIRD DEGREE AGGRAVATED ASSAULT AS LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES OF ATTEMPTED MURDER, EVEN IF HIS CO-DEFENDANTS WERE GUILTY OF ATTEMPTED MURDER.

(Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">As of November 11, 1999, fifty-seven year old Bruce Moshen had been employed by the Bergen County Sheriffs Department as a corrections officer for seventeen years. He \u201csupervise[d] and controlled] the movement and the behavior of the inmates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">On November 11, 1999, Moshen was on duty at the Bergen County Jail and was assigned as \u201cRover 3,\u201d the recreation officer responsible for \u201csupervising] the inmates in their recreation.\u201d Moshen was supervising Pod B, which was a 900 square foot yard, surrounded by a fifteen to twenty foot high fence topped with razor wire. In the yard there was \u201capparatus for the inmates to exercise on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Moshen did not carry any firearm, but carried a two-way radio, and had the keys to open and access the various cells. He was the sole officer \u201cconducting the yard\u201d that night. Moshen did a \u201cwalk around to make sure there was no contraband\u201d and that everything was \u201csound and secure.\u201d Then he \u201centered the living area and told the officer on the floor [that] everything [was] all ready\u201d and then announced to the inmates that the \u201cyard is now open, all come on out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">One inmate came out, walked over to the apparatus, and started doing chin-ups. Shortly thereafter another inmate, Andrew Johnson, a 6T\", 160 pounds, twenty-two year old male, came out and started to play basketball, whereupon the other inmate went inside. A third inmate, co-defendant Andre Cutler, a twenty-three year old, 6' male weighing approximately 175 pounds, came out and went to the chin-up bar. Johnson and Cutler then went back into the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">The two men subsequently came back outside as did defendant, a twenty-seven year old 6'2\" tall male who weighed 240 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Moshen heard the door to the yard close as defendant came \u201cbehind\u201d him. Defendant grabbed Moshen and placed his arm \u201caround [Moshen\u2019s] neck.\u201d Moshen stamped on defendant\u2019s toe and \u201ctried to turn around and get a shot off at him\u201d but he \u201cgot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>struck\u201d by Cutler and Johnson. While Moshen was being held by defendant, Cutler hit Moshen \u201cvery hard\u201d on his head and Johnson kicked his left leg \u201cout from under\u201d him. Defendant then \u201cgot a more secure grip around [Moshen\u2019s] neck, and at that point they all started to batter\u201d Moshen. Defendant kept pulling Moshen\u2019s chin with \u201ca very strong grip\u201d so that the other two could keep \u201cbattering\u201d him. Moshen could not breathe and felt weak and decided to \u201cplay dead,\u201d and defendant \u201cthrew [him] down as if [he] were dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Moshen could then see the three men \u201cgo to the fence,\u201d but he could not stand on his left leg. Nevertheless, he \u201cmanaged to work\u201d himself to the fence and tried to pull one of them off the fence before he got hit in the head and could not lift his body from the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Moshen decided \u201cto get into the building and let people know there was an escape because [he] was no good.\u201d He did not have his radio and his dentures fell out of his mouth. Moshen \u201ccrawl[ed] into the building\u201d and sought help from the other officers. On his way \u201cthere was a room full of inmates that [were] obscuring his passage\u201d and \u201cblocking\u201d him. \u201cSome were kicking [him]\u201d and some were \u201cstepping on [his] hand and various parts of [his] body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Officer Dennis Michael Cooney observed that Moshen \u201cwas bleeding profusely through the head area\u201d and was in \u201can incoherent state\u201d as he was held up by another officer. Officer Cooney deduced that the escapees would try to get to East Broadway and notified Officer Sehielzo, who ran with Cooney toward the East Broadway area. However, while they were running, they saw co-defendant Cutler run across a parking lot and \u201cstarted scanning the yard area\u201d to find the other escaped inmates. Officer Cooney saw a \u201csilhouette\u201d of a person against a trailer, and upon the threat of the use of a police dog, defendant surrendered. Defendant was handcuffed to the fence while Cutler was captured in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Officer Moshen was taken to the Hackensack University Medical Center where his lips, mouth and eye were stitched and sewed by Dr. David J. Bikoff, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon. The doctor testified that when Moshen arrived at the hospital, his bones were shattered and he had a \u201cseverely comminuted and deviated nasal fracture,\u201d otherwise stated as a \u201cseverely fractured nose and nasal septum\u201d which required surgery. The doctor further testified that Moshen had cheekbone and alveola fractures which did not require surgery, and that he had multiple soft tissue injuries such as a laceration of the eyelid, an evulsion flap of the lower lip and his upper lip was cut in half. Moshen was discharged from the hospital on November 13, 1999, around 3 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">At the time of trial, Moshen continued to have symptoms such as \u201c[djizziness, loss of balance, double vision, blurred vision, and chronic headaches,\u201d in addition to the facial injuries. He also suffers from frequently \u201cinterrupted sleep with nightmares,\u201d and his ears keep \u201cringing\u201d \u201clike a cacophony of sound.\u201d At the time of trial, he was still unable to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Defendant contends that the trial judge should have charged accomplice liability on the attempted murder charge as he did on the second-degree aggravated assault. Defendant further contends that in light of the evidence presented, the jury could have found him guilty of a lesser-included offense to attempted murder, but was precluded from doing so in light of the judge\u2019s instructions. Defendant asserts that the jury could have found that he \u201cintended only to participate in an aggravated assault on Moshen to temporarily incapacitate him [while] the beating meted out by his codefendants evidenced their intent to kill Moshen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">In sentencing defendant, the trial judge stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">He planned this escape. It was wholly directed, and he first attacked the officer with the other two joining in. He was the one who had Officer Moshen around the throat while the other two may have punched and kicked him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>... [Defendant was the mastermind, he planned this whole routine to be outside, to create the disturbance so he could get behind Officer Moshen, to start to strangle him with the others joining in. He stayed there after the others ran-to get over the fence, because their main purpose was to get out, because it was clear to this Court that with the marshal [sic] arts training that this defendant has, that he intended to kill Officer Moshen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">That may well be so, but because defendant planned the escape, and even the assault incident to it, does not necessarily mean he intended to Mil Moshen or had the requisite purpose to be convicted of an attempted murder. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1a (purposeful conduct required for attempt), 2C:2-2b(1) and 2C:11-3. In fact, the indictment for attempted murder expressly included a reference to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6, wMch embodies the provisions on accomplice liability. Moreover, the judge charged the jury on accomplice liability with respect to the second-degree aggravated assault, so the judge found a jury question was presented concerning defendant\u2019s culpability or scope of responsibility with respect to the attack on Moshen.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Before the summations commenced, the prosecutor explained why she was requesting an accomplice charge with respect to the second-degree aggravated assault only. She explained that the State \u201cwould not want the accomplice charge on the attempted murder [because] the attempted murder was by this defendant\u2019s own conduct.\u201d She added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">However, I believe, Judge, that the accomplice charge is necessary for counts two and three for the following reason: If the jury declines to accept the State\u2019s theory, then they \u2014 they just \u2014 they need to be charged on accomplice, because the facts that have been elicited at this trial is that this defendant\u2019s role throughout the beating was static. He was the one who had the victim from behind and was tugging on his neck, I mean, we heard testimony there was clearly kicking and punching going on, but it\u2019s obvious that kicking and punching [were] not administered by this defendant, that\u2019s why we need the accomplice charge here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">After being questioned by the judge, the prosecutor \u201cconcedfed] the Court has a point in not charging accomplice [liability] on count three\u201d because of the nature of the bodily injury required. When the judge indicated he was not charging on accomplice liability with respect to the attempted murder, defense counsel said \u201c[b]ut his same actions would apply to the aggravated as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>sault.\u201d However, counsel ultimately stated that \u201cI will leave it up to the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Parties who participate in a criminal act may be guilty of different degrees of offense, depending on their own actions and culpability. <em>State v. Bielkiewicz, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>520, 531-38, 632 A.2d 277 (App.Div.1993). In <em>Bielkiewicz </em>we held that a jury must be instructed in connection with an accomplice charge that the defendant could be found guilty of a lesser offense than the principal based on what the accomplice actually did and intended. Judge Skillman traced the case law on accomplice liability, noted that the jury must be instructed concerning the differences in culpability required for the grades of crime <em>(Bielkiewicz, supra, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 527-30, 632 A.2d 277), and held that the jury must be told that \u201c[ejach defendant may thus be guilty of a higher or lower degree of crime than the other, the degree of guilt depending entirely upon his own actions, intent and state of mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528, 632 A.2d 277 (quoting <em>State v. Fair, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>77, 95, 211 A.2d 359 (1965)). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s doctrine, this Court further noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">[I]f several participate in an attack and death results, the degree of the offense as to each may turn upon his own acts and purpose. Thus if two should attack and one of them intends only a simple assault and battery and is unaware of the intent of the other to use deadly force, he would be culpable only according to his own intent and wrong. But if he participates in an attack or continues in it with an awareness of the purpose of others to kill or to do grievous bodily harm, he is chargeable with that further intent and result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\"><em>[Bielkiewicz, supra, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 528, 632 A.2d 277, citing <em>State v. Madden, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>377, 391, 294 A.2d 609 (1972).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">In <em>Bielkiewicz, </em>we reversed defendant\u2019s murder conviction because the judge \u201cdid not inform the jury that a defendant could be found guilty as an accomplice\u201d of lesser included offenses, and \u201cdid not even mention accomplice liability in instructing the jury with respect to [them].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 632 A.2d 277. Similarly, in <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Cook, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 488, 693 A.2d 483 (App.Div.1996), we reversed a murder conviction on grounds of \u201cplain error\u201d because, as Judge (now Justice) Long noted, although defendant was tried alone, the trial judge did \u201cnot adequately explain to the jury how it might go about finding an accomplice guilty of a different offense or degree of offense than the principal.\u201d <em>See also State v. Jackmon, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 284-298, 702 A.2d 489, <em>certif. denied, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>49, 707 A.2d 152 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We recognize that there was a premeditated plan in this case, unlike <em>Bielkiewicz </em>and <em>Cook, </em>and that defendant was tried alone so that the jury could not assess or weigh the comparative culpability. We also recognize that, unlike those cases, the jury in this case was not instructed in accomplice liability with respect to the critical count, and the State argues that \u201cthe facts in evidence did not support either a <em>Bielkiewicz </em>instruction or an accomplice liability instruction.\u201d The State also seems to contend that there was no basis to charge lesser culpability or a lesser-included offense. The State\u2019s arguments are premised on the nature of Moshen\u2019s serious bodily injury and the assertion that \u201cdefendant\u2019s culpability ... was greater than either of his co-defendants,\u201d as only the defendant choked Moshen and the others did not intend to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">We agree with the State that, in order to charge a lesser-included offense, there must be a rational basis for a jury to reject the greater charge and a clear basis in the evidence for a conviction on the lesser. <em>State v. Savage, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>374, 397, 799 A.2d 477 (2002); <em>State v. Brent, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>107,113-15, 644 A.2d 583 (1994); <em>State v. Choice, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>295, 298, 486 A.2d 833 (1985). But the State\u2019s argument presumes the correctness of its own theory of the facts. A jury could have found defendant\u2019s intent was to escape, and to assault to the point of incapacity to prevent it, but not to kill, even if the co-defendants had that intent. Moreover, the defendant was charged in the indictment with two counts of aggravated assault, which would have served as lesser-included offenses. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>State v. Sloane, </em>111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>N.J. </em>293, 299, 544 A.2d 826 (1988), \u201c[a] jury reluctant to acquit defendant might compromise on a verdict of guilt on the greater offense,\u201d if it is the only crime charged. <em>See also Bielkiewicz, supra, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 534, 632 A.2d 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Finally, while it is true that defendant did not object to the charge or to the judge\u2019s statements that he was not charging accomplice liability on count one (and as to count three when it was subsequently addressed), it is also true that defense counsel suggested that counts one and two should be treated alike. We understand that only defendant put his arms around Moshen and choked him, but we cannot speculate that the jury had to find that the choking was the basis for the attempted murder conviction. In any event, Johnson and Cutler \u2014 like defendant \u2014 were indicted as principals and accomplices on counts one, two and three, but the State asked for an accomplice charge on count two only. The fact defendant was tried alone is not dispositive in these circumstances, <em>Cook, supra, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 479, 488, 693 A.2d 483, and the judge concluded that there was a sufficient basis for charging accomplice liability with respect to the same victim as alleged in count two.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Under these circumstances, we reverse the attempted murder conviction and remand for a retrial on that count. As the issue is not before us, we do not address whether the extended term can be imposed on the second-degree aggravated assault if the State does not seek to retry defendant for attempted murder but desires to unmerge count two. We also do not address the impact of that conviction or the conviction on count three with respect to the lesser-included offenses relevant to the retrial of the attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>murder count. <em>Cf. State v. Grunow, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>133, 149, 506 A.2d 708 (1986); <em>State v. Pridgen, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239, 250, 584 A.2d 869 (App.Div.1991). In any event, there is no basis for reversing the other convictions as there was no \u201cplain error\u201d on the ground that the judge did not charge lesser-included offenses to third-degree aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In light of our disposition, we need not address the sentencing issues raised. Irrespective of a retrial, the judge should stay resentencing until after the Supreme Court decides the cases of <em>State v. Natale, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>226, 861 A.2d 148 (App.Div. 2004) and <em>State v. Abdullah, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 858 A.2d 19 (App.Div.2004), which were recently argued in the Supreme Court. We add only that jury fact-finding is not required before a defendant can be sentenced to an extended term under the persistent offender statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44r-3a. <em>State v. McMillan, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>27, 28, 860 A.2d 484 (App.Div.2004). The same is true with respect to imposition of a consecutive term. <em>Natale, supra, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 238, 861 A.2d 148; <em>Abdullah, supra, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 281, 858 A.2d 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-15\"> Counts nine and ten are not contained in the record, but there is no dispute as to the charges which were presented to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-10\"> The day before defendant's attorney indicated he had no objection when the judge stated he would not charge accomplice liability on the attempted murder count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\"> We also note in connection with count one that this case involved offenses occurring before the June 2001 amendment to the No Early Release Act and the jury was not unanimous as to whether defendant caused \u201cserious bodily injury,\" and found he did not, whereas it found he caused \u201cserious bodily injury\" with respect to count two. In his summation, defense counsel acknowledged that defendant assaulted Officer Moshen, but argued the State \u201chas not proven beyond a reasonable doubt ... attempted murder and [that defendant] along with the others, caused serious bodily injury/' as opposed to \u201cbodily injury.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
