Hat Manufacturers use casein fiber as a substitute for a portion of animal fur in the mixture subjected to the felting process to make material for fur felt hat bodies and hats.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Defendant asserted directly to some of plaintiff\u2019s hat manufacturing customers and prospective customers that defendant\u2019s patents encompass the use of casein fiber in such manufacture. Defendant circularized the hat\u2019 trade among which were many present and prospective purchasers of plaintiff\u2019s fibers informing the hat trade of the claims of defendant\u2019s patents and that unauthorized use of such fibers would constitute infringement of said patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">One of plaintiff\u2019s largest customers, John B. Stetson Co., was charged with infringement. After commencing a declaratory judgment to question, defendant\u2019s patent, Stetson discontinued its suit. Later Stetson, and one other customer, obtained a license from defendant to use the process covered by its patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">Plaintiff charges defendant proposed by its patents to control the use of casein fiber in hat manufacture and that defendant submitted to the hat trade a form of a proposed agreement of license to operate under defendant\u2019s patent rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">Plaintiff claims that because of defendant\u2019s course of conduct of intimidation many hat manufacturers fear infringement suits, others refuse to pay royalties, others are uncertain as to their rights and obligations, and as a result there has been a substantial reduction and, in many instances, a discontinuance or refusal to purchase plaintiff\u2019s fibers, causing plaintiff serious financial loss. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment of invalidity and an injunction restraining defendant from \u201cbringing or prosecuting or threatening to prosecute any suit charging infringement * * * against plaintiff or any purchaser or user of casein fiber in the manufacture of fur felt hats.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">The complaint averred that defendant\u2019s patents are invalid and that \u201cno valid claim thereof is infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of hats made by its customers or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>by the use by its customers of any method used in connection therewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The complaint contains no specific averment as to any infringement or lack thereof by plaintiff and no prayer for judgment that it is not a contributory infringer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Whether a person is aggrieved or not by the act of another depends upon the nature of the act complained of and the manner in which it will affect the complainant. Substantive law must recognize plaintiff\u2019s privilege before procedure affords him an opportunity of vindicating his claim in the courts. The person raising the question of invalidity must have a legal interest to justify the grant of judicial relief. More particularly the court must in each case determine whether plaintiff has demonstrated the necessary \u201clegal interest\u201d in the declaration. Are the legal rights shown by the facts asserted such as to require judicial determination ?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In form the Declaratory Judgment Act differs in no essential respect from any other action. The conditions of the usual action, procedural and substantive, must always be present, namely, the competence or jurisdiction of the court over the parties and subject matter, the existence of the operative facts justifying the judicial declaration of legal consequences, the assertion against an interested party of rights capable of judicial protection, and a sufficient legal interest in the moving party to entitle him to invoke a judgment in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Legal rights may only be adjudicated under the Act precisely as only legal rights may be adjudicated in any other form of civil action. Samuel Goldwyn Inc., v. United Artists Corp., 3 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 703, at page 707. The controversy must be one that is appropriate for judicial determination. Alfred Hofmann v. Knitting Machines Corp., 3 Cir., 1941, 123 F.2d 458, at page 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">\u201cThe requirements of case or controversy are of course no less strict under the Declaratory Judgment Act * * * than in case of other suits.\u201d Altvater v. Freeman, 319 U.S. 359, at page 363, 63 S. Ct. 1115, 1118, 87 L.Ed. 1450.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">The question is whether plaintiff\u2019s allegations are sufficient to entitle it to the declaratory relief prayed in its complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This raises the question whether there is an \u201cactual controversy\u201d within the meaning of the Declaratory Judgment Act, since the District Court is without power to grant declaratory relief unless such controversy exists. Nashville C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, 288 U.S. 249, 259, 53 S.Ct. 345, 77 L.Ed. 730, 87 A.L.R. 1191; U.S.C.A.Constitution, Art. III, Section 2; Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, at page 272, 61 S.Ct. 510, 85 L.Ed. 826; Coffman v. Breeze Corporations, Inc., 323 U.S. 316, 324, 65 S.Ct. 298, 89 L.Ed. 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">The existence of a justiciable controversy is to be determined by the decisions of the Federal Courts. Dewey &amp; Almy Chemical Co. v. American Anode, Inc., 3 Cir., 1943, 137 F.2d 68; Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. v. Ziegler, 3 Cir., 1945, 151 F.2d 784, at page 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>This court has emphasized that the Act should have a liberal interpretation bearing in mind its remedial character and the legislative purpose. Alfred Hofmann v. Knitting Machines Corp., supra; Treemond Co. v. Schering Corp., 3 Cir., 1941, 122 F.2d 702; Dewey &amp; Almy Chemical Co. v. American Anode, Inc., supra, certiorari denied 320 U.S. 761, 64 S.Ct. 70, 88 L.Ed. 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u201cThe difference between an abstract question and a 'controversy\u2019 contemplated by the Declaratory Judgment Act is necessarily one of degree, and it would be difficult, if it would be possible, to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy. Basically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment. * * * \u201d Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., supra, 312 U.S. 273, 61 S.Ct. 512, 85 L.Ed. 826. See Creamery Package Mfg. Co. v. Cherry-Burrell Corp., 3 Cir., 1940, 115 F.2d 980, 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u201cThe operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only.\u201d Hughes, C. J. in \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240, 241, 57 S.Ct. 461, 463, 81 L.Ed. 617, 108 A.L.R. 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">\u201cIt is an axiom that the Declaratory Judgment Act has not enlarged the jurisdiction of the courts over subject-matter and parties.\u201d Borchard Declaratory Judgments, 2d Ed. p. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">The Act created no new rights but introduced an additional remedy of inestimable value for the determination of an already existing right. Cover v. Schwartz, 2 Cir., 1942, 133 F.2d 541, at page 544. It modified the law only as to procedure and though the right to such relief has been in some cases inherent the statute extended greatly the situations under which such relief may be claimed. A new opportunity for relief is thus afforded, i. e., new legal interests are recognized and protected. No new substantive rights were however created. The controversy is the same as previously.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">There being no diversity of citizenship, it is apparent that if jurisdiction is to be found in this case it must be by reason of the provisions of the Judicial Code, Section 24(7), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41(7), which confers jurisdiction upon the Federal Courts \u201cof all suits at law or in equity arising under the patent * * * laws.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">To constitute a case or controversy under the patent laws the plaintiff must set up some \u201cright, title, or interest under the patent laws, or, at least, make it appear that some right or privilege will be defeated by one construction, or sustained by the opposite construction of these laws.\u201d Pratt v. Paris Gas Light &amp; Coke Co., 1897, 168 U.S. 255, at page 259, 18 S.Ct. 62, 64, 42 L.Ed. 458; Odell v. F. C. Farnsworth Co., 1919, 250 U.S. 501, 39 S.Ct. 516, 63 L.Ed. 1111; Dickinson Tire &amp; Machine Co. v. Dickinson et al., 2 Cir., 1928, 29 F.2d 493.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-17\">Prior to the passage of the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act the patentee was the only one in a position to initiate a suit against the alleged infringer or his dealers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An alleged infringer could not sue the patentee for a declaration that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>plaintiff was not infringing or that the patent was invalid. Today the alleged in-fringer, once he is threatened by a paten-tee, has a remedy by a complaint for a declaratory judgment. Now the controversy between the parties as to whether infringement exists is in either instance essentially one arising under the Patent Laws.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The patentee \u201cnow, by making threats and charges, exposes himself to an action at the hands, of the alleged infringer for a declaratory judgment that the defendant\u2019s patent is invalid or, if valid, that the plaintiff is not infringing. By making charges, the patentee submits to an adjudication at the option of the alleged infringer.\u201d Bor-chard Id. p. 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In Treemond Co. v. Schering Corp., supra, 122 F.2d at page 705, we said, \u201cThere can be no doubt that an \u2018actual controversy\u2019 does not exist until the patentee makes some claim that his patent is being infringed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u201cActual manufacture, use or sale ought not to be essential. * * * It ought to suffice that the party charged is about to infringe or take some action which is prejudicial to the interests of the patentee, and that he is then charged and put on notice that his action is attacked as infringement, present or prospective.\u201d Borchard Id. p. 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u201c* * * the allegation and proof by a vendor that it is engaged in a course of conduct, the sale of machinery, which has brought and must bring purchasers from it into conflict with the owner of the patent, is sufficient to support a suit for a declaratory judgment by the vendor.\u201d Alfred Hofmann, Inc., v. Knitting Machines Corp. et al., supra, 123 F.2d at page 4-61. See Crowell v. Baker Oil Tools, 9 Cir., 1944, 143 F.2d 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">In Dewey &amp; Almy Chemical Co. v. American Anode, Inc., supra, 137 F.2d at page 70, referring to Treemond Co. v. Schering Corp., supra, we stated, \u201c * * * this statement should be qualified so as to admit the possibility of declaratory judgment where the patentee has claimed that the manufacture of a certain product or the practising of a certain process would constitute an infringement and a person who is about to engage in such alleged infringing conduct seeks a declaration of his right to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">What is the nature of the claim that must be made by the patentee ? In this connection see Treemond Co. v. Schering Corp., supra, and Girdler Corp. v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., D.C.Del.1944, 56 F.Supp. 871, where the various possible kinds of claims and assertions are discussed and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">As to the process covered by defendant\u2019s patents, in the present Case there was a charge of infringement made as to Stetson, notice of the claims of the patents to other purchasers and prospective purchasers of defendant\u2019s fibers; and notice to the hat trade of the scope claimed for defendant\u2019s patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">The claim need not be formally asserted; it is not necessary that notice be given directly to the plaintiff or that. any threat be made to sue the plaintiff. Dewey &amp; Almy Chemical Co. v. American Anode, Inc., supra; E. W. Bliss Co. v. Cold Metal Process Co., 6 Cir., 102 F.2d 105; Treemond Co. v. Schering Corp., supra, 122 F.2d at page 705; Borchard Id. 807; Crowell v. Baker Oil Tools, supra. Notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s customers is sufficient. Treemond Co. v. Schering Corp., supra; Duro Test Corp. v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co., D.C.Del., 21 F.Supp. 260; B. F. Goodrich Co. v. American Lakes Paper Co., D.C.Del., 23 F.Supp. 682; Tinius Olsen Testing Machine Co. v. Baldwin-Southwork Corp., D. C. Pa., 25 F.Supp. 885 (for other reasons refused to exercise jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Notice in trade journal is sufficient. Treemond Co. v. Schering Corp., supra, 122 F.2d at page 705; E. W. Bliss Co. v. Cold Metal Process Co., supra; E. Edel-man &amp; Co. v. Triple-A Specialty Co., <em>7 </em>Cir., 1937, 88 F.2d 852; Girdler Corp. v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">When the patent owner makes his position clear with respect to a manufacturer\u2019s customer, and the manufacturer finds his business affected by such assertions, the manufacturer may then bring an action for declaratory judgment relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">\u201cThe fact that a patentee\u2019s claim of infringement is a condition precedent of this type of action places the matter of adjudication of the patent within control of the patentee, for, if he wishes to avoid adjudication, he can refrain from making charges of infringement. But having made the charge, he then exposes himself to adjudication * * *. <em>It </em>requires an assertion of right under the patent to place the alleged infringer in gear to join issue and challenge the title.\u201d Borchard Id. p. 807; see Id. p. 43; see National Hairdressers\u2019 &amp; Cosmetologists\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Philad Co., 3 F. R.D. 199; Thermo-Plastics Corp. v. International Pulverizing Corp., D.C., 42 F. Supp. 408; Engler v. General Electric Co., D. C., 29 F.Supp. 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">In this case however there has never been a charge of infringement made by defendant against plaintiff or any of plaintiff\u2019s customers or prospective customers by notice, threat or suit as to the sale or purchase of casein fiber or against casein fiber as such, but a claim that the purchasers of plaintiff\u2019s fibers were, by using the process encompassed by defendant\u2019s patents, performing an act of infringement. Plaintiff was never charged with doing anything by way of direct or contributory infringement. In the cases referred to throughout this opinion the notice to the trade and to the customers was as to the very article which the plaintiff manufactured or sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">The charges of infringement under defendant\u2019s patents have been against a product and a process with which plaintiff has had no connection. The invention covered by the patents is not per se for casein fiber but covers the process of combining such fibers with fur fibers to form hats or hat materials. In fact casein fiber and the preparation thereof are expressly disclaimed from any inclusion in the claims of the patents (see Patent No. 2,322,254, page 2, 2d column, lines 24-27; Patent No. 2,322,255, page 2, 2d column, lines 72-75, page 3, 1st column, lines 1 to 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">Plaintiff has the right to have that which it lawfully produces freely bought and sold without restraint or interference. It is a right which attaches to its product, to a particular thing \u2014 as an article of commerce \u2014 and it continues only so long as the commodity to which the right applies retains its separate identity. If in the course of trade that commodity is combined with other things in the process of the manufacture of a new commodity, the trade right in the original part as an article of commerce is necessarily gone. So that if other persons become manufacturers on their own behalf, assembling the various elements and uniting them so as to produce hats or hat bodies, a new article, it is manifest plaintiff cannot by reason of its mere right to make and sell, and the fact of its having made and sold casein fibers to the manufacturers of the new article, satisfy the legal requirement that it has sufficient legal interest in any claim arising under the patent laws, enabling it by declaratory judgment to challenge the validity of the defendant\u2019s patent, where no charge of infringement has been made against the product sold by plaintiff but against a process with which plaintiff has had no connection. Cf. Rubber Tire Wheel Co. v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 1914, 232 U.S. 413, 34 S.Ct. 403, 58 L.Ed. 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">Plaintiff could demand protection of its right to sell the casein fiber it produced. It has no right to demand that others be allowed to practice the patented process in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>violation of the patent monoply in order that it might have a market for its fibers.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Angier et al. v. Anaconda Wire &amp; Cable Co., D.C.Del., 48 F.2d 612, 613, an infringement action as to patent for \u201cImprovement in Packages\u201d, one element of which was crepe paper. The manufacturer which supplied the patentee with crepe paper sought to intervene as party defendant. Intervention was denied on the ground that petitioner had no interest in the patent litigation to justify permitting it to become a party. Interest as used in this rule means a legal interest. \u201cThe petitioner has, if any, only a commercial interest in this litigation, and even that interest is dependent upon the continuance of business relations between the petitioner and the defendant which so far as this record shows, may be terminated at any time. * * * Moxie Nerve Food Co. of New England v. Modox Co., C.C., 179 F. 415.\u201d Id., 48 F.2d at page 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Defendant argues, \u201cFurthermore, equity would decline to entertain a suit for infringement by Hat Corporation against plaintiff should it attempt to assert domination over the sale of casein fibers and thereby extend its monopoly to unpatented products.\u201d Citing Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., 1942, 314 U.S. 488, 491, 62 S.Ct. 402, 86 L.Ed. 363; B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, 1942, 314 U.S. 495, 498, 62 S. Ct. 406, 86 L.Ed. 367, and Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Inv. Co., 1944, 320 U.S. 661, 64 S.Ct. 268, 88 L.Ed. 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">Plaintiff asserts that by the foregoing defendant contends, by reason of those cases, defendant would be unable to maintain an action against plaintiff for contributory infringement because of plaintiff\u2019s sale of casein fibers to infringers; that defendant contends those cases have abolished contributory infringement from the law of patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">In reply plaintiff argues defendant does not make or sell casein fibers (defendant being in fact a customer of plaintiff) and hence is not a competitor of plaintiff; and that these cases do not hold as contended; that there is nothing in those cases which hold that \u201cstraight\u201d contributory infringement free from any question of misuse of a patent is no longer in the law of patents. We do not herein express any opinion as to how much of the doctrine of contributory infringement remains. This is an interesting question upon which we reserve opinion until that question is squarely before us.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">We assume arguendo that casein fibers are a standard article of commerce capable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>of various uses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiff sold to hat manufacturers and to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Our view is that it is not necessary to decide what if any effect those cases have on the law of contributory infringement for the reason that long prior to those decisions it was and still is the law that the sale of an article of commerce of ordinary use without relation to any apparatus does not make the manufacturer guilty of contributory infringement if the buyer later makes use of the article in an infringing apparatus. Walker on Patents, Dellers Ed., Section 508, p. 1768; Duplex Envelope Co. Inc., v. Denominational Envelope Co., 4 Cir., 1935, 80 F.2d 179, at page 182. \"* * * soya bean meal and soya bean flour are standard articles of commerce; and being such a sale thereof may not be enjoined.\u201d Charles H.

We do not mean to be understood as indicating our opinion that any such claim however exists under the facts before us. There being no suit arising out of \u201e the patent laws, and no diversity of citizenship and no federal question involved, such a suit must be brought in the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">\u201cA suit for damages to business caused by a threat to sue under the patent law is not itself a suit under the patent law. And the same is true when the damage is caused by a statement of fact, \u2014 that the defendant has a patent which is infringed. What makes the defendants\u2019 act a wrong is its manifest tendency to injure the plaintiff\u2019s business; and the wrong is the same whatever the means by which it is accomplished. But whether it is a wrong or not depends upon the law of the State where the act is done, not upon the patent law, and therefore the suit arises under the law of the state. * * * The fact that the justification may involve the validity and infringement of a patent is no more material to the question under what law the suit is brought than it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>in an action of contract.\u201d Holmes J. in American Well Works Co. v. Layne &amp; Bowler Co., 241 U.S. 257, 36 S.Ct. 585, 586, <em>60 </em>L.Ed. 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Even though a patent is collaterally involved, this does not mean that such an action arises under the patent laws. See Wade v. Lawder, 165 U.S. 624, 17 S.Ct. 425, 41 L.Ed. 851; Dale Tile Mfg. Co. v. Hyatt, 125 U.S. 46, 8 S.Ct. 756, 31 L.Ed. 683; MacGregor v. Westinghouse Electric &amp; Mfg. Co., D.C., 45 F.Supp. 236, affirmed 3 Cir., 130 F.2d 870 c. 5; see also Measurements Corp. v. Ferris Instrument Corp., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">See E. Edelman &amp; Co. v. Triple-A Specialty Co., 7 Cir., 88 F.2d 852, 853, 854. A prayer for damages because of circulation of charges of infringement among dealers and potential customers stamps the suit as one to enforce a common-law remedy, viz., recovery of damages for unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Plaintiff cites several cases, none of which we feel support his claim. In Water Hammer Arrester Corp. v. Tower, Jr., D.C.E.D.Wis., <em>66 </em>F.Supp. 732, and Mitchell &amp; Weber, Inc., v. Williamsbridge Mills, Inc., D.C., 14 F.Supp. 954, defendant had charged plaintiff before suit with infringement. Defendant\u2019s statement after action brought that plaintiff did not infringe could not deprive plaintiff of declaratory judgment relief. Here there was no charge of infringement as to plaintiff\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In A. L. Smith Iron Co. v. Dickson, 2 Cir., 1944, 141 F.2d 3, there was a direct threat against plaintiff, whose customers used the bands in the only way they were useful. There was no attempt on appeal to support the position that the patent prevented the sale of the bands alone. The question here presented was not discussed, and apparently there was diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">In Dewey &amp; Almy Chemical Co. v. American Anode Inc., supra, 137 F.2d at page 71, we said, \u201cIn patent cases it has been held that an \u2018actual controversy\u2019 may exist even though, for one reason or another, the patentee is disabled from maintaining any action against the particular alleged infringer seeking the declaration.\u201d Citing Alfred Hofmann, Inc., v. Emitting Machines Corp., supra, 123 F.2d at page 460, 461; Western Electric Co. v. Hammond, 1 Cir., 1943, 135 F.2d 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The Hofmann case held that the allegation and proof by a vendor that it is engaged in a course of conduct, the sale of machinery, which has brought, and must bring purchasers from it into conflict with the owner of the patent is sufficient to support a suit for a declaratory judgment by the vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">True the vendor could not be sued for infringement because he had not sold any machines after the date of issuance of the patent; true also he had not been charged by the patentee with infringement, but one to whom he had sold a machine prior to issuance of the patent had been sued for infringement by reason of use of the machine after the patent issued, and other customers of plaintiff were notified that acquisition and use of plaintiff\u2019s machinery would constitute infringement. The defendant contended that the very machine plaintiff was selling would when sold or used infringe defendant\u2019s patents. Plaintiff could have been sued for infringement by a sale of a machine after the date the patent issued. Defendant charged plaintiff\u2019s product infringed and plaintiff was intending to import and sell more machines when war conditions warranted. The court applied established law that the manufacturer could bring a suit for a declaratory judgment where charges of infringement were made as to its product against its customers. Particularly that situation was covered by the qualification of the rule of Treemond Co. v. Schering Corp., supra, made in Dewey &amp; Almy Chemical Co. v. American Anode, Inc., cited supra. Finally the charge of infringement was against the use of the machine in the same condition as when it left the control of plaintiff. This is quite unlike the charge made against the process in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">In Dewey &amp; Almy Chemical Co. v. American Anode, Inc., supra, plaintiff averred defendant charged infringement, sought to negotiate a license and threatened plaintiff with suit. In another suit defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>asserted a scope for its patent broad enough to encompass the use of the process by plaintiff. The court held in view of the other suit no direct threat against plaintiff was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In Western Electric Co. v. Hammond, supra, apart from the remedy afforded by the Declaratory Judgment Act, neither party had a cause of action against the other. Under a sub-license plaintiff manufactured and sold articles to the Government, notwithstanding patentee\u2019s claim that the license did not include such right. By law the patentee could not sue plaintiff for infringement but Could only and did sue the Government in the Court of Claims. Plaintiff could not sue the patentee in tort because defendant acted under a claim of right. The patentee charged plaintiff\u2019s product and its articles infringed. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment. Since neither party could otherwise sue the other, the patentee claimed there could be no case or controversy to support a declaratory judgment. It was held that the act created a new remedy, and that plaintiff had a legal interest because a judgment under the act would affect not only its possible liability to the Government on its contracts of indemnity but also its right to enter into similar transactions with the Government in the future, which according to the complaint plaintiff sought to do. That case involved the interpretation of a contract and apparently there was diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In Girdler Corp. v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., D.C.Del.1944, 56 F.Supp. 871, defendant wrote plaintiff that it was offering for sale equipment that would infringe defendant\u2019s patent and that failure of plaintiff to obtain a license would be considered notice of infringement. The device in Girdler involved a question of contributory infringement. Here there is no such question.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u201cA patent is a species of property. It gives the patentee * * * the \u2018exclusive right to make, use, and vend the invention or discovery' for a limited period. R.S. \u00a7 4884, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 40, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 40. That is to say, it carries for the statutory period \u2018a right to be free from competition in the practice of the invention\u2019.\u201d Transparent-Wrap Machine Corp. v. Stokes &amp; Smith Co., 329 U.S. 637, at page 643, 67 S.Ct. 610, 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">What steps the patentee has taken in this case are a matter between the patentee and the alleged users of the process covered by the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The situation as to plaintiff is no different than if plaintiff sold milk, from which casein is made, to its customers and they in turn made their own casein fibers which they might thereafter use in a way to infringe defendant\u2019s patents, or in a way which would not. As the learned trial judge observed, \u201cTo hold otherwise would be to say that a person (who admittedly is not an infringer) who furnishes any commercial resin to a manufacturer for use in a process to make a plastic, for example, which infringes the patent of another, may bring a declaratory judgment action, even where there is no diversity, to test the validity of the patent.\u201d [64 F.Supp. 696, 698.]</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">We realize the importance to the public generally that an invalid patent should not have the protection of the law. The power of the court under the Declaratory Judgment Act is limited to the declaration of rights and legal relations of interested parties. In this, case we find that there is no federal question involved; that the plaintiff has no rights under the patent laws; that no case or controversy is presented over which the District Court has jurisdiction. The judgment of the District Court will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> Aralac, Inc., v.
