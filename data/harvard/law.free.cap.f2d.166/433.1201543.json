He asserted that he had applied for his former position with the respondent but had been denied reinstatement to that or an equivalent position. We may accept the petitioner\u2019s assertion that on or about January 7, 1946 he applied to the respondent for reinstatement in his former job of tool maker. The district court, however, found that this particular job was not available either then or thereafter during the period in' question and that the respondent offered the petitioner another job of like seniority, status and pay which he was not willing to accept. These findings are supported by the evidence and they in turn support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>court\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner is not entitled to the award of compensation he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
