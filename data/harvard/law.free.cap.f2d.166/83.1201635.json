The respondent has appealed and urges that the court erred in its conclusion because (1) the petitioner\u2019s prior employment was not permanent, (2) the respondent\u2019s business had so increased as to make it unreasonable to restore the petitioner to his position, (3) the petitioner was an independent contractor rather than an employee, (4) his claim was moot, and (5) the amount awarded to him was unreasonably high.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-22\">We have carefully examined each of these contentions but find them to be wholly without merit. The findings of fact of the district court are supported by the evidence and the findings, in turn, support the court\u2019s conclusions and final order. The order appealed from will accordingly be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
