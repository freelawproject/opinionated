Two questions are presented for decision. The first is whether the Commissioner was precluded from determining the deficiency in suit by reason of the taxpayer having paid a previously determined deficiency for the same year, after signing a waiver of restrictions on the assessment and collection of that deficiency. After an audit of his 1941 return the taxpayer was notified of an additional tax of $6,900.70. In July 1944 he signed Form 870 of the Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, which is a \u201cWaiver of Restrictions on Assessment and Collection of Deficiency in Tax\u201d; and thereafter he paid said additional tax with interest thereon. Such a waiver is provided for by section 272(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code \u00a7 272 (d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After payment of this deficiency the taxpayer was notified of an additional deficiency resulting from disallowance of a capital loss claimed in his return. This item had not been disallowed in the determination of the first deficiency. In contesting the additional deficiency, the taxpayer contended before the Tax Court, and reasserts here, that' the Commissioner\u2019s acceptance of the waiver and of payment of the first deficiency estops him from assessing and collecting the second. The argument, as we understand it, is that where the United States has received the consideration due it under an agreement it cannot refuse to perform its own obligations thereunder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the cases relied upon are in-apposite because the waiver imposed no obligation on the United States. On the contrary it expressly gave the taxpayer notice that it was not a final closing agreement and did not preclude the assertion of a further deficiency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By his waiver the tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>payer surrendered his right to appeal that particular deficiency to the Tax Court, but not his right to claim a refund of the tax,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in return he obtained relief from the running of interest on the deficiency, as stated in Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 282(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 292(a). The Tax Court rightly held that the claim of estoppel is groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">The second question is whether the capital loss claimed in the taxpayer\u2019s return was properly disallowed. During 1941 Refined Syrups Sales Corporation, of which the taxpayer was a shareholder, sold its assets to Refined Syrups &amp; Sugars, Inc., in exchange for a substantial block of the latter\u2019s preferred and common stock, and the stock so received by the Sales Corporation was distributed in liquidation to its shareholders. The value of the Sugars Stock distributed to the taxpayer was .$151,-120 less than the cost of his Sales stock, and he claimed two-thirds of the loss as a deductible capital loss. The Commissioner disallowed it on the ground that the transaction between the two corporations was a tax-free reorganization as defined in section 112(g) (1) (D), I.R.C., 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 112(g) (1) (D), and the dissolution and liquidation of the Sales corporation was a part of the plan of reorganization. The Tax Court held that the acquisition of the assets of the Sales corporation constituted a tax-free reorganization as defined in subdivision (C), instead of (D), and its opinion stated that this was not disputed by the parties. The taxpayer contends that it was disputed and that because of the Tax Court\u2019s contrary assumption it failed to make a finding that substantially all the assets of the Sales corporation were transferred to Sugars, Inc., and therefore the case must be remanded. We see no necessity for a remand. All the facts were before the Tax Court and its opinion sets out all the evidentiary facts needed for its d . vision that a reorganization took place urjfer section 112(g) (1) (C). The fact that the Sales corporation used some of its a.\u00a1Mts to settle pending litigation and to disclXge certain liabilities before transferring*he remainder to Sugars, Inc., does not affect the applicability of the section. See Western Industries Co. v. Helvering, 65 App.Div. 205, 82 F.2d 461, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">Finding no error in the Tax Court\u2019s decision, we affirm it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">\u201c(d) Waiver of restrictions.
