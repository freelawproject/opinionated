HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b576-27\">The defendants Toscano and Casablanca were indicted on three counts under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7 2553, quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Casablanca pleaded guilty and Toscano not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Count One alleged that on or about July 31, 1946, Casablanca and Toscano did fraudulently and knowingly import and bring into the United States, and did assist in so importing and bringing into the United States, a quantity of narcotics, to wit, approximately 2 ounces and 400 grains of heroin, contrary to 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Count Two alleged that on or about the foregoing date, in the vicinity of LaGuar-dia Airport, Casablanca and Toscano did knowingly possess, conceal and facilitate the transportation and concealment of the heroin after the same had been imported into the United States knowing that it had been illegally imported, contrary to 21 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Count Three alleged that on or about such date, in the vicinity of LaGuardia Airport, Casablanca and Toscano did unlawfully have in their possession a quantity of narcotics, to wit, 2400 tablets of morphine sulphate in original stamped packages, without having registered and paid the required taxes, contrary to 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 2553. It was conceded on the trial that Toscano did not have a registration for the handling of narcotics and did not pay any taxes with respect thereto, as required by 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3221 and 3220. The concession was made with the understanding that it did not involve any admission as to the possession of any narcotics by Toscano.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Toscano was found guilty by a jury on all three counts and has appealed from the sentence which was imposed by the trial judge after the rendition of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">Ryan, a Treasury Agent in the Narcotic Bureau, testified in substance to the following : At about 9:30 P. M. on July 30, 1946, he went by automobile to the vicinity of the building where Toscano occupied an apartment and parked his car on the opposite side of the street at a point where he was able to observe the entrance. Some time shortly before midnight he saw a car drive up to the vicinity of these premises and saw Toscano, Casablanca, Mrs. Tos-cano and her daughter, get out of the car. Toscano was carrying his daughter on his shoulder as though she were asleep. Casablanca had nothing in his hands. The four persons then entered the building and Ryan saw the lights go on and the three adults moving about in the living-room of the apartment of the Toscanos in the front section of the second floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">At about 1:30 A. M. Ryan saw Toscano conversing with his wife for about five minutes and later saw him come out of the building with Casablanca and enter Tos-cano\u2019s car. Just before Casablanca entered the automobile Ryan saw him carrying a brown wrapped package, tied with a white string, approximately 12 inches <em>long, </em>10 inches wide and 3 inches deep. He testified that Toscano was not carrying anything but was driving the car, with Casablanca sitting next to him. The agent followed Toscano\u2019s car until it reached LaGuardia Airport where it was parked to the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>and across the driveway from the Administration Building. Ryan parked his car closer to that building and saw the defendants get out of their car and pass within 6 or 8 feet of him. Casablanca was still carrying the package described above. As they went into the Administration Building Ryan followed them and saw Casablanca enter waiting-room 7 and 8; as he followed Casablanca he saw Toscano also entering this waiting-room and talking to Casablanca. As Toscano and Casablanca seemed to Ryan to be about to leave the room, Ryan identified himself as a federal officer and asked Casablanca, who was still holding the brown package, what he had in it. He replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know what is in the package. I just found it over on the chair there.\u201d The agent then turned to Toscano and said: \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He replied: \u201cI just stopped in for a cup of coffee. I don\u2019t know what this is all about.\u201d Ryan then asked Casablanca to open the package. The latter made a few ineffectual tugs at the string and then said: \u201cI can\u2019t open this package. If you want to see what is in it, you will have to open it up.\u201d Ryan opened one end and drew forth an envelope containing heroin. He then arrested both defendants for violation of the narcotic laws and lodged them in detention headquarters. At this time he asked Toscano if he had any further narcotics in his home and Toscano replied that he had not and that Ryan could search there any time that he wished. Thereafter Ryan went to the Toscano apartment and,</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">with the permission of Mrs. Toscano, searched it but found no narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">While there was testimony by Toscano and his wife tending to contradict the inference that Toscano had possession of the narcotics, there was sufficient proof that he had the package in his apartment prior to the arrival of Casablanca and before going to the airport to show a violation of the narcotic statutes and justify the verdict. The weight of the evidence and the conflicting inferences which might be drawn from the testimony were questions for the jury. There must, however, he a reversal of the judgment because of statements made by government\u2019s counsel in the course of his address to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">The defendant contends that government\u2019s counsel in summing up argued that the brown package which contained the narcotics might show defendant\u2019s fingerprints. It is admitted that the government introduced no evidence to show any fingerprints. While the record does not contain the summation of counsel, it does contain the following discussion by them with the court in connection with motions by the defendant for a mistrial and to strike from the record the alleged statement about fingerprints. This discussion is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In spite of the absence from the record of the summation of government\u2019s counsel, the latter, in referring to the contention that he had said that there were \u201cfingerprints of the defendant on this paper and that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>prepared to prove by experts there were fingerprints on it,\u201d admitted that he had said \u201cthey felt there might have been.\u201d \u201cThey\u201d evidently meant the government\u2019s experts. This statement, even if provoked by references by defendant\u2019s counsel to facts outside of the record, was not legally justified and was in fact a seriously injurious reference to incriminating matter not in the record which might have affected the jury on the basic question of possession. This statement should have been stricken out with specific instructions to the jury that it could not be considered. The motion to strike was denied and the specific matter was not dealt with in the charge. We do not think it was eliminated by the statement of the judge, in connection with his denial of the motion to strike, that the jury was to decide the case only on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Doubtless the judge supposed that he had sufficiently dealt with the objection by his general instruction that the jury was to decide the case only on the evidence, and we may assume that the reference to the fingerprints was provoked by irritating irrelevancies on the part of defendant\u2019s counsel. But, a reference which might have such serious result to the defendant should have been more thoroughly and conclusively eliminated from the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">It is unnecessary to discuss any further objections taken by the appellant in the course of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-28\"> 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174 \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b576-29\">\u201cSame; penalty; evidence.
