Two packages were prepared by postal inspectors as decoys. Cancelled postage stamps and the names and addresses of living persons as senders and addressees were placed on both of these packages. Before appellant reported for work on December 21, 1946, the packages were deposited at two places in the post office where mail was handled and where appellant would pass in the course of his janitorial duties. A postal inspector kept watch from a gallery and observed appellant pick up one of the prepared packages, throw it onto his pile of sweepings, cover it with waste paper and sweep it away. Shortly thereafter postal authorities examined the trash hamper in which appellant had been gathering his sweepings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>found it to contain both of the decoy packages. One package was intact and the other had been unwrapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Count one of the indictment charged that appellant \u201cdid secrete and embezzle a package which came into his possession as said custodial laborer,, and which was intended to be conveyed by mail, addressed to Mrs. E. Johnson, 1706 South Hoover, Los Angeles, California.\u201d Count two charged that appellant \u201cdid unlawfully detain, delay, and open a package which came into his possession as said custodial laborer, and which was intended to be conveyed by mail, addressed to Mrs. A. S. Cluff, 2026 South Burnside, Los Angeles, California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Axa\">Appellant pleaded not guilty, waived trial by jury and was found guilty by the court on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that the evidence failed to show that the packages were \u201cintended to be conveyed by mail,\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The evidence established that the packages were prepared by postal inspectors and addressed to living persons at actual addresses. The evidence tended to show that the packages contained Christmas gifts for acquaintances of one of the inspectors. It was testified by an inspector that although the object in preparing and setting out the packages was to apprehend whoever was stealing the mail, there was also a purpose for the packages, if they were not stolen, to reach the addressees; the packages would have been delivered if not unlawfully diverted. This evidence, which was not controverted, appears to us to satisfy the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The cases are too numerous to warrant citation which have held that, criminal prosecutions, under this statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may be based on the abstraction of decoy letters mailed by post office inspectors. It has specifically been held that a decoy letter is intended to be conveyed by mail, within the meaning of the statute, though the addressee is fictitious and though the postal authorities intend to intercept the letter. Montgomery v. United States, 162 U.S. 410, 16 S.Ct. 797, 40 L.Ed. 1020; Scott v. United States, 172 U.S. 343, 19 S.Ct. 209, 43 L.Ed. 471; McShann v. United States 8 Cir., 231 F. 923. This court has addressed the subject heretofore: \u201cThe intent to have the letter conveyed by mail is none the less effective because the addressee and the purported point of origin are fictitious.\u201d Jarrett v. United States, 9 Cir., 92 F.2d 698, 699. A fortiori in the case at bar, where the addressees were bona fide and there was no evidence of plan to withdraw the packages from the mail, the intent to have the packages conveyed by mail was clearly present.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">The sole authority cited by appellant as support for his contention in this regard is United States v. Matthews, C.C.Md., 35 F. 890, 1 L.R.A. 104. That case appears to take a view of the law contrary to that expressed in subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court, above cited. Furthermore, the holding of the Matthews case was that the question of whether the letter was intended to be conveyed by mail should have been submitted to the jury for determination \u2014 this problem is not present in the instant case since appellant was tried without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">Appellant attempts to spell out a lack of intent that the packages be conveyed by mail from the fact that cancelled stamps were placed on them by the postal inspectors. This fact does not compel that inference. See: Goode v. United States, 159 U.S. 663, 16 S.Ct. 136, 40 L.Ed. 297; Jarrett v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">We conclude that there is ample evidence that the packages involved were intended to be conveyed by mail within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">Appellant next asserts that the evidence failed to show that he secreted \u00a1or embezzled, or that he unlawfully detained or delayed the decoy packages. This as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>sertion is predicated on the theory that appellant\u2019s throwing the packages into his trash collection did not remove them from the mail or from the custody of the post office. It was shown that the refuse collected by custodial laborers customarily went to the post office basement where it was sorted through before disposal to discover any mail mixed with it. However, the existence of this procedure made appellant\u2019s deliberate diversion of the packages no less unlawful. From the evidence it is clear that appellant took the packages into his possession when he unlawfully removed and concealed them: the crime was then completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The logical conclusion to be drawn from the facts is that appellant planned to extract the packages from the trash before relinquishing it in the basement for screening and disposal. He in fact succeeded in furtively unwrapping one package before being accosted by the authorities. The principle has long obtained that a letter or package need not be removed from the post office building to consummate the offense of stealing from the mail. United States v. Marselis, C.C.N.Y., Fed.Cas.No. 15,724; United States v. Nott, C.C.Ohio, Fed.Cas.No.15,900; Ex parte Peters, C.C., 12 F. 461, 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the indictment was insufficient in the following particulars. (1) The indictment' did not allege the sender of the packages or that he intended them to be conveyed by mail. Each count charged that the package \u201cwas intended to be conveyed by mail\u201d \u2014 the language of the statute \u2014 to the named addressee. This was sufficient. As has been indicated hereinbefore, this crime may be committed though the sender and addressee of the decoy package are fictitious ; it <em>would </em>be an absurdity to require the identification of a fiction or reference to a fiction\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d. (2) The indictment did not allege the owner of the package. The packages were described as directed to persons other than appellant, and an averment as to ownership was unnecessary. United States v. Laws, D.C.Mass., Fed.Cas. No.15,579; United States v. Okie, C.C.N.Y., Fed.Cas.No.15,916; Walster v. United States, C.C.N.Y., 42 F. 891, 893. (3) Count one of the indictment did not allege that the taking was with felonious intent. The allegation used the language of the statute \u2014 that appellant did \u201csecrete and embezzle\u201d \u2014 and was in this respect sufficient. United States v. Atkinson, D.C. Mich., 34 F. 316. See also: United States v. Falkenhainer, C.C.Mo., 21 F. 624, 627; United States v. Trosper, D.C.Cal., 127 F. 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The indictment was sufficient and the conviction was fully supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\"> 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 318, with violation of which appellant is charged, was drawn from three prior statutes: Rev.St. \u00a7\u00a7 3890, 3891, and \u00a7 5467. Most of the earlier cases hereinafter cited in this opin-4on were decided under Rev.St. \u00a7 5467, Act June 8, 1872, c. 335, 17 Stat. 318, which was substantially re-enacted in the presently effective statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
