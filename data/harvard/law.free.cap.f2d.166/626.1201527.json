Plaintiffs assert its transaction of business in Chicago by having had freight consigned to it in care of the Transport Terminal Company, Chicago. The Transport Company, pursuant to a contract which it had with the defendant, assembled such freight into carload lots and handled its shipment to defendant or its members on the west coast. The individual upon whom the summons and complaint were served was one A1 Davis, president of the Transport Terminal Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The plaintiffs are four shippers who carried freight consigned to defendant, to Chicago. They had regular tariffs filed with the I.C.C. setting forth their freight charges. However, Transport Company revised and reduced the bills which the plaintiffs submitted, and made what plaintiffs claim were under payments. It is because of these alleged under payments that plaintiffs brought this suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Transport Company was reimbursed by defendant for sums which it advanced, as well as for its stipulated service charge for assembling and forwarding the freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">The U. S. Marshal\u2019s return on service read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">\u201cServed this writ together with copy of Complaint on the within named Pacific Coast Wholesalers Association, a corporation, by delivering copies thereof to A1 Davis, <em>an agent of said corporation, </em>this 3rd day of June, A. D., 1946. The President of said corporation not found in my district. * * * \u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">Motion supported by affidavit, for default judgment was made, and the court entered a default judgment for the amounts claimed, and interest and costs, on July 1, 1946. Executions were issued and returned unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">On August 6, the defendant, Pacific Coast Wholesalers Assn., appeared by counsel and moved to vacate the default judgment, the motion reciting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-14\">\u201cappearing specially * * * moves that all of the judgments * * * by default * * * be vacated and that this suit be dimissed on the ground that the suit has been brought in the wrong district of the United States because as appears from the Complaint, this suit arises under a law regulating commerce, to-wit: U.S.C.A., Title 49, Section 317, Paragraph (b), and the defendant is not an inhabitant of the Northern District of Illinois, wherein this suit is brought, within the meaning of Section 51 of the Judicial Code [28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 112] * $ * <em>&gt;*</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">In its amended motion to dismiss, defendant gave as further ground:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-18\">\u201cthis Court lacks jurisdiction over the person of this defendant and that the service of process is insufficient and the return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>thereof should be quashed, for the reasons that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-4\">\u201c(1) The said A1 Davis, upon whom the summons and complaint were served, was not an officer, agent or employee of the defendant, nor was he authorized to receive service of process for it, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">\u201c(2) The defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of and residing in the State of California; that it was not \u25a0doing business in the State of Illinois, nor was it licensed to do business there; that it did not consent to be sued or served with process in the State of Illinois; and that it was not present in the State of Illinois so that process could not there be served upon \u25a0it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">This motion to vacate was supported by an affidavit of the secretary of defendant, and by another affidavit by an employee of the Transport - Terminal Company. The \u25a0secretary\u2019s affidavit was to negative any inference of defendant\u2019s \u201cdoing business\u201d in Illinois so as to be subject to suit in said state.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The affidavit of defendant\u2019s secretary is set forth below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The affidavit of Transport Company\u2019s employee gave the details of its methods of handling of defendant\u2019s freight.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The amended motion was supported by the affidavit of the executive secretary of the defendant, which affidavit stated that A1 Davis \u201cis neither an employee nor an agent\u201d of defendant-and was not \u201cauthorized to accept service\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">A1 Davis also made an affidavit setting forth the facts of his presidency of Transport Terminal Company and also stating that the Transport Company is not a subsidiary of or affiliated with the defendant and none of its stock is owned by defendant, and there was no organizational connection between the two companies. Transport Company was engaged in the business of consolidating, distributing and forwarding freight for various shippers and associations of shippers. Transport Company has had a contract with defendant for four years, dealing with the handling of defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ant\u2019s freight. The substance of the contract, as stated in Davis\u2019 affidavit, is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The trial court did not specifically state the reasons for its ruling in setting aside the default judgment and quashing service, but it is easy to see the contest is over the query \u2014 Was defendant doing business in Illinois so as to be subject to suit?</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The plaintiffs contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">(1) defendant waived any defect of venue by failing to challenge it before entry of default judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">(2) defendant\u2019s activities in Illinois es-topped its asserting improper venue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">(3) defendant\u2019s activities in Illinois, through Transport Terminal Co. were sufficient to constitute its presence here for service of process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">(4) personal service upon Davis, president of Transport Co., was binding upon defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Defendant, on the other hand, denies that {1) its activities in Illinois constituted consent by it to be sued here, nor was it doing business here so as to be subject to service; (2) service upon Davis could not bind it because he was neither its agent, officer nor employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">Our guide is the opinion of the late Chief Justice Stone, rendered in the case of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316, 319, 320, 66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95, 161 A.L.R. 1057. In the light of the opinion in that case, we have little doubt that the defendant was \u201cdoing business\u201d in the State of Illinois in this case so as to be subject to suit here.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-20\">The facts necessitating such a conclusion are:</p>\n<p id=\"b681-21\">(1) Transport Terminal Co. was an agent of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-22\">(2) Defendant\u2019s business was the handling of freight, a very vital part of that business, i. e., the handling of freight, routed to Chicago for reassembly into carload lots, for final shipment to defendant or its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-23\">(3) Such activity in Illinois was substantial \u2014 it had continued for four years and its volume of business was substantial (the fact that the alleged under payments alone amounted to just under seven thousand dollars is evidence of the volume of its business).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-24\">(1) Defendant stresses the independence of Terminal Transport Company of the defendant. True, there is evidence that they are separate corporations. Equally clear is the proof to show Terminal Co. was a valued agent of defendant. \u201cNearly one-half of the freight tonnage handled by Transport Co. consists of freight consigned to Pacific Coast Association\u201d. The only inference we can draw from the sworn state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>ment of the Terminal\u2019s president is that well-nigh one-half of Terminal\u2019s business was for defendant. It was paid by defendant for such service, and its compensation was a percentage of defendant\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">While there seems to have been no corporate relationship between the two, the vice-president of Transport Co. was general manager of defendant, a fact not to be ignored for it suggests possibility of control which defendant might have had in determining Transport\u2019s policy and operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Defendant\u2019s and Transport Co.\u2019s own appellation of the relationship was that of <em>agency, </em>in several instances when they were not conscious of or troubled with the instant controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The affidavit of Transport Co.\u2019s employee, submitted by defendant as basis for the motion to vacate stated</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">\u201cSuch shipments moved daily under uniform standard bills of lading * * * to the aforesaid receiving station of Transport Terminal Co., and receipts were issued thereon reading, \u2018Transport Terminal Co., Agent for Pacific Coast Wholesalers Association.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">(2) Defendant\u2019s business was described by the Interstate Commission as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">\u201c * * * (defendant) is an association of shippers engaged in consolidating and distributing freight for its members on a non-profit basis, for the purpose of securing the benefit of carload, truckload, or other volume rates * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">It can thus be seen how extremely important a part of defendant\u2019s business was being done in Chicago by the Transport Co. It was an important cog in effectively accomplishing the economic and efficient transportation of products going to defendant and its constituent members in California from points beyond Chicago. If such freight had been shipped directly to defendant in California in the less than carload lots, the freight cost would have been much greater. Transport Co.\u2019s activity eliminated any necessity for a formal \u201cbranch\u201d of defendant being in Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">(3) Not only was the volume of defendant\u2019s business carried on by Transport Co. very substantial and long continued, but there were the more formal indicia of presence of defendant in Illinois, manifested (1) by a sign bearing the legend \u201cPacific Coast Wholesalers Association\u201d appearing directly over the receiving facilities of Transport Terminal Company; (2) defendant\u2019s name was also carried in the Chicago telephone directories.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">In the International Shoe Co. case, supra, it was said the criteria for determining whether a corporation\u2019s activities were such as to justify its subjection to suit could not be \u201csimply mechanical or quantitative.\u201d The corporation must have \u201ccertain minimum contacts (within the state) * * * that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d The Court said</p>\n<p id=\"b682-16\">\u201cThose demands (of due process) may be met by such contacts of the corporation with the state of the forum as make it <em>reasonable, </em>in the context of our federal system of government, to require the corporation to defend the particular suit which is brought there. An \u2018estimate of the inconveniences\u2019 which would result to the corporation from a trial away from its \u2018home\u2019 or principal place of business is relevant in this connection. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b682-17\">\u201c \u2018Presence\u2019 in the state in this sense has never been doubted when the activities of the corporation there have not only been <em>continuous </em>and <em>systematic, </em>but also give rise to the liabilities sued on, even though no'consent to be sued or authorization to an agent to accept service of process has been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-18\">\u00edj\u00ed <em>% </em>5|C jjc $</p>\n<p id=\"b682-19\">\u201cBut to the extent that a corporation exercises the privilege of conducting activities within a state, it enjoys the benefits, and protection of the laws of that state.. The exercise of that privilege may give rise to obligations; and, so far as those obligations arise out of or are connected with the activities within the state, a procedure which requires the corporation to respond to a suit brought to enforce them can, in most instances, hardly be said to be undue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-20\">As we read the International Shoe opinion, containing as it does such a fair and practical application of the theory of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>law to modern business conditions as they exist, we can not avoid the conclusion that it is eminently fair in the instant case to hold the Pacific Coast Association liable to suit in Illinois, and make it responsible to plaintiffs if there be merit proved in their contention of illegal underpayments on freight of defendant by them carried to Chicago, and deposited with Transport Co. The transaction in controversy arose in Chicago. It was Transport Co.\u2019s alleged illegal action in Chicago in reducing the freight charges for freight services terminating in Chicago, that gives rise to the instant cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">If, in so reducing the freight charges, the Transport Co. was acting for defendant as its agent, and as suggested in the International Shoe Co. case, we are to \u201cestimate inconveniences\u201d in defending a suit away from home, we believe we might also well place on the scale the inconvenience of the four plaintiffs located in Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois, going to California to sue the defendant. In fact, it might be even more convenient for Pacific Coast to be sued here than in California, for all the books and records concerning the charges in issue are presumably located at Transport Co.\u2019s place of business. Those records must be of hundreds of transactions; the persons who took it upon themselves to calculate the existence of overcharges must be located at Terminal Co.\u2019s offices in Chicago. All of these facts lead us to the inescapable conclusion that the logical forum for the determination of the conflict is in Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In view of the fact of our holding that Transport Co. was an agent of defendant and its activities such as to render defendant liable to suit in Illinois, it follows that service of process upon Transport Co.\u2019s president was valid service upon defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Ordinarily, service on a foreign corporation doing business in another state may be made by service on its agent in said state. Here the agent of the foreign corporation is a domestic corporation. The avoidance of the service by the foreign corporation may not be accomplished because the agent is a local corporation rather than an individual. If the service on the local corporation, \u2014 the agent \u2014 is good as to said local corporation, it follows that it is good as to the principal, the foreign corporation. Here the service on the president of Transport Co. was service on said domestic corporation. It was therefore good as service on the foreign corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\"><em>Venue </em>Another issue strenuously urged is that the trial court lacked venue. The statute provides that a defendant shall be sued in the district of which he is an inhabitant. Defendant is an inhabitant of California. Even though we have concluded defendant was doing business in Illinois, it would seem that it is not subject to suit if it has not designated an agent for service in this state or unless it has waived a lack of venue. Plaintiffs staunchly contend that such waiver 'was effected when it permitted default judgment to be entered against it, and for this contention they rely on Commercial Casualty Insurance Co. v. Consolidated Stone Co., 278 U.S. 177, 49 S.Ct. 98, 99, 73 L.Ed. 252. In that case, Justice VanDevan-ter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">\u201c* * * the other provision * * * merely accords to the defendant a personal privilege respecting the venue * * * which he may assert, or may waive, at his election.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-13\">\u201cThe decisions also make it plain that the privilege must be \u2018seasonably\u2019 asserted; else it is waived. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-14\">\u201cWe are of opinion that the privilege is of such a nature that it must be asserted at latest before the expiration of the period allotted for entering a general appearance and challenging the merits. In ordinary course, when that period expires the defendant either will have appeared generally for the purpose of contesting the merits or by suffering a default will have assented that his adversary\u2019s allegations be taken as confessed for the purposes of judgment. * * * To hold that such a privilege may be retained until after the suit has reached the stage for dealing with the merits and then be asserted would be in our opinion subversive of orderly procedure and make for harmful delay and confusion. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-15\">\u201cHere the objection was not that the court was without jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the suit, but that the suit was not brought in the district of the residence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>of either party \u2014 a waivable matter of venue only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">\u201cOur conclusion is that the objection was not seasonably made and therefore that under our decisions * * * it was waived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APWL\">Defendant, however, <em>contends </em>that this decision antedated the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section' 723c, and therefore has lost its controlling importance. Blank v. Bitker, 7 Cir., 135 F.2d 962. The Commercial Casualty Insurance Co., case however, has been cited as recently as 323 U.S. 310, 314, 65 S.Ct. 289,292, 89 L.Ed. 260 (Industrial Addition Ass\u2019n v. Commissioner) wherein Chief Justice Stone, speaking for the court, stated: \u201cThe right to have a cause heard in the court of the proper venue may be lost unless seasonably asserted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAO\">In Freeman v. Bee Machine Co., 319 U.S. 448, 63 S.Ct. 1146, 1149, 87 L.Ed. 1509, the following appears :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u201cThat requirement relates to venue. But venue involves no more and no less than a personal privilege which \u2018may be lost by failure to assert it seasonably, by formal submission in a cause, or by' submission through conduct.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201cOn the face of the present record it would seem that any objection to venue has been waived. There is no indication in the record before us that any such objection was \u2018seasonably asserted.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The Bitker case in this court is distinguishable. This court there found there was no waiver. Deposition had been taken simply to refresh the party\u2019s recollection and the answer pursuant to the Rules incorporated not only the answer on the merits but the defense of improper venue. This practice Rule 12(b) authorizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Getting down to the realities in this case and the reasons back of the Commercial Casualty Insurance Co. case, we believe that the default in the instant case was sufficient to bar defendant\u2019s later assertion of lack of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">First of all defendant was well aware of the imminence of suit. There had been letters sent by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to defendant and its counsel in California pleading for adjustment of the underpayments, and threatening suit if such payments were not made. Defendant\u2019s counsel wrote conciliatory letters begging for more time to ascertain the merits. Plaintiffs stated the I. C. C. was pressing them to rectify their undercharges under their tariffs. So, this suit was not a matter of surprise to defendant. The complaint was filed May 14. Summons was served upon Mr. Davis, June 3. Defendant received a copy of it on June 10. The default judgment was entered July 1. Motion to vacate was made August 6. Defendant was apprised by the summons that unless answer were filed within 20 days default judgment would be taken against it. Defendant sat by while more than the 20 days elapsed without taking action, and tardily appeared in August, two months after Mr. Davis had been served, and asked that the service be quashed on the ground of lack of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">We conclude that this case is controlled by the Commercial Insurance case.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-19\">The complaint is in four counts, one each respectively for the four plaintiff shippers.
