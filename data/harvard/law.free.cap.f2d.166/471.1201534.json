Thereafter he brought suit for overtime compensation under section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207, and obtained the judgment from which Sertner's has appealed. The questions raised by the appeal are, first, whether Lesser\u2019s work brought him within section 7 as an employee \u201cengaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,\u201d and, second, if it did, whether he was exempted by section 13(a) (2), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213(a) (2), which makes the provisions of sections 6 and 7 inapplicable to \u201cany employee engaged in any retail or service establishment the greater part of whose selling or servicing is in intrastate commerce.\u201d The district' court answered the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-21\">The first answer was plainly correct. Sertner\u2019s was engaged in the business of cleaning, renovating and repairing upholstered furniture, draperies, curtains, rugs and carpets. To a small extent it was engaged in interstate commerce. It operated trucks to pick up goods from its customers, bring them to its premises in Manhattan and redeliver them to the customers after the work on them was completed; about two per cent, of the goods were delivered to customers outside the state of New York. As receiving and shipping clerk Lesser handled all goods brought to his employer\u2019s premises. One department of the business was the Gleaning of rugs. The actual work of cleaning them was done by a subcontractor, Lincoln Rug Co., located in East Newark, New Jersey. The rug company\u2019s trucks made daily trips between Manhattan and East Newark transporting the rugs to be worked on and returning the cleaned rugs. Lesser\u2019s activities in connection with the rugs which came into the premises of Sertner\u2019s and were then delivered by truck to New Jersey and later returned to Sertner\u2019s consumed several hours of his working time each day during the entire period of his employment. The district court made a finding that a substantial portion of plaintiff\u2019s activities were directly related to the movement of the aforementioned rugs in interstate commerce. This finding, which is supported by the evidence, brings the plaintiff within section 7 of the Act as an employee \u201cengaged in commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Walling v. Jacksonville Paper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Co., 317 U.S. 564, 572, 63 S.Ct. 332, 87 L.Ed. 460; Skidmore v. John J. Casale, Inc., 2 Cir., 160 F.2d 527, 530. It is unnecessary to consider whether he was also engaged \u201cin the production of goods for commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Less easy of solution is the second question, namely, whether Lesser is exempted by section 13(a) (2) as an \u201cemployee engaged in any retail or service establishment the greater part of whose selling or servicing is in intrastate commerce.\u201d This exemption has been narrowly construed, the word \u201cservice\u201d being held to mean \u201cretail service\u201d because of the proximity of the two words and the legislative history and administrative interpretation of the section. This court suggested as much in Fleming v. Arsenal Bldg. Corporation, 2 Cir., 125 F.2d 278, 280, affirmed sub nom. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517, 62 S.Ct. 1116, 86 L.Ed. 1638; and the question was authoritatively settled in Phillips Co. v. Walling, 324 U.S. 490, 65 S.Ct. 807, 89 L.Ed. 1095, 157 A.L.R. 876, and Roland Co. v. Walling, 326 U.S. 657, 66 S.Ct. 413, 90 L.Ed. 383. See also Phillips v. Star Overall Dry Cleaning Laundry Co., 2 Cir., 149 F.2d 416, certiorari denied sub nom All Service Laundry Corporation v. Phillips, 327 U.S. 780, 66 S.Ct. 677, 90 L.Ed. 1008. In the light of these authorities the district court concluded that the appellant\u2019s business was not a retail service establishment</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In reaching this conclusion the court stressed the fact that the conduct of the business was not designed to attract the attention of the consuming public in the manner usually associated with retail establishments, and did not have any of the characteristics \u201cepitomized by the corner grocery, the drug store and the department store.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sertner\u2019s occupied the entire twelfth floor of a loft building located in a factory neighborhood. The customer whose goods were cleaned and processed rarely came to the premises. It employed about twenty employees, but had no sales clerk to wait on trade, and no display windows to attract the patronage of the general public; the articles customers wished to have cleaned or otherwise worked on were brought to the premises'by its trucks. Four or more outside salesmen were employed to solicit business and its customers included furniture dealers, trade shops, interior decorators, department stores, commercial consumers and institutions, as well as occupants of private residences. About 83 per cent, of its business came from private residences. Approximately one-third of this was procured through interior decorators wh\u00f3 were solicited to recommend Sert-ner\u2019s to their clients and were paid a 10% commission on the business so obtained. On its own premises Sertner\u2019s only cleaned, renovated and repaired upholstered furniture, the greater part of the work for its customers being performed by subcontractors employed by it for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">It is true, as the foregoing facts show, that the appellant\u2019s business was not conducted in a manner characteristic of the small retail store, nevertheless we think it should be held to come within the exemption of section 13(a) (2). As we read the authorities, the test of whether the local merchant or purveyor of service is operating a retail establishment is the type of customers he has; the volume of his business, the number of his employees or the manner in which trade is attracted and customers obtained is not material. If the customers are \u201cultimate consumers\u201d of the goods sold or serviced locally, the establishment is retail. As Mr. Justice Burton stated in Roland v. Walling, 326 U.S. 657, 666, S.Ct. 413, 417, 90 L.Ed. 383, \u201cthe exemption reaches employees of only such retail or service establishments as are comparable to the local merchant, corner groc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>er or filling station operator who sells to or serves ultimate consumers who are at the end of, or beyond, that \u2018flow of goods in commerce\u2019 which it is the purpose of the Act to reach.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And in 326 U.S. at page 671, 66 S.Ct. at page 419, 90 L.Ed. 383, he explains that the purpose of the exemption was to make plain that when a local merchant sells to customers for their own consumption goods which the merchant may have purchased outside the state, the Act was not to be applied to his employees on the theory that such goods were still within the stream of interstate commerce when the retail sale was made. Hence the employees of a retail grocer who sells only to individual householders would not fall outside the exemption because the volume of his business was large and his customers numerous, or because orders were accepted on credit and deliveries made by truck instead of being a cash sale over the counter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similarly a laundry company which picks up soiled clothes at private homes, transports them to its local plant for washing and redelivers the cleaned clothes to their owners is no less within the exemption than the Chinese laundryman whose customers must bring in and call for their own parcels. In either case the business is local and the goods with respect to which the service is performed \u00e1re not within the flow of interstate commerce. That the appellant operated a service establishment the greater part of whose servicing is in intrastate commerce is indisputable. With respect to customers who were occupants of private residences it was a retail service establishment under the test above discussed. The fact that the greater part of the work done for its customers was let out to subcontractors whom it employed for that purpose is, in our opinion, irrelevant under that test. Not all of the appellant\u2019s business, however, was retail; only about 83 per cent, came from private residences ; the other 17 per cent, we will assume was not done with \u201cultimate consumers\u201d because the customers were furniture dealers, department stores, etc.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When an establishment makes some non-retail sales, the Administrator has ruled that it will nevertheless be considered a retail establishment unless the gross receipts from non-retail sales constitute more than 25 per cent, of the total gross receipts of the establishment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although 83 per cent, of the appellant\u2019s total gross receipts were derived from retail sales of services to occupants of private residences, the district court thought the appellant was not within the required percentage because approximately one-third of the business with private residences was procured upon the recommendation of interior decorators who were paid a commission on the business so obtained; he considered such business non-retail, with the result that the total non-retail business was about 45 per cent, of the gross receipts of the establishment. We are unable to agree with this view. Whether the business with private residential customers was obtained by the efforts of appellant\u2019s outside salesmen, by newspaper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>advertising, or through the recommendation of decorators (paid or unpaid) seems to us immaterial. However the customer was obtained, he purchased from Sertner\u2019s the service he desired and was the \u201cultimate consumer\u201d of the goods with respect to which the service was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">For the foregoing reasons we are of opinion that the plaintiff was within the exemption of section 13(a) (2) of the Act. Accordingly the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-18\">The fact that Sertner\u2019s business with the Lincoln Rug Co. was only about $5600 a year, while its total yearly business ranged between $106,000 and $158,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>000, is of no importance. The statute makes no distinction on the basis of volume of the employer\u2019s interstate business. Mabee v. White Plains Pub. Co., 327 U.S. 178, 181, 66 S.Ct. 511, 90 L.Ed. 607. The applicability of the Act depends on the character of the employee\u2019s work. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U.S. 517, 524, 62 S.Ct 1116, 86 L.Ed. 1638. Since Lesser devoted a \u201csubstantial\u201d portion of bis time to the movement of goods across state lines, he was \u201cengaged in commerce.\u201d Skidmore v. John J.
