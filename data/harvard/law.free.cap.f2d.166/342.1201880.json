Its status as such was, however, contested\u2019 by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company until about December 31, 1943 when the-Railroad Company acquiesced in a ruling of the Board that the Water Supply Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>pany was within the Acts. Consequently it was not until after that date that the Water Supply Company, which ever since the petitioner\u2019s retirement had been paying him a monthly pension under its private pension plan, advised the petitioner to make application for an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1935. The petitioner made such application on August 28, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The Board\u2019s decision was based on the proposition, subsequently acquiesced in by all parties, that the Mountain Water Supply Company was a \u201ccarrier\u201d and an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of the Railroad Retirement Acts on July 1, 1937, and that the petitioner would, therefore, under the terms of the Acts have been entitled to an annuity on that date if he had applied for it. Consequently under the express terms of the Acts the petitioner was not entitled to a pension under the Act of 1937 after October 1, 1937, or to an annuity under the Act of 1935 for any period more than sixty days prior to actual application for it. The petitioner does not deny that the plain language of the Acts so provides. In this court the petitioner\u2019s sole contention is that -the Board, by reason of its prior rulings with respect to other subsidiary water companies and its failure until 1944 to rule upon the Mountain Water Supply Company\u2019s status, was estopped to deny that he was not eligible for an annuity on July 1, 1937. We \u25a0see no basis for such an estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\"> It is settled that estoppel may not be asserted against an agency of the United States Government such as the Railroad Retirement Board. Federal Crop Insurance Corporation v. Merrill, 1947, 68 S.Ct. 1. Moreover, even .if estoppel might be asserted against the Board we are satisfied that the essential elements of an estoppel are not present in this case. To refer to only one of the necessary elements, the petitioner has suffered no loss. On the \u25a0contrary it appears that during the entire period from October 1, 1937, to June 28, 1944, he regularly received a monthly pen-sion from the Mountain Water Supply \u25a0Company under its private pension plan at a rate in excess of the annuity which he now claims from the Board. Consequently if anyone is aggrieved by the Board\u2019s decision it is the Water Supply Company and not the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The decision of the Railroad Retirement Board will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-15\">Jurisdiction is conferred upon this court by \u00a7 11 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, as amended by \u00a7 215 of the Act of July 31, 1946, 60 Stat. 735, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 228k.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
