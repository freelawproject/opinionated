The issue in the case involves the confusion in trade clause of section 5 of that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Appellant\u2019s trade-mark is the term \u201cChap Stick,\u201d registered June 4, 1912, registration No. 86,819, for use on a \u201cmedicinal preparation for chapped skin, sunburn and hangnails * *</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">It appears from the record that appellant\u2019s trade-mark registration was renewed in 1932; that its preparation is always \u25a0\u201cmarketed\u201d under the name \u201cFleet\u2019s Chap Stick;\u201d and that appellant has also registered the mark \u201cFleet\u2019s\u201d and \u201cFleet\u2019s Chap-Stick,\u201d although such registrations are not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Appellant\u2019s mark \u201cChap Stick\u201d was registered under the 10-year clause of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, and the product upon which its trademark is used .is composed of camphor, oil of doves, aromatic oils, petrolatums and waxes, and is used to sooth and relieve irritations of the skin, including- irritation of the skin caused by the razor in shaving. It is sold in containers in the form of sticks, and also to some extent, not stated, in jars. Appellant\u2019s trade-mark has been \u25a0extensively advertised in magazines, newspapers, and other types of advertising throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Appellee\u2019s trade-mark is composed of the term \u201cSlick Stick\u201d for use on shaving \u2022sticks; Its application for registration was \u25a0filed July 21, 1943, wherein it is stated that \u25a0appellee had used its mark - on its goods \u25a0since June 8, 1942. In its application for registration the term \u201cstick\u201d was disclaimed apart from the mark as shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Apppellee\u2019s \u201cSlick Stick\u201d shaving preparation is apparently put up in paper containers in the form of sticks and is used to prepare the .beard for shaving. Each stick is composed of a combination of earth \u25a0minerals, a drop or two of olive oil, and perfumed by one or two drops of essential \u25a0oil. It is dry and greaseless, and its sole purpose, as hereinbefore stated, is to aid in shaving. It is not composed in any part of petrolatums, waxes, camphor, or oil of cloves. It is a hard, round stick approximately <em>3% </em>inches in length and li^ inches in diameter. The minerals in appellee\u2019s shaving stick are alkaline in reaction and slightly styptic, although it does not have the styptic qualities in a sense that it prevents bleeding or that it stops bleeding caused by an abrasion or cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">It appears from the testimony of Robert H. Delafield, Financial Vice President of the Columbia Gas &amp; Electric Corporation and a director and treasurer of appel-lee\u2019s corporation that</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">\u201cIn order, to shave with Slick Stick the face must be thoroughly wet. The stick is then applied to the face where it leaves a chalky deposit. The action of this deposit is to hold the water on the face close to the whiskers, so to speak, to make each whisker a little container for water, and by its slight styptic action \u2014 -that is, drawing the skin tight \u2014 make the whiskers stand up straight.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">\u201cAfter the application of Slick Stick has been allowed to dry on the face for a short time it is washed off with clear water, and apparently the plain face without any substance on it is shaved. In fact, there has been left a slight slick which, with the astringent or styptic quality of the earth minerals, helps to hold the whiskers in an erect position, thus presenting the smallest possible surface to the cutting edge of the razor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">No soap or lather or other material is used in the shaving process.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">It is true, of course, that other preparations, including appellant\u2019s preparation, may be used after shaving in order to relieve any irritation of the skin caused by the razor;</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">It further appears from the record that appellee\u2019s goods, under the trade-mark \u201cSlick Stick,\u201d have not been advertised to any great extent. Its product is sold to wholesale druggists and drug supply houses and is then distributed to retail drug stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">Each of the tribunals of the Patent Office held that the goods of the parties might be regarded as having the same descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>tive properties but that considering the difference in the goods and the difference in the marks, the concurrent use of the marks on the goods of the parties would not be likely to cause confusion in trade or deceive purchasers and, accordingly, dismissed appellant\u2019s notice of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In his decision, the Examiner of Interferences stated that the word \u201cStick\u201d was merely descriptive and that although appellant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cChap Stick,\u201d in its entirety, having been registered under the 10-year clause of section 5 of the TradeMark Act of February 20, 1905, was a valid trade-mark, appellant was not entitled to the exclusive use of the word \u201cStick\u201d and, in support of his statement, cited the case of Charles R. Spicer v. W. H. Bull Medicine Co., 49 F.2d 980, 18 C. C.P.A., Patents, 1402, where it was held, on the authorities therein cited, that the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d were merely descriptive and that although appellee had registered its mark \u201cW. H. Bull\u2019s Herbs and Iron\u201d under the 10-year clause of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, appellant in that case had the right to use the words \u201cHerbs and Iron\u201d ,in a primary sense, so long as its trademark in its entirety was not confusingly similar to appellee\u2019s trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">We are of opinion that appellant is not entitled to the exclusive use of the word \u201cStick\u201d in a trade-mark, as it is merely descriptive of the shape or form of appellant\u2019s product and is one of the characteristics thereof. Accordingly, the question presented is whether \u201cSlick Stick\u201d for use on appellee\u2019s goods is confusingly similar to the trade-mark \u201cChap Stick\u201d for use on appellant\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We have given careful consideration to the argument presented here by counsel for appellant and to the cases cited by them, but are of opinion that considering the difference in the marks in their entireties, and the difference in the goods of the parties, the concurrent use by the parties of their marks on their respective goods would not be likely to cause confusion in trade or deceive purchasers, and that appellee is entitled to the registration of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">By reason of illness, O\u2019CONNELL, Associate Judge, was not present at the argument of this case and did not participate in the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
