S. S. Poznan, 274 U.S. 117, 47 S.Ct. 482, 71 L.Ed. 955, the Court held, in effect, that no lien can be obtained against a ship in custodia legis; but it allowed the Dock Company a preferential claim against the proceeds of the ship for wharfage service rendered while the libel proceedings were pending, because the <em>service was </em>furnished as an incident of the court\u2019s administration and had benefited the parties to the proceedings. Such a payment, said the Supreme Court, defrayed an expense which the admiralty court \u201chas permitted for the common benefit and which, in equity and good conscience, should be satisfied before the libellants may enjoy the fruits of their lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Consequently, there is here no room for the doctrine that a lien is waived by one who looks wholly to the credit of some person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Yet it is distinctly pertinent that the Dock Company, in its day-to-day contract with Mercantile, relied solely upon Mercantile\u2019s credit. For the Poznan decision rests on the doctrine of unjust enrichment;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we accept, as a correct formulation of one aspect of that doctrine, the following statement in Restatement of Restitution, \u00a7 110: \u201cA person who has conferred a benefit upon another as the performance of a contract with a third person is not entitled to restitution from the other merely because of the failure of performance by the third person.\u201d That disposes of the bulk of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-17\">After September 6, 1946, however, the Dock Company no longer relied upon Mercantile\u2019s credit. As, from that date, the Dock Company furnished a service which conferred a benefit upon those interested in the ship, it would seem that its claim for wharfage after that date comes within the ruling in Poznan. However, there is one differentiating fact. In Poznan, the Supreme Court, in disposing of an argument that the wharfage service had not been furnished \u201cin accordance with 'an order made by the court and with the consent of the libellants,\u201d said: \u201cBut here the court denied a motion to remove the ship from petitioner\u2019s wharf with the consent of some of the libellants and with full knowledge of all concerned that the wharfage was then being furnished. The libellants <em>* </em>* * thus appear to have acquiesced in this determination. * * * It is enough if the court approves the service rendered or permits it to be rendered, and it inures to the benefit of the property or funds in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>custody.\u201d In the instant case, the court, before the ship\u2019s sale, had made no order approving the service rendered or permitting it to be rendered. Nevertheless, we think that, as the ship had to be wharfed somewhere, and since the other parties knew of the wharfage, were \u201cenriched\u201d by it, and took no steps, after September 6, to provide wharfage elsewhere, the Dock Company is entitled to a preferred claim for the period from September 6, to November 22, 1946.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The order will be modified in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-12\">See, e.g., Marshall &amp; Co. v. \u201cPresident Arthur,\u201d 279 U.S. 564, 49 S.Ct. 420, 73 L.Ed. 846; The City of Seattle, 2 Cir., 61 F.2d 763.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-14\">This appears from the Court\u2019s use of the phrases \u201ccommon benefit,\u201d \u201cequity and good conscience.\u201d It also appears from the Court\u2019s citation of United States v. Cornell Steamboat Co., 202 U.S. 184, 26 S.Ct. 648, 50 L.Ed. 987, a salvage ease in which the Court relied on the doctrine of unjust enrichment; cf. Woodward, The Law of Quasi Contracts (1913) 323-326.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">Note also that in Poznan the Court cited Fosdick v. Schall, 99 U.S. 235, 25 L.Ed. 339 (and related cases), which established the \u201csix-months\u2019 rule\u201d in railroad receiverships, a rule which is based upon the unjust enrichment doctrine. The \u201csix-months\u2019 rule\u201d has been said to create \u201can admiralty lien upon wheels\u201d; see Fairman, Mr. Justice Miller and The Supreme Court (1939) 244-246; cf. Galveston H. &amp; H. R. Co. v. Cowdrey, 11 Wall. 459, 480, 482, 20 L.Ed. 199, and Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Kansas City, W. &amp; N. R. Co., C.C., 53 F. 182, 190. It is of interest that, just as in Poznan the Court cited the railroad receivership cases, so in St. Louis &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. Spiller, 274 U.S. 304, 310, 47 S.Ct. 635, 71 L.Ed. 1060, a railroad receivership case, the Court bracketed Fosdick v. Schall, supra, and Poznan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b742-14\">The Marshal made no effort, after September 6, 1946, to remove the ship from the Dock Company\u2019s wharf. He may thus be said to have authorized that wharfage from that date. In this connection, we note the following passage in Poznan (274 U.S. at page 121, 47 S. Ct. at page 484, 71 L.Ed. 955): \u201cThe most elementary notion of justice would seem to require that services or property furnished upon the authority of the court or its officer, acting within his authority, for the common benefit of those interested in a fund administered by the court, should be paid from the fund as an \u2018expense of justice.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
