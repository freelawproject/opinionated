There are likewise, however, certain similarities and these similarities are deemed to predominate by reason of the fact that applicant has appropriated nearly the whole of opposer\u2019s mark as the first portion of its notation. The first parts of marks are the portions which are most likely to be noticed and \u2022 retained in the mind of the purchasers and the examiner is of the conclusion, therefore, that the similarities predominate over the differences to such an extent that confusion in trade is reasonably likely. At least there is doubt on this question and in such cases the doubt must be resolved against the newcomer, here the applicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-19\">The First Assistant Commissioner said, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-20\">\u201c \u2018Gaby\u2019 and \u2018Gabardine\u2019 begin with the same three letters, but not with the same syllable. Normally pronounced, they have no vowel sound in common. In appearance their differences far outweigh their single point of resemblance, though it is true that both are printed in conventional script. Other than as opposer\u2019s name, and possibly the name of various individuals, \u2018Gaby\u2019 has no generally recognized meaning; while \u2018Gabardine\u2019 is a word in common use as denoting a well-known fabric. Opposer suggests that \u2018the word \u201cGaby\u201d would be very quickly and readily mistaken for an abbreviation of, or nickname for, the word \u201cGabardine.\u201d \u2019 But I think that is far<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>fetched and sheerly speculative. And I doubt that opposer may rightfully claim a monopoly of all words beginning with the letters \u2018Gab;\u2019 for those letters constitute only a portion, albeit the major portion, of its trade-mark as registered. Rather applicant\u2019s complete mark must be compared with opposer\u2019s complete mark; and when so compared I am convinced that the two differ sufficiently in appearance, sound and significance to be used concurrently in trade without any reasonable likelihood of confusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The brief on behalf of appellant (incidentally it may be said that appellee did not file any brief nor did it make any appearance for argument before us) is quite critical of certain of the First Assistant Commissioner\u2019s expressions. According to the brief \u2014 appellant took no testimony\u2014 the \u201ca\u201d in Gaby is pronounced as is the \u201ca\u201d in gabardine. The brief asserts that in neither of the words is the first vowel pronounced as a long \u201ca,\u201d as in \u201cgay,\u201d and adds \u201cThe pronunciation of the registered mark \u2018Gaby by the First Assistant Commissioner was entirely gratuitous. Such pronunciation has no basis in the record and has no foundation in-the actual use of the word, either in opposer\u2019s business, or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Apropos the statement that the pronunciation attributed to the First Assistant Commissioner \u201chas no basis in the record,\u201d it is not improper to say that if appellant deemed the matter of pronunciation important it would seem that it would have introduced evidence concerning it. Appellant is the opposer; it initiated the controversy, and it has some burden in connection with the suit. Its registration upon which it relies does not indicate the pronunciation. As for the statement that the pronunciation \u201chas no foundation in the actual use of the word, either in opposer\u2019s business, or otherwise,\u201d it may be said that we took occasion to examine Webster's New International Dictionary to see how many words it listed which began with \u201cgab,\u201d and we found there the word \u201cgaby\u201d and the diacritical mark above the \u201ca\u201d is indicating the long sound as in \u201cgay.\u201d (Incidentally, the <em>only </em>definition of the word given by Webster is \u201cA simpleton.\u201d) So, although pronunciation \u201cas in gay\u201d may have no foundation in actual use \u201cin opposer\u2019s business\u201d the \u201cor otherwise\u201d phrase seems to \u201ccover too much territory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">We are not convinced that appellant is right in the assertion that \u201cthe First Assistant Commissioner, in arriving at his conclusions in this case, got off on the wrong track at the very start.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Appellant\u2019s trade-mark is appellant\u2019s name. The pronunciation of names of persons always, and of corporations frequently, is an arbitrary matter ungoverned by any fixed rules of lexicographers, and a person seeing a name in print and not having heard it used by others may pronounce it quite differently from the way in which its owner pronounces it.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">However, acctepting the statement that the \u201cGab\u201d in appellant\u2019s \u201cGaby\u201d is, or should be, pronounced exactly as the \u201cGab\u201d in appellee\u2019s \u201cGabardine,\u201d we are not prepared to hold that that circumstance renders the marks confusingly similar. The marks must be looked at, not just listened to, and must be compared, as a whole. Appellant\u2019s mark considered as a whole, bearing in mind that it is a proper name and not the dictionary term \u201cgaby,\u201d hereinabove alluded to, certainly is neither descriptive nor suggestive of anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary defines \u201cGabardine\u201d as \u201c1. A long loose gown or cloak of coarse material; in the middle ages, the prescribed garment o-f Jews. 2. A raincoat or cloth of which to make it * *</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">As used by appellee it has no descriptive or suggestive significance with respect to the goods upon which it is used; so, there is no resemblance of the trademarks in the matter of suggestiveness. Appellant stresses 'the fact that appellee\u2019s mark is in script like that of appellant. It is our surmise that that was one of the similarities which influenced the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, although it was not so stated by him. It is a matter proper to be considered but, after all, there is nothing particularly novel about conventional script type such as both parties use, and upon full consideration we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>think there is no likelihood of the public being confused or purchasers being deceived by the concurrent use of \u201cGaby\u201d and \u201cGabardine\u201d on goods of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">There are many words having a variety of definitions which begin with \u201cGab.\u201d In many instances \u201cGab\u201d forms the first syllable. We do not think appellant by using its name as a trade-mark and registering it as such, may so preempt the field as to secure a monopoly upon such words and prevent others from using, and in proper cases registering, those which happen to begin with \u201cGab,\u201d and we think if it could prevent the registration of \u201cGabardine\u201d in this case, it could prevent the registration of all the other words having \u201cGab\u201d as the first syllable which the dictionaries show.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patent is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">By reason of illness, O\u2019CONNELL, Judge, was not present at the argument of this case and did not participate in the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
