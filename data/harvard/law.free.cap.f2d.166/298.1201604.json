The amended' complaint was dismissed by the District Court on the ground that it failed to state a claim against the defendants on which relief could be granted. The judge said in his opinion that he found himself \u201cin accord with the logic and reasoning of Judge Lindley\u201d of the Seventh Circuit, who, however, was the dissenting judge in Spanel v. Pegler, 160 F.2d 619, 623, 171 A.L.R. 699. The majority opinion\u2014 written by Judge Kerner \u2014 dealt with the text before us in the case at bar and held that from that text \u201can ordinary reader could understand the article to mean that Spanel is a Communist or a Communist sympathizer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-18\">The plaintiffs-appellants contend that the article conveys the meaning that Spanel, the president of International Latex, is a Communist, a \u201cfellow-traveler,\u201d or a \u201cpro-Red,\u201d and that International Latex Corporation is under the management or control of Communists, \u201cfellow-travelers,\u201d or \u201cpro-Reds.\u201d While the article by the defendants did not in direct terms describe the plaintiffs as Communists, \u201cfellow-travelers,\u201d or \u201cpro-Reds,\u201d a jury might properly find that the import of the Pegler article was to that effect. There can, in our opinion, be no reasonable doubt about this. Accordingly the judgment of the District Court must be reversed upon the authority of the latest decision of the New York Court of Appeals, as well as numerous recent decisions of this court. Mencher v. Chesley, 297 N.Y. 94, 75 N.E.2d 257; Sweeney v. Schenectady Union Pub. Co., 2 Cir., 122 F.2d 288, affirmed 316 U.S. 642, 62 S.Ct. 1031, 86 L.Ed. 1727; Grant v.
