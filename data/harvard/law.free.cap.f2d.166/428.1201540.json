The court awarded him the overtime wages which he claimed, amounting to $164, but held that the failure of the respondent to pay this portion of the libellant\u2019s wages was not \u201cwithout sufficient cause\u201d within the meaning of Section.4529. As Judge Ganey said in the opinion of the district court, 69 F.Supp. 15, 21, \u201cThe question here raised [as to the libellant\u2019s right to the $164 of overtime wages] is not free from difficulty and one cannot say that failure to make the payment was without \u2018sufficient cause.' \u201d We are in complete agreement with the view thus expressed. The \u201csufficient cause\u201d to which Section 4529 refers need not amount to a valid legal defense to the claim for wages. Collie v. Fergusson, 1930, 281 U.S. 52, 55, 50 S. -Ct. 189, 74 L.Ed. 696. It includes a reason for nonpayment asserted in good faith even though it may ultimately be held not to be a good defense. The Velma L. Hamlin, 4 Cir., 1930, <em>40 F.2d 852.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-23\">The decree of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
