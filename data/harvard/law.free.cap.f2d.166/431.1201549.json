Nor does it contend the evidence does not amply support Cardillo\u2019s findings or that the findings do not sustain the award. Seaboard\u2019s contention runs thus: The question whether Seaboard had timely notice is jurisdictional and therefore one of \u201claw\u201d; a question of \u201claw\u201d with respect to a compensation award can be judicially reviewed solely by court proceedings under \u00a7 921; ther efore, the attempted administrative modification of the April 11, 1946 order was invalid and that order now stands unmodified.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">We think this contention untenable. We assume, arguendo, that the doctrine of Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598, is still intact. But that doctrine strictly limits the category of jurisdictional questions. We think that category does not include the question of notice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">As Park\u2019s application for modification was made within the one-year period provided by \u00a7 922, our decision disposes of the case. We therefore not only affirm the denial of the temporary injunction but also remand with directions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-15\">See Chicago Coal &amp; Dock Co. v.
