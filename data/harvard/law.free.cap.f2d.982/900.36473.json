GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b963-17\">The government brought suit against defendants, Melvin Soil and Leroy Brinkley, seeking to hold them personally liable for fines imposed against their corporation, Clinical Leasing Service, Inc. (\u201cClinical\u201d), for violations of the Federal Controlled Substances Act (\u201cFCSA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 842 et seq. (1988). A jury found Soli and Brinkley liable for the corporation\u2019s fines on the grounds that Clinical was the alter ego of Soli and Brinkley, and that Clinical was used by them to frustrate a legislative purpose. Soil and Brinkley appeal, arguing that the district court improperly instructed the jury and that the district court\u2019s actions and comments denied them a fair trial. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b963-19\">The government originally filed suit against Clinical, seeking fines for registration and recordkeeping violations of the FCSA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 842, et seq. (1988). The district court imposed a $337,000 civil fine on the corporation. Soil and Brinkley made a settlement offer to pay the fine over several years,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the government refused. The government then seized the available assets of Clinical, but these were valued at less than $15,000. Consequently, the government filed suit against Clinical\u2019s only shareholders, Soli and Brinkley, seeking to find them personally liable for the balance of the fines. The government sought to pierce the corporate veil on two theories: (1) alter ego and (2) frustration of a legislative purpose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury found in favor of the government on both theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Soli and Brinkley now challenge the verdict, contending that the district court erred in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-4\">(a) improperly instructing the jury on the alter ego theory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-5\">(b) allowing the government to pierce the corporate veil after Soli and Brinkley had made an offer of settlement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-6\">(c) terminating the direct examination of Soil during trial, and making prejudicial comments during voir dire.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">Soil and Brinkley argue that the district court failed to instruct the jury properly on the Louisiana law<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of piercing the corporate veil under the alter ego theory. We review jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>See Koonce v. Quaker Safety Products &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>798 F.2d 700, 719 (5th Cir.1986) (\u201cThe district judge \u2018has wide discretion to select his own words and to charge in his own style.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Sandidge v. Salen Offshore Drilling Co., </em>764 F.2d 252, 262 (5th Cir.1985))). \u201cIf the jury instructions are \u2018comprehensive, balanced, fundamentally accurate, and not likely to confuse or mislead the jury, the charge will be deemed adequate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Scheib v. Williams-McWilliams Co., </em>628 F.2d 509, 511 (5th Cir.1980)). \u201cThe crucial issue on review is whether the jury had an understanding of the issues and its duty to determine those issues.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">Under Louisiana law, shareholders are generally not held individually responsible for debts of the corporation. <em>Kingsman Enterprises v. Bakersfield Elec. Co., </em>339 So.2d 1280, 1282 (La.App. 1st Cir.1976). However, where the corporation is merely the alter ego of the shareholder, Louisiana courts have ignored the corporate form and have held the individual shareholder or shareholders liable. <em>Id. </em>In applying this alter ego doctrine, Louisiana courts have traditionally focused on the following five elements: (1) commingling of corporate and shareholder funds; (2) failure to follow statutory formalities for incorporation and the transaction of corporate affairs; (3) undercapitalization of the corporation; (4) failure to provide separate bank accounts and bookkeeping records; and (5) failure to hold regular shareholder or director meetings. <em>Id. </em>n. 1; <em>see also Jones v. Briley, </em>593 So.2d 391, 395 (La.App. 1st Cir.1991) (using five-element test); <em>GI\u2019s Club of Slidell, Inc. v. Am. Legion Post # 374, </em>504 So.2d 967, 968 (La.App. 1st Cir.1987) (same); <em>Harris v. Best of Am. Inc., </em>466 So.2d 1309, 1315 (La.App. 1st Cir.) (same), <em>writ denied, </em>470 So.2d 121 (La.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-14\">In charging the jury, the district court included the elements above, but added two more: (a) failure to pay dividends; and (b) withdrawal of corporate funds for the personal use of the stockholders. <em>See </em>Record on Appeal, vol. 7, at 147-48. Soli and Brinkley argue that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>abused its discretion in not strictly adhering to the five elements enumerated in <em>Kingsman. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">First, Soli and Brinkley have not cited, nor has this Court found, a single Louisiana case suggesting that a court is limited to the five factors in <em>Kingsman. </em>Moreover, the court in <em>Kingsman </em>recognized that the five factors it listed are not exclusive. <em>See Kingsman, </em>339 So.2d at 1282 n. 1 (\u201cThese factors may include <em>but are not limited </em>to \u2014 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Second, Louisiana courts have recognized that the additional factors given by the district court are proper criteria for determining shareholder liability under the alter ego theory. <em>See Riggins v. Dixie Shoring Co., Inc., </em>592 So.2d 1282, 1283 (La.1992) (\u201cSome of the many factors which may properly be considered include: ... nonpayment of dividends, ... [and] siphoning of funds of the corporation____\u201d); <em>Rivers v. Schlumberger Well Surveying Corp., </em>389 So.2d 807, 813 (La.App. 3d Cir.1980) (considering the paying of dividends as a factor in deciding whether to pierce the corporate veil); <em>Dillman v. Nobles, </em>351 So.2d 210, 214 (La.App. 4th Cir.1977) (considering the withdrawal of corporate funds for personal use as a factor in deciding whether to pierce the corporate veil). Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s formulation of factors to consider under the alter ego theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Soil and Brinkley also contend that the district court abused its discretion by failing to explain alter ego liability in its charge to the jury. <em>See Baker v. Raymond Int'l, Inc., </em>656 F.2d 173, 180 (5th Cir.1981) (holding that it is reversible error for a district court to fail to \u201cpresent adequately and in context the factors that might warrant the imposition of [alter ego] liability\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 983, 102 5.Ct. 2256, 72 L.Ed.2d 861 (1982). After reviewing the record, we find that the district court adhered to <em>Baker\u2019s </em>prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">In <em>Baker, </em>we first noted that a court should explain \u201cat least the rudiments of limited liability.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>656 F.2d at 180. For example, we stated that a court should instruct a jury that shareholders are \u201cimmune from liability for its debts in the absence of ... exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court fulfilled this requirement by stating that \u201cas a general rule, shareholders are not responsible for debts of the corporation____ However, under certain circumstances ... shareholders become liable individually for corporate debts.\u201d Record on Appeal, vol. 7, at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-18\">Second, we stated that a court should describe to the jury the \u201cdegree of control that must be found to establish that an ostensibly separate corporation is a mere instrumentality [i.e., alter ego].\u201d <em>Baker, </em>656 F.2d at 180. For example, in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship, we noted that a court should instruct the jury that to hold the dominant party liable, \u201cthe jury must find that this control \u2018amounts to total domination of the subservient corporation, to the extent that the subservient corporation manifests no separate corporate interests of its own.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 181 (quoting <em>Krivo Indus. Supply Co. v. National Distillers &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>483 F.2d 1098, 1106 (5th Cir.1973)). The district court also met this requirement by instructing the jury that to find Soli and Brinkley liable, it had to find them to be \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from the corporation. <em>See </em>Record on Appeal, vol. 7, at 146-47.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-19\">Third, we indicated in <em>Baker </em>that a court should instruct the jury to weigh all the factors given, but not consider any one to be dispositive. <em>Baker, </em>656 F.2d at 181. The district court so advised the jury by stating that \u201c[n]o one factor determines whether the corporate form should be disregarded. I have given you seven of them. No one determines by itself whether you should disregard the corporate form.\u201d Record on Appeal, vol. 7, at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>Lastly, we stated that a court should \u201celaborate[] the significance of [a specific] factor\u201d where warranted by the facts. <em>Baker, </em>656 F.2d at 181. Soil and Brinkley contend that the district court erred in not elaborating on the element of undercapitalization.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, they argue that the district court should have instructed the jury that continuous corporate operations for a reasonable period of time are per se indicative of adequate capitalization. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">In <em>Matter of Multiponics, Inc., </em>622 F.2d 709, 717 (5th Cir.1980), we stated that \u201cthe concept of undercapitalization has never been precisely defined.\u201d \u201c[T]his inquiry is highly factual and may vary substantially with the industry, size of the debt, account methods employed, and like factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the law does not provide that sustained corporate operations preclude a finding of undercapitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Furthermore, \u201c[t]he trial court has no duty to give the jury an exegesis of legal principles that might enable a plaintiff to recover.\u201d <em>Laird v. Shell Oil Co., </em>770 F.2d 508, 510 (5th Cir.1985); <em>see United States v. Jon-T Chemicals, Inc., </em>768 F.2d 686, 694 n. 8 (5th Cir.1985) (\u201cWe do not require a district court [in instructing a jury on alter ego liability] to list and expressly consider every factor that might be relevant to an ultimate factual issue. This would convert even a simple issue into a lengthy ordeal and would virtually ensure that a district judge would hear only a handful of case in his or her lifetime.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1014, 106 S.Ct. 1194, 89 L.Ed.2d 309 (1986). Because the jury instructions were fundamentally accurate, and gave the jury a basic understanding of the issues, we find no abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">Soll and Brinkley next argue that the district court erred by not finding that the government was equitably estopped from pursuing its suit. They specifically contend that it was inequitable for the government, on the one hand, to reject their settlement offer and oppose Clinical's bankruptcy petition,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and on the other hand, to initiate suit against them in hopes of finding them personally liable. We strongly disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">In support of their novel proposition\u2014 that as a prerequisite to any suit piercing the corporate veil, a plaintiff (1) must accept any settlement offer submitted by shareholders,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and (2) must not oppose the corporation\u2019s bad faith resort to the bankruptcy laws <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 Soil and Brinkley cite a single case which is irrelevant to this issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>Rather than applying equitable estoppel to prevent suits against individual shareholders, some courts have used equitable estoppel to allow plaintiffs to pierce the corporate veil. <em>See, e.g., Matter of Kaiser, </em>791 F.2d 73, 75 (7th Cir.) (\u201cThe rules under which the corporate veil may be pierced go-by many names, ... such as alter ego and <em>equitable estoppel.\" </em>(emphasis added)), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1011, 107 S.Ct. 655, 93 L.Ed.2d 710 (1986). Therefore, we find no error in the district court\u2019s refusal to apply equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Lastly, Soll and Brinkley claim that they were denied a fair trial. During trial, the district court terminated Soil\u2019s direct examination because of leading questions. During voir dire, the district court warned the jury on several occasions to disregard the fact that Soil and Brinkley operated an abortion clinic. Soil and Brinkley contend that the district court (a) abused its discretion by cutting off Soil\u2019s direct examination, and (b) erred because its warnings \u201cunduly sensitized\u201d the jury to the volatile issue of abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">\u201cThe conduct of a fair trial is vested in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Cranberg v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>756 F.2d 382, 391 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 850, 106 S.Ct. 148, 88 L.Ed.2d 122 (1985). \u201cOn review, this conduct will be measured against a standard of fairness and impartiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Soil and Brinkley contend that the district court abused its discretion in terminating Soil\u2019s direct testimony \u201cwithout any explanation.\u201d Brief for Soll at 23. We disagree. When the district court terminated Soil\u2019s direct testimony, the court sustained a specific objection by government\u2019s counsel to leading questions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, we find that the district court adequately explained its actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-15\">In addition, the exclusion of Soil\u2019s direct testimony was within the sound discretion granted the district court by Fed.R.Evid. 611.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The record indicates that Soil\u2019s counsel attempted to elicit direct testimony from. Soil through leading questions. <em>See </em>Record on Appeal, vol. 6, at 197, 200. A few minutes before terminating direct testimony, the district court specifically warned Soil\u2019s attorney not to lead the witness. <em>See id. </em>at 197. The record further indicates that the district court warned Soli\u2019s attorney about leading questions on at least seven previous occasions. <em>See id. </em>at 16-17, 32, 46, 48, 135, 147, 186. Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s termination of Soil\u2019s direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-16\">Soll and Brinkley further allege that the district court\u2019s warnings concerning abortion denied them a fair trial. Soil and Brinkley did not object to these comments, and therefore, we review this aspect of the district court's conduct for plain error. <em>See Miles v. Olin Corp., </em>922 F.2d 1221, 1228 (5th Cir.1991) (\u201cBecause [appellant] did not object to the district court\u2019s comments in this case, we review only for plain error.\u201d). \u201cOnly an error so fundamental that it generates a miscarriage of justice rises to the level of \u2018plain error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kuehne &amp; Nagel (AG &amp; CO) v. Geosource, Inc., </em>874 F.2d 283, 292 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>Soli and Brinkley seem to argue that in warning the jury repeatedly not to consider abortion,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the district court somehow \u201cplanted\u201d abortion as a prejudicial factor in the minds of the jury. However, the record indicates that Soil\u2019s own attorney repeatedly referred to abortion in addressing the jury during his opening statement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, rather than create prejudice, the district court\u2019s admonitions attempted to rectify the prejudice caused by Soil and Brinkley\u2019s own counsel.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Furthermore, it would be nonsensical to find that the district court erred in giving cautionary instructions where Soli and Brinkley themselves requested extensive voir dire on abortion. See Record on Appeal, vol. 4, at 1031, 1033. Thus, we do not find the district court\u2019s cautionary instructions so prejudicial as to constitute error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-12\">.

In their reply brief, Soli and Brinkley also challenge the verdict for: (a) insufficient evidence of neglect of corporate formalities; (b) insufficient evidence of undercapitalization; and (c) the unconstitutional application of the \"frustration of legislative purpose\" theory for corporate disregard. However, we will not consider these arguments on appeal as they were not raised in the initial brief. <em>See Peteet v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>868 F.2d 1428, 1437 (5th Cir.) (\"We may not review arguments raised for the first time in the appellant\u2019s reply brief.\u2019\u2019), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 935, 110 S.Ct. 328, 107 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b964-16\">. Though Clinical was incorporated in Delaware, with Louisiana as its principal place of business, the parties agree, <em>see </em>Brief for Soli at 9-10; Brief for United States at 30, that Louisiana law governs whether Soil and Brinkley should be held personally liable for Clinical\u2019s debts. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) Conflicts of Law \u00a7 306 (1971) (\"The obligations owed by a majority shareholder to the corporation ... will be determined by the local law of the state of incorporation, <em>except ... </em>where, with respect to the particular issue, <em>some other state has a more significant </em>relationship____\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b965-10\">.

Concerning this element, the district court stated \"[w]hat is adequate capitalization depends upon the nature of the business of the corporation.\u201d Record on Appeal, vol. 7, at 147.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b966-7\">. Soli and Brinkley also contend that the district court erred in submitting the \u201cfrustration of legislative purpose\u201d theory to the jury without evidence that the stockholders were personally involved in the FCSA violations. However, we need not reach this issue on appeal. The jury was asked separate interrogatories about the traditional alter ego theory and the frustration of legislative purpose theory, and answered <em>both </em>inquiries against the stockholders. <em>See </em>Record on Appeal, vol. 4, at 990. Because the district court\u2019s instructions on alter ego liability were proper, and Soli and Brinkley have not otherwise disputed their liability under this theory, judgment for the government was justified even without considering the frustration of legislative purpose question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b966-8\">. As the government proceeded to collect the fine for violating the FCSA, Clinical filed a petition for bankruptcy. The government moved to dismiss the petition, alleging that (1) the petition was filed in bad faith; and (2) Clinical was not a potentially viable business capable of rehabilitation. The bankruptcy court dismissed Clinical\u2019s petition, finding both of these arguments applicable. <em>See </em>Government Exhibit 21, <em>included in </em>Government Record Excerpts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b966-16\">.
