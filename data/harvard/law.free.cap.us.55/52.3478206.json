S. Fowler &amp; Co.; and the objection was sustained, and the said bill excluded; to whieh the defendant, by his counsel, excepted. This was all the evidence offered in the case, and thereupon the court charged the jury \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">That the deed from Ticknor to Day, of April 28th, 1840, was, upon its face, in connection with the answers of Ticknor and Day, fraudulent as to creditors, and void; to which, the defend^ ant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">The court further qharged, that the title of Dargan, derived from the marshal\u2019s sale, under the judgment of C.

The head-notes are: \u201c When property is rightfully in the hands of a receiver, it is in the custody of the court, and cannot be dis-strained upon - for rent without permission of the court by whom the receiver was appointed; and any person who. takes the property out of the possession of the receiver .without such permission, after he .has notice, of the character in which possession is holden, is guilty of a contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-5\">The sam\u00e9 prin\u00e9iples are applicable to any interference with-the possession of a receiver, sequestrator, committee, or custodee, who holds the property as the officer of the Court of Chancery; as his possession is the possession of the court itself.

But the purchaser cannot disturb the possession of the receiver, when he obtains his conveyance from the sheriff, without the permission of the court. 9 Paige, 373.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-7\">This subject is discussed at large in a late case before Lord \u2022 Truro, reported in 3 Gordon &amp; Macnaghten It. 104, from which we extract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-8\">\u201c I am of opinion, that it is not competent for any one to interfere with the possession of a receiver, or to disobey an injunction or any other order of the court, on the ground that such orders were im providently made. .Parties must take a proper course to question their validity;' but Avhile they exist they must be.obeyed. I consider the rule to.be of such importance to the interests and safety of the public, and to the due administration of justice,'that it ought on all occasions to be inflexibly maintained.' I do not see how the court can expect its officers to do their duty, if they do it under the peril of resistance, and of that resistance being justified on grounds tending to\u2019 the impeachment of the order .under which they are acting. In the present case, it would have been perfectly open to the plaintiffs in the execution to have applied to this court, to be heard <em>pro interesse suo, </em>or to naive been heard on a summary application for leave to levy under their execution, notwithstanding the posssesion of the;receiver. There is no instance in which justice may not be readily obtained by persons who are supposed to have their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>rights interfered with by an order or process issued by this court. Thus, I find, in one case, where a party wished to distrain for rent on property in the possession of a receiver, that the court, being satisfied that the legal right of distress was paramount to' the title of the party for whose benefit the receiver was appointed, allowed the (distress to be made. In another .case, where property liable to distress had been sold, and the receiver had received the proceeds and paid them into court, the landlord having claimed a right to distrain while the receiver was in possession, this court ordered the receiver to pay out of.those prodeeds, to the landlord, the rents that were due to him, the receiver being in possession for the benefit of the tenant for life, who was liable for the payment of that rent which was -so sought to be distrained for on the property in.the possession of the receiver. I apprehend, then, it may be taken as a rule that, though this court may havo issued a process, or have made an order which may interfere with th*e supposed rights and interests of other .parties, not parties to the cause, it is always competent; for such parties to make an application to the coart for relief; and it is not'to be presumed or doubted, but that justice will be duly administered to them, on that application.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b73-5\">Mr. Justice NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AqK\">delivered'the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">This is a writ of error to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The suit in the cour-t below was an action of ejectment against Wiswali to recover the possession of a lot of land situated in the city of Mobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The lessors of the plaintiff gave in evidence two judgments' against John Ticknor \u2014 one in favor of Fowler &amp; Co. for $4,491, rendered 28th December, 1840 \u2014 the other in favor of Crouch &amp; Sneed for $7,167.25, rendered 31st December of the same year, each of them in the Circuit Court of the United States.

Dargan under the marshal\u2019s sale upon the two judgments was superior to that of the defendant under the sale upon the decree in chancery, and directed a verdict for the plaintiff. And further, that the decree in chancery on the petition of Dargan was not'conclusive upon the rights of the parties \u2014 that he was not .bound'to go into that court for relief, as his remedy was at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The case is now before us on exceptions to this charge.'</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">It was made a question, on the argument, whether or not the lien of the judgments, under which the marshal\u2019s sale took place, had not been postponed to that of Wiswall, on account of laches in the enforcement of them by execution. But in the view we have taken of the case, the validity pf the liens, at\"'the time of sale, will be conceded, without, however, intending' to express any opinion upon the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Wiswall filed his bill in chancery against Ticknor and Day to set aside the fraudulent conveyance to the latter, and have the property applied to the satisfaction of his judgment, on the 7th February j 1843. In that bill he prayed for a sale of the .real estate, and for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of it with other assets of the judgment debtor; and, also, for an injunction. A temporary injunction -was granted. . On the coming in of the answers of the defendants, the complainant, on the 11th April .of the same year, moved for the. appointment of a receiver, and the defendants, at the same time, moved to dissolve the injunction. The court denied the motion to appoint the receiver, and dissolved the injunction,- expressing the opinion that tlie answers so far explained the circumstances undqr which the deed to Day was giyen, as to remove the charge of fraud against it. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, and, on the 10th April, 1844, that court reversed the order of the court below, and remanded the cause for further proceedings : and on the 15th April, 1845, the Chancellor made a decree, that the deed was fraudulent and void, as against the complainant, and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>ferred the case to a master, to take, and state the- account between the parties. He further ordered and decreed that a receiver should be appointed to fake possession of all the property embraced in the fraudulent conveyance, and, particularly, that possession should be delivered to him of the premises in question; and further, that the receiver, under the direction of the master, should sell the same and apply the proceeds-to the payment of the complainant\u2019s judgment, with costs, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The receiver was appointed on the 27th June, 1845, and on the same day Ticknor, who was in possession of the premises, attorned to him, who held possession until the sale was made in pursuance of the decree. It will be recollected' that the execution on the judgment in favor' of Crouch &amp; Sneed, was issued, and levied on the 24th February,-1845; and on that in favor of Fowler &amp;.Co. 7th April of the same year, and that the sale took place under which the lessors of the plaintiff claim, 7th July, 1845.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">At the time, therefore, of this sale, the receiver was in the possession of the premises, under the deereb of the Court of Chancery \u2014 in other words, the possession and custody of them were in the Court of Chancery itself, (as the court is deemed the landlord,) to abide the final decree to be thereafter rendered .in the suit pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The. appointment of a receiver is a matter resting in the discretion of the court; and, as a general rule, in making the appointment on behalf of a complainant seeking to enforce an equitable claim, or a claim which is the subject of equitable jurisdiction, against real estate, it will take care not to interfere with the rights of a person holding a prior legal interest \u2019in the property.. l'hus, where there is a prior mortgagee having the legal estate, the court will not, by the appointment of a receiver, deprive him of his right to the possession ; but, at the same\u201d time, it will not permit him to object to the appointment\u2019by any act short of a personal assertion of his legal rights,, and the taking of possession himself. 1 J. &amp; <em>W. </em>648; 2 Swanst. 108, 137; 3 Id., 112, n. 115; 3 Daniel\u2019s Pr. 1950, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">If the person holding the legal interest, is not in possession, the equitable claimant against the property is entitled to the interference of the. court, not only for the purpose of preserving it from. waste, but for the purpose' of obtaining thb rents and profits' accruing, as a fund in court tp abide the result of- the litigation. \u25a0 For until the person holding the legal interest takes possession, or asserts his right to the possession, the accruing rents'and profits present a question simply between the parties to the litigation. And the court will also'\u00e1ppoint a receiver, even against a party having possession under a'legal title, if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>is satisfied such party has wrongfully obtained that interest in the property. Thus, where fraud can be proved, and immediate danger is likely to result, if possession, pending the litigation, should not be taken by the court in the mean time. 13 Ves. 105; 16 Id. 59; 3 Daniel\u2019s Pr. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The effect of the appointment is not to oust any party of his right to the possession of the property, but merely to retain.it for the benefit of the party who may ultimately appear to be \u2022 entitled to it; and when the party entitled to the estate has been ascertained, the receiver will be considered his receiver, (T. &amp; R. 345; Daniel\u2019s Pr. 1982); and the master will usually be directed to inquire what encumbrances there'are affecting the estate, and into the priorities respectively. 10 J. R. 521, Codwise <em>v. </em>Gelston.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">When a receiver has been appointed, his possession is- that' of the court, and any attempt to\u2019 disturb it, without the leave of the court first obtained, will be a contempt on the part of the person making it. This was held in Angel <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 Ves. 335, both with respect to receivers a.hd sequestrators. When, therefore, a party is prejudiced by having a receiver put in his way, the course has either been to give him leave to bring an ejectment, or to permit him to be examined <em>pro interesse suo. </em>1 J. &amp; W. 176, Brooks <em>v. </em>Greathed; 3 Daniel\u2019s Pr. 1984; And the doctrine that a receiver is not to be disturbed, extends even to cases in which he has been appointed expressly, without. prejudice to the rights of persons having prior legal or equitable interests. And the individuals having such prior interests must, if they desire to avail themselves of them, apply to the court either for liberty to bring ejectment, or ta be examined <em>pro interesse suo; </em>and this, though their right to the possession is clear. Cox, 422; 6 Ves. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The proper course to be pursued, says Mr. Daniel, in his valuable treatise on Pleading and Practice in Chancery, by any person who claims title' to an estate or other property sequestered, whether by. mortgage or judgment, lease or otherwise, or who has a title paramount to.the sequestration, is to apply to the court to direct the plaintiff to exhibit- interrogatories before one of the masters, in order that the party applying may be examined as .to his title to the estate. An examination of this :sort is called an examination <em>pro interesse </em>suo, and an order for such examination may be obtained by a party interested, as' well where the property consists of goods and chattels, or personalty, .as where it is real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">And the mode of proceeding is the same m the case of the receiver. 6 Ves. 287; 9 Id. 336; 1 J. &amp; W. 178; 3 Daniel\u2019s Pr; 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>A party, therefore, holding a judgment which is a prior lien upon the property, the same as a mortgagee, if desirous of enforcing it against the estate after it has been taken into the care and custody of the court, to abide the final determination of the litigation, and pending that litigation, must first obtain leave of the court for this purpose. The court will direct a master to inquire into the circumstances, whether it is an existing unsatisfied demand, or as to the priority of the lien, &amp;c., and take care that the fund be applied accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"AyO\">Chancellor Kent, in delivering the opinion of'-the' court in Codwise. <em>v. </em>Gelston, as Chief Justice, observed, <em>u </em>that if- a* fund for the- payment of $ebts be created under an order or decree in chancery, and the creditors come in to avail themselves of it, the rule of equity then is, that they shall be \u00a3&gt;aid <em>in pari passu, </em>or upon a footing of equality. But when the law giw ' a priority, equity will not destroy' it,, and especially -vfrhere legal assets are created by statute, as in case of a judgment lien, they remain so, though the creditors be obliged to go into equity for assistance. The legal priority will be protected and preserved in chancery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The settled rule, also, appears to be, that where the subject-matter of the suit in equity is real estate, and which is taken into the possession of the court pending the litigation, by the appointment of a receiver, or by sequestration, the titl\u00e9 is bound from the filing of the bill; -and any purchaser, <em>pendente lit\u00e9, </em>even if for a valuable consideration, conies in at his peril. 3 Swanst. 278, n., 298, n.; 2 Daniel\u2019s Pr. 1267; 6 Ves. 287; <em>9 </em>Id. 336; 1 J. &amp; W. 178; 3 Daniel\u2019s Pr. 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">It has been argued, that a sale of the premises oh execution and purchase, occasioned.no interference with tne- possession of the receiver, and hence no contempt of the authority of the court, and that the sale therefore, in such a case, should be upheld. But, conceding the\u2019 proceedings did not disturb the possession of the receiver, the argument does not rheet. the objection. The property is a fund in court, to abide the event of the litigation, and to be applied to the payment of the judgment creditor, who has filed his bill' to remove impediments'-in the way of his execution. If he has succeeded in establishing \u2022his right to the application \"of any portion of the fund, it is the duty of the court to. see that such application is made. And, in order to effect this, the court must administer, it independently of any rights acquired by third persons, pending the litigation. Otherwise, the whole fund may have passed out of its hands before the final decree, and the litigation become fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">It is true, in administering the fund\u2019, the court will take care that'the rights of prior liens or encumbrances shall not be \u2019 de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>stroyed; and will- adopt the proper measures;by reference to the master or otherwise, to ascertain them, and bring them before it. Unless the court be permitted to retain the possession of the fund, thus to administer it, how can it ascertain the interest in the same to which the prosecuting judgment creditor is entitled, and apply it upon his demand ?</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">There can be no difficulty in ascertaining the prior liens and encumbrances, as all of them, are matters of record. Several of the judgment creditors came in, in this case, and received their share in the distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">These two .judgment creditors had notice of the suit before the sale, and might. have ' made themselves -parties to it, and claimed application of the fund according to the priority of their liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">They were also before the court, pending the litigation, on the petition of Dargan, who had purchased for their benefit, to have the possession of the receiver delivered up to the purchaser. There is no pretence, therefore, for saying that they have not had notice of the proceedings in .th\u00e9 equity suit. \u2022 The prayer of the petition was denied, among other grounds, because their appropriate remedy was a motion to the court, founded on their judgments to have the proceeds of the sale under the decree .applied to them according to priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">We agree, that the person holding the prior legal lien or encumbrance, must have notice, and an opportunity to come in and claim his prior right to the property or interest in the fund before his legal.right can be affected; and the proper way is by summons or notice upon the order or direction of the court-</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">This notice can be readily given on the report of tne master, of the prior liens or encumbrances resting upon the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">But it is-not necessary to go this length in the case before us, as it is sufficient to say, that the sale under the judgment; pending the equity-suit, and while the court was in possession of the estate .without the leave of the court, was illegal and void. We.do not doubt but that it would be compfetent for the court,'in case the judgment creditor holding the prior lien had hot come in and claimed his interest in the equity suit, to decree a sale in the final disposition of the fund subject to-bis judgment. The purchaser would then be bound to pay it off.' But .this disposition Of the legal prior encumbrance is a very different matter, and comes .to. a v\u00e9ry different result, from that of permitting the- enforcement of.it, <em>pendente </em>Ute, -without the leave of the court. The.rights of the several claimants to the estate or fund is then settled, and the purchase under the decree can be made, with-a full knowledge of the cohdition of the. titlg, or charges- to which it -may be subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Neither do we doubt but that it is competent, and might, in some cases, be fit and proper for the court, where the property in dispute is ample, and the litigation protracted, to permit the execution to issue, and compel the prosecuting creditor to pay off the judgment. 3 Beav. 428. But it is manifest that these proceedings, on behalf of the prior encumbrancer, should be under the control of the discretion of the court, as the condition of the title to the property may frequently be so complicated and embarrassed, that unless the sale was withheld until the title was cleared up by the judgment of the court, great sacrifice must necessarily ensue to the parties interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">This case affords an apt illustration of the remark. The marshal\u2019s sale was made under an arrangement that no rnmiey was to be paid by the purchaser, unless he succeeded in obtaining a title to the property under it. It is' obvious, therefore, if the purchase had been unconditional, and at the risk of the purchaser, it must have been bid off for a nominal consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">As we have already said, it is sufficient, for the disposition of this case, to hold, that while'the estate is in the custody of the court, as a fund to abide the result of a suit pending, no sale of the property can take place either on execution or otherwise, without the leave of the court for that purpose. And upon this ground, we hold that the sale by the marshal on the two judgments was illegal and void, and passed no, title to the purchaser;</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">.We are, also, inclined to think, that the question of title to the property under the marshal\u2019s sale is concluded between these parties by the judgment of the court in the proceedings on the petition by the- purchaser for the removal of the receiver,- and to be let into the possession. This, we have seen, is the appropriate. remedy on behalf of a person claiming a paramount legal right to an estate which has been brought into the possession and safe keeping of the Court of Chancery, pending the litiga-, tion in resp\u00e9ct to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">This proceeding Was explained by Lord Eldon in Angel <em>v. </em>Smith, (9 Ves. 335),.speaking of the rule in respect to sequestrators, and which he held was equally applicable in the case of. receivers. \u201c Where sequestrators,\u201d he observed, <em>\u201c </em>are in possession under the process of the court, their possession is not-to be disturbed, even by a n adverse title, without leave: upon .this principle,-that the possession of the sequestrators is the possession of the court, and the court being competent to examine the title, will not permit itself to be made a suitor in a court of law, but Will itself examin\u00e9 the title. And the mode is, by permitting the party to come in to be examined <em>pro, interesse suo ; </em>the practice being, to go before the master to state his title, and there is the; judgment of the master, and afterwards, if neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>sary, of the court upon it. See also 10 Beav. 318; <em>2 </em>Daniel\u2019s Pr. 1271; 2 Mad. 21; 1 P. Wms. 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">An appeal to the House of Lords will lie from the order or decree of the Chancellor upon exceptions to the master\u2019s report in the matter. 2 Daniel\u2019s Pr. 1273; 3 Id. 1633, 1634.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In the petition to the Chancellor in the case before us, the purchaser set out his title at large under the marshal\u2019s- sale, and. claimed the possession of the property by virtue of* his title, that the receiver might be removed, and the possession delivered to the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The answer of \u201cWiswall set up his right to the property under the decree in the suit against Ticknor and Day.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The right of the petitioner, therefore, under his title to the possession of the property as against the right of Wiswall under the proceedings in equity and the. decree in his favor, would seem to be a question directly involved. The court so understood the issue and passed upon it, holding, as we hold in this case, that the sale was illegal and void, having been made while the estate was in the possession and safe keeping of the Court of Chancery. From this decision -an appeal wap taken to the \u201cSupreme Court, where \u201c'he order or decree of the court below was affirmed. 11 Ala. R. 938; Dargan <em>v. </em>Waring and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The question is one depending very much upon the local law of Alabama, and the judgment, therefore, in the matter, by the. highest court of the State, is entitled to the highest respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">For these reasons we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below was erroneous and must be reversed, and' the case remitted for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">This cause c\"ame on to be heard on tne transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Alabama, and was argued by counsel. On consideration wh\u00e9reof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed with costs, and that this cause be, and the same is. hereby, remanded to the said Circuit Court for further proceedings to be had therein, in conformity to the opinion of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
