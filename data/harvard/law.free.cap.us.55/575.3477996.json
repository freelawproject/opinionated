The following extract from it will be sufficient:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-13\">\u201c If, in your letter of August 10, 1847, you mean by the \u2018 office \u2019 yourself, or the author of the letters which I have received from you, you prescribe two conditions in said letter which are inconsistent, viz., that my. letters to you, or to the author-of those letters subscribed by you, should-be both respectful and proper. It is improper to treat a person respectfully while it is known that he is unworthy of respect; theiefore, it is impossible to comply with your prescriptions. The claim of unworthy office-holders to. have people, as they say, respect the,offices they hold, while it is known that the incumbents are unworthy of respect, is absurd. Do you mean, when you urge people to respect \u2018 the office,\u2019 to have them respect you merely because you hold the office, while it is known that you are unworthy of respect ? This is a free country! \u201d &amp;c. &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-14\">On the same day Mr. Boyden wrote to Mr. Greenough, in Washington, as follows: \u2022'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-15\">Boston, Mass., December 14,1847.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A86\">Sir, \u2014 Your letter of the 23d ult. was duly received.

J. Greenough, by-authority of-the plaintiff, called at the Patent-Office-to obtain'for him copies-of three \" several patents, which had theretofore been issued,by- said.office for \u201c Turbines\u201d or \u201c water-wheels;\u201d that he - was referred by the clyi;k,.to- whom he applied, to the defendant, and informed defendant, that he had been requested by the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>plaintiff to obtain for him copies of those patents, arid defendant refused, saying he would not have any thing to. do with Mr. Boyden, directly or indirectly, or words to that effect; and, upon his cross-examination, witness stated, that he asked Mr. Burke to give him in writing his reasons for so refusing, which .he \u25a0then and there promised to do ; and some days after the witness, received a letter from the defendant containing Those reasons,\u25a0which letter he had transmitted to the plaintiff.; and then, upon cross-examination, the counsel for' the defendant called upon the plaintiff to produce said letter, and the plaintiff, admitting he had said letter then in court, refuses to produce th\u00e9 same; on the ground that the said letter, if produced, would not be evidence ; but the court, overruling the objection of the defendant, ordered the same to be produced, and thereupon the said letter was produced by the plaintiff; and the defendant, by his counsel, offers to read the same in evidence, and the plaintiff, by his counsel, objects thereto, but the court permits the same to be. read in evidence, and it is read accordingly, as follows; and the plaintiff, by his counsel, excepts thereto, &amp;c. &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-5\">\n<em>Third Exception.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-6\">And here the. plaintiff rested; and thereupon the defendant, offered to read, in evidence, a letter addressed to him by the plaintiff, dated 14th December, 1847, and also a letter from plaintiff to J. j. Greenough, which it is admitted is the same letter referred to in the testimony of said Greenough, as- eonr taining th\u00e9- authority under which he applied for the copies of patents, as testified by him in his examination by the plain-' tiff, which letter bears date -the 14th December, 1847, to the admissibility of which said letters, or either of them, as evidence in, this cause, the plaintiff, by his counsel, objects, arid the' court overrules the said objection, and permits both of said letters to be read in evidence; and the handwriting of the plaintiff thereto being adm\u00edttedythe same are r\u00e9ad accordingly, and the plaintiff, by his counsel, excepts thereto, &amp;c. &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-7\">\n<em>Fourth Exception.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-8\">And thereupon, and upon th\u00e9 whole evidence aforesaid,, the defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury that upon the evid\u00e9nce aforesaid, if the same is believed by the jury, the plain- \u2022 tiff is not entitled to recover in this action; which instruction the court gave, and the plaintiff, by his counsel, excepts thereto, &amp;c. &amp;e.. . '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-9\">Upon these exceptions, the case came up' to this court, and was argued by <em>Mr. </em>Bradley, for the plaintiff in error, and <em>Mr. Coze, </em>for the defendant in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>Mr. Bradley </em>contended that the Circuit' Court erred in each one of the above rulings.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-5\"><em>First., </em>The defendant was, by law, bound to give-the cppies asked for, if they could be made consistently with the public interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-6\">1. The Patent Office is for certain purposes an office of public record, in like manner as the office in which the titles to real property are recorded:</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-7\">From the very name; tne object; the nature of the contract between the government and the patentee; the effect of the granting the patent as to the right granted; and the notice implied; the manner in which the title is secured, and by which a right under it is, to be transferred; the necessity to prevent litigation; to prevent conflicts; to avoid the expenditure of time and money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-8\">2. For like reasons, if no provision were made by law for copies, still the keepers of those records should be bound to ' give them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-9\">3. The original statute, and each successive one, made provision for such copies. Act 10th April, 1790, 1 Stat. at Large, 109, \u00a7 1, 2, 3; Act 21st February, 1793, Id. 318, \u00a7 1, 4, 11; Act 4th July, 1836, 5 Stat. at Large, 118, \u00a7 4, 5, 11; Act 3d March, 1837, Id. 191, \u00a7 1, 2, 12; Act 3d March, 1839, Id. 353, \u00a7 2, 8; Act 29th August, 1842, Id. 542, \u00a7 2, 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-10\">The law, in terms, provides copies in cases in which they are to be used as evidence, and makes them evidence. It dq,es not stop here, but directs copies of the records, drawing, and other papers deposited in the office, to be given to any person making application for them, on their, paying certain fees therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-11\">It requires a record of the claim, specification, drawings, the patent therefor, and the assignment thereof. It imposes heavy penalties upon an infringement of the patent, and makes these records notice of the particulars of the right granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-12\">Its design, in authorizing copies to every person applying for them, is obvious; that is, protection against the danger of incurring these penalties. The reason for requiring copies in such cases, is obviously the same as that which requires them to be .given in cases of contest. Prevention is often better than redress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-13\"><em>Second. </em>The duty was purely ministerial, involving no discretion; and it will.be further contended \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-14\">. 1. The general proposition, that, for a refusal by a public officer to do a mere ministerial act, to the injury of another\u2019s right, an action will lie.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-15\">2. The injury is. to be compensated in damages, and if the officer has acted in good faith, the measure of damages is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>actual injury sustained; if he has acted wilfully, maliciously, corruptly, or by color of his office, with intent to injure, \u2019 the party injured will be entitled to recover such damages as the jury may see fit to give.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-5\">As to the first branch o\u00a3 this second point, Tracy &amp; Ballestier <em>v. </em>Swartwout, 10 Pet. 80; 9 How. 259.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">As to the second branch, Huckle <em>v. </em>Money, <em>2 </em>Wils. 205; Beardmore <em>v. </em>Carrington, Id. 244; Dinsman <em>v. </em>Wilkes, 12 How. 401-406; Day <em>v. </em>Woodworth, 13 How. 371.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-7\"><em>Third. </em>Evidence is admissible, in this last case, to show that the officer knew the nature of the injury he was inflicting, and therefore it was competent for the plaintiff to give, in evidence \u2022the facts stated in plaintiff\u2019s bill of exceptions, hot as indicating a measure of damages,'but to give the jury some knowledge pf the nature, character, and degree of the injury,1 as a guide in forming an estimate of the extent to which they might rightfully go in inflicting punitive as well as compensatory damages. Marest <em>v. </em>Harvey, 5 Taunt. 442; Woert <em>v. </em>Jenkins, 14 Johns. 352; Whipple <em>v. </em>Walpole, 10 N. H. Rep. 130 ; Wallace, Jr. R. 164; and cases under second point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-8\"><em>Fourth. </em>The letter written by the defendant to Mr. Greenough, set out in the 2d bill of exceptions, was not evidence for any purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-9\">1. Mr. Greenough had no authority to require it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-10\">2. It was but an amplification of his first refusal, and not explanatory of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-11\">3. It was the party\u2019s own letter, offered in evidence by himself, not originally called for by plaintiff, and not in any manner admitted or acquiesced in by him. Farlie <em>v. </em>Denton, 3 C. &amp; P. 103; 14 E. C. L. R. 227, 228; Healey <em>v. </em>Thatcher, 8 C. &amp; P. 338; 34 E. C. L. R. 442; Whifford <em>v. </em>Buckmeyer &amp; Adams, 1 Gill, 127, 140; Van Buren <em>v. </em>Digges, 11 How. 461, 477; Towle <em>v. </em>Stevenson, 1 Johns. Ca. 112; Champlin <em>v. </em>Tilley, 3 Day, 306; Antoine <em>v. </em>Coit, 2 Hall, N. Y. 40, 46, 47.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-12\"><em>Fifth. </em>The letter to the defendant, set out in the 3d bill of exceptions, was not evidence for the defendant for any purpose. The letter from the plaintiff to Mr. Greenough was admissible to show his authority from the plaintiff, and shows conclusively that, he had no authority to ask for or to receive defendant\u2019s written statement, set out in the 2d exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-13\">. But the letter written by plaintiff to defendant, on the 14th December, 184.7, was not evidence in mitigation of his refusal on the 22d December, 1847, or on the 2d January, 1848; .and it cpuld have been admissible for no other purpose.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-14\">That letter would have reached here on. the 18th December, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>1847, at furthest, b.y due course of mail, and the defendant had abundant time to get cool before the <em>22d </em>of that month.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-5\">The refusals were both given deliberately, wilfully, with the intent to punish, that is, to injure the plaintiff, and the malice is. so.much the greater.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-6\"><em>Mr. Coze, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAt\">made the following points:</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-7\">1. That the Circuit Court ruled according to law on all the points raised in the bills of exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-8\"><em>2. </em>That the action is founded upon a misconception of the 4th section of the act of Congress of July 4th, 1836.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azd\">3. That if the plaintiff\u2019s case is embraced by that section, the evidence in the record furnishes a complete justification of the acts of defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-11\">4. That the declaration sets forth no legal cause of action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b594-12\">Mr. Justice GRIER,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai4\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">The bills of exception, taken by the plaintiff to the rejection and admission of testimony on the trial, have not been supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">The declaration charges, that the defendant, Burke, was Commissioner of Patents, and as such was bound to grant to. applicants therefor, copies of patents, &amp;c., on payment of fees. That the plaintiff tendered the customary fees and demanded copies of certain patents, which defendant refused to give him, to the damage of plaintiff, $10,000, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">As no special damage is alleged, the court very properly, refuse to receive evidence tending to prove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">A demand for certain copies was made through the agency of Mr.- Greenough, but accompanied with a letter from plaintiff to defendant, requesting him to deliver the copies to Mr. Greenough. This letter, with-the answer of defendant thereto, was properly received as part of the <em>res gestee, </em>or as a conversation between the parties, reduced to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-17\">A bill of exceptions .was also taken to the charge of the court, who instructed the jury, <em>\u201c </em>that, upon the evidence before them, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-18\">(A.s the plaintiff had shown a demand of the copies, with tender of fees, and a refusal of defendant, be had made out his case as laid in his declaration, and was .entitled to a verdict for nominal damages, unless'by law he was not entitled to demand Such copies, or defendant fiad shown a sufficient excuse for refusing them. Patents are public records. All persons are bound to take notice of their contents, and consequently should haye a right to obtain copies of .them. The patent law of 1836, .\u00a74, enacts that \u201c any. person making application therefor may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>have certified copies,\u201d &amp;c. These records being in the care and custody of the Commissioner of Patents, it is his duty to give authenticated copies to any person who shall demand the same, as soon as he conveniently can, on' payment ,of the legal fees. Where there is a right on the one side, and a corresponding duty imposed on the other, a refusal to perform such duty, on the reasonable request of the party entitled to demand it, will subject the officer to an action. But the party entitled to such services must request it in a proper manner. He has no right to accompany his demand with personal insult, or vulgar abuse of the officer. Those to whom the people have committed high trusts, are entitled at least to common, courtesy,.and are not bound to submit to the insolence or ill temper of those who disregard the decencies of social intercourse. A demand, accompanied with rudeness and insult, is not a legal demand. The letter, accompanying the plaintiff\u2019s demand in this case, was taunting, insulting, and libellous, indicating a want of taste and temper. And if the case had rested here, we could have found no fault with the instruction of the court. But the plaintiff showed another demand, some two weeks after the first,' by his agent, which was made in a proper manner, and unaccompanied with any insulting missive. The defendant was not justified in refusing this demand on account of the former misconduct of the plaintiff, or to enforce an apology by withholding his rights. Ill manners or bad temper do not work a forfeiture of men\u2019s civil rights. While the want of an apology for his previous- rudeness and insult might well justify the defendant in refusing all social intercourse with the plaintiff, yet it could not release him from the obligations imposed upon him by his official station, or entitle him to disregard the rights guaranteed to the plaintiff by the laws of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The court below erred, therefore, in not instructing the jury that if they believed the testimony, the plaintiff was entitled tc a verdict for nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded. '</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">This cause came on to be .heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United .States for the District of Columbia, holden in and for the county of Washington,, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court that the, judgment of the said Circuit Court, in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed with costs; 'and that this cause be; and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Circuit Court with directions\u2018to award a <em>venire facias de novo.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
