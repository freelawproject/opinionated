The District Court erred, in giving to the jury the several instructions prayed for by the counsel for the plaintiffs below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-9\">1, The instruction, \u201cthat under the treaty with Franpe of the 30th of April, 1803, and the acts of Congress, Tesson, and Reddick as his assignee, had a valid subsisting interest in the land in controversy, at the date of the report made by the Recorder, which was not divested by the reservation in the treaty with the Sac and Fox Indians, or the act of Congress of the 30th of June, 1834,\u201d was erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-10\">'(After analyzing the treaty, and the several acts of Congress from that time to 1815, <em>Mr. Butler </em>came to the following conclusion :)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-11\">Neither under the, treaty, nor under any one of the above-cited acts, or all of -them combined, had Reddick, as the'assignee of Tesson, a valid subsisting interest in the- land in controversy, at the date of the Recorder\u2019s report, November 1, 1815.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjB\">-1. Under the treaty, every species of title to lands in Louisiana, emanating from the French or Spanish governments\u2014 whether perfect and complete, or inchoate and incomplete \u2014 was recognized and protected as \u201cproperty;\u201d but mere permits to. .make settlements on such lands, even when lawfully granted by such authorities, conferred no right of property within the meaning of the treaty.

No specific quantity,,and no definite location, are mentioned in the -written permit to Tesson; he is merely permitted to establish himself, for the purpose of trade with the Indians, at the head of the rapid of the River Des Moines. No survey could have be'en made, nor was any made -or contemplated, under this permit; nor did any interest, in any particular tract, pass by it. to Tesson.

Tesson, after making his establishment, was to apply to the Governor-General, to obtain a grant of a convenient space for the use of his establishment; and, until the obtaining of such grant, Tesson neither had, nor could equitably clairn, any interest whatever in any specific tract or lot. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-6\">5. This permit to' Tesson was, therefore, a mere license to\u2018 reside and trade in the Indian country ; it was wholly insufficient- to extinguish the Indian title in any particular tract, or to sever any particular tract from the public domain; and, unless confirmed by'Congress, and duly located by their authority, Tesson had, and. could have no standing, under said permit, in a court of justice. Cases above cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-8\">See, as to the Indian title, and the proceedings necessary to extinguish'it, the.following cases: \u2014 United States <em>v. </em>Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691, 741; Mitchell <em>v. </em>United States, 9 Id. 711; S.

Whatever power, under the acts of Congress passed prior to the date of the Receiver\u2019s report, that affair might have to grant or confirm to Tesson\u2019s assignee, as a donation, the land claimed by him, neither of said acts had; by itself, confirmed his claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-10\">The first branch of the instruction now under review \u2014 that Tesson, and his' assignee, on the 1st of November, 1815, had a subsisting interest\u2019in the land in controversy \u2014 was, therefore, erroneous.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-11\"><em>Mr. Geyer, </em>for the defendants in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApJ\">divided his points as follows:'</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-12\">That a complete' title to the land in controversy was vested in Thomas F\u201e Reddick, on the 29th' of April, 1816, whether the \u201cIndian rights\u201d had, or had not, then been extinguished; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the title so vested has not been divested or impaired, by any subsequent treaty or act of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-5\">A confirmation of a title by act of Congress^not only renders it a legal title, but furnishes higher evidence' of that fact than a patent, inasmuch as it is a direct grant of the fee by the government itself, whereas a patent is only an act of its ministerial officer. Grignon\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Astor, 2 How. 319, S. P.; Simms\u2019s Lessee v. Irvine, 3 Dal. 405; Strother <em>v. </em>Lucas, 12 Pet. 410.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-6\">The grant to the half-breeds by the act of 30th of June, 1834; does not affect the grant to Reddick, by the act of 29th of April, 1816. It is a principle applicable to every grant, that it cannot affect preexisting titles. Polk\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Wendall, 5 Wheat. 293; 9 Cr. 87; Patterson <em>v. </em>Loinn, 11 Wheat. 380; Stoddard et al. <em>v. </em>Chambers, 2 How. 284.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-7\">II. The confirmation by the act of 29th April, 1816, \u00a1vested in Reddick the title, subject only to the Indian right of - occupancy, if not then extinguished. All grants by the government are subject to such rights, whether expressly reserved or not, but as soon as they are extinguished by cession or otherwise, the grantee of the government acquires full dominion over the property. Fletcher <em>v. </em>Peck, 6 Cranch, 87, 137, 143; Mitchell <em>v. </em>United States, 9 Pet. 711; United States <em>v. </em>Hernandez, 10 Pet. 304.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-8\">III. The report of the Recorder of Land Titles is an approval of the claim of Reddick, and a recommendation that six hundred and forty acres of land be granted to him, \u201c if Indian rights extinguished.\u201d Referring it to Congress to determin\u00e9 the whole question. Congress must therefore be understood to have decided that the Indian rights were extinguished, or to have made the grant subject to- such rights, and in either case the title of the defendants in error is complete; all such rights having been extinguished before the commencement of the suit.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-9\">IV. Although the grantee of the government takes, subject to the Indian right of occupancy, the existence of such right is not-presumed, nor is the grantee bound to prove its extinguishment in an action against a mere intruder, especially where, as in this -case, the grant is by an act of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-10\">. V. If the Indian right of occupancy could be set up as a bar to a recovery under a grant by act of Congress, which is denied, it was incumbent on the defendants below to prove the existence of such right at the time of the commencement of the suit-. No such proof was made;' on the contrary, so far as the evidence discloses the existence of any claim by any Indian.tribe, that claim appears to' have been extinguished in 1824, so that .at that time, if not before, Reddick acquired the absolute dominion and right of possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>VI, The permit granted by the Spanish Government to Louis Honor\u00e9 Tesson, to settle upon, occupy, and cultivate the land in controversy, as-his property, excluded all Indian rights. The grants of the Spanish goverhment were -not subject to Indian rights,- but operated as extinguishments of such rights on the lands granted. At the date of the treaty by which Louisiana was acquired, the title of Tesson, though incomplete, was property protected by the treaty; that title, with all its incidents, was recognized by the laws of the United States,\u2019 and confirmed by the- act of 29th April, 1816; so that according to the record, no Indian right of occupancy existed since 1798,</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmO\">Y\u00cdI. If the existence of an Indian right had been recognized by the treaty of 4th August, 1824, as asserted in the third refused instruction, such recognition would not have affected the - title of Reddick, granted in 1816. But that treaty recognizes no such right; it is merely a relinquishment of a claim by the Sacs and Foxes, a quitclaim by the Indians, and not a recognition of their title by the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-7\">The Sacs and Foxes, by a treaty of 3d November, 1804, (Stat. at Large, vbl. 7, p. 84,) ceded to the United States all their claim to the lands east of a line drawn from a point on the Missouri River, opposite the mouth of Gasconade, to a point on the River Jeffreon, thirty miles above its mouth, thence down that river to the Mississippi River, and up the same to the mouth of Wisconsin River, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-8\">The Great and Little Osages, by a treaty of 10th November, 180$, ceded to the United States all. lands \u201c-northwardly of the Missouri Riven\u201d A survey of the boundary was provided for in the seventh article, and was made in 1816; the north boundary being coincident with the north boundary of the now State of Missouri.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-9\">The Osages, as well as the Sacs and Foxes, had set up claims to lands north of the Missouri, and both relinquished to the United States. But in 1824, the Sacs and Foxes still pretended to have a claim -within the bounds of the State of Missouri, which is relinquished by the treaty of 1824.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATH\">',It caftnot be assumed that the title to-the country, embracing the land in controversy, Was in the Sacs and Foxes at any time; nor can the party claiming under a grant of the Spanish Government,. confirmed by act of Congress, be required to prove that it was not, or that their treaty of 1804 included the land granted. \u25a0The party who undertakes to maintain a possession against such a'titlb, by. showing an -outstanding title or right of occupancy, takes upon himself the burden of proving it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Mr. Justice CATRON</author>\n<p id=\"AXk\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">This case was before us in .1850, and is reported in 8 Howard. We then'held that as the patent to Reddick\u2019s heirs of 1839 was younger than the treaty of 1824, and the confirming act of 1836, by which the title of the United States was <em>primd facie </em>vested in the Sac and Fox half-breeds, the patent could not prevail. Nor could its recitals be relied on to give it legal effect from an earlier date than it had on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The judgment was then reversed, and the cause remanded. for another trial, and an intimation given, that probably additional evidence might be adduced on a subsequent trial, which would establish an earlier and better title in the plaintiffs, than that of the half-bre\u00e9ds. That trial has taken place, and the case is now before us, with the evidence to which the recitals in the'patent of Reddick\u2019s heirs, to some extent,-refer. This evidence consists of a- permit given by the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Louisiana to Louis Honor\u00e9 Tesson, to establish himself at the head of the rapids of the River Des Moines, (being a-great rapid in the River Mississippi,) and having formed his establishment, he was assured that then it would be the duty .of the Governor-General of Louisiana, residing at .New Orleans, to procure for said Honor\u00e9, a concession of sufficient space to render the establishment available and useful to the trade of the country in peltries, and so that said Honor\u00e9 might exercise an oversight of the Indians, and keep them in the fidelity which they owed to His Catholic Majesty; the object being to increase the trade with the Indians on that border; and in which \u2022said Honor\u00e9 was permitted to. be a participant, and to trade with the Indians in that part of His Majesty\u2019s dominions; nor . were any rival traders to be allowed- to deal with the Indians^ except such as had a passport .for that purpose, signed by the Lieutenant-Governor. This stipulation. was made in March, 1799. Honor\u00e9 was then in possession, \u00f3f the land in dispute, and had improvements on it; and he, improved it further under the permit of 1799, and continued there until 1805. He had houses, orchards, and- fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Thos. F. Reddick\u2019s claim was regularly derived by assignments from Honbr\u00e9. Reddick\u2019s heirs, claimed a league square,on the assumption that the permit to. settle and inhabit, entitled Honor\u00e9 to this quantity. But the Recorder at St. Louis, acting as Commissioner, rejected the claim for a league square; and properly, as we think; there being only a promise of title in future, but no concession of land; in the, Lieutenant-Governor\u2019s permission to Honor\u00e9.to establish himself, and occupy the premises, and trade with the Indians. As,\u2019however, Honor\u00e9 held actual possession, and had improved the land in afi expensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>and substantial manner, he was-beyond question entitled to six hundred and forty acres,; including his improvements, under our acts of Congress securing this quantity to actual settlers, had the land laid .within that part of Louisiana to .which the Indian title was extinguished, at the time when the occupancy existed. Being ui certain whether Honor\u00e9 was entitled, by reason of his inhabitation and cultivation within territory to which the Indian title was not extinguished, the Recorder, in his tabular statement, granted the six hundred and forty acres, \u201c if Indian rights extinguished.\u201d And this expression has embarrassed the' title for more than thirty years.- There were many claims in the Recorder\u2019s report and tabular statement, in which this one is found; and by the act of April 29, 1816, all of them were confirmed without exception, and without any notice-having bem taken pf the Recorder\u2019s remark, referring to ' an existing Indian title to the land. That the Sacs and Foxes did claim the colmtry generally, where this land lies, is not controverted; nor was their claim ceded to the United States till 1824. <em>A </em>nd this raises the question whether, according to Spanish usage, whilst that power governed Louisiana, an existing Indian claim to territory'precluded inhabitation and cultivation under a permit to inhabit and cultivate a particular place designated in the permit, and which was in the Indian country. Spain had no treaties with any <em>bf </em>the Indian tribes in Louisiana, fixing limits to their claims, so far as we are informed. The Indians were kept quiet, and at peace with Spanish subjects, by kind treatment and due precautions, which did not allow obtrusion on lands claimed by them, without written 'permits from the Governor ; but that such permits were usual, cannot be doubted. The county of St. Charles lies in the fork of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers; it was settled, and the village of St. Charles established there, twenty- years and more before we acquired Louisiana; and yet, by the' treaty of November 3d, 1804, this section of country was ceded to the United States, by the Sac and Fox tribes, extending from the Missouri River, opposite -to the mouth of the Gasconade, to' the Janfilione, \u00f3r \u201c North 2 rivers,\u201d as now known; .which empties into the Mississippi, in the county of Marion, in the State of Missouri. This country .was as solemnly ceded, as was the country north of that cession; by the treaty of 1824; and. which treaty is here set up in opposition to Reddick\u2019s title. The treaty of 1804 was- duly ratified by the Senate of the' United States, and apparently sanctioned, retrospectively, the Sac and Fox claim to the old county of St. Charles, in like' manner that the treaty of 1824 recognized an existing Indian claim to the half-breed tract, where the land in .dispute lies. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>And again in 1808, the Osages ceded to the United States all the lands east of a line running from Fort Clark on the Missouri River, situate a few miles below the mouth\" of the Kansas; thence, due south to the River Arkansas, qnd down the same to the Mississippi; up the same to Sullivan\u2019s line; then west to the north-west corner, being a point one hundred miles due north of the 'mouth of the Kansas Riffer; and with this line south to the north bank of the Missouri opposite the mouth of the Kansas. Sullivan\u2019s line was run in 1816, in execution of the Osage treaty of 1808, and is the northern boundary of the half-breed tract, and the line referred to in the treaty off 1824 with the Sacs and Foxes, and which the Osage treaty of 1808, included.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">This treaty had every sanction that a ratification by our Senate could give it, and is a recognition of an \u2018Indian title in the Osages to nearly all the territory now embraced in the State of Missouri, and the greater part of Arkansas; and of an Osage right to the land claimed by Reddick up to November, 1808; and yet the county and town of St. Louis, the seat of government in Upper-Louisiana during the existence of the Spanish colonial government there, the post'of New Madrid, the county, town, and post of St. Charles, \u2014were all within the cession made by the Osages; and within which cession, lay a great mass, of Spanish orders of survey and grants, in regard to which this country has been legislating and adjudicating for nearly fifty years, without any one ever supposing that such concessions were affected by these loose Indian pretensions set \u00fcp to the country at a time when the concessions were made ; pretensions that the Spanish government notoriously disregarded, further\" than \"a cautious policy required. If permits to inhabit and cultivate were given in so many other instances, regardless of Indian claims, no reason exists why Honor\u00e9 Tesson, could not lawfully improve the land in dispute under his .permit; and in view of this notorious state of facts, the treaty of 1804 with the Sacs and Foxes, by an additional article, declared that' nothing in that treaty \u25a0contained should affect the claim of any individual (or individuals, if more than one) who had- obtained grants oinland from the Spanish government b.eyond the boundary lines of the country then ceded to the United States, on lands claimed by 'the Sacs and Foxes, but not ceded by that treaty; provided, that such grants had at any time been made known to the said Indian tribes, and recognized 'by them.' 'IPhat the large, valuable, and notorious '-improvements were made by Honor\u00e9, at a place where the-Sacs and Foxes themselves resided at the time, is a histbrical fact. He resided there as notoriously as they did. His claim to this property was transferred to Reddick, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>'occupied for twenty-five years under Tesson and Reddick, and his heirs before the treaty of 1824 was made. It was held and improved by authority of the Spanish government, and claimed as individual property, to which the Indian right of .possession did not extend; of this the* Indians never complained, nor do they now complain; no half-breed owner and Indian descendant is defending this suit; it is defended by trespassers, showing no color of claim under the half-breeds, or any one else; shelter is' sought under the assumption that Honor\u00e9\u2019s permit and inhabitation were neither known or recognized by the Sacs and Foxes, and that therefore, the additional, article of the \u00abtreaty of 1804, cannot protect the title of Reddick. We concur with the opinion of Mr. Attorney-General Grundy, in his report of 1839 .on Reddick\u2019s title, to the Secretary of the Treasury, (Opinions of Attorney-Gen'., 1230.) that it must be presumed that the Indians both had knowledge and assented to Honor\u00e9\u2019s claim; and we are furthermore of opinion, that the Indian tribes, and the half-breeds, who claim under them, must beheld to knowledge, and to consent, that Honor\u00e9 took and held, rightful possessions, from the fact of his open and notorious actual occupancy,' and holding for himself, in their midst. This is the settled rule in other cases, and no reason is seen why it should not apply in this case. The reasons are quite as strong, and the rul\u00e9 quite as necessary in its application here, as it was in the case of Landes <em>v. </em>Brant, (10 How. 375,) where we enforced the rule. We are therefore of opinion that the' supposed Indian right of occupancy did not affect the confirmation by Congress in this case, and that the remark of the recorder, \u201c If Indian rights extinguished,\u201d was surplusage, and which remark Congress properly disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">That-the confirmation of 1816 earned the title with it, if the confirmation was valid, has so often been decided by this court, that -it is- not open to discussion; nor is it disputed here on be;half of the defendants below. The confirming act of 1816, 'however, ordered, that a patent should issue according, to a survey afterwards to be made, in all cases' confirmed by the act. This has been done. The patent recites the necesshry facts to connect-the\u2019 confirmation with the patent, and gives date to it by relation, as a legal title, from the 29th of April, 1816, accord-, ing-.to the boundaries set forth in the patent; and as this ruling covers all,the instructions that were given i,n the court -.below, and all such as were refused, we order that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\n<em>Order,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">This .cause came on to-be heard on the transcript of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>record from the District Court of the United States.for the Southern District of Iowa and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court that the judgment of the said District Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
