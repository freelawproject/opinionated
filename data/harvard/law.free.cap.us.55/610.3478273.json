He had not in his hands any.\u201cfunds, evidences of debt, stocks, certificates of stock,\u201d belonging to the debtor, nor \u201c any acknowledgment by the Mexican government,\u201d on which an attachment could be laid.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-10\">This was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the \u201cDistrict of Maryland, sitting as a court of equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-11\">The bill was filed by John Deacon, the surviving partner of Baring, Brother &amp; Company, of- London, under the following circumstances:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-12\">In 1821, Baring, Brother &amp; Company obtained a judgment, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Maryland, against one Lyde Goodwin for $60,000, upon a bill of exchange, to be released on payment of $41,005.58, with interest and costs. Goodwin was eft this time \u2018the owner of one ninth share in the Mexican Company,'the history of which is given in the report of the case of Gill <em>v. </em>Oliver\u2019s Executors, ll How. 529. This judgment was kept alive until the issuing of the attachment hereafter spoken of, in 1826.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-13\">On the 19th of July, 1823, the government of Mexico passed a decree, declaring that General Mina, amongst other persons, was a benefactor of his country; and on the 28th of June, 1824, another decree, acknowledging the debts contracted by the Generals declared to have been benefactors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-14\">On the 11th of January, 1825, Lyde Goodwin addressed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>letter to Mr. Oliver, which is too long to be inserted, but which 'was of the following tenor. He states the claim to have been acknowledged by Mexico; that the amount of his original proportion of the claim, exclusive of interest, was twenty thousand dollars; that his object in proposing to assign his interest therein was, 1st, to secure to Oliver the sum he already owed him; \u2019 and 2d, to obtain barely the means of support for the present, and that the additional sum he would acquire, should not exceed $2,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-5\">Between this date and June, 1825, Oliver paid to Goodwin $2,0\u00da0, and received an assignment of the share from Brown, the trustee in insolvency of Goodwin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-6\">On the 22d of March, 1825, the company appointed Oliver their attorney to prosecute the claim, and informed him that Goodwin was entitled to a commission of five per cent, .in addition to his one ninth share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-7\">On the 28th of October, 1826, an attachment under the act of Maryland, of 1715, was issued upon the judgment against' Goodwin, and laid in the hands, of Oliver, as garnishee. At the same time, the following interrogatories were filed, which the. garnishee was required to answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-8\">Interrogatory 1. Had you, at the time of laying-- the attachment in the above cause, in your hands, or at any other time, and when, any funds, evidences -of debt, stocks, certificates of stock, belonging to Lyde.Goodwin, or any acknowledgment of debt due by -the government of Mexico to the said Lyde Goodwin ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-9\">2.

Had you not a claim against said Goodwin, secured by a transfer or pledge of some Certificate of stock, or document of a public character, showing that Goodwin was entitled to receive some funds from the Mexican government ? If so, what was the amount of your claim so secured, and what was the security; w.asf or was not, the balance or remaining credit, under your control at the time of laying the attachment? State particularly how your claim was secured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-11\">4.

If so, state it as fully as if you were particularly interrogated thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-12\">In December, 1827, Oliver filed the following answers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-13\">1. To the first interrogatory he answers: That he had not, at the time of laying the attachment in the above 'Cause in his hands, nor at any other time, any funds, evidences' of' debt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>stocks, or certificates of stocks, belonging to Lyde Goodwin, or any acknowledgment of debt due by the government of Mexico,' but that he had a power of attorney signed by said Lyde Goodwin, in conjunction with several other persons, claimants of a \u25a0 debt alleged to be owing by the Mexican government, and authorizing him to claim and receive the same for the benefit of said Goodwin\u2019s assignees and others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-4\"><em>2. </em>To the second interrogatory he answers: That the said Goodwin did not transfer to him any certificates of stock or evidences of debt due by the Mexican government, or documents of that character, unless the before-mentioned power of attorney may be called one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-5\">3. To the third interrogatory, he answers: That he. had, and still has, a large claim against said Good-win for money lent him from time to. time; that he is not seemed for this debt, and never has been seemed, by a transfer or pledge of some certificate of stock, or document of a public character, showing that Goodwin was entitled to receive .some funds from the Mexican government, unless the aforesaid power of attorney be deemed such, tut which he does not admit it to be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-6\">4. To the fourth interrogatory he answers: That he knows nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-7\">On the 10th of ,January, 1829, the counsel for the Barings caused the following entry to- be made upon' the docket, relative to the attachment: \u201c Discontinued without costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-8\">On the 30th of May, 1829, Oliver obtained from Goodwin the following paper:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-9\">\u201c Being indebted to Robert Oliver, of Baltimore, upwards of nine thousand dollars, I hereby .assign, transfer, and make over to the said Robert Oliver, in payment of my debt to him, the following objects, which were assigned to him many years ago, to secure the payment of the said debt due by me, to wit* all my undivided ninth part, and right, title, and interest of every kind whatsoever, in the claim on the government of Mexico for supplies furnished, and advances made, to the late General Mina,- or the proceeds thereof, and which claims are under the control of the said Robert Oliver and his agent, J.ohn Mason, Jr., now in Mexico; also a claim on - a certain Louis Merwin, who died some years ago in Havana. The object and intention of this assignment, is to make a full and complete transf\u00e9r to the said Robert Oliver of all my right, title, and interest,, as aforesaid, for which said Robert Oliver has agreed to balance my account on his books, and to consider the same as satisfactorily settled; and I hereby authorr , and order all my agents, \u00ed&gt;r those holding any powers of atto- ey or instructions from me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>relative to the aforesaid property, to account with the\u201d said Robert Oliver for the same, or the proceeds thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-5\">\u201c L.

Robert. Oliver.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-9\">This claim was prosecuted under the treaty between the United States and Mexico, with the following result:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-10\">On' the 11th of April, 1850, there were paid to Oliver\u2019s executors (he having died in 1834) the following sums, being net proceeds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-11\">On account of Goodwin\u2019s commissions .... 22,143.12</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-12\">\u201c \u201c \u201c his share.........35,110.47</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-13\">$&gt;57,253.59</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-14\">In November, 1850, Deacon filed his bill against the execu-.. tors, alleging that the answers of Oliver were untrue and evasive, by means of which deception the attachment had been discontinued; that at the time when it was laid, Oliver had under his control the evidences of debt due by the Mexican government; that so far from having' a mere power of attorney from Goodwin to collect the debt, he had a transfer of the claim for the purpose of security, which, being irrevocable, was, by the laws of Maryland, the subject of an attachment, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-15\">The executors of Oliver answered, and upon a hearing of the cause, the Circuit Court dismissed the bill, when the complainant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-16\">It was argued by <em>Mr. Davis </em>and <em>Mr. </em>Howard, for the appellant, and <em>Mr. Campbell </em>and <em>Mr. </em>Johnson, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-17\">, As the decision rested mainly upon one point of the case, namely, that, at the time of laying the attachment, Oliver had no interest which was attachable, many of the arguments\u2019 of counsel upon other points, are omitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-18\">\u25a0 The following extract from the brief of Mr. Davis contains his view of the leading points of the case. \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-19\">1. That a debt due by a foreign or domestic government is assignable, passing, by insolvency, to executors ox administrators, and liable for debts of claimant, and liable to all the incidents of other debts, excepting that it cannot be enforced by suit. Comegys <em>v. </em>Vasse, 1 Pet. 193, 215, 217; Sheppard <em>v. </em>Taylor, 5 Pet. 675; Plater <em>v. </em>Scott, 6 Gill &amp; Johns. 116; Gorgier <em>v. </em>Mieville, 3 Barn. &amp; Cress. 45; 10 E. C. L. R. 16.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-20\">2. That the Court of Appeals of Maryland have decid\u00e9d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>th\u00e1t, by the local law, the share of Lyde Goodwin, n'ow in controv\u00e9rsy, and his commissions, did not pass to his insolvent trustee in 1817, because then under the ban of the public policy of the country; but that after the decrees of 19th July, 1823, and 28th June, 1824, of Mexico, it became a fair and valid .debt, due by the Mexican government, and as such was assignable, and did pass by the'assignment of Goodwin of 1825, and 30th May, 1829.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-5\">3. That the Supreme Court have pronounced \u2018the above to have been the decision of the Court of Appeals; and that being on a question of local municipal law, not involving any law of the United States, such decision could not be reviewed by them. Gill <em>v. </em>Oliver\u2019s Ex\u2019s, 11 How. 529; Williams <em>v. </em>Oliver\u2019s Ex\u2019s, 12 Id. 111, 125.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-6\">4t That the award of the Mexican commission and the decree of the Court of Appeals, are conclusive upon Robert Oliver\u2019s representatives and in our favor, of the_nature and origin of the fund, of the validity and assignability of the funds, and its liability to all legal incidents of a valid legal claim, from 1824 down to this time. Comegys <em>v. </em>Vasse, 1 Pet. 212; Sheppard <em>v. </em>Taylor, 5 Id. 708, 709, 713; Frevall <em>v. </em>Bache, 14 Id. 97; De Vallingan <em>v. </em>Duffy, Id. 290, 291; Barry <em>v. </em>Patterson, 6 Har. &amp; Johns. 203, 204.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJI\">II- That the assignment of 1825 was a mortgage on the fund to secure the prior debt of Goodwin to Oliver, and the $2,000 then advanced; subject to which Goodwin remain\u00a9! owner of the fund, and Oliver was accountable to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-8\">1. This appears from Goodwin\u2019s letter to Oliver, 11th January, 1825; his receipt, 15th February, 1825; Brown\u2019s assignment, 21st March, 1825; and Goodwin\u2019s receipt, 24th March, 1825; and the assignment of 30th May, 1829.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-9\">The letter did not propose a sale; there was no .estimate .of the value ' of the claim; Good-win considered' it likely to be received in a year, and looked on it as- worth $20,000, or more.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-10\">His objects he said were \u2014 1st. To secure a debt he then owed, but if' it were a- sale for ,$2,000, it secured nothing; 2d. To obtain the bare means of support for the. present. He then plainly looked to the remainder of the fund as his support for the future.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-11\">The additional sum I shall want .shall not exceed $2,000,\u201d is the language, of a borrower, and implies a previous loan now to be added to. The receipts are, on account of his share, or interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-12\">The assignment, signed by Brown, mentions no value given. It was a mere precaution to preclude a possible claim. The assignment of 1829, May 30, finally, is express and decisive as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>to' the former assignment, being for security merely, and itself purports to assign and relinquish the remaining right of Goodwin. It recites a debt of $9,000; but the' answer shows only $8,500, including the $2,000. So it continued to be a debt, and so was not a payment on a sale. If it were a sale, then \u201c the words to.secure you the sum I already owe you,\u201d must be construed to make that sum a part of the consideration of the sale; and it also would cease to be a debt. If it were a sale, then the. assignment of 30th May, \u00cd829, would not only recite a falsehood, but be an absurdity. It cannot be half sale and half mortgage; a sale for $2,000 and a mortgage for $6,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-5\">The assignment of 1825 was therefore a mortgage, agreed by the act of the parties to be worth $8,000, and considered by Goodwin worth more than $20,Q00, and likely to be paid in cash in a year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-6\">2. That such an assignment is in law a mortgage, or security merely, the following cases prove: 1 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1018; 1 Cruise (by Greenleaf) tit. 15, ch. 1; Conway <em>v. </em>Alexander, 7 Cranch, 218, 241; Hughes <em>v. </em>Edwards, 9 Wheat. 489; Morris <em>v. </em>Nixon, 1 How. 118, 122, 123, 124, 126, 127, 130, 131; Dougherty <em>v. </em>McCalgan, 6 Gill &amp; Johns. 275, 280, 281.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-7\">-3. That on mortgage, or pledge, or transfer, by way of security, the mortgagor is treated as the substantial owner, subject to the lien of the creditor. His right to redeem is an incident inseparable. It may be assigned or pass to his representatives, or to his insolvent trustee, -or in bankruptcy, or a judgment creditor may claim to stand in his place and to redeem..</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-8\">This principle applies to securities of chattels as well as of lands, and to choses in action as well as to either. ^ Morris <em>v. </em>Nixon, 1 How. 123, 124, 126, 129; 5 Johns. R. 345; 2 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7\u00a7 1023, 1052; Dougherty <em>v. </em>McCalgan, 6 G. &amp; J. 281, 282; Hudson <em>v. </em>Warner &amp; Vance, 2 Har. &amp; G. 415; Hartley <em>v. </em>Russel, 2 Sim. &amp; Stu. 244; Milne <em>v. </em>Walton, 2 Younge &amp; Col. 354, 362.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-9\">III. That, therefore,- Lyde Goodwin retained such a property and interest in the claim on Mexico, after its assignment to Oliver, as was liable in some way to be subjected to the payment, of his debts by judgment. Being an equitable interest in a chose in action, it could not be subjected to the common-law execution of <em>fieri facias.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-10\">It could then b,\u00e9 reached by one of two processes only; either, 1st, by attachment in the-nature of an execution; 2d, by bill in equity to,/subject the surplus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-11\">The appellant insists that it could be subjected by either of those modes, and that the laying the attachment was a fit preliminary; and that the fraud is the same in either view.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>1. By execution of attachment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-5\"><em>a. </em>The act of 1715, \u00a7- 7, gives any judgment creditor of any person right, in lieu of any other execution, to sue out an attachment against the goods, chattels, and credits, of the defendant, in his own hands, or in the hands of any other person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-6\">The policy of our law is to subject every species of property to execution. Somerville <em>v. </em>Brown, 5 Gill, 422.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-7\">It is an execution. Baldwin <em>v. </em>Wright, 3 Gill, 246.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-8\">The attachment was intended to cover every species of property-not hable to be taken by <em>fi. fa., </em>and for which, before plaintiff had been driven into equity to get hold of; and that it would not lie where a <em>fi. fa., </em>lay. For example,\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-9\"><em>Fi. fa. </em>lay only, for chattels held by <em>legal title. </em>10 G. &amp; J. 226, 261; Harding <em>v. </em>Stevenson, 6 H. &amp; J. 267. Attachment covers that by <em>equitable title.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-10\">' Legal estates in land, by the act of 1732, are sold on <em>fi. fa. </em>Equitable estates, as equities of redemption, by attachment, but not to <em>fi. fa. </em>Ford <em>v. </em>Philpot, 5 Har. &amp; J. 312; 5 Johns.

Wells <em>v. </em>Ghiselin, 1 Har. &amp; McH. 91.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-13\">Surplus money in sheriff\u2019s hands could not be taken on <em>fi. fa. </em>but might by .attachment. 1 Har. &amp; Johns. 546; 5 Har. &amp; Johns. 312.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-14\">Attachment lies for a credit or a chose in action, or for stocks, because they are not liable to <em>fi. fa. </em>Evans, Pr. 364.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-15\">But chattels in defendant\u2019s possession were not liable to at-' taehment, because they could be taken by <em>fi. fa. </em>3 Har. &amp; McH. 594, 615, 616, 617.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-16\">Thus the policy of the attachment law was to give a residuary \u00e9xecufcion, covering every case not before, covered. The. words goods and-chattels, and lands, covering interests in lands, and goods and chattels, which could not be taken, by <em>fi. fa. </em>.and \u25a0credits,- being used to designate every thing, in .the nature' .of a chose in action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-17\"><em>b. </em>The claim on the Mexican government, assigned by. Goodwin, was a credit of Goodwin, in the hands of .'Oliver, and so liable to attachment in his hands. ', . '</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-19\">The statute does not confine the attachment to .credits in the hands of the debtor, budextends it to the credits .of the defendant in the hands of the plaintiff, or any other- person. \u2019\u25a0 .</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-20\">The most common case is. the attaching the' cfedit' in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>hands of the debtor, or person owing the money to the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-5\">But the act does not define the subject-matter on which the attachment may be laid by any reference to the person in whose hands it may happen to be. The credit is the thing attached; it may be attached in the hands of the .plaintiff, or any other person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-6\">May, then, a credit be in the hands of any \u25a0 person but the debtor, who himself directly owes the money to the defendant ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-7\">A credit is a right to demand money from some- one. It- is equivalent to the legal phrase, a chose in action \u2014 a thing to be sued for. .. ' -</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-8\">Now, a right in A to recover money from B for the use of C, is matter of every day occurrence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-9\">If D have judgment against C, may he not lay an attachment in the hands of A, who holds a credit or chose in action against B for the benefit of C, especially if B. be out of the State ? \u2022 '\u2022 \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b629-10\"><em>2. </em>The modern law recognizes the assignability of choses in action, operating an actual transfer <em>proprio vigore </em>of the title of the chose in action, or credit, from the assignor to the assignee, vesting the latter with all the rights \u00f3f the' former,-the possession of the evidences, and the right to enforc\u00a7\u2019 the claim, as effectually as a bargain and a sale of lands. <em>2 </em>Story, Eq.

An execution is usually required as precedent to suit in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-9\">The attachment was such an execution. Even if no condemnation \u2019 could have been had under it; yet neither can an equitable interest in chattels or land be sold under a <em>fi. fa. </em>at common law. But the <em>fi. fa. </em>is held to bind them, and a bill lies in equity to sell them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-10\">So here, the attachment was the most appropriate form of execution to bind an interest, in the nature of a credit or chose in action, as preliminary to a bill in equity, to have it applied to the satisfaction of the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-11\">(c.) To this preeeeding the facts of the assignment, by way of mortgage to, and the possession of the evidences by Oliver, were as essential as to the sustaining of the attachment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOAR\">The untrue denials in the answers of Oliver equally misled the plaintiff to the abandonment of his remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-13\">The fraud gives the plaintiff an equal equity now to call on the court to do him justice by subjecting the fund to his judgment, after paying Oliver his debt and expenses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-14\">The points raised by the counsel for the appellees were as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-15\">The theory of the bill, is, that the appellant had, by the attachment on the judgment of iiimself and co-plaintiffs, entitled himself to condemnation of Goodwin\u2019s funds, alleged to be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Oliver\u2019s hands as garnishee, and that Oliver, by his false and. fraudulent answers, having deprived him of his legal right to such condemnation, equity will compel Oliver\u2019s estate to pay the money which, but for his unconscientious conduct, would have been recovered at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-5\">A right to condemnation, then, as against Oliver, and the loss of that right through his fraud and falsehood, are essential, on the appellant\u2019s own showing, to his success.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-6\">Neither of these elements are found in the case, as it appears on pleadings or proofs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-7\">1st. The attachment was issued against law, and would, at the trial, (which never came on, because the plaintiffs in the attachment discontinued it,) have' been quashed, and is therefore to be regarded as void. Act of Maryland, 1715, chap. 40, \u00a7 6; Waters &amp; Caton, 1 Harris &amp; McHenry, 407; Harden &amp; Moores, 7 Harris &amp; Johnson, 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-8\">2d. The attachment was irregular and void for another reason; that the act of 1715, (above referred to,) and adopted by the 100th rule of the Circuit Court of Maryland, authorized no-such writ in the case of a resident defenda\u00f1t. Act of 1831, chap. 321.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-9\">3d. But conceding the attachment to have been regular, it could only- take the \u201c lands, tenements, goods, chattels, or credits,\u201d of Goodwin, in Oliver\u2019s hands, (see Writ, 19, 20,) and there being none of these things in his hands, there was nothing to attach, and of course nothing to condemn. Houston &amp; Nowland, 7 Gill &amp; Johnson, 480; Meeker and Wilson, 1 Gallison, 419; Act of Maryland, 1810, chap. 160; Ford &amp; Philpot, 5 Harris &amp; Johnson, 312; Campbell &amp; Morris, 3 Harris &amp; McHenry, 535; 9 Crunch, 477.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-10\">4th. If there was any thing in Oliver\u2019s hand at tbe time of the attachment, it was only Goodwin\u2019s claim on the government of Mexico, for assistance rende1 ed to Mina, in his attempt to revolutionize Mexico when a province of Spain, in violation of our neutrality acts; and such a claim has been decided by the Maryland-courts, in the case of Goodwin\u2019s trustee against these appellees, to be of such a character that the law of Maryland will not recognize its existence, and of course no condemnation could be had of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-11\">5th. The discontinuance of the attachment was the voluntary act of the appellant; and as he was not bound by Oliver\u2019s answers to the interrogatories in attachment, but might have tested their truth by bringing the attachment to trial, bis failure to proceed at law gives him no right to come into equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-12\">6th. Oliver\u2019s answers were true. Goodwin\u2019s share in the Mexican Company was assigned to Oliver absolutely in 1825, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>and ho interest therein remained in Goodwin at the time of the attachment. Goodwin\u2019s interest in \u2022 his commissions and his claim on Mervin were not assigned to Oliver till May, 1829, nearly two years after the answers, and at the time of the attachment Oliver had no interest whatever in either of these claims.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b634-5\">Mr. Justice GRIER</author>\n<p id=\"AM\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Without attempting to give a history of the'facts of this case, as exhibited in the pleadings and proofs, or noticing all the objections of the equity of the bill, we think there are two of its charges or allegations, on which its whole equity rests, and which the complainant has failed to substantiate.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">1. That\u2019there were in the hands of Robert Oliver at the time the attachment was laid, any chattels, rights, or credits of Lyde Goodwin, \u201c which were bound by said attachment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\"><em>2. </em>That Robert Oliver was guilty of. falsehood or fraudulent concealment of facts, in his answers to the interrogatories- proposed to him as garnishee in the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">In 1816,-and previous to his insolvency, Lyde Goodwin had become a shareholder in the Baltimore Mexican Company, to the extent of one. ninth part. This company had furnished means to General Mina to fit out a warlike expedition against Mexico, then a dependency of Spain. The expedition of Mina had failed, and he had perished with it. This transaction of the company was- illegal, and punishable as a misdemeanor, with fine and imprisonment. The contract was therefore void in law, and could not be the foundation of any debt, nor could the stock thus created be treated in law as' a thing of value; and ,from the uncertainty of its future prospects,- its value in the market was little better. It was merely possible that Mexico, if successful in her struggle for independence, might, at some future day, assume the payment of the debts contracted by Mina, and if, as it was possible, or perhaps probable, that at some day still further in the future the payment may be obtained. Goodwin\u2019s title in this possibility or expectancy, or whatever it might be called, was supposed to have passed-to Brown, his assignee, under the insolvent act. Afterwards, in 1824, Mexico having achieved her independence, passed a decree promising to acknowledge \u201c the debts that -may be proven to have been contracted for the service of the nation by the Generals declared <em>bene m\u00e9ritos de la </em>patria,\u201d of whom Mina was one. This renewed the hopes of the company, that, possibly something might be recovered hereafter on this pledge of the Mexican government ; and Robert Oliver was appointed the attorney on the part of the company to prosecute their claim. Lyde Goodwin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>being in actual want of the means of subsistence, persuaded Robert Oliver to advance him the sum of two thousand dollars, and take a transfer from Brown, his insolvent trustee of this claim, as security.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In this situation of affairs, the attachment of Baring, Brothers &amp; Co. was served on Robert Oliver, as garnishee of Lyde Goodwin, in 1827. Now it is admitted that Oliver was a creditor of Lyde Goodwin, and not a debtor. His power of attorney put him in possession of nothing which could be attached as the property of Goodwin. .The insolvent hssignment was supposed to have vested Goodwin\u2019s interest in this expectancy, in Brown. If it did not do so, as has since been decided, Oliver had no title to Goodwin\u2019s claim. And if it did, and if Oliver held it merely as a.security for the sum advanced by him, the equitable assignment taken as such security, was his own ; it was but an instrument to obtain satisfaction for his debt'; it conferred nothing but a right in equity. Whether it was valid or invalid, absolute or defeasible, it did not constitute him a debtor of Lyde Goodwin, or put him in possession of any of his credits or effects, so as to subject him to an attachment as Goodwin\u2019s' garnishee. \u25a0 It was not till after the death of Robert Oliver, and more than ten years after the attachment of complainant was discontinued, that the United States made the Convention of April, 1839, with Mexico, under which Commissioners were appointed, before whom this claim of the Baltimore Company was proved, and \u00e1cknowledged by Mexico as a just debt. Then for the first time, this uncertain cla.im or equity, assumed the form of a credit, and an existence as \u00e1 legal chose in action. But in that character it never existed in the hands of Robert Oliver. If, at the. time the attachment was served-on him, the claim of Lyde Goodwin had existed as a debt due him by a citizen of Maryland, and Olivei held an equitable transfer either absolute or defeasible, it is abundantly evident that the proper person to be made garnishee in an attachment, would have been the debtor, not the equitable claimant of the debt. He has but an equity or a bare right, but whatever it is, it is his own, and his claim is in hostility both to the plaintiff and defendant in the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The whole foundation of the complainant\u2019s equity in this bill rests on the averment, that the interest of Lyde Goodwin, whatever it was, in this Mexican claim, <em>(\u201c </em>was bound by the attachment laid in the hands of Robert' Oliver, as garnishee.\u201d The Merwin claim not having been assigned till after the attachment was withdrawn, need not be.noticed. The decision of this point against the a'verment of the Dill, would dispose of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">But as we think the charges made in the bill against Robert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Oliver, of false and fraudulent concealment, have not been sustained, it is due to the memory of one who always sustained a high reputation as a merchant and man of honor, to notice this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">It must be remembered that the purpose of the interrogatories was to ascertain whether Oliver had in his hands any credits or effects of Lyde Goodwin, subject to attachment; and also that Brown, the insolvent assignee of Goodwin, was supposed to' have had the title to Goodwin\u2019s interest vested in him. The legitimate inquiry was, therefore, not whether Brown had abused his trust, by selling or \u00bfmortgaging the trust property for the benefit of Goodwin; or whether Oliver\u2019s claim under the assignee was valid or not. This inquiry was wholly irrelevant in the investigation, under the attachment proceeding. Nor was Oliver bound, in that investigation, to make any disclosure of the strength or weakness of his own title, which was hostile to that of the plaintiff. The discovery sought, was not of Oliver\u2019s equities, but of. Goodwin\u2019s assets. Oliver\u2019s answers to the interrogatories were drawn, no doubt, by learned counsel, fully aware of the nature of the proceedings, and the rights of the parties under-them. Th\u00e9 answers were strictly true to the letter. The garnishee had not in his hands, \u201c any funds, evidences of debt, stocks, certificates of stock, belonging to Lyde Goodwin, nor any acknowledgment by the Mexican government to said Lyde Goodwin,\u201d on which the attachment could be laid. - What claims or securities he himself had as. .a creditor of Goodwin, the plaintiff in that proceeding had no right to inquire, nor was Oliver bound to answer. If he had nothing which the plaintiff could attach, it Was no fraud on plaintiff, to keep his own counsel, and make no disclosure as to the nature of his own securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The decree of the Circuit Court is therefore affirmed.-</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Maryland, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed, by this court, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
