That the act of Congress, passed in 1793, was constitutional ; that the power of legislating upon the subject of fugitive slaves, ought to be vested in Congress; that the act had been declared to be constitutional by the following authorities: 16 Peters, 620 <em>et seq.; </em>9 Johns, 67; 12 Wendell, 311; 2 Pick. 11; 5 Sergeant &amp; Rawle, 62; 2 Wheeler\u2019s Crim.

The act of Congress of 1793, and the law of Illinois, conflict with each other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-14\">5. Two laws legislating over the same offence, cannot exist at the same time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-15\">6. If so, the law of Illinois must give way</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-16\">It was particularly pressed upon the court by Mr. Chase, that this court had decided, in the case of Prigg <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania, (16 Pet. 539,) that all State legislation upon the subject of fugi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>tive slaves, was void, whether professing to be in aid of the legislation of Congress, or independent of it, was void; and he claimed the benefit of that decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-5\">The' counsel for the defendant in error, commented- oh the various positions above, mentioned; and the following extract from the brief,' shows the principal ground relied upon to vindicate the State law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-6\">The case just cited, (Houston'v.-Moore, 5 Wheaton-,) leads directly to the question; What is 'the particular power exercised by the State in the present' instance ; whence derived, and what the design and mode of its operation ? And it may be -as well here to remark, that it is not alone in the light of an act in aid of the legislation of Congress, that this law is to be considered. The question before this court is one of pow~er \u2014 of power in the State to legislate in the particular manner. If the power exists in the\" State, no matter from whence derived, the validity of the law cannot be questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-7\">It is now contended that the power, in question belongs to the States .in virtue of their original and- .unsurrendered sovereignty ; in virtue of those great cons\u00e9rvative powers which all governments must have, exercise, and maintain for their own protection and preservation; powers which, in the language of Mr, Madison, (Federalist, No. 45,) \u201c extend to all the objects which, 'im'the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties,' and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the- State.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-8\">In the City of New York <em>v. </em>Miln, (11 Pet. 139,) the court say, \u201c that a State has the same undeniable, and unlimited jurisdiction over all persons and things within its territorial limits' as any foreign nation, when that jurisdiction is not surrendered or restrained by the Constitution of the United States,\u201d &amp;\u00e9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-9\">It has been, before remarked, that slavery exists to a limited extent in the State of Illinois; nevertheless, it is the settled policy of the State to discourage the institution, as~ also a free negro population. \u2022 By numerous acts of legislation, before and since the present constitution, it has been made penal to iniroduce negroes from other States, except upon severe conditions. Negroes have been and continue to be regarded as constituting a vagabond population; and to prevent their influx -into the State, restrictive, laws have be\u00e9n from time to time passed.- In connection with this regulation is to \u25a0 be found the law in question, prohibiting persons within the State from harboring or secreting fugitive negro slaves. The question whether a State may not prohibit its citizens from harboring.or protecting felons, fugitives from other countries, is the same with this. It is pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>sible that some new State might become a country of refuge for .the accused and convicted outcasts of older and stronger governments; would that State be compelled to receive and welcome the moral pestilence ? Certainly not; the right of self-preservation, necessary to all governments, would justify any act required to repel them from her borders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-5\">It was upon this principle, as a sovereign power in the State, that this court sustained the law of New York, intended to-prevent the influx of a pauper and vagabond population at the port of New York. City of New York <em>v. </em>Miln, (11 Pet.-i42.) In which case the court say, \u201cWe think it as competent and as necessary for a State to provide precautionary measures against-the moral pestilence of paupers and vagabonds, and possibly convicts, as it is to guard against the physical pestilence which may arise from unsound and infectious articles imported, or from a ship the crew of which may be laboring under an infectious disease.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-6\">It was in favor of this same power that the court, in Prigg <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania, (16 Pet. 625,) qualify the general terms of their, opinion, \u2014 \u201c To guard, however, against any possible misconstruction of our views, it is proper to state that we are by no means to be understood, in any manner whatsoever, to doubt or to interfere with the. police power belonging t\u00f3 the States, in-virtue of their general sovereignty,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-7\">The State may arrest, restrain, and even remove from its borders, the. fugitive slave, and so long as the rights of the owner are not interfered with, it is a constitutional exercise of power. If, then, the greater power exists, that over the person of the slave, for the purpose of police, certainly the- lesser power, that over the citizen, preventing him from harboring, secreting, or protecting the\u2019 slave, for like purposes of police, will n'ot be denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHU\">It will be perceived that this view of the case settles the point made in the opposing argument, that the law of Illinois is a violation of the Federal and State Constitutions, which prohibit two punishments for one offence.. A legal offence is the' breach of a law. - Eels, in harboring a fugitive slave, violated a law of this State,' by interfering with its internal policy. He also violated a law of Congress, by interfering with the rights of the slave-owner secured by- the Constitution. The one act constitutes two distinct offences against the several laws of district jurisdictions. Within thg same jurisdiction one act. frequently constitutes several offences) as in the familiar cases of assaults, libels, and other personal injuries, which are offences against the persons injured, and at the same time.offences against the government; and the different offences may be separately tried, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>-and separately punished. The constitutional provision is not, that no person shall be subject, for the same act, to be twice put in jeopardy of life or hmb; but for the same offence, the same violation of law, no person\u2019s life or limb shall be twice put in jeopardy.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b29-5\">Mr. Justice GRIER</author>\n<p id=\"As8\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The plaintiff in error was indicted and convicted under the criminal code of Illinois for \u201c harboring and secreting a' negro slave.\u201d The recofd was. removed by writ of error to the Supreme Court 9^ that State; and it was there contended, on behalf of the plaintiff in error, that the judgment and conviction should be reversed, because the statute of Illinois, upon which the indictment was founded, is void, by reason of its being in conflict with that article of the Constitution of the United States which declares \u201c that no person held. to labor or service in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such\u2019 labor may. be due.\u201d And, also, because said statute is in conflict with the act of Congress on the same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">That this record presents a case of which this court has jurisdiction under the twenty-fifth section of the judiciary act, is not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">The statute of Illinois,- whose validity is called in question, is contained in the l49th section of the Criminal Code, and is as follows: \u201c If any person shall harbor or secrete any negro, mulatto, or person of color, the same being a slave or servant owing service or labor to any other persons, whether they reside in this State or in any Other State or territory, or district, within the \u25a0 limits and under the jurisdiction of the United States, or shall in any wiseXbinder or prevent the lawful owner or owners of such slaves or servants from retaking them, in a lawful manner, every such-person so offending shall be deemed guilty- of a misdemeanor, and fined not exceeding five .hundred dollars, or imprisoned not exceeding six months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">The bill of indictment, framed finder this statute, contains four counts. The first- charges that <em>\u201c </em>Richard Eels, a certain . negro slave, owing service to one C. D., of the State of Missouri, did unlawfully secrete, contrary to the form of the statute,\u201d &amp;c. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">2. That he harbored the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">4. For unlawfully secreting a negro owing labor in the State of Missouri to one C. D., which said negro had secretly fled, from said State and from- said C. D.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">4. For unlawfully preventing C. D., the lawful owner of 'Said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>slave, Irom retaking him. in a lawful manner, by secreting the said negro, contrary to the form of the statute, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In view of this section of the Criminal; Code of Illinois, and this indictment founded on it, we are unable to discover any thing, which conflicts with the provisions of the Constitution of thi. United States or'the legislation of Congress on. the subject of fugitives.from labor. It does not' interfere in any manner witb the owner or claimant in the exercise of his right tq arrest and recapture- .his slave. It neither interrupts, delays, or im- , pedes' the right of the .master to immediate possession. It gives no immunity or protection to the fugitive. against the claim of \u25a0his master. It acts .neither on the master nor his slave; on his right or his remedy. It prescribes a rule of conduct for the citizens of Illinois. It is but the exercise of the power which every State is.' admitted to possess, of defining offences and punishing\u2019 offenders against its laws. The power to make municipal regulations for the restraint and punishment of crime, for the preservation of the health and morals of her citizens, and of the public peace, has never been surrendered by the States, or restrained by the Constitution of the United States. In the exercise of this power, which has been denominated the police power, a State has .a right to make it a penal offence to introduce paupers,- criminals, or fugitive slaves, within their borders, and punish those who thwart this policy by harboring, concealing, or secreting such persons. Some of the States,-coterminous'with those who tolerate slavery1, have found it necessary to protect themselves' against the influx' either of liberated 'or fugitive slaves, and to repel from their' soil a population likely, to become burdensome and injurious, either as paupers or criminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Experience has shown, also, that the results of such conduct as that prohibited by the-statute in question are not only, to demoralize their citizens -who live in daily and open disregard-of the duties imposed upon them by the Constitution and laws, but to destroy the harmony and kind feelings which should exist between citizens of this Union, to create border feuds and bitter animosities, and to cause breaches, of the peace, violent assaults, riots, and murder. No one can deny or doubt the right of a State to defend itself .against evils of such magnitude, and punish, those who perversely persist in conduct which promotes them.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">. As this statute does not impede the master in the exercise of his rights', so neither does it interfere to aid or assist him. If a State, in the exercise of its l\u00e9gitimate'powers in promotion of' its policy of excluding an unacceptable population,, should thus indirectly benefit the master of \u00e1 fugitive, no one has a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>complain that it has, thus far at least, fulfilled a duty assumed or imposed by its compact as a member of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">But though we are of opinion that such is the character, policy, and-intention of the statute in question, and that for this reason alone the power of the State to make and enforce such a law cannot be doubted, yet we would not wish it to be inferred, by any implication from what we have said, that any-legislation of a State to aid and assist the claimant, and which does not directly nor indirectly delay, impede, or frustrate the reclamation of a fugitive, or interfere with the claimant in the prosecution of his other remedies,' is necessarily void. This question has not been before the court, and cannot be decided in anticipation of future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">It has been urged that this act is void, as it subjects the delinquent to a double punishment for a single offence. But we think that neither the fact assumed in this proposition, nor the inference from it, will be found to be correct. The offences for which the fourth section of the act of 12th February, 1793, subjects the delinquent to a fine of five hundred dollars, are different in many-respects from those defined by the statute of Illinois. The- act of Congress contemplates recapture and reclamation, and punishes those who interfere with the master in the exercise of this right \u2014 first, by obstructing or hindering the claimant in his endeavors to seize and arrest the fugitive ; secondly, by rescuing the fugitive when arrested; and, thirdly, by harboring or concealing him after notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">But the act of Illinois, having for its object the prevention of th\u00e9 immigration of such persons, punishes the harboring or secreting n\u2019ego slaves, whether domestic or foreign, and without regard to the master\u2019s, desire either to reclaim or abandon them. The fine imposed is not given to the master, as the party injured, but to the State, as a penalty for disobedience to its laws,-. And if th\u00e9 fine inflicted\u2019 by the act .of Congress had been mad\u00e9 recoverable by indictment, the offence, as stated in any one -of the counts of the bill - before us, would not have supported such an indictment. Even the last count, which charges the plaintiff in error with \u201cunlawfully preventing C. D., the lawful owner, from retaking the negro slave,\u201d as it does not allege potice, does not describe an offence punishable by the act of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">But admitting that the plaintiff in' error may be liable to aii action, under the act of Congress, for the same acts of harboring and preventing the owner from retaking his slave, it does., not follow that he would be twice punished for the same offence. An offence,-in its legal signification, means the'transgression -of . a law.- A man may be compelled to make reparation in da<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>mages to the. injured party, and. be liable also to punishment for a breach of the public peace, in consequence of the same act.; and may be said, in common parlance, to\u2019be twice punished for the same oifence. Every citizen of the United States is also a-citizen of a State or territory. He may be said to owe allegiance to two sovereigns; and may be liable to punishment for, an infraction of the laws of either. The same act may be an' offence or transgression \u2022 of the laws of both. Thus, an assault upon the marshal of the .United' States, and. hindering him in the execution of legal process, is a high offence against the United States, for which the perpetrator is liablfe to punishment; and the same act maybe .also a gross breach of the neace of the State, a riot, assault, or a murder, and subject the same person to a punishment, under the State laws, for a misdemeanor or felony. That either or both may (if they see fit) punish such an offender, cannot be doubted. Yet it cannot be truly dverred that the offender has been twice punished fpr the same offence.; but only that by one act he has committed two offences, for each of which he is justly punishable. He could not plead the punishment by one in bar to a conviction by the other; consequently, this court has decided, in the case of Fox <em>v. </em>The State of Ohio, (5 How. 432,) that a State may punish the offence of uttering or passing false coin, as a cheat or fraud practised on its citizens; and, in the case of th'e United States <em>v. </em>Marigold, (9 How. 560,) that Congress, in the proper exercise of its authority, may punish\u2019 the same act as an offence against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">It has been urged, in the. argument on behalf of the plaintiff in error, that an affirmance of the judgment in this case will conflict with the decision of this.court in the case of Prigg <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 540. This, we think, is a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">The questions presented and decided in \u2019 that case differed entirely from those which affect the present. Prigg, with full power and authority from the owner, had arrested a fugitive slave in Pennsylvania, and taken, her to her master in Maryland. For this he was indicted' and convicted under a statute of Pennsylvania, making it a felony to take and carry away any negro or mulatto for the purpose of detaining them as slaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The following questions were presented by the case and decided by the court: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">,1. That, under and in virtue of the Constitution of the United States, the owner of a slave is clothed 'with entire authority, in every State in the Union, to seize and recapture his slave, wherever he can do it without illegal violence or a breach ,of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>2. </em>That the government is clothed with appropriate authority and functions to enforce the delivery, on claim of the owner, and has properly exercised it in the act' of Congress of 12th February, 1793,</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">3. That any State law or regulation which interrupts, impedes, limits, embarrasses, delays, or postpones the right of the owner to the immediate possession of the slave, and the immediate command of his service, is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">We.have in this case assumed the correctness of these doctrines ; and it will be found that the grounds on which this cn.se is decided were fully recognized in that. \u201c We entertain,\u201d say the court, (page 625,) \u201c no doubt whatsoever, that the States, in virtue of their general police power, possess.full jurisdiction, to arrest and restrain runaway slaves, and remove them from their borders, and otherwise to secure themselves against their depredations and evil example, as they certainly may do in cases of idlers, vagabonds, and paupers. The rights of the owners of fugitive slaves are in no just sense interfered with or regulated by such a course; and, in many cases, the operations of the police power, although designed ess\u00e9ntially for other purposes, \u2014 for the protection, safety, and peace of the State, \u2014 may essentially promote and aid the interests of the owners. But such regulations can never be permitted to interfere with or to obstruct the just rights of the owner to reclaim his slave, derived from the Constitution of the United States, or with the remedies prescribed by Congress to aid and enforce the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Upon these grounds, we are of opinion that the act of Illinois, upon which this indictment is founded, is constitutional, and therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b33-8\">Mr. Justice McLEAN.</author>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">In the case of Prigg <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the police power of the States was not denied, but admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"AT\">This court held, in Fox <em>v. </em>The State of Ohio, (5 How. 410;) that a person might be punished under a law of the State for passing counterfeit coin, although the same offence was punishable under the act of Congress, and, consequently, that the co\u00f1viction and punishment under the State law; would be no bar to a prosecution under the law of. Congress. In that case I dissented, and gave at large the grounds of my dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">As the case now before us involves the same principle as was ruled in that case, I again! dissent for the reasons then given, and I deem it unnecessary now'to repeat them.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">It is contrary to the .nature and genius of our government, to punish an individual twice for the same offence.- Where the jurisdiction is clearly vested in the Fed\u00e9ral Government,-and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>an .adequate punishment has b\u00e9en provided by it for . an offence, no- State, it. appears to me, can punish the same act. The assertion of, such a .power involves the right of' a State to' punish all offences punishable under the acts of Congress. This would practically disregard, if it did not destroy, .this important branch of criminal justice, clearly vested in the Federal Government. The exercise of such' a power by the States would,in effect, be a-violation of'the Constitution of the United States, and the Cbnstitiition of the respective States. \u25a0 They all provide against a. second punishment for the same act. It is no \u2019satisfactory\u2019answer -to this, to say that the States' and Federal Government constitute different sovereignties, arid, consequently, may; each punish offenders under its own laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">It is true, the criminal laws of the Federal and State Governments emanate from different sovereignties; but they Operate \u2022upon th'e same people, and should have the same end in view. In this respect, the Federal Government, though sovereign within the limitation of- its powers, may, in some sense, be considered as -the agent of the States, to provide for the general welfare, by punishing offences under its own laws within its jurisdiction. It. is believed that no government, regulated by-laws, punishes twice criminally the same act. And I deeply regret that our government shouldfbe an exception to a great principle of action; sanctioned by humanity and justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">It .seems to. me it would be as unsatisfactory to an individual as it would be illegal, to say to him that he must submit tp a second punishment for the same act; because it is punishable as well-under the State laws, as' under the laws of the Federal Government. It is true he lives under the <em>ag\u00eds </em>of both laws; \u25a0 and .though he might yield to the power, he would riot be satisfied with the logic or justice of th\u00e9 argument;</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\n<em>Order-</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Supreme Court of the State of \u25a0 Illinois, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof,'it is now here ordered and adjudged by-this court, that the. judgment of the said Supreme Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
