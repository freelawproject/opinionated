Gutierrez argues his sentence, 60 months of which are to run consecutively to a 15-year state-court sentence, is procedurally unreasonable. Upon review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reject Gutierrez\u2019s argument and affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-22\">Gutierrez argues the district committed procedural errors by failing to consider the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and by failing to explain the sentence imposed. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (providing examples of procedural sentencing errors). More specifically, in the latter respect Gutierrez contends the district court did not adequately explain why it rejected his arguments concerning his criminal history and the costs of his incarceration. Each of Gutierrez\u2019s arguments is without merit. The district court expressly stated it \u201cconsidered the statements of all parties ... and the statutory factors,\u201d and this is sufficient. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>cient....\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). A court need not discuss each factor individually. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, although not required, the district court elaborated on its reasoning by stating that its decision was based in part on the serious crimes Gutierrez had committed after returning to the United States and not his improper return alone. This discussion further demonstrates that the district court considered Gutierrez\u2019s arguments for leniency and committed no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-17\">.
