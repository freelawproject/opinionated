California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Chappie has filed a response requesting an extension of time to respond to various orders to show cause issued by this court, and to investigate his counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-20\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Chappie\u2019s response. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Chappie\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claim without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014). Chappie\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED as unnecessary because counsel has adequately satisfied each order to show cause. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review because the defendant validly agreed to waive appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
