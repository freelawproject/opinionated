The district court dismissed the case, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In 2004, William Roper and Karen Roper purchased the subject property and executed a promissory note payable to Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. The note was secured by a deed of trust. Under the deed of trust, the Ropers were the borrowers, Countrywide was the lender, and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) was the beneficiary and the nominee for Countrywide. The deed of trust provides that MERS has \u201cthe right to foreclose and sell the Property.\u201d MERS assigned its interest in the deed of trust to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, which later merged into Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The property also had a recorded lien for assessments due to a homeowners\u2019 association (the S-G Owners Association, Inc.), established by a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (the Declaration). When the Ropers failed to pay assessments as they came due, the homeowners\u2019 association foreclosed on the property, and Morlock purchased the property at the foreclosure sale. The trustee\u2019s deed provides that the conveyance to Morlock \u201cis made and accepted subject to any superior liens ... against the property as provided for in the Declaration or at law.\u201d The Declaration itself provides that any homeowners\u2019 association lien \u201cshall be secondary, subordinate and inferior to all liens ... to secure the payment of monies advanced on account of the purchase price....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Bank of America later posted the property for a trustee\u2019s foreclosure sale. In response, Morlock filed a petition and application for temporary restraining order in Texas state court seeking to enjoin the foreclosure sale and quiet title to the property. Bank of America removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Morlock filed a response to the motion to dismiss, which included a request for leave to amend its complaint. The district court granted the motion to dismiss and denied Morlock\u2019s request for leave to amend. Morlock appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">We review de novo a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \u201c \u2018accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, \u201cplaintiffs must plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-17\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b391-18\">For essentially the reasons stated by the district court, we agree that dismissal was warranted. Morlock concedes that when it purchased the property at the homeowners\u2019 association foreclosure sale, it was subject to the deed of trust as a superior lien on the property. This is undisputable, as the trustee\u2019s deed provided that the conveyance to Morlock was subject to any superior liens against the property, and the Declaration provided that the home<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>owners\u2019 association lien was subordinate to mortgage liens. These documents were properly considered in deciding the motion to dismiss since they were matters of public record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Morlock nonetheless argues that it has stated a plausible quiet title claim under Texas law. According to Morlock, Bank of America could not foreclose because it was not the holder or owner of the note, but only the nominee and beneficiary under the deed of trust. Morlock also contends that the deed of trust could not be assigned to Bank of America without also assigning the underlying note to Bank of America, and that any assignment of the deed of trust would have to be signed by Countrywide. This court rejected these arguments in <em>Martins v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, </em>L.P,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, to the extent Morlock argues that the assignment of the deed of trust to Bank of America was made by an unauthorized individual, it has no standing to make this challenge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, Morlock has not stated a plausible quiet title claim since Bank of America did not lack authority to foreclose and Bank of America\u2019s claim is not otherwise invalid, unenforceable, or unlawful.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend the complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In requesting leave to amend, Morlock stated that it would add more specific factual allegations but never explained how such facts could change the legal effect of the documents submitted by Bank of America. Thus, as the district court concluded, leave to amend would have been futile.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">As a final matter, Morlock has previously raised the same arguments it made here in other appeals with nearly identical facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>and this court has rejected those arguments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Morlock is warned that frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings in the future will invite the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and/or restrictions on its ability to file pleadings in this court and other courts subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AND\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED and a sanctions warning is ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
