The district court ruled that Weaver\u2019s complaint was barred by the two-year statute of limitation for personal injuries. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-3-33. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">In 2007, a Georgia grand jury indicted Weaver for 40 offenses involving racketeering, conspiracy, and theft. Alltel and Robinson provided evidence to law enforcement that resulted in Weaver\u2019s indictment. In 2009, a jury found Weaver guilty of the 40 offenses. On March 26, 2010, the trial court granted Weaver\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. The State appealed, but on November 24, 2010, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The State petitioned for a writ of certiorari, but the Supreme Court of Georgia denied the petition on April 18, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">On April 15, 2013, Weaver filed in a Georgia court a complaint that he had been prosecuted maliciously by Alltel and Robinson. Alltel and Robinson removed Weaver\u2019s action to the district court based on diversity of citizenship. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). Later, Alltel and Robinson moved for summary judgment on the ground that Weaver\u2019s complaint was untimely, and the district court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">Under Georgia law, an \u201c[a]ction[] for injuries to the person shall be brought within two years after the right of action accrues.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-3-33. Section 9-3-33 requires that \u201ca suit for malicious prosecution must be brought within 2 years after the underlying criminal prosecution terminated in plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Daniel v. Ga. R.R. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>255 Ga. 29, 334 S.E.2d 659, 661 (1985). A termination in the plaintiff\u2019s favor occurs when there is a \u201cdefinite termination, by dismissal or otherwise, of the proceeding against the arrested party.\u201d <em>McCord v. Jones, </em>168 Ga.App. 891, 311 S.E.2d 209, 211 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">The criminal prosecution against Weaver terminated in his favor when the Georgia court granted his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. \u201cThe grant of ... [a defendant\u2019s] motion for a directed verdict of acquittal establishes ... that the criminal prosecution terminated in his favor.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Ga. Power Co., </em>186 Ga.App. 565, 367 S.E.2d 832, 834 (1988); <em>see Seven Hills Sec., Inc. v. Dillingham, </em>188 Ga.App. 1, 372 S.E.2d 1, 1-2 (1988). Weaver argues that the prosecution was not terminated until the Georgia Supreme Court denied the petition of the State for a writ of certiorari, but the State could not appeal the verdict directed in Weaver\u2019s favor. \u201cA directed verdict of acquittal is not appeal-able by the State when the defendant has been put in jeopardy[,]\u201d regardless of whether the \u201cacquittal is erroneously granted.\u201d <em>State v. Seignious, </em>197 Ga.App. 766, 399 S.E.2d 559, 560-61 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (citing Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-7-1). Weaver\u2019s criminal prosecution was terminated definitively when the trial court directed a verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">The district court did not err by entering summary judgment against Weaver\u2019s complaint of malicious prosecution. Weaver had two years from March 26, 2010, when his criminal case terminated in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>favor, to file a complaint against Alltel and Robinson. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-3-33; <em>Daniel, </em>255 Ga. 29, 334 S.E.2d at 661. Weaver waited more than three years, until April 18, 2013, to file his complaint. Weaver\u2019s complaint is barred by the two-year statute of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Weaver argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to reconsider, in which he argued, for the first time, that the statute of limitation was tolled until the conclusion of his civil forfeiture proceeding. The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to consider Weaver\u2019s new argument. It is not \u201c[t]he function of a motion to alter or amend a judgment ... to serve as a vehicle to ... present the case under a new legal theory ... [or] to give the moving party another \u2018bite at the apple\u2019 by permitting the arguing of issues and procedures that could and should have been raised prior to judgment.\u201d <em>Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1137 n. 69 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Alltel and Robinson.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
