Relying on <em>Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. (NFIB) v. Sebelius, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012), Collins contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) exceeds Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause. He argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied because the indictment did not state that his possession of the firearm was an economic activity and failed to reflect that he was engaged in the relevant market at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the time of the regulated conduct. Further, he contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is facially unconstitutional because <em>NFIB </em>interpreted the Commerce Clause to mandate that \u201cCongress may regulate only ongoing economic activity,\u201d and his possession of a firearm purchased many years ago does not qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">This court reviews preserved constitutional claims and the denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment de novo. <em>See United States v. Whaley, </em>577 F.3d 254, 256 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Kay, </em>513 F.3d 432, 440 (5th Cir.2007). In <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>889 F.2d 580, 583 (5th Cir.1989), and decisions following, this court held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) was a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause. <em>United States v. Alcantar, </em>733 F.3d 143, 145 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1570, 188 L.Ed.2d 579 (2014). <em>NFIB </em>did not overrule this court\u2019s precedent upholding \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 146. Accordingly, Collins\u2019s argument that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face is foreclosed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Furthermore, this court\u2019s cases upholding \u00a7 922(g)(1) uniformly establish that the statute is constitutional in that it properly regulates the possession of guns that have moved in interstate commerce. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996). There is no additional requirement that, to apply the law constitutionally, the Government must prove some economic activity beyond the interstate movement of the weapon. <em>See United States v. Meza, </em>701 F.3d 411, 418 (5th Cir.2012). Accordingly, Collins\u2019s constitutional challenge to the application of \u00a7 922(g)(1) also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
