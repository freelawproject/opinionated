Oates appeals from the entry of final judgment against him in a suit to recover benefits allegedly due to him under the terms of the Walgreen Income Protection Plan for Pharmacists and Registered Nurses (\u201cthe Plan\u201d). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling affirming or reversing a plan administrator\u2019s ERISA benefits decision, applying the same legal standards that governed the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>644 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">A. Relevant Plan Terms</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">The Summary Plan Description (\u201cSPD\u201d) states that it \u201cis the official Income Protection Plan governing document for purposes of describing the various plan provisions.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the SPD, defendant Walgreen Company (\u201cWal-greens\u201d) is the designated Plan Administrator, benefits are paid from Walgreens assets, and Walgreens is directly responsible for the final adjudication of disability claims. According to the SPD, a third party called Sedgwick CMS (\u201cSedgwick\u201d) is the Claim Administrator who handles initial claims determinations and appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-19\">According to the SPD, both Walgreens and Sedgwick have authority to \u201cconstrue and interpret the Plan and make benefit determinations, including claims and appeals determinations.\u201d That authority is exercisable \u201cas [Walgreens and Sedgwick] deem appropriate in their sole discretion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>According to the SPD, Sedgwick\u2019s benefit determinations are binding on all parties, \u201cexcept to the limited extent to which [Sedgwick\u2019s] decisions are subject to further review by [Walgreens].\u201d The SPD provides for further review by Walgreens if either Walgreens or Sedgwick \u201cdetermines that the appeal presents material issues that are outside the expertise or purview of [Sedgwick] (such as hours worked, employment status or new or unique procedural or Plan interpretation issues).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Below, Walgreens submitted a sworn declaration from a Sedgwick employee stating that, based on the declarant\u2019s personal knowledge and her review of Sedg-wick\u2019s business records, \u201c[u]nder the Plan, Sedgwick performs claims evaluations and makes determinations on specific claims .... Walgreens only provides information regarding the general eligibility for Plan benefits and regarding the duties and compensation of Walgreens employees participating in the Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Under the terms of the Plan, participants are required both to apply for Social Security disability benefits and also to appeal any denial of those benefits. If awarded, the Social Security disability benefits reduce the amount of benefits awarded under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">B. Sedgwick\u2019s Determination That Oates Was No Longer Entitled to Long-Term Disability Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">As relevant on appeal, Sedgwick terminated Oates\u2019s long-term disability benefits claim effective May 22, 2011. Oates twice appealed to Sedgwick, but both times Sedgwick upheld the termination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wal-greens was not involved with either the initial benefits determination or the appeals, and Oates never sought review by Walgreens.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Under the terms of the Plan, Oates was eligible for continued long-term disability benefits if, <em>inter alia, </em>as a \u201cdirect result\u201d of sickness or accidental injury he was \u201cunable to earn more than 60% of [his] indexed pre-disability earnings from any employer in [his] local economy at any gainful occupation for which [he was] reasonably qualified, taking into account [his] training, education, experience, and pre-disability earnings.\u201d Sedgwick maintains that Oates did not satisfy this criterion because he was able to work full-time in a sedentary capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">On appeal, Oates argues that Sedgwick failed to give due weight to evidence that he suffers from cognitive problems as a result of his medications, has problems with his hands, and is unable to sit for long periods of time. <em>See infra </em>Part IV. Oates also argues that Sedgwick failed to give due weight to the Social Security Administration\u2019s (\u201cSSA\u2019s\u201d) determination that Oates was entitled to Social Security disability benefits. <em>See infra </em>Part V. We summarize a subset of the evidence relevant to Oates\u2019s contentions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">1. Dr. Sweeney (Oates\u2019s Treating Physician)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">Oates\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Sweeney, opined that Oates had been permanently and totally disabled since May 2009 and was unable to work safely in any capacity. Oates submitted letters from Dr. Sweeney, addressed \u201cto whom it may concern,\u201d and records of multiple office visits between January 2010 and November 2011. These documents indicate that Oates regularly took multiple medications for chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. In these documents, Dr. Sweeney opined that Oates ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>hibited \u201c[cognitive dysfunction secondary to medication\u201d and was restricted to \u201cno critical thinking due to side effects of medications.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">Dr. Sweeney\u2019s letters and records also indicate that Oates had some hand trouble. For example, Dr. Sweeney described a \u201ctrigger finger phenomenon\u201d in Oates\u2019s right thumb. Elsewhere, Dr. Sweeney stated that Oates \u201ccannot do repetitive hand motion due to severe spasm and pain of his hands as well.\u201d In another record, Dr. Sweeney reported that both of Oates\u2019s hands had erythema,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that Oates experienced moderate pain in his right hand with motion, and that Oates\u2019s left hand had a moderately reduced range of motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">2. Dr. Puentes (Oates\u2019s Treating Chiropractor)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">In a letter dated November 18, 2011, addressed \u201c[t]o whom it may concern,\u201d Oates\u2019s treating chiropractor, Dr. Puentes, reported the following.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-7\">This office continues to see the above-mentioned patient for his severe osteo-arthritic, [sic] and degenerative conditions of the spine, neurogenic claudication of the lower extremities, chronic limitations and swelling of the knees, hands, and feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-8\">Mr. Oates is unable to perform any type of repetitive movements, long periods of standing, sitting, or lifting due to the patients [sic] permanent disability. The patients [sic] mental capacity is also severely limited due to the side effects of his medication. The patient becomes very lethargic, forgetful, and unable to perform the most basic procedures without modification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-14\">The patient is [sic] and never will be able to perform his chosen profession or any other type of employment in a safe capacity for himself as well as for the public safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-15\">[Oates\u2019s] physical condition will continue to worsen with time. He has been permanently and totally disabled since 2009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-16\">The record also contains notes from two of Oates\u2019s. visits to Dr. Puentes\u2019s office in May 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">3. Dr. Kutner (the SSA\u2019s Independent Medical Evaluator)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">As required under the terms of the Plan, Oates applied for Social Security disability benefits. Oates was ultimately awarded monthly Social Security disability benefits beginning in November 2009. Oates was notified of this award by a Notice of Award letter dated March 7, 2011. Oates provided the Notice of Award letter to Sedgwick.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-19\">As part of his application for Social Security disability benefits, Oates was required to visit an independent medical evaluator named Dr. Kutner. In a report dated January 28,- 2011, Dr. Kutner concluded that Oates \u201cwould not be able to do any type of work that requires him to be on his feet for long periods, no frequent bending, stooping or climbing.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dr. Kut-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>ner offered no opinion about Oates\u2019s capacity to perform sedentary work or work involving light physical exertion. Dr. Kut-ner indicated that Oates\u2019s chief complaint was \u201cpain in knees, back pains and difficulty standing up\u201d and that Oates reported \u201cdifficulty doing any activities of daily living.\u201d Dr. Kutner also observed that Oates had driven to the clinic alone and was \u201calert, oriented pleasant and cooperative,\u201d although he \u201cappeare[ed] to be somewhat depressed over his situation.\u201d Dr. Kutner observed \u201cno evidence of any arthritis in any of [Oates\u2019s] extremities\u201d and that the range of motion in Oates\u2019s hands was \u201cwithin normal limits with no limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">4. Sedgwick\u2019s Seven Independent Physician Advisers</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">At various points in the process, Sedg-wick had Oates\u2019s file reviewed by multiple independent physician advisers. None of these physicians observed Oates directly, but some communicated directly with Oates\u2019s treating physicians. Each independent physician adviser stated in his or her report that he or she was not operating under a conflict of interest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">In a report dated November 13, 2009, an orthopedic surgeon named Dr. Mendelssohn concluded that, based on then-existing medical documentation, Oates \u201ccan certainly function in a sedentary-to-light physical exertion level provided he can change positions as needed and does not have to climb ladders, stand for an extended period of time, or walk long distances.\u201d As part of his review, Dr. Mendelssohn spoke with Dr. Sweeney by telephone. In his report, Dr. Mendelssohn rejected Dr. Sweeney\u2019s opinion that Oates \u201ccannot return to any gainful employment because of pain and the need for medications which may affect his cognitive ability.\u201d Dr. Mendelssohn asserted that \u201cthere is no documentation provided that [Oates\u2019s] cognitive ability has been hampered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">In a report dated November 13, 2009, a pain medicine specialist named Dr. J. Lewis concluded that, from a pain medicine perspective, the then-existing medical documentation did not support a conclusion that Oates was disabled from performing sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">In a report dated September 20, 2011, a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation named Dr. M. Lewis concluded that \u201c[s]edentary type of work may be applicable in this situation.\u201d Dr. M. Lewis stated that Oates\u2019s primary diagnosis was severe knee arthritis, which limited \u201chis ability to be able to stand or walk for prolonged periods of time.\u201d Dr. M. Lewis found no evidence, however, that Oates was \u201cdisabled from any occupation for which he might be qualified by education, training, or experience during the time period in question.\u201d He specifically documented, <em>inter alia, </em>his review of Dr. Kutner\u2019s assessment for the SSA, as well as several failed attempts to reach Dr. Kutner. Dr. M. Lewis also documented his review of Dr. Sweeney\u2019s statements regarding Oates\u2019s purported cognitive dysfunction and hand problems, although he did not directly address these statements in his analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">In a report dated September 20, 2011, a specialist in occupational medicine named Dr. Ayyar concluded that Oates</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqLu\">would not be able to perform prolonged standing and walking and heavy lifting, kneeling, stooping, squatting, etc. He can, however, do sedentary work. There is no compelling evidence that Mr. Oates is disabled from any occupa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>tion for which he might be qualified by education, training, or experience ... [from May 22, 2011,] through present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9i\">Dr. Ayyar recounted a conversation with Dr. Sweeney in which Dr. Sweeney stated that Oates\u2019s principal diagnosis supporting disability was \u201cbilateral knee osteoarthritis\u201d but that, in Dr. Sweeney\u2019s mind, Oates was \u201cdisabled from any number of conditions.\u201d Dr. Ayyar also specifically documented, <em>inter alia, </em>a review of Dr. Kut-ner\u2019s report for the SSA, as well as several failed attempts to reach Dr. Kutner. Dr. Ayyar specifically documented a review of Dr. Sweeney\u2019s statements regarding Oates\u2019s purported hand problems and cognitive dysfunction, although Dr. Ayyar did not address these statements in his analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">In a report dated February 7, 2012, a psychiatrist named Dr. Rigaud concluded that, from a strictly psychiatric perspective, Oates \u201cwas not disabled from the ability to perform any occupation for which he may be qualified by education, training or experience as of May 22, 2011[,] to return to work date.\u201d Dr. Rigaud stated that there was \u201cno evidence from the available information to support a disabling psychiatric diagnoses [sic]\u201d and that \u201c[Reported cognitive dysfunctions/limitations and inability to engage in critical thinking are not validated by findings of a mini mental status examination or direct clinical observations.\u201d Dr. Rigaud documented a phone conversation with Dr. Puentes, who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-8\">reported observing [that Oates] was lethargic and in [Oates\u2019s] own words \u201cloopy\u201d at times. [Dr. Puentes] believes this is due to pain medications and not to alcohol or other illicit substances.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] ... Dr. Puentes stated that [Oates] has no problem driving to the office \u2014 that is a short distance from his home. He noted that [Oates] has difficulty with his gait and his speech is a \u201clittle slurred.\u201d Dr. Puentes has not observed evidence of problems with concentration such as loss of train of thoughts. Dr. Puentes has not had to write down instructions for [Oates]; who seems to retain instructions and directions he received from Dr Puentes. [Dr. Puentes] emphasized primarily [Oates\u2019s] physical limitations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Dr. Rigaud did not specifically address Dr. Kutner\u2019s report for the SSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">In a report dated February 7, 2012, a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation and pain medicine named Dr. Kap-lan concluded, after a thorough review of the records before him, that they \u201c[did] not validate that this claimant is disabled from performing any occupation for which he may be qualified from May 22, 2011[,] to return to work date.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to Dr. Kaplan, Oates had a \u201cpartial impairment, but is not disabled from all work.\u201d Dr. Kaplan opined that \u201cthe records contain very limited objective functional assessment of [Oates\u2019s] physical ability.\u201d Dr. Kaplan also noted that \u201ccognitive defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>cits from medications are potentially treatable\u201d and that \u201cthe records are unclear regarding the specific cause of [Oates\u2019s] perceived cognitive symptoms.\u201d He recounted conversations with Dr. Sweeney and Dr. Puentes in which both reported that Oates often \u201cappears drowsy\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and in which Dr. Sweeney reported that Oates had severe intractable pain in his, <em>inter alia, </em>hands. Dr. Kaplan referred to Oates\u2019s Social Security disability benefits award but did not specifically address it in his analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">In a report dated February 7, 2012, a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation and pain medicine named Dr. Marion concluded that Oates was \u201cable to work full time at the sedentary job level.\u201d Dr. Marion recounted a conversation with Dr. Sweeney in which the latter acknowledged that \u201che had not specifically performed a cognitive evaluation or assessment and had not restricted [Oates] from driving a motor vehicle.\u201d In that conversation, Dr. Sweeney also indicated that Oates had complaints of severe pain in his, <em>inter alia, </em>hands. Dr. Marion specifically documented his review of Dr. Kutner\u2019s report for the SSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">5. Mr. Percic\u2019s (Sedgwick\u2019s) Transferable Skills Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">At Sedgwick\u2019s request, a Mr. Percic completed an analysis of Oates\u2019s \u201ctransferable skills.\u201d Mr. Percic\u2019s report is dated May 20, 2011. According to his report, Mr. Percic reviewed, <em>inter alia, </em>the reports of Dr. J. Lewis and Dr. Mendelssohn, as well as a letter from Dr. Sweeney dated January 25, 2011, and a note from Oates\u2019s visit to Dr. Sweeney\u2019s office on January 20, 2011. Mr. Percic also reviewed a Training, Education, and Experience statement submitted by Oates, which indicated, for example, that Oates had worked for over twenty years as a pharmacist and had a Bachelor of Science degree in Pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Based on Dr. Mendelssohn\u2019s report, Mr. Percic discounted Dr. Sweeney\u2019s assertion that Oates was restricted to \u201cno critical thinking due to side effects of medications.\u201d Mr. Percic also asserted that there was \u201cno additional medical to support the statement of Dr. Sweeney that Mr. Oates is unable to perform repetitive hand motions due to severe spasm and pain of his hands.\u201d Mr. Percic consequently assumed, for the sake of his analysis, that Oates was able to work in a \u201csedentary or light physical exertion level occupation in which he is able to change positions as needed and not require [sic] long distance walking, standing for extended periods of time, climbing stairs or ladders, or bending, stooping, and kneeling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Mr. Percic also concluded \u2014 apparently based on Oates\u2019s reports of his own training, education, and experience \u2014 that Oates had demonstrated transferable skills including, but not limited to, \u201cknowledge of drugs and drug interactions, basic medical knowledge, customer service skills, good communication skills, supervisory skills, management skills, good arithmetic skills, organizational ability, computer skills, typing skills, and good judgment and decision-making skills.\u201d Using the SkillTRAN online computer database, Mr. Percic identified several vocational alternatives for Oates in his geographic area with a mean annual wage of $113,844.80 \u2014 substantially more than 60% ($67,392.00) of Oates\u2019s pre-disability annual earnings, which was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>threshold established by the applicable Plan eligibility standard. <em>See supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">6. Ms. Pennachio\u2019s (Oates\u2019s) Transferable Skills Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">As part of his second appeal, Oates submitted his own Vocational Evaluation report dated December 12, 2011, which was prepared by one Ms. Pennachio. The report contains a lengthy review of Oates\u2019s medical records. According to the report, Ms. Pennachio met with Oates on November 18, 2011, and recorded his own description of his \u201cperceptions of his physical capabilities,\u201d including that he could sit for only \u201c1 hour, but ... must sit forward for comfort.\u201d The report contains a transferable skills analysis that was conducted using OASYS software, \u201ctaking into account at least sedentary restrictions.\u201d The analysis produced zero vocational alternatives, let alone any in which Oates could earn at least 60% of his pre-disability earnings. It is not entirely clear why Ms. Pennachio\u2019s analysis yielded zero vocational alternatives while Mr. Percic\u2019s yielded several, but it appears that Ms. Pennachio believed Oates had fewer transferable skills. In her report, Ms. Pennachio specifically challenged each of Mr. Percic\u2019s proposed vocational alternatives on the ground that Oates was either underqualified, disabled, or both. Ms. Pennachio concluded that Oates \u201cdoes not have the ability to perform any occupation for which he may be qualified by education, training or experience within his physical capabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">C. The Instant Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Oates filed suit against Walgreens in federal district court, attaching the SPD as an exhibit to his complaint. In a motion to, <em>inter alia, </em>limit discovery to the existing administrative record, Walgreens made three .relevant assertions. First, Wal-greens expressed its belief that there was no dispute regarding which documents governed the Plan. Second, Walgreens\u2014 arguing from the SPD \u2014 asserted that the Plan vested Sedgwick with sufficient discretion such that Sedgwick\u2019s benefits determinations should be reviewed under an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. <em>See, e.g., Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>644 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). Third, Walgreens asserted that there was no structural conflict of interest because the entity paying the claims, Wal-greens, was not the same as the entity evaluating the claims, Sedgwick.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Oates apparently did not submit a written response to Walgreens\u2019s motion. At a subsequent hearing, however, Oates asserted that the SPD was merely a summary and that he \u201c[did] not concede that that is the Plan.\u201d Oates did not challenge Walgreens\u2019s assertion that the Plan vested Sedgwick with discretion. Oates argued that there was a conflict of interest, however, because Walgreens had authority to be involved in benefits determinations and may have, at least, participated in the decision to terminate Oates\u2019s benefits. Oates sought to supplement the administrative record with discovery regarding both whether there was a conflict of interest and also how the claims benefits determinations were actually made.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">The district court held that there was no conflict of interest and that the administrator\u2019s determination would be reviewed under an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. The court permitted Oates to serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>five interrogatories and five requests for admission, limited in scope to the following four issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-4\">1) the exact nature of the information considered by [Sedgwick] in making the decision; 2) whether Sedgwick was competent to evaluate the information in the administrative record; 3) how Sedgwick reached its decision; and 4) whether, given the nature of the information in the record, it was incumbent upon Sedg-wick to seek outside assistance in addressing the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Oates apparently never served any written discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Pursuant to the district court\u2019s order, the parties submitted memoranda of law in support of their respective positions. The district court reviewed the termination of Oates\u2019s long-term disability benefits pursuant to this Circuit\u2019s six-step test, which is as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-7\">(1) Apply the <em>de novo </em>standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u201cwrong\u201d (i.e., the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-8\">(2) If the administrator\u2019s decision in fact is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong,\u201d then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-9\">(3) If the administrator\u2019s decision is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong\u201d and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \u201creasonable\u201d grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under -the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-10\">(4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator\u2019s decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-13\">(5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-14\">(6) If there is a conflict, the conflict should merely be a factor for the court to take into account when determining whether an administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-15\"><em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">The district court first concluded that Sedgwick\u2019s decision was not \u201cwrong.\u201d The court alternatively concluded that, even if Sedgwick made the \u201cwrong\u201d decision, it was vested with sufficient discretion to invoke the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of review, and its decision was supported by \u201creasonable\u201d grounds. Finally, the district court reiterated its conclusion that Sedgwick did not operate under a conflict of interest and opined that, even if it did, that factor was not so significant as to render the decision \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The court affirmed the termination of Oates\u2019s long-term disability benefits and ordered the entry of judgment in Walgreens\u2019s favor. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-17\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b932-18\">For the first time on appeal, Oates challenges Walgreens\u2019s assertion that the Plan vested Sedgwick with sufficient discretion to invoke the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of review. Oates makes this argument despite having asserted multiple times below that the Plan gave <em>both </em>Walgreens and Sedgwick discretion to make claims determinations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-19\">Oates also argues, for the first time on appeal, that it was improper for the district court to draw conclusions about Sedg-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>wick\u2019s discretion under the Plan from the SPD because the SPD had not been authenticated or entered into evidence. Oates makes this argument despite having invited consideration of the SPD by attaching a copy of it as an exhibit to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">In addition, Oates argues that the district court\u2019s discovery order<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> prevented him from pursuing discovery that might have revealed \u201cdefects\u201d in the SPD.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Oates did not argue below for additional discovery on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">We decline to consider these arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Ramirez v. Sec\u2019y, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>686 F.3d 1239, 1249-50 (11th Cir.2012). We have reviewed Oates\u2019s arguments and are not persuaded that our refusal to consider them will result in a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1250. We consequently limit our review to the question of whether Sedgwick\u2019s determination was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1355. Oates bore the burden to establish that it was. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">III. WHETHER SEDGWICK OPERATED UNDER A CONFLICT OF INTEREST</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">If a plan administrator operates under a conflict of interest, that conflict is a factor to consider when determining whether the administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Oates challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that Sedgwick did not operate under a conflict of interest. Oates\u2019s primary argument is that Sedgwick has a financial incentive to deny claims. Oates suggests that some unknown financial arrangement between Walgreens and Sedgwick may give Sedgwick a direct financial incentive to deny claims.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Oates also argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Walgreens, as the payor, might prefer a claim administrator that denies more claims, resulting in indirect pressure on Sedgwick to deny claims so that it can keep its business with Walgreens.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Again, Oates failed to make these arguments below. Oates argued that the determination of his claim was tainted by a conflict of interest, but his argument was that the payor, Walgreens, had somehow participated in or influenced the decision. Oates did not argue, as he does now, that Sedgwick operated under a conflict of interest because it had a financial incentive to deny claims. Oates had the opportunity to make these arguments at the hearing on Walgreens\u2019s motion to, <em>inter alia, </em>limit discovery. In its motion, Walgreens had already argued that there was no conflict of interest, and it was clear that that question would be discussed at the hearing. Oates did not respond to Walgreens\u2019s motion in writing and did not make these arguments at the hearing. Nor did Oates make these arguments at any other point before the district court. We decline to entertain these arguments made for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">To the extent that Oates reasserts a version of the argument that he <em>did </em>make <em>below </em>\u2014 ie., that Walgreens had the authority to reverse Sedgwick\u2019s decisions and may have participated in the final decision to uphold the termination of Oates\u2019s benefits \u2014 that argument does not persuade us that there was reversible error. According to the SPD, Sedgwick\u2019s decisions are subject to further review by Walgreens only if either Sedgwick or Walgreens \u201cdetermines that the appeal presents material issues that are outside the expertise or purview of [Sedgwick] (such as hours worked, employment status or new or unique procedural or Plan interpretation issues).\u201d Even if the language regarding \u201cnew or unique ... Plan interpretation issues\u201d indicates that Wal-greens has the power to reverse Sedg-wick\u2019s Plan interpretations, it does not indicate that Walgreens has the power to reverse Sedgwick\u2019s factual determinations. More specifically, it does not indicate that Walgreens had the power to reverse Sedgwick\u2019s factual determinations with respect to Oates\u2019s condition and transferable skills. It is those determinations that Oates challenges on appeal. <em>See infra </em>Part IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Finally, to the extent, if any, that Wal-greens\u2019s limited power of review created a conflict of interest, the district court did not err in its alternative holding that the conflict was not significant enough to render Sedgwick\u2019s decision \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in light of the other factors. A conflict of interest should be weighed more heavily \u201cwhere circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision.\u201d <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>554 U.S. 105, 117, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 2351, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008). The converse is also true. There is no indication that the payor, Walgreens, directly influenced Sedgwick\u2019s determination.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is possible that the mere prospect of reversal influenced Sedgwick\u2019s decision, but the district court was not required to attach great weight to this possibility in the circumstances at bar. We note, in particular, the sworn declaration of a Sedgwick employee that \u201c[u]nder the Plan, Sedgwick performs claims evaluations and makes determinations on specific claims .... Walgreens only provides information regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>general eligibility for Plan benefits and regarding the duties and compensation of Walgreens employees participating in the Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">IV. WHETHER SEDGWICK IGNORED RELEVANT AND RELIABLE EVIDENCE THAT OATES\u2019S MEDICATION CAUSED HIM COGNITIVE PROBLEMS, THAT OATES HAD PROBLEMS WITH HIS HANDS, AND THAT OATES WAS UNABLE TO SIT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME</p>\n<p id=\"ADg\">Where there is no conflict of interest, an administrator\u2019s benefits decision is not \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d if it has a \u201creasonable basis\u201d in the material available to the administrator at the time of the decision. <em>See Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Oates correctly observes that only Mr. Percic\u2019s and Ms. Pennachio\u2019s transferable skills analyses applied the specific standard at issue in this case, i.e., whether as a \u201cdirect result\u201d of Oates\u2019s sickness or accidental injury he was \u201cunable to earn more than 60% of [his] indexed pre-disability earnings from any employer in [his] local economy at any gainful occupation for which [he was] reasonably qualified, taking into account [his] training, education, experience, and predisability earnings.\u201d Oates argues that it was arbitrary and capricious for Sedgwick to rely on Mr. Percic\u2019s May 2011 analysis because, <em>inter alia, </em>it did not incorporate more recent medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">We disagree. Sedgwick was not required to conclude that medical opinions obtained subsequent to Mr. Percic\u2019s analysis undermined the assumption on which it was <em>based </em>\u2014 ie., the assumption that Oates was able to work in a \u201csedentary or light physical exertion level occupation in which he is able to change positions as needed and not require [sic] long distance walking, standing for extended periods of time, climbing stairs or ladders, or bending, stooping, and kneeling.\u201d We are likewise not persuaded that it was arbitrary and capricious for Sedgwick to favor Mr. Per-cic\u2019s transferable skills analysis over Ms. Pennachio\u2019s more recent analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Oates argues that even if Mr. Percic\u2019s analysis was not out of date, it was nevertheless based on unreliable medical evidence. Specifically, Oates argues that Sedgwick\u2019s independent physician advisers \u2014 including Dr. Mendelssohn, upon whom Mr. Percic relied \u2014 gave insufficient weight to evidence of Oates\u2019s cognitive dysfunction, hand problems, and difficulty sitting for extended periods of time. Oates argues that it was, therefore, arbitrary and capricious for Sedgwick to rely on a transferable skills analysis that relied on Dr. Mendelssohn\u2019s medical opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Again, we disagree. A plan administrator \u201cmay not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant\u2019s rehable evidence,\u201d <em>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 834, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 1972, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003), or \u201csimply ignore[] relevant medical evidence in order to arrive at the conclusion it desire[s],\u201d <em>Oliver v. Coca Cola Co., </em>497 F.3d 1181, 1199 (11th Cir.), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>506 F.3d 1316 (11th Cir.2007). A plan administrator is not categorically required, however, to accept the opinions of the claimant\u2019s treating physicians over those of independent medical professionals who have reviewed the claimant\u2019s file but have not directly observed the claimant. <em>See Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1356.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Mr. Percic crucially relied on Dr. Mendelssohn\u2019s opinion. By the time Sedgwick upheld the termination of Oates\u2019s benefits for the second time, Sedgwick had before it the reports of six other independent physician advisers who had reviewed Oates\u2019s file. These reports permitted Sedgwick to conclude that Dr. Mendelssohn\u2019s opinion was correct, at least in its crucial aspects. Specifically, three of these other physicians \u2014 specialists in pain medicine, occupational medicine, and physical medicine and rehabilitation \u2014 agreed that Oates was capable of performing sedentary work, and none of them disagreed. Two of these physicians \u2014 including a psychiatrist, Dr. Rigaud \u2014 agreed that evidence of Oates\u2019s cognitive problems was unpersuasive; two \u2014 again including Dr. Rigaud \u2014 suggested possible alternative explanations for Oates\u2019s purported cognitive dysfunction, such as alcohol consumption or sleep apnea; and one stated that any cognitive dysfunction resulting from Oates\u2019s medications was potentially treatable. In addition, four of these physicians specifically documented their consideration of Dr. Sweeney\u2019s statements that Oates suffered from hand problems (although apparently none of them addressed these statements in their written analyses).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">In sum, Sedgwick had conflicting evidence before it, and evidence tending to establish that Oates was able to perform sedentary work was not obviously unreliable. We conclude that Sedgwick was permitted to deny Oates\u2019s benefits on the basis of this evidence. <em>See Oliver, </em>497 F.3d at 1199 (stating that a plan administrator may deny a claim \u201con the basis of conflicting, reliable evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">V. WHETHER SEDGWICK FAILED TO GIVE PROPER CONSIDERATION TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\u2019S DISABILITY DETERMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"AI36\">Oates additionally argues that Sedgwick\u2019s determination was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d because it failed to give sufficient weight to the SSA\u2019s determination that Oates was entitled to disability benefits. \u201c \u2018[A] district court may consider the Social Security Administration\u2019s determination of disability in reviewing a plan administrator\u2019s determination of benefits,\u2019 \u201d but \u201cthe approval of disability benefits by the Social Security Administration is not considered dispositive on the issue.\u201d <em>Whatley v. CNA Ins. Cos., </em>189 F.3d 1310, 1314 n. 8 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Kirwan v. Marriott Corp., </em>10 F.3d 784, 790 n. 32 (11th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">We reject Oates\u2019s argument that the mere failure to consider the award of benefits rendered Sedgwick\u2019s determination \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d This is not a case in which Sedgwick \u201cignore[d] the evidence generated by the SSA process.\u201d <em>Melech v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>739 F.3d 663, 675 (11th Cir.2014). In a letter memorializing the initial termination of Oates\u2019s benefits, Sedgwick asserted that it had previously requested a copy of the SSA\u2019s Independent Medical Examination and that Oates had failed to provide a copy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Once Oates provided a copy of Dr. Kutner\u2019s report as part of his first appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Sedgwick provided it to each of the independent physician advisers who reviewed Oates\u2019s file during both his first and his second appeals. Multiple advisers specifically referred to Dr. Kutner\u2019s findings, which were not obviously inconsistent with the conclusion that Oates was capable of working in a sedentary capacity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, the instant case is very different from <em>Melech, </em>in which the plan administrator deemed irrelevant the SSA award and the evidence on which it was based. <em>Me-lech, </em>739 F.3d at 671-72. The instant case does not involve the \u201cprocedural unfairness\u201d which we found in <em>Melech. See id. </em>at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">We cannot conclude that Sedgwick, having considered Dr. Kutner\u2019s report, was also required to specifically consider either the Social Security award itself or the contents of the Notice of Award letter. The Notice of Award letter contained no information whatsoever about Oates\u2019s condition or the process by which the SSA had reached its decision. Sedgwick\u2019s determination that Oates was not disabled is, of course, in some discord with the SSA\u2019s determination that he was, which was made under a perhaps more stringent standard.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> An administrator departing from the SSA may be well-advised, whenever possible, \u201cto draw a principled distinction between its own standards for granting disability benefits under [a plan] and the SSA\u2019s standards for awarding SSDI.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676. But having considered what is apparently the only substantive evidence generated by the SSA process,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and having found it not inconsistent with the opinions of its independent physician advisers, Sedgwick did not act arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to explain its departure from the SSA\u2019s opinion. <em>See Paramore v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>129 F.3d 1446, 1452 n. 5 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c[A]n award of benefits by the Social Security Administration is not dispositive of the issue before us, particularly given the measure of deference that we afford a plan administrator\u2019s decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">We note that it may have been difficult for Sedgwick to explain its decision in light of the apparently limited evidence generated by the SSA process. We also note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>the SSA, unlike ERISA claim administrators, is generally required to give more weight to the opinions of a claimant\u2019s treating physicians. <em>See Black &amp; Decker, </em>538 U.S. at 829, 123 S.Ct. at 1969. Finally, we note that in both <em>Melech </em>and <em>Glenn v. MetLife, </em>on which Oates primarily relies, the entity paying the claims was the same as the entity evaluating the claims, which created a structural conflict of interest. <em>See Melech, </em>739 F.3d at 668 (\u201c[E]very dollar the claimant gets from the SSA is one less dollar [the defendant] has to pay.\u201d); <em>Glenn v. MetLife, </em>461 F.3d 660, 666 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201c[Defendant] is authorized both to decide whether an employee is eligible for benefits and to pay those benefits\u201d), aff<em>'d, </em>554 U.S. 105, 112, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 2348, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008). As discussed, <em>supra </em>Part III, that was not the situation in this case.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-12\">. For the first time on appeal, Oates argues that the Summary Plan Description does not accurately describe the terms of the Plan.

Oates later mailed a copy to Sedgwick during his first appeal. The record indicates that Sedgwick provided a copy of Dr. Kutner's report to every independent physician adviser who reviewed Oates\u2019s file during Oates\u2019s first and second appeals. <em>See infra </em>Part I.B.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b928-7\">.

Dr. Rigaud had before her a Vocational Evaluation Report created by one Ms. Penna-chio, <em>see infra </em>Part I.B.6, which indicates that Oates reported drinking eight to ten beers per day.

At the time of his review, Dr. Kaplan had before him the Vocational Evaluation Report created by Ms. Pennachio, <em>see infra </em>Part I.B.6. Dr. Kaplan discounted the Vocational Evaluation Report to the extent that Ms. Pennachio relied on subjective reports of Oates\u2019s abilities that were not based on physical examination or functional assessment data. For the first time on appeal, Oates argues that it was improper to discount Ms. Pennachio's findings on the basis that she relied on Oates\u2019s self-reports. <em>See Oliver v. Coca Cola Co., </em>497 F.3d 1181, 1196 (11th Cir.), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>506 F.3d 1316 (11th Cir.2007).

According to Dr. Kaplan, it appeared from the medical records that Oates had \"the diagnosis of sleep apnea as well as chronic pain.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b931-9\">. Oates's attorney stated that he sought both discovery \"because of the conflict\u201d and also <em>\"Cerrito </em>type discovery with regard to the actual claims decisions that were made.\u201d The word <em>\"Cerrito </em>\u201d is a reference to <em>Cerrito v.

Oates made these assertions as part of his attempt to argue that Walgreens had participated in the decision to terminate Oates\u2019s benefits and that there was, therefore, a conflict of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b933-7\">. Walgreens observes that Oates did not mention the discovery order in his notice of appeal and argues that Oates consequently may not challenge it on appeal. We disagree. ''[T]he appeal from a final judgment draws in question all prior non-final orders and rulings which produced the judgment.\u201d <em>Barfield v. Brierton, </em>883 F.2d 923, 930 (11th Cir.1989). Because the district court\u2019s discovery order was a step toward the final judgment, rather than an order \"separate from that progression,\u201d we have jurisdiction to review the discovery order on appeal. <em>See </em>16A Charles Alan Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3949.4, at 100-105 (4th ed. 2008) (\"A notice of appeal that names the final judgment suffices to support review of all earlier orders that merge in the final judgment ..., at least if the earlier orders are part of the progression that led up to the judgment rather than being separate from that progression.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b933-8\">. Oates relies heavily on <em>Wilson v. Walgreen Income Protection Plan for Pharmacists and Registered Nurses, </em>942 F.Supp.2d 1213, 1248-50 (M.D.Fla.2013). The Wilson court conducted a bench trial on the issue of \u201cwhether the grant of discretion to Sedgwick under [the] Summary Plan Description ... was effective to entitle Defendants to a review of Sedgwick\u2019s resolution of Plaintiff's [long-term disability] claim under a deferential standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1217. Obviously the evidence and testimony introduced in the <em>Wilson </em>bench trial was not before the district court in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\">. Oates relies only on <em>Wilson, </em>942 F.Supp.2d at 1227, to support this proposition. As previously stated, <em>supra </em>note 14, the evidence and testimony before the <em>Wilson </em>court was not before the district court in this case. As Walgreens points out, furthermore, the <em>Wilson </em>court did not hold that Sedgwick operates under a conflict of interest when it acts as the Claim Administrator for this Plan. In addition, the <em>Wilson </em>court\u2019s discussion of the financial arrangement between Walgreens and Sedgwick does not uniformly support the proposition that Walgreens gives Sedgwick a direct financial incentive to deny claims. For example, the court in <em>Wilson </em>recounted testimony that \u201cSedgwick is paid monthly for every open claim. Further, if [a long-term disability] claim is granted, then the claim remains \u2018open\u2019 for purposes of calculating the fee collected by Sedgwick.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, even if we were to consider <em>Wilson </em>for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>purpose of determining whether Walgreens gives Sedgwick a direct financial incentive to deny claims, it is not at all clear that <em>Wilson </em>supports Oates\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b934-9\">.
