California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Anyanwu has filed responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">By unconditionally pleading guilty, Any-anwu waived his right to appeal of the denial of his motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Sanchez Guerrero, </em>546 F.3d 328, 331 (5th Cir.2008). The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Anyanwu\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, invalid guilty plea or waiver; we therefore decline to consider these claims without prejudice to collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Corbett, </em>742 F.2d 173, 176-78 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s briefs and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Anyanwu\u2019s responses. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. See 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
