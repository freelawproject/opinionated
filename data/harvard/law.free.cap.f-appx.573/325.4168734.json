He challenges the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) imposed for his prior conviction for statutory rape under Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 39-13-506(b). According to Robinson-Jesus, the district court erred by applying the enhancement because \u00a7 39-13-506 criminalizes sexual intercourse with someone under the age of 18 whereas the generic, contemporary definition of \u201cstatutory rape\u201d \u2014 as it is defined by the Model Penal Code and the laws of various states \u2014 prohibits intercourse with someone under the age of 16. The Government has filed an unopposed motion for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-22\">In <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 544 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 512, 187 L.Ed.2d 365 (2013), we held that a \u201cplain-meaning approach\u201d applies to the determination of the \u201cgeneric, contemporary\u201d meaning of statutory rape under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Under this approach, the court looks to the age of consent as it is \u201cdefined by statute in the jurisdiction where the prior conviction was obtained\u201d instead of conducting the \u201ccumbersome\u201d survey of state codes, the Model Penal Code, federal law, and treatises that Robinson-Jesus urges. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-24\">Robinson-Jesus concedes that the issue is foreclosed by <em>Rodriguez </em>and raises it merely to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
