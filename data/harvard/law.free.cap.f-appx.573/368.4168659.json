Zhang sought relief based on his participation in underground Christian church activities, for which he was arrested and beaten, and his fear that he would be persecuted if he returned to China. The immigration judge (IJ) determined that Zhang was not credible and had failed to establish that he was entitled to relief and ordered Zhang removed to China. The BIA agreed and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">We review the factual determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). Under that standard, we may not reverse an immigration court\u2019s factual findings unless \u201cthe evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d at 531, 537 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">Zhang argues that the IJ and BIA erred in making an adverse credibility determination because the discrepancies relied upon were minor and did not go to the heart of his claim for relief. However, in making a credibility determination, the trier of fact considers the totality of the circumstances \u201cwithout regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Even if there could be reasonable explanations for some of the omissions and discrepancies, it is not plain, based on the totality of the circumstances, that no reasonable factfinder could make an adverse credibility ruling. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-23\">As for Zhang\u2019s argument that the IJ and BIA erred in concluding that he was not entitled to asylum because his detention and the sole incident of mistreatment during his detention did not rise to the level of persecution, he has failed to show that the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 306 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>(5th Cir.2005). Zhang also has failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution if he is returned to China. <em>See id. </em>at B07. There is no evidence that Zhang would be singled out for persecution or that there is a pattern or practice of persecuting Christians in China. <em>Id.; see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(2)(b)(iii). Moreover, members of Zhang\u2019s family continue to live in China and practice their Christianity at an underground church without suffering any harm. <em>See, e.g., Mei He v. Holder, </em>442 Fed.Appx. 172, 174 (5th Cir.2011) (noting, inter alia, that alien\u2019s parents practiced Christianity in a government-monitored church as well as a family, or underground, church in determining that alien had failed to demonstrate fear of future persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Because the burden of establishing eligibility for withholding of removal is greater than that required for asylum, Zhang\u2019s failure to establish eligibility for asylum is dispositive of his claim for withholding of removal. <em>Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir.2006). Zhang also has failed to show that the evidence compels a conclusion \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to his home country.\u201d <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Accordingly, Zhang\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. The Government\u2019s motion to strike the petitioner\u2019s brief for noncompliance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28 is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
