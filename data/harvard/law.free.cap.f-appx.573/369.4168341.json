He avers that the record reflects that he immediately complied with the district court\u2019s fee order by sending a letter to prison officials authorizing the release of funds from his inmate trust account. Lucas avers that the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint should be vacated and that he be reimbursed the $455 appellate court filing fee. Lucas cites no authority that would allow this court to return the filing fee, and his request is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Pursuant to Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a district court may dismiss a complaint sua sponte if a plaintiff fails to follow a court order. <em>Long v. Simmons, </em>77 F.3d 878, 879 (5th Cir. 1996); FED. R. CIV. P. 41(b). We ordinarily review such a dismissal under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See McNeal v. Papasan, </em>842 F.2d 787, 789-90 (5th Cir.1988). However, the scope of the district court\u2019s discretion is narrow when the Rule 41(b) dismissal is with prejudice or when a statute of limitations would bar re-prosecution of a suit dismissed without prejudice under Rule 41(b). <em>See Berry v. CIGNA/RSI-CIGNA, </em>975 F.2d 1188, 1190-91 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice will very likely operate as a dismissal with prejudice because Lucas will be barred by the one-year limitations period for seeking \u00a7 1983 relief. <em>See Henson-El v. Rogers, </em>923 F.2d 51, 52 (5th Cir.1991); LA. CIV. CODE ANN. art. 3492. Therefore, dismissal \u201cis appropriate only if the failure to comply with the court order was the result of purposeful delay or con-tumaciousness and the record reflects that the district court employed lesser sanctions before dismissing the action.\u201d <em>Long, </em>77 F.3d at 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The record contains no indication that Lucas failed to comply with the initial partial filing fee order for purposes of delay or out of contumaciousness. Lucas did not demonstrate \u201cthe stubborn resistance to authority\u201d that is the hallmark of contumacious conduct. <em>McNeal, </em>842 F.2d at 792 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Hatchet v. Nettles, </em>201 F.3d 651, 654 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Lucas\u2019s complaint for failure to pay the initial partial filing fee. <em>See id. </em>The district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED and the matter is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
