She entered the United States in October 1998 without being paroled or inspected. In May 2008, Cai was issued a notice to appear, charging that she was subject to removal under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae. Cai has three children, all born in the United States, and, in February 2011, she converted to Christianity. Cai requested asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because she feared persecution in the form of forcible sterilization or excessive fines due to her violation of China\u2019s family planning policies. She also feared persecution based upon her Christian faith and her intent to join an underground Christian church if returned to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">The IJ determined that Cai was ineligible for asylum because she had not shown a reasonable possibility that she would face persecution on account of her violation of China\u2019s family planning policies or due to her religion if returned to China. As to her fear of forced sterilization, the IJ concluded that her claim that she would suffer persecution in China on account of giving birth to three children in the United States lacked sufficient evidentiary support. Specifically, the IJ pointed out that Cai had produced no evidence that someone similarly situated <em>(i.e., </em>someone who had given birth to children in the United States and then returned to China) had suffered forcible sterilization or other persecution. Rather, Cai\u2019s evidence (1) concerned persons who had violated China\u2019s family planning policies by having more than one child in China; (2) came from interested family members or individuals whom Cai had never met, who did not testify during her immigration proceedings; and (3) was largely written years before Cai\u2019s immigration proceedings. Additionally, the IJ concluded that the U.S. State Department Country Reports and other documentary evidence showed that officials in her home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>province of Fujian were not particularly likely to forcibly sterilize a returning Chinese national with unauthorized children born abroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">As to Cai\u2019s fear of excessive fines, the IJ concluded that Cai might face a f\u00edne of up to \u00a550,000, but she had not provided any evidence that such a f\u00edne would cause her to suffer economic difficulties above those generally shared by others in China. As to Cai\u2019s Christian faith claim, the IJ concluded that Cai had not demonstrated that there was a good reason she would be singled out for her persecution and had not shown a pattern or practice of persecution of Christians in China. The IJ further concluded that, because Cai had failed to meet the lower standard for asylum, she was ineligible for withholding of removal or CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. First, the BIA found that the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Cai did not face a reasonable possibility of forced sterilization, excessive fines, or other persecution upon returning to China for violating China\u2019s one child policy was not clearly erroneous. Addressing specific pieces of evidence in detail (including a letter from Cai\u2019s cousin, who claimed to have been forcibly sterilized and fined after giving birth to her second child in China) the BIA determined that much of the evidence that Cai offered in support of her position was entitled to little weight. Like the IJ, the BIA focused on the fact that Cai\u2019s evidence concerned persons who had violated China\u2019s family planning policies by having more than one child in China, rather than those who had United States-born children. The BIA also noted that U.S. State Department Country Reports and Annual Reports from the Executive Commission on China worked against Cai because they showed that forcible sterilization was prohibited. The BIA concluded that, to the extent forcible sterilization occurred, no evidence suggested that it was used against individuals who gave birth to children in the United States. Moreover, the BIA determined that much of Cai\u2019s evidence did not speak to current conditions in China or relate to population control policies in Fu-jian Province. The BIA also concluded that Cai\u2019s claim based upon her fear of fines did not rise to the level of persecution because (1) the Country Reports showed that couples unable to pay fines immediately had been allowed to pay in installments, and (2) Cai had not shown that she would be unable to pay the fines. As to her claim related to her Christian faith, the BIA noted that her evidence was of little probative value because converting to Christianity and attending church services in the United States did little to suggest that the Chinese authorities would likely become aware of her continued religious practice once she returned. The BIA also concluded that, because Cai had failed to meet the lower standard for asylum, she was ineligible for withholding of removal, and that she was. ineligible for CAT relief because none of her evidence demonstrated that she would more likely than not face torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">On appeal here, Cai argues that the BIA improperly reweighed evidence by making its own observations, rather than relying on those of the IJ. She also argues that the BIA erred in discounting her cousin\u2019s letter based upon an arbitrary distinction between children born in the United States versus those born in China in violation of China\u2019s family planning policies. Cai maintains that the BIA\u2019s distinction fell afoul of our decision in <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.2007). Cai also claims that the BIA erred in concluding that she had failed to show a reasonable possibility that she would face persecution based upon her Christian faith if returned to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>We only review the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning. <em>Zhu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>703 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir.2013). Where the BIA has issued its own opinion and relied upon the IJ\u2019s decision and reasoning without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion to the extent the BIA found that IJ\u2019s reasons were supported by the record. <em>Seck v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>663 F.3d 1356, 1364 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">We review legal questions <em>de novo. Zhu, </em>703 F.3d at 1307. We review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, and thus \u201cmust affirm if the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Under that standard, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s decision, draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the BIA\u2019s decision, and must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision unless the record compels reversal. <em>Seek, </em>663 F.3d at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">An alien who is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The government has the discretion to grant asylum if the alien establishes that he is a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). The INA defines a \u201crefugee\u201d as, among other things, (1) \u201ca person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,\u201d and (2) \u201cany person who is outside of [the] country of [her] nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to ... that country because of ... a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... religion.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving refugee status. <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006). Generally, an applicant for asylum must establish either: (1) past persecution on account of a protected ground; or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005). We have explained that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">An applicant can establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, for purposes of asylum, by showing a fear based upon a reasonable possibility of future persecution on account of a protected ground, that is both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1352 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThe subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution.\u201d <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1007 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe objective prong can be fulfilled by establishing that the applicant has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">The well-founded fear of future persecution is thus a mixed question of law and fact. <em>See Zhu, </em>703 F.3d at 1311-12. The factual prong involves \u201cdetermining what has happened to the petitioner in the past and what would occur to the petitioner upon returning to his or her native country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1312. The legal prong involves \u201cdeciding whether what has occurred and what will occur suffice to meet the legal standard for a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo the extent the BIA has the ability to reweigh evidence, this power is limited to reviewing the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>dence before the IJ and reviewing it <em>through the prism of clear error review.\u201d Id. </em>at 1315 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">In <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>the petitioner sought to reopen her removal proceedings after having been denied asylum because she gave birth to two children in the United States and feared that she would face forcible sterilization if returned to China. <em>See L% </em>488 F.3d at 1372-73. The BIA denied her motion to reopen after determining, among other things, that the petitioner had failed to establish a policy of persecuting women with foreign-born children, as opposed to native children. <em>Id. </em>at 1376. We rejected the BIA\u2019s distinction, explaining that the BIA \u201cassumed that [the petitioner\u2019s] alleged persecutors would make a similar distinction\u201d even though no evidence in the record showed that government officials would make such a distinction. <em>See id. </em>We determined that the BIA\u2019s reliance on that factual distinction to conclude that the petitioner failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case for asylum was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d on that record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that her life or freedom would be threatened in her country of origin on account of a statutorily protected ground. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The applicant must demonstrate that she would more likely than not be persecuted upon being returned to her country of origin. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. To qualify for CAT relief, the petitioner must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she would be tortured \u201cat the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of\u2019 government authorities if removed to her home country. <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). An applicant who is unable to satisfy the standard for asylum generally will be unable to meet the more stringent standards for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33; <em>Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Contrary to Cai\u2019s assertion, the BIA did not engage in impermissible reweighing of evidence, but rather reviewed the evidence that was before the IJ through the prism of clear error. <em>See Zhu, </em>703 F.3d at 1315. Cai\u2019s claim that the BIA\u2019s discounting of her cousin\u2019s letter fell afoul of <em>Li </em>is unpersuasive because, even if so, the BIA also noted that the letter\u2019s author was an interested witness not subject to cross examination as a reason for giving it little weight. In any event, here, unlike in <em>Li, </em>record evidence supports the BIA\u2019s native-born child versus foreign-born child distinction. Specifically, a 2006 correspondence from the Fujian Province Population and Family Planning Commission to the United States General Consulate states that a U.S.-born child by a resident of China would not be counted for family planning purposes if the child\u2019s permanent residency is not established when the child returns to China. <em>See Li, </em>488 F.3d at 1376.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">In addition to the 2006 Fujian Province Population and Family Planning Commission correspondence, other substantial evidence in the record supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s determinations that Cai failed to show a reasonable possibility that she would face forced sterilization if returned to China. <em>See Zhu, </em>703 F.3d at 1307. Specifically, there is evidence in the record that (1) the Chinese government prohibited use of force to compel sterilization; and (2) forced sterilization occurred, but only in some instances and under intense pressure to meet family planning goals. Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusions that Cai had not shown a reasonable possibility of persecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>tion in the form of excessive fines because Cai offered no evidence that a fine of any particular amount would cause her severe economic damage. Therefore, even assuming Cai proved she faced a reasonable possibility of a fine, the BIA properly concluded that she did not show that any such fine would rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s determinations as to Cai\u2019s claim based on her Christian faith are, likewise, supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhu, </em>703 F.3d at 1307. The U.S. State Department Country Reports show that the Chinese government\u2019s treatment of underground church members varies regionally, and Cai provided no evidence of persecution of underground church members in her local region, or any evidence that the Chinese government was aware of her Christian faith. As Cai did not meet the lower standard for asylum as to any of her claims \u2014 ie., a reasonable possibility of future persecution based on her violation of China\u2019s family planning policy or her Christian faith \u2014 substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Cai failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33; <em>Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 891. Accordingly, we deny her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
