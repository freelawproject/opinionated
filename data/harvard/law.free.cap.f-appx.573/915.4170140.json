Upon review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reject Jallali\u2019s arguments on both counts and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Dealing first with Jallali\u2019s motion for recusal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that the motion was both untimely and meritless. Although \u00a7 455 does not include an explicit timeliness requirement, a motion to disqualify a judge must nonetheless be \u201cfiled within a reasonable time after the grounds for the motion are ascertained.\u201d <em>Summers v. Singletary, </em>119 F.3d 917, 921 (11th Cir.1997). Jallali did not file her motion for recusal until eight months after the first order she argues evinced bias or prejudice. Under the circumstances, this was an unreasonable delay. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cCertainly, where the facts are known before a legal proceeding is held, waiting to file such a motion until the court has ruled against a party is untimely.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Moreover, the motion was meritless because an objective, fully-informed lay observer would not entertain significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>See In re Walker, </em>532 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2008). The orders, language, and conduct Jallali complains of are the district court\u2019s descriptions of and attempts to address Jallali\u2019s and her counsel\u2019s misconduct in the proceedings before it. Were such actions sufficient to establish the pervasive bias and prejudice necessary to obtain re-cusal based on bias not stemming from extrajudicial sources, <em>see id. </em>at 1311, district judges would be powerless to address misconduct without subjecting themselves to recusal. Instead, the general rule is that \u201cjudicial remarks ... that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Jallali\u2019s motion to recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Turning to Jallali\u2019s motion under Rule 60(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jallali argues the district court should have granted relief from its order dismissing her complaint with prejudice because that order was based on the erro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>neous conclusion that Jallali had violated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 by improperly filing an amended complaint. Again, Jallali\u2019s argument is meritless. Even assuming the district court incorrectly determined that she violated Rule 15 and that this error was of the sort contemplated by Rule 60(b), <em>see Carter v. United States, </em>780 F.2d 925, 928 (11th Cir.1986) (explaining that Rule 60(b) allows trial judges to correct \u201cobvious errors\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), the district court specifically explained that the Rule 15 violation was merely one of a litany of abuses that warranted its dismissal of Jal-lali\u2019s complaint. Consequently, even if Jal-lali\u2019s were correct that she did not violate Rule 15, this would not justify relief under Rule 60(b) because the district court would have ruled \u2014 and would have been justified in ruling \u2014 the same way. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying Jallali\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-8\">. We review a district court judge\u2019s denial of a motion for recusal for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Walker, </em>532 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2008). Likewise, \u201ca district court's order under Rule 60(b) is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Nw. Nat'l Ins. Co., </em>198 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-9\">. We reject Appellees\u2019 contention that we lack jurisdiction over the order denying Jallali\u2019s motion for recusal.

We do not consider Jallali\u2019s arguments as to the judgment and prejudgment sanction orders that were not designated in the notice of appeal, as we lack jurisdiction to do so. <em>See Rinaldo v.
