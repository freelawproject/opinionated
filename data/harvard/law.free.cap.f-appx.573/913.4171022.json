On appeal, Jones argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We will vacate a sentence only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted). The party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">Jones has not met his burden to show his 155-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. Jones\u2019s sentence is at the lower end of the advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months and well below the statutory maximum life sentence, both indications that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. McKinley, </em>732 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">In sentencing Jones, the district court emphasized the serious circumstances of Jones\u2019s current offense, which involved a civilian calling 911 to report that Jones was waving a gun around in a parking lot and then police discovering Jones with a revolver and two rounds of ammunition, as well as a crack pipe containing cocaine residue. Although Jones claimed he was not actually waving the firearm around, but instead was trying to barter the firearm for drugs, either one of these was a dangerous activity that, in the words of the district court, \u201cput[ ] other individuals significantly at risk.\u201d The district court stressed that Jones\u2019s current offense was even more serious in light of his prior criminal history, especially his 2007 convictions for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, which involved Jones shooting a coworker.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">The district court\u2019s concern over Jones\u2019s criminal history is supported by the record, which demonstrates that Jones has a lengthy history of at least 18 prior convictions dating back to 1993, only four of which resulted in criminal history points. Many of Jones\u2019s prior crimes were drug-related and some involved theft or violence. In addition, Jones had five prior convictions for driving on a suspended or revoked license. Based on his criminal history, Jones received the highest criminal history category of VI and qualified as an armed career criminal under both the Sentencing Guidelines and the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). Not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>had Jones already been convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm once before, but during that offense Jones fought with a coworker, was instructed by his employer to leave the work site, and then returned 45 minutes later and shot his coworker in the buttocks. As the district court stated, given the circumstances of Jones\u2019s prior firearm offense, Jones \u201chad no business having [a loaded firearm] anywhere near [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">The district court also stated that Jones showed a lack of respect for the law, citing in particular the fact that Jones \u201c[took] the law into [his] own hands\u201d by shooting his coworker rather than allowing the law to prosecute his coworker for the altercation. In addition, Jones\u2019s extensive criminal history and some of Jones\u2019s statements at the sentencing hearing minimizing some of his offenses showed a lack of respect for the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The fact that Jones provided substantial assistance after his arrest does not undermine the district court\u2019s finding that Jones showed a lack of respect for the law. Rather, the district court took into account Jones\u2019s assistance to authorities when it granted the government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) motions\u2014 permitting a sentence below the mandatory minimum 15-year sentence and reducing his advisory guidelines range from 180 to 210 months to 151 to 188 months \u2014 and then sentenced Jones to 155-months, at the lower end of the new range.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">The record belies Jones\u2019s claim that the district court failed to consider his status as a small-time drug dealer who was in need of substance abuse treatment. Jones\u2019s counsel argued these facts in mitigation, and, in response, the district court recommended that Jones be allowed to participate in drug treatment programs and vocational training in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Jones also argues that the district court failed to adequately consider the unfairness of applying the ACCA enhancement when one of Jones\u2019s three predicate offenses involved the sale of only 0.1 gram of cocaine. Jones\u2019s counsel raised this argument in the district court and also conceded that the cocaine offense technically qualified as a predicate offense. The district court heard this argument and was not required to address it explicitly, so long as it acknowledged that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which it did. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). The district court went further, however, and explicitly considered Jones\u2019s criminal history as a whole to be an aggravating, rather than a mitigating, factor. Although Jones disagrees with the district court\u2019s assessment of his criminal history, after reviewing the record, we cannot say that the district court committed a clear error in judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or that Jones\u2019s 155-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-9\">. Jones does not argue that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable or point to any procedural error at his sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
