In March 2010, Chen was charged with re-movability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) as an alien who had entered this country without being admitted or paroled. Chen conceded removability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>but sought relief in the form of asylum, \u25a0withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), asserting that she had suffered past persecution on account of her opposition to the Chinese government and that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution on that same ground. The immigration judge (IJ) found that Chen\u2019s asylum application was frivolous, that she had not shown that the application had been timely filed, and that she had not shown that she was eligible for the relief she sought. Accordingly, the IJ denied Chen\u2019s requests for relief and ordered Chen removed to China. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed Chen\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision. Chen now petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">On a petition for review, this court \u201creview[s] only the BIA\u2019s decision, unless the IJ\u2019s decision has some impact on\u201d that decision. <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 517 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, and we review legal questions de novo. <em>Rui Yang v. Holder, </em>664 F.3d 580, 584 (5th Cir.2011). Under the substantial evidence standard, the petitioner must show that \u201cthe evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach\u201d a conclusion contrary to that of the BIA. <em>Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 518 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Chen argues that there was not sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding of frivolousness. The IJ and the BIA credited the testimony of Robert Gohl, a forensic document examiner, that the identification card submitted by Chen was fraudulent. \u201cIt is the factfinder\u2019s duty to make credibility determinations, and this court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Other than her own assertions that her Chinese identification card is authentic, Chen has never offered any evidence to refute Gohl\u2019s testimony that the card she submitted was fraudulent. Substantial record evidence supports the BIA\u2019s factual finding that Chen submitted a fraudulent identification card in support of her asylum application and that the application was therefore frivolous. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.20; <em>Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 518; <em>Rui Yang, </em>664 F.3d at 584-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Chen also attacks the BIA\u2019s frivolousness determination on three additional grounds. First, she asserts that Gohl\u2019s report and his testimony were \u201cintroduced for impeachment purpose[s] only\u201d and that Gohl was not placed under oath. Second, Chen argues that it was not established that she knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application. Third, Chen argues that the IJ should not have made a frivolousness determination sua sponte. Chen did not raise any of these arguments in her brief before the BIA or in a motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, she has failed to exhaust these issues, and we lack jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318-21 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Chen assigns error to several of the individual findings underpinning the BIA\u2019s overall conclusion that she had not credibly established her claims for relief. An adverse credibility determination may be supported by <em>\u201cany </em>inconsistency or omission ... as long as the totality of the circumstances establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In this case, we need not address each of the individual findings challenged by Chen because Chen\u2019s submission of a fraudulent identification card and her insistence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the card was genuine, by itself, supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Moreover, reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude that it is not plain that no reasonable factfinder would have made the same adverse credibility ruling. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Overall, the BIA\u2019s decision that Chen was not entitled to asylum because she had not provided credible evidence of either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 518. If an alien has failed to establish the well-founded fear necessary for an asylum claim, it follows that she necessarily cannot establish an entitlement to withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. <em>See Dayo v. Holder, </em>687 F.3d 653, 658-59 (5th Cir.2012); <em>Rui Yang, </em>664 F.3d at 588-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Chen also challenges the BIA\u2019s-determination that there was a conflict between her oral testimony, which described Chen\u2019s relationship with a woman named \u201cSue C.,\u201d and her asylum statement, which did not mention \u201cSue C.\u201d The legal issue asserted by Chen arose from \u201cthe BIA\u2019s act of decisionmaking\u201d and could not have been raised prior to the BIA\u2019s issuance of its decision. <em>See Omari, </em>562 F.3d at 320-21. In order to properly exhaust this issue, Chen should have raised it first in a motion for reconsideration before the.BIA. <em>See id. </em>Because she did not do so, we lack jurisdiction to consider the issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Finally, Chen argues that the BIA did not make any express findings on the issue of timeliness and that \u201cit may be assumed that the BIA agreed with\u201d her position that the application was timely. She reiterates her contention that she provided sufficient evidence of the timeliness of her asylum application. Whether Chen met her burden to establish that she filed a timely asylum application is a factual question that this court lacks jurisdiction to review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Arif v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 677, 680 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">To the extent that Chen challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that her asylum application was untimely and to the extent that Chen raises arguments that she failed to exhaust before the BIA, the petition for review is DISMISSED. In all other respects, Chen\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
