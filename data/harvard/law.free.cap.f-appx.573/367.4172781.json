On appeal, Garay-Acevedo argues only that the written judgment incorrectly states that his offense of conviction is illegal reentry rather than attempted illegal reentry. He requests a remand to correct the judgment. The conviction and sentence imposed by the district court are AFFIRMED. However, we REMAND to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment to reflect the correct offense of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AtL\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
