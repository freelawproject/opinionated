We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Lopez has two mortgage liens on his house. The first has an outstanding balance that exceeds the current value of the house. The second mortgage lien at issue in this case is held by Bank of America and is junior to the first lien. Bank of America\u2019s lien is considered to be wholly \u201cunderwater,\u201d because the debt secured by the first lien exceeds the current value of the house. ROA at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Lopez moved to have Bank of America\u2019s junior lien extinguished under \u00a7 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The bankruptcy judge granted Lopez\u2019s motion and concluded binding circuit precedent holds \u00a7 506(d) authorizes a Chapter 7 debtor to \u201cstrip off\u2019 (remove in its entirety) a junior lien, where the amount of debt securing the senior lien exceeds the value of the house. <em>McNeal v. GMAC Mortgage, LLC (In re McNeal), </em>735 F.3d 1263, 1264-66 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (holding a wholly unsecured junior lien may be stripped off or voided under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(d)); <em>Folendore v. SBA (In re Folendore), </em>862 F.2d 1537, 1539 (11th Cir.1989) (interpreting 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a) and (d) and concluding that an allowed claim that was wholly unsecured was voidable under the plain language of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Bank of America appealed to the district court. It subsequently moved for summary affirmance in view of our binding precedent and noted a challenge to McNeal\u2019s reasoning would more appropriately be heard by this court or the Supreme Court. The district judge granted the motion. Bank of America now seeks the appellate review that its motion for summary affirmance was intended to expedite.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Bank of America argues the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Dewsnup v. Timm, </em>502 U.S. 410, 112 S.Ct. 773, 116 L.Ed.2d 903 (1992), abrogated our construction of \u00a7 506(d) in <em>Folendore. </em>As Bank of America acknowledges, however, we rejected that argument in <em>McNeal </em>and concluded <em>Dewsnup </em>was not clearly on point, because it disallowed only a \u201cstrip down\u201d of a partially unsecured mortgage lien, rather than a \u201cstrip off\u2019 of a wholly unsecured mortgage lien.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>McNeal, </em>735 F.3d at 1265-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">Because we are bound to follow our prior published decisions in <em>Folendore </em>and <em>McNeal, </em>we affirm the bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision voiding Bank of America\u2019s lien on Lopez\u2019s house. <em>See World Holdings, LLC v. Fed. Republic of Germany, </em>701 F.3d 641, 650 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201c[T]he holding of the first panel to address an issue is the law of this Circuit, thereby binding all subsequent panels unless and until the first panel\u2019s holding is overruled by the Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-8\">. Section 506(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-9\">To the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim, such lien is void, unless \u2014 (1) such claim was disallowed only under section 502(b)(5) or 502(e) of this title; or (2) such claim is not an allowed secured claim due only to the failure of any entity to file a proof of such claim under section 501 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-z\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-17\">. A \u201cstrip down\u201d of an unsecured lien reduces the lien to the value of the collateral to which it attaches, while a \"strip off\u201d removes a wholly unsecured lien in its entirety. <em>McNeal, </em>735 F.3d at 1264 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
