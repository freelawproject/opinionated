Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B). Marrero moved to dismiss his indictment more than two years after his conviction became final on direct appeal. He argued that his indictment was void ab initio because the offenses charged were not within the power of Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause. The district court denied Marrero\u2019s motion. Because Marrero failed to file his motion while his case was pending, <em>see id., </em>we vacate the order that denied his motion on the merits and remand with instructions for the district court to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">\u201c[W]e are obligated to address the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to issue a ruling we are reviewing on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Diveroli, </em>729 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.2013). \u201c[W]e review jurisdictional issues <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Lopez, </em>562 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">The district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Marrero\u2019s collateral challenge to his indictment. A defendant may move to dismiss the charges against him on the ground there is a \u201cdefect in the indictment,\u201d but the motion must be filed \u201cwhile the case is pending.\u201d Fed.R. Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B). When a case is no longer pending, the district court is divested of authority to consider a motion for relief from the judgment. <em>See United States v. Elso, </em>571 F.3d 1163, 1166 (11th Cir.2009). Marrero\u2019s case was no longer pending after he exhausted his claims on direct appeal and we issued our mandate on September 14, 2011. <em>See id. </em>On February 19, 2014, when Marrero moved to dismiss his indictment, the district court lacked authority to consider Marrero\u2019s motion. We vacate the order that denied Marrero\u2019s motion on its merits and remand with instructions for the district court to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
