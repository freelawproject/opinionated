Paschal, an African-American part-time supervisor at United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), appeals from the dis-triet court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of UPS in his employment discrimination suit, filed pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). Paschal argues the district court erred in determining that UPS offered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for failing to promote him to a full-time supervisor position and choosing a Caucasian candidate instead, namely, that UPS did not consider him for the promotion because his required paperwork for the promotion process was not completed. Paschal also asserts the district court erred in determining he did not show that UPS\u2019s proffered reason was pretextual. He contends he was not required to present evidence beyond that used to establish his <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination because UPS promoted employees through a secretive, informal process. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">Title VII provides that \u201c[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 796 n. 4, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). When a plaintiff offers circumstantial evidence of discrimination, we apply the burden-shifting framework articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas. Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1264 (11th Cir.2010). Under this framework, if the plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, and the employer \u201carticulates] one or more legitimate non-discriminatory reasons\u201d for the adverse employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>ment decision, the plaintiff must then show that the stated reason is mere pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, to overcome a motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must put forth evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons were pretext. <em>Chapman v. Al Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024-25 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en bane). </em>A plaintiff can do so directly, by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely than not motivated the employer, or indirectly, by showing \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoheren-cies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1265 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Assuming Paschal established a <em>prima facie </em>case, the district court did not err in determining that UPS proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for not considering Paschal for the full-time supervisor promotion, namely, the fact that UPS did not have Paschal\u2019s completed promotion paperwork on file. Thus, the burden then shifted back to Paschal to show that UPS\u2019s reason was mere pretext. <em>See Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">As an initial matter, Paschal\u2019s own evidence makes clear that Robert Wahns-chaff, the employee promoted to full-time supervisor, complied with UPS\u2019s Management Assessment and Promotion Process (MAPP), which was UPS\u2019s procedure for promoting employees to full-time management positions. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Paschal, Paschal submitted his MAPP paperwork to Virgil Tindal by email, and at some point, his paperwork was lost. However, Paschal has provided little evidence other than affidavits based upon personal belief and opinion that there was any deliberate, discriminatory reason for losing his paperwork. <em>See Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining mere conclusions, unsupported factual allegations, and statements in affidavits based in part on information and belief cannot raise genuine issues of fact, and, thus, are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment). Charles Inman\u2019s affidavit corroborated portions of Paschal\u2019s affidavit, including Paschal\u2019s conversation with Tindal in which Tindal reassured Pascal that his MAPP paperwork had been submitted. Although Inman\u2019s affidavit lends support to Paschal\u2019s recollection of the conversation with Tindal, this evidence does not tend to show that Paschal\u2019s paperwork was lost or misplaced after Tindal submitted it to human resources for a discriminatory reason, and, thus, fails to show pretext. <em>See Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Paschal also has pointed to no weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, inco-herencies, or contradictions in UPS\u2019s proffered reason for not hiring him. <em>See id. </em>UPS has consistently presented the same reason for not hiring Paschal because, as noted in Paschal\u2019s EEOC charge, UPS managers told him from the beginning that the MAPP paperwork issue was why he was not considered for the promotion. At most, the evidence suggests that Paschal\u2019s paperwork was lost, and he offers no evidence for his conclusory assertion that UPS lost other African-American employees\u2019 paperwork, such as affidavits or testimony from those other African-American employees. Paschal\u2019s argument that he was not required to cast doubt on UPS\u2019s argument is also without merit because MAPP was not a secretive promotion procedure. <em>See Roberts v. Gadsden Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>835 F.2d 793, 798 (11th Cir.1988) (noting informal, secretive hiring or promotion processes tend to facilitate the consideration of impermissible criteria). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>undisputed record makes clear that all employees were told about MAPP and how to comply with MAPP. As Paschal has failed to show UPS\u2019s legitimate, non-diserimina-tory reason for failing to promote him was mere pretext, the district court did not err in granting UPS\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-11\">. We review an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing all facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Jones v. UPS Ground Freight, </em>683 F.3d 1283, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2012).
