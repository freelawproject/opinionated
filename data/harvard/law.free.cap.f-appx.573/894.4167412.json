Jeudy appeals his 141-month total sentence imposed after pleading guilty to one count of interference with commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2, and one count of brandishing a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) and 2. Jeudy contends the district court\u2019s order to run his federal sentence consecutive to his undischarged state sentence was unreasonable under the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a), because the court did not give adequate consideration to his personal history or the disparity between his sentence and his codefendant\u2019s lesser sentence. After review, we affirm Jeudy\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Where a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment, the terms may run concurrently or consecutively. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). To determine whether to impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to an undischarged term of imprisonment, the court should consider the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3584(b); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c). In addition, the commentary to \u00a7 5G1.3 provides that the court should also consider, <em>inter alia, </em>any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence for the instant offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Section 3553(a) provides the district court is required to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">Jeudy does not demonstrate the district court\u2019s decision to impose the sentence consecutive to his undischarged state sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (stating the party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors). Rather, it was within the district court\u2019s discretion to impose his federal sentence consecutive to his undischarged state court sentence, and the sentence met the goals encompassed within \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Kuhlman, </em>711 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2013) (reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">In announcing its decision to run the sentence consecutive to the state court sentence, the district court stated it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Moreover, the court\u2019s statements show it did consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the parties\u2019 arguments. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (explaining the district court is required to set forth enough reasons to show it has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>basis for its decision). First, with respect to Jeudy\u2019s argument that he faced a more severe punishment than his codefendant, the court noted that charging lies in the discretion of the United States Attorney. The court then considered relevant differences between the two offenders that may warrant differing sentences. Specifically, when the issue was first raised, the court inquired whether Jeudy\u2019s codefendant, Sutton, had \u201cshot anybody else\u201d as Jeudy had in the past. Later, when announcing the sentence, the court specifically stated, \u201cyou were the man with the gun in the incident that brings you here today.\u201d Accordingly, the district court did not ignore this argument and did not abuse its discretion in imposing a consecutive sentence that was longer than that of Jeudy\u2019s code-fendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Next, the court specifically addressed the nature and circumstance of the offense and history and characteristics of the defendant when it stated that Jeudy\u2019s conduct was \u201cbad in the extreme,\u201d and further commented, \u201cI always have reservations about sending someone your age into the penitentiary for a long period of time. People your age do things that they probably would not do if they were older.\u201d With respect to the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense and to promote respect for the law, the court commented that Jeudy\u2019s conduct showed \u201ca disregard for the law on your part that is almost total\u201d and further explained, \u201cI think after you have served your sentence or most of it you will have matured and you will, at least, come to appreciate the things that concern me in imposing this sentence.\u201d The court also addressed the need to protect the public, noting that Jeudy had \u201calready shot one person,\u201d and \u201ccould very well have shot somebody in that [Dollar General] store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Finally, the record does not reflect that the district court ignored Jeudy\u2019s mitigation arguments. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007) (stating a district court\u2019s failure to specifically discuss mitigating evidence does not mean that it erroneously ignored or failed to consider this evidence in determining a sentence). Rather, after hearing Jeudy\u2019s arguments through counsel and hearing from Jeudy directly, the court stated \u201cyou are the source of your problem yourself,\u201d \u201cnobody but you. And it is what it is and it\u2019s got to be dealt with.\u201d Nevertheless, while the court declined to sentence him concurrently, it stated that it was \u201cnot going to sentence him at the top of the guidelines range either.\u201d Accordingly, the district court\u2019s statements reflect that it considered the seriousness of the offense and adequately acknowledged the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in rendering its decision to run the sentence consecutive. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456. Jeudy has not carried his burden in demonstrating the district court abused its discretion. Thus, we affirm Jeudy\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
