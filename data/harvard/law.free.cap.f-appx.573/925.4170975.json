Fac\u00f3n challenges the 300-month sentence he received for the second conviction under \u00a7 924(c). He complains that because the second \u00a7 924(c) conviction was charged in the same indictment, it does not constitute a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d conviction, triggering the 300-month sentence, for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Because Fa-con\u2019s position is foreclosed by binding Supreme Court precedent, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Section 924(c) requires a district court, \u201c[i]n the case of a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection,\u201d to impose a sentence of not less than 25-years imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). In <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993), the Supreme Court considered whether multiple convictions under \u00a7 924(c) arising out of a single criminal proceeding constitute second or subsequent convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 131, 113 S.Ct. at 1996. Over a vocal dissent composed of three justices, the majority held that a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of the enhanced sentences set forth in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) refers to the finding of guilt preceding the entry of final judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 113 S.Ct. at 1996. This interpretation of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C), the Supreme Court held, allows and indeed requires the enhanced sentences to be imposed even where more than one \u00a7 924(c) conviction is obtained in a single criminal proceeding. Id. at 132, 137, 113 S.Ct. at 1996, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\"><em>Deal </em>thus bound the district court here to impose the enhanced sentence set forth in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). <em>Deal </em>also binds us to affirm sentences like these, \u201c[ujnless and until the Supreme Court itself overrules that decision,\u201d or Congress revisits \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
