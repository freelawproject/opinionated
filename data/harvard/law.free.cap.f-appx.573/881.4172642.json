That range was the product of a base offense level of 36 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, because the total drug quantity involved in the conspiracy was more than 500 grams but less than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, a total offense level of 41,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a criminal history category of III.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-24\">On June 5, 2008, Woods moved the District Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentences on the ground that Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables of \u00a7 2D1.1, reduced his base offense level by two levels, from 36 to 34, and thus his total offense level from 41 to 39 and, with a criminal history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>category of III, reduced the sentencing range to 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court granted his motion and sentenced him to four concurrent prison terms of 324 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">On October 12, 2011, Woods again moved the District Court to reduce his sentences pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This time he based his motion on Amendments 748 and 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Those amendments were promulgated to correspond with the provisions of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. Ill\u2014 220, 124 Stat. 2372, which raised the minimum quantities of crack cocaine necessary to trigger the five-year and ten-year statutory mandatory minimum sentences under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) from five grams to 28 grams (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii)) and from 50 grams to 280 grams (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii)), respectively. He argued that, under these amendments, his base offense level for 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine should be 32, instead of 34, and that the Guideline sentencing range for an offense level 32 and a category III criminal history should be 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court denied his motion on the ground that the amendments did not change the sentencing range the court used when it reduced his sentences to 324 months\u2019 imprisonment based on a base offense level of 34. He now appeals the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">As noted, at sentencing, the District Court held Woods accountable for between 500 grams and 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Recalculating Woods\u2019s \u00a7 2D1.1 base offense level for 500 grams to 1.5 kilograms after applying Amendment 750, the District Court could have reached a level 34 based on between 840 grams and 2.8 kilograms, see \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) Drug Quantity Table, or a level 32 based on between 280 grams and 840 grams. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">In <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328 (11th Cir.2013), the court faced the same problem that faces us here. There, the District Court held the defendant Hamilton accountable for \u201cat least 1.5 kilograms\u201d of cocaine base. In reviewing the District Court\u2019s denial of Hamilton\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 750, we said that \u201cthe district court needs to determine accurately the original drug quantity findings before it can analyze whether Hamilton has shown that Amendment 750 actually lowered his base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340. \u201cBecause the eligibility question is whether Hamilton would have had a lower guidelines range had Amendment 750 been in effect at the time he was sentenced, the court should not consider any evidence or materials beyond those that were before it at the time of the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf that new guidelines [turns out to be] lower than the original guidelines range, the district court should proceed to the next step and exercise its discretion to grant or deny relief based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and all applicable policy statements from the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">The same must be done in this case. The District Court must determine whether the crack cocaine it held Woods accountable for was more than or less than 840 grams. If more than 840 grams, it will deny Woods\u2019s motion \u2014 because the base offense level will still be at 34. If less than 840 grams and a base offense level of 32, the court will have to take the second step, as the <em>Hamilton </em>court prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the District Court\u2019s order denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is Vacated and the case is Remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-17\">.
