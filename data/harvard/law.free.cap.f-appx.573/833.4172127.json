Flores\u2019s suit sprung up from an e-mail complaint he sent to one DeVry official (a statement alleging racist conduct on the part of DeVry) and from his subsequent firing (allegedly for working simultaneously at a competing institution contrary to University policy). On appeal, Flores expressly argues that the district court erred in granting DeVry\u2019s motion for summary judgment because he established a <em>prima facie </em>claim for retaliation; we suppose he implicitly challenges the court\u2019s determination that he did not show pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-18\">We review the grant or denial of summary judgment <em>de novo. Moton v. Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2011). In doing so, we draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[I]f the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>judgment as a matter of law,\u201d then summary judgment is appropriate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, \u201c[a]ll persons ... shall have the same right ... to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens,\u201d which in an employment context means protection against discrimination based on race and color. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(a). Section 1981 protects individuals who seek to enforce their rights thereunder from retaliation. <em>See CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, </em>553 U.S. 442, 457, 128 S.Ct. 1951, 1961, 170 L.Ed.2d 864 (2008) (retaliation claims permitted under \u00a7 1981); <em>Andrews v. Lakeshore Rehab. Hosp., </em>140 F.3d 1405, 1411-13 (11th Cir.1998) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Absent direct evidence, when analyzing claims for retaliation brought under \u00a7 1981, we employ the analytical framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Bryant v. Jones, </em>575 F.3d 1281, 1307 (11th Cir.2009). Under this framework, a plaintiff alleging retaliation may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case by showing, among other things, that a causal link exists between a protected activity he engaged in and an adverse act, such as a firing. <em>Id. </em>1307-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">If a plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation and the defendant articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse act, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason was merely a pretext to mask retaliatory acts. <em>See id. </em>at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">To create a genuine issue about a causal connection, the plaintiff has to show (1) \u201cthat the decision-makers were aware of the protected conduct\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the protected activity and the adverse actions were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>See Shannon v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir.2002). Actual knowledge is required. Furthermore, \u201ctemporal proximity [between the employee\u2019s protected conduct and the adverse employment action] alone is insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to causal connection where there is unrebutted evidence that the decision[-]maker did not have knowledge that the employee engaged in protected conduct.\u201d <em>Brungart v. Bell-South Telecomms., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">To establish that a defendant\u2019s explanation was pretextual, the plaintiff may point to \u201cconcrete evidence in the form of specific facts which show[ ] that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason was mere pretext[;] [m]ere conclusory allegations and assertions [do] not suffice.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>575 F.3d at 1308 (alterations omitted). We must evaluate whether the plaintiffs evidence has demonstrated \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its actions that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., </em>408 F.3d 763, 771 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">A reason is pretextual if it is false and the true reason is impermissible. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). \u201cThe plaintiff must meet the reason proffered [by his employer] head on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Crawford v. City of Fairburn, Ga., </em>482 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we see no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">On this record, the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of DeVry. Flores failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>claim for retaliation because the evidence indicated that the decision-makers (Spano and Padr\u00f3n) for his termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>nation were not aware of the racism complaint he had sent to another DeVry official. Furthermore, Flores failed to show that DeVry\u2019s reason for firing him was pretextual: DeVry had a policy against full-time professors teaching at competing institutions, and it was undisputed that Flores violated this policy. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
