He contended that his 120-month sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm was unconstitutionally enhanced in violation of <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), because he did not admit the facts necessary for an enhancement based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). The district court determined that Martindale could not pursue relief under \u00a7 2241 because he had failed to show that relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective as required by the savings clause of \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">We review the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition <em>de novo. Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). A federal prisoner may attack the validity of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition if he can meet the requirements of the savings clause. <em>Id. </em>He must show that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). A petitioner\u2019s inability to meet the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2255 is insufficient to make the required showing. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2000). Instead, he must establish that his claim \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that the claim \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">Martindale asserts that his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced in light of <em>Al-leyne </em>and that <em>Alleyne </em>announced a new rule of criminal law that should apply to his case and that, pursuant to <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013), he is actually innocent. <em>Alleyne </em>and <em>Perkins, </em>however, do not establish that Martindale\u2019s claims are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court opinion indicating that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense and that his claims were foreclosed when they otherwise should have been raised. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">Finally, Martindale avers that the district court erred by assigning his base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2); that the penalties in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) violate the Eighth Amendment because his sentence was disproportionate to the crime; and that the court failed to address the claims overlooked by the magistrate judge. We do not consider these claims because they are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 435 n. 1 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-17\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
