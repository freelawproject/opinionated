The district court dismissed Ajamu\u2019s amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-20\">The district court correctly dismissed Ajamu\u2019s amended complaint. Ajamu alleged that the Service violated the Act by withholding an individual\u2019s address, but Ajamu attached to his original complaint a response in which the Service provided the individual\u2019s last known address. Ajamu\u2019s claim about a violation of the Act became moot when the Service produced the address. <em>See Lovell v. Alderete, </em>630 F.2d 428, 430-31 (5th Cir.1980). And the Service was not liable for the individual\u2019s supposed refusal to update her address. <em>See NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>421 U.S. 132, 162, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 1522, 44 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975). Ajamu also alleged that the Service withheld the mailing address because of his \u201crace, color, nationality, and faith,\u201d but the district court correctly ruled that claim was barred by sovereign immunity, <em>see Dolan v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>546 U.S. 481, 484, 126 S.Ct. 1252, 1256, 163 L.Ed.2d 1079 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-21\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Ajamu\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
