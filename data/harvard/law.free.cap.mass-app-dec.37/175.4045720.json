The defendants pleaded a general denial and <em>res judicata. </em>There was a finding for the plaintiffs and the defendants claimed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">This agreement and a lease between the parties was the subject of prior litigation in the District Court of Springfield by the defendants against the plaintiffs in which the plaintiffs prevailed. The plaintiffs there pleaded in answer the agreement was illegal because made on the Lord\u2019s Day. The only evidence offered in the present action were the special findings of the trial judge in the prior action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In his special findings the judge in the first action found, in part: \u201cThat the promise of the defendants to pay the $1,000.00 toward the erection of the new building, and the actual payment of the $500.00 check (which was later cashed by the plaintiffs) was part and parcel of the total agreement made on Sunday, September 11, 1960\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Excluding statutory exceptions (see GKL. c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>136, \u00a7 6) contracts made on the Lord\u2019s Day are invalid and unenforceable.
