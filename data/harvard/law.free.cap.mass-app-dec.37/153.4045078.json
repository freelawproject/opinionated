The request for the report did not include \u201ca clear and concise statement of the rulings upon which a rehearing is requested . ...\u201d as required by the third paragraph of <em>Rule 27 </em>of <em>the Rules of the District Courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1965).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Neither did the defendant file a draft report within ten days after notice of the finding, the cause being ripe for judgment except for the pendency of the request for a report and the motion for a new trial, as required \u25a0by the first paragraph of <em>Rule 28 of said District Court Rules. (1965).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The motion for a new trial set forth as the grounds for same:</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">(1) the finding was against the evidence and the weight of the evidence;</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">(2) that it was against the law; and</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">(3) that the damages were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">On July 29,1966, the court denied the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">The report and the docket entries indicate that the defendant again presented requests for rulings at the time of the hearing on the motion for a new trial on which requests the trial judge refused to rule for the reason as stated in the report that they dealt with matters that could have been presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>at the trial. To the denial of the motion for a new trial and the court\u2019s action in failing to pass on the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings filed at the time of the hearing on said motion, the defendant duly filed a claim of report and a draft report within the time allowed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b162-6\">Charles S.

See <em>Skudris </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>287 Mass. 568 and <em>Mantho </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>285 Mass. 156. No question of law can be raised on a motion for a new trial which could have been raised at the trial on the merits unless the trial judge sees fit to entertain it. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Currier, </em>293 Mass. 435, 439. <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>266 Mass. 286.</p>\n<p id=\"AFo\">The denial of the motion for a new trial was within the sound discretion of the trial judge and there was no abuse of that discretion. <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Jordon Marsh Co., </em>240 Mass. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">There was no prejudicial error on the part of the trial judge on the matters that are complained of and the order should be: report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
