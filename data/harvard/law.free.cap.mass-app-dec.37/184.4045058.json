He further alleged that the plaintiff had agreed to hold him harmless from any claims of abutting owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The case was originally entered in the Middlesex Superior Court on September <em>4, </em>1962 with both parties claiming jury trial. On July 9, 1963, it was transferred to the First District Court of Eastern Middlesex under the remand statute (Gr.L. c. 231, \u00a7102C). After trial held on January 5, 1966, the trial justice found for the defendant and on January 6, 1966 notice of such finding was sent to both parties. On Jan-nary 13, 1966 the -defea&amp;nl filed a paper in the District Court entitled: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Motion to Retransfer and Insistence on Jury Trial and Right to Introduce Further Evidence\u201d, which reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff, having reserved his (sic) right for a jury trial, she now insists upon said jury trial with the right to introduce further evidence pertaining to the following matters.....\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Upon the filing of said paper the clerk of the District Court retransferred the case to the Middlesex Superior Court. The defendant there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>upon filed a motion in the Superior Court to return the case to the District Court on the ground that no request for retransfer had been made. The motion was heard by a justice of the Superior Court, who ordered the case returned to the District Court \u201cfor the determination whether the request for re-transfer to the Superior Court was duly filed within the provisions of General Laws, chapter 231, section 102C\u201d. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion in the District Court \u201cthat the request for re-transfer to the Superior Court filed by the plaintiff be adjudged as not duly filed within the provisions of General Laws, chapter 231, section 102C and that judgment be entered for the defendant\u201d. The motion was allowed after hearing and the plaintiff duly requested a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment squarely presented the question as to whether the plaintiff had effectively exercised her right to \u201chave the case retransferred for determination by the superior court\u201d (G.L. c. 231, s. 102C). A paper was filed by the plaintiff within the ten day period prescribed by the statute for filing a request for retransfer. If as matter of law such paper should have been construed as a request for retransfer, the court erred in ordering judgment for the defendant, as in such case the plaintiff would have been entitled to a new trial in the Superior Court, with or without jury depending on whether the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>therefor was renewed within ten days after the filing in the Superior Court of the decision of the District Court. (Q-.L. c. 231, s. 1020).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Examination of the substance of the paper filed by the plaintiff discloses no words requesting a retransfer to the Superior Court. Textually, it is an insistence on a jury trial and a reservation of the right to introduce evidence on certain stated issues, according to the practice in the Superior Court after a hearing before an auditor. (See Rule 88 of the Superior Court Rules). The word \u201cRetransfer\u201d does appear in the caption of the paper following the words \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Motion To\u201d and preceding the words \u201cand Insistence on Jury Trial and Right to Introduce Further Evidence\u201d. Both parties are in agreement that papers filed in court are to be interpreted in accordance with their true character. See <em>Metropolitan Transit Authority </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>323 Mass. 707, 709. The plaintiff argues that the true character of the paper in question is that of a request for retransfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In insisting on a jury trial, the paper necessarily contemplated a trial in the Superior Court, even though as a demand for a trial by jury it was premature under the remand procedure (See G-.L. c. 231, s. 102C). Its caption contains the words: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Motion to Re-transfer\u201d. This, too, demonstrates an intent to claim a new trial in the Superior Court. Construing the paper other than as a request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>for retransfer would render it completely irrelevant, a nullity. As the court said in <em>Essex Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Averill, </em>321 Mass. 68 (at p. 70), \u201cIt is to he presumed that the (plaintiff) intended by her (paper) to \u2018 accomplish something and not do a futile act\u2019 \u201d, citing <em>Hays v. Georgian, Inc., </em>280 Mass. 10, 15. The inartfulness with which the paper was drafted has muddied the waters and has made this a difficult case to decide. However, since the statute (c. 231, \u00a7 1020) does not prescribe with particularity the form of request for retransfer to the Superior Court, this paper which was filed within the time required for the filing of such a request and which may reasonably be construed as seeking a new trial in the Superior Court should be held to have satisfied the requirements of the statute. We hold that the District Court erred in not construing the paper filed by the plaintiff as a request for retransfer and in ordering judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The defendant has argued in his brief that this Division has no jurisdiction to hear appeals in cases remanded to the District Courts, that the only remedy of an aggrieved party is to request a retransfer to the Superior Court. This is not so. <em>Lubell </em>v. <em>National Stores, Inc., </em>342 Mass. 161, 165, 166; <em>McGloin v. Nilson, </em>348 Mass. 716, 718, 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The justice\u2019s action allowing the defendant\u2019s motion \u201cthat the Request for Retransfer \u2014 filed by the plaintiff be adjudicated as not duly filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u2014 and that judgment be entered for the defendant\u201d, is hereby vacated; and the clerk of said District Court is directed to retransfer the case to the Superior Court in the manner provided by General Laws, c. 231, \u00a7 102 C.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AC3\">Howard S.
