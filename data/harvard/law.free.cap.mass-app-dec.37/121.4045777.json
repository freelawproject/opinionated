Shor\u201d and \u201cArnold S. Daniels \u2019 the latter being the appellant in the proceedings before this Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">As the defendant points out in his brief, the sole issue in these cases is whether from the evidence offered at the trial, there was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to find as. a fact that the defendant Daniels, in signing as an endorser, adopted the waiver appearing not over his endorsement, but over that of a prior endorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">Although a report from the District Court to the Appellate Division is the report of the trial judge, it is still the responsibility of the ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>grieved party to see to it that the report is complete enough to enable the Appellate Division to determine whether there has been prejudicial error. <em>Vengrow </em>v. <em>Grimes, </em>274 Mass. 278; <em>Posell </em>v. <em>Herscovitz, </em>237 Mass. 513 at 516-517.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ABf\">Morris A.
