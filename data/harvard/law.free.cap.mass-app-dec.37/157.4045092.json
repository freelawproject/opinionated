The defendant seasonably filed a demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, setting forth the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">1. The plaintiff\u2019s declaration and the account annexed thereto, marked \u201cA\u201d, are lacking in substantive facts necessary to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">2. The plaintiff has not set forth any facts with conciseness and with such substantial certainty as is required by the provisions of General Laws, Chapter 231, Section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">3. The allegations contained in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration and in the account annexed thereto, marked \u201cA\u201d, are too vague and too indefinite to be capable of being intelligently answered to by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">4. The plaintiff\u2019s declaration and the account annexed thereto marked \u201cA\u201d lack a sufficient bill of particulars to enable the defendant to answer thereto, and constitute a mass of ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">On June 3, 1966, the court entered an order overruling the defendant\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">The defendant claims to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s overruling of the demurrer and that decision is the only question before us for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">There was no error. The declaration sets forth with substantial certainty the substantive facts necessary to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"A8_\">This declaration was on a common count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>and by statute need only state a conclusion as to liability such as the defendant owes a certain sum for services rendered, G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 7. The plaintiff has compiled with the statute. Such a count, however, must be accompanied by a bill of particulars and this apparently is where the defendant claims to be mainly aggrieved.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b165-8\">Marshall M. Dranetz of Hyannis for the Plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AW2\">Maurice H. Kramer of Boston for the Defendant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We find that the plaintiff has complied with the form and the intent of the statute and if there is some information missing which the defendant seeks in order to intelligently prepare its defense, it has at least two remedies available to it. It may seek additional particulars, G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 70, or file interrogatories under G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">A review of the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings in this case leads us to the conclusion that the trial justice was correct in overruling the defendant\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">There being no prejudicial error, the report is ordered dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
