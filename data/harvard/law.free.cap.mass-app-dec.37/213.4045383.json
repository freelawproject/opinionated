The defendant requested a report claiming it was error to deny its request that the evidence did not warrant a finding that a proper notice of the alleged breach was given the seller by the buyer. The notice, otherwise admitted to be sufficient, failed to state the date of the purchase although known to the buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The report states: \u201cAt the trial, there was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff purchased the soup in question on January 19,1966 from the defendant, and on that day suffered injury to his throat upon swallowing a piece of metal contained in the soup.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Introduced in evidence was the following letter sent to the defendant by counsel for the plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">\u201cJanuary 27, 1966</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">Stop &amp; Shop, Inc. 1530' Boston Road Springfield, Mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\">Gentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-13\">This office represents Patrick R.

Co. </em>332 Mass. 439, 442-443, held <em>inter alla, </em>that the notice of breach of warranty given under the Sales Act, G-.L. c. &lt;\u00a7 38, \u201cWhere practicable . . . should refer to the particular sales ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">C. 106 $ 2-607, (3) of the Uniform Commercial Code, which became effective October 1, 1958, provides \u201cWhere a tender has been accepted (a) the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach, notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">In <em>Nugent </em>v. <em>Popular Markets, Inc., </em>353 Mass. -, reversing a decision of this Division,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>court, in an opinion by C. J. Wilkins, held that notice of breach required by the Code is \u201cless rigorous than that required by the Sales Act at least so far as applied to a household purchaser rather than a \u2018merchant buyer\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b222-8\">Louis H. Cohex of Springfield for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AYx\">Stephen A. Moore of Boston for the defendant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">As to the failure of the buyer to state the date of the purchase in a notice almost identical to the one in issue, the court said: \u201cIt was, of course, possible to give the exact date of the purchase, but we are not disposed for this reason alone to act contrary to the comment to the Code, and to deprive a good faith retail consumer of his remedy by relying on the rule requiring notification, which is designed to defeat commercial bad faith\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Further, the court held, that once a seller has been \u201calerted\u201d to a claim of breach, he cannot remain inactive. \u201cThere would have been nothing to prevent the seller from seeking further information as to the date of the transaction and any other circumstances it wished to know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">There was no error. The report is to be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b221-12\"> Reported in 16 Legalite 404.
