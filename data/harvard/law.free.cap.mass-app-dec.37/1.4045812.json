A finding of fact is not a proper subject of a report, but the question whether the evidence requires a finding does present a question of law which may be reported to the appellate division. <em>Soutier </em>v. <em>Kaplow, </em>330 Mass. 448, 450. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Cromartie, </em>339 Mass. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b8-6\">It was error to deny the defendant\u2019s requested rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b8-7\">The justice made special findings that the plaintiff, a New Jersey corporation, is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling aluminum products at wholesale; that the defendant is a Massachusetts corporation engaged in the wholesale and retail sale of aluminum products; that the defendant did business in New Jersey and was there represented by one Moore and one Bradigan, the latter being Moore\u2019s assistant; that the plaintiff furnished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>aluminum products to the defendant in New Jersey; and that Moore and Bradigan as the defendant\u2019s agents ordered the goods from the plaintiff which delivered them to the defendant corporation in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-5\">All the material evidence is reported. It does not sustain the findings directly or by reasonable inference. It is reported that one David Bailey was known to the plaintiff\u2019s president and general manager as a salesman. In February and April, 1962, he learned from Bailey that he was doing business as the Larkin Company in Bast Patterson, New Jersey, that he had taken over the Air Lite Building and that Moore and Bradigan were to assist him in operating an aluminum siding business. Moore to be in charge. The goods delivered by the plaintiff are shown on three invoices dated respectively May 18, June 8 and July 7, 1962. Bach invoice shows a sale to \u201cThe Larkin Company, Route #46, Bast Patterson, New Jersey.\u201d The goods described in the first invoice were picked up by A. Ott, in the second by D. Merlo and in the third by B. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-6\">We discern nothing in the reported evidence which supports the justice\u2019s finding that Moore and Bradigan were operating the defendant\u2019s business in New Jersey or even that the defendant did business in New Jersey. Nor do we find any evidence that the plaintiff furnished aluminum products to the defendant in New Jersey. There is no evidence which war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>rants the finding that the goods were order\u00e9d for the defendant\u2019s account. None of the personalities referred to are shown to have been associated with the defendant in any way. The four requested rulings denied 'should have been allowed. Their denial was prejudicial error. A finding for the defendant was required by the evidence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b10-5\">S CHAIR <em>&amp; </em>DlTQUET of Braintree for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b10-4\">The finding for the plaintiff must be reversed. The defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
