The court denied Neva-rez-Arreola\u2019s two requests for downward adjustments in his offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines, finding that he neither qualified as a minimal or minor participant under guideline section 3B1.2 nor had he accepted personal responsibility for the offense under guideline section 3E1.1. Because the two findings are not clearly erroneous, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Appellant Nevarez-Arreola and his code-fendant below, Pedro Morales-Torres, met with two Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms undercover agents in El Paso, Texas, to negotiate a drugs-for-weapons transaction. Failing to conclude a bargain, the parties conducted several follow-up telephone conversations, finally agreeing that in exchange for thirty pistols and $80,-000 the defendants would deliver four ounces, nine grams of heroin. It was agreed that Morales-Torres would meet one agent in one part of El Paso while Nevarez-Arreola simultaneously would meet the second agent at another location. The meetings took place and both defendants were arrested immediately after Nev-arez-Arreola handed to the second agent approximately 107 grams of heroin. Morales-Torres had provided a .13 gram sample to the first agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Nevarez-Arreola was charged with the following four counts under a five-count indictment: conspiracy to possess more than 100 grams of heroin with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846 (count 1); possession with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin, contrary to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (count 2); aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin within one thousand feet of a public junior high school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 845a (count 3); and conspiracy to receive firearms shipped in interstate commerce with the intent to use them to violate narcotics laws, contrary to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 924(b) (count 4). Nev-arez-Arreola plead guilty to count 1 in return for dismissal of the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">At the presentence interview with a probation officer, appellant stated that he agreed with the factual scenario outlined in the preceding paragraph. He told the officer that he participated in the offense as a favor to Morales-Torres, that he was to receive no compensation for his services and that he got involved purely out of his own stupidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The probation officer stated in the pre-sentence report that he disbelieved Neva-rez-Arreola\u2019s statements and that, in the officer\u2019s opinion, Nevarez-Arreola appeared not to have accepted personal responsibility for the crime. The report further stated that both defendants were equally culpable in the conduct of the offense. The officer calculated the sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines at 70 to 87 months, plus five years supervised release and a mandatory fifty dollar assessment. The recommended sentence was based on guidelines offense level 26, derived from the nature of the offense and the defendant\u2019s moderate criminal history (level 2), with no upward or downward adjustment in the offense level warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">At the sentencing hearing, Nevarez-Ar-reola\u2019s counsel objected to the recommendations in the presentence report, asserting that the defendant deserved a four-level downward offense-level adjustment because he was a \u201cminimal participant,\u201d or at least a two-level downward adjustment for being a \u201cminor participant,\u201d under guideline section 3B1.2. Counsel also objected to the report on the ground that the defendant had accepted personal responsibility for his role in the crime and on that basis also should receive a two-level downward adjustment. The court disagreed with both objections, finding the defendant\u2019s claims incredible. The defendant declined to allo-cute. The court sentenced Nevarez-Arreo-la to 70 months imprisonment followed by five years supervised release, and made the mandatory fifty dollar assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Nevarez-Arreola appeals his sentence on two grounds. First, he contends that the district court erred in denying him minimal participant status, which would entitle him to a four-level downward sentence adjustment under guideline section 3B1.2. He claims that the record clearly shows his involvement was not significant until he actually delivered the heroin, and that he was subservient to Morales-Torres, who bargained with the government agents at the initial meeting and conducted the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>sequent telephone negotiations. He does not appeal the denial of minor participant status.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Second, Nevarez-Arreola complains that the district court erred by refusing a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under guideline section 3E1.1. He points out that he did not attempt to escape arrest and that he pleaded guilty to the count on which he was sentenced. He explains his failure to give the arresting agents and the probation officer a more detailed explanation of the crime by claiming that as a minimal participant he was unable to relate a clearer account of his and Morales-Torres\u2019 activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Our role in reviewing sentences made under the guidelines is confined to determining whether a sentence was \u201cimposed in violation of law\u201d or \u201cas a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e). We must affirm guideline applications based on factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, <em>United States v. Mejia-Orosco, </em>867 F.2d 216, 221, <em>clarified on petition for reh\u2019g, </em>868 F.2d 807 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 3257, 106 L.Ed.2d 602 (1989), including applications based on findings concerning a defendant\u2019s degree of participation in criminal activity under guideline section 3B1. <em>See id.; United States v. Hewin, </em>877 F.2d 3, 4 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The sentencing court must reduce the defendant\u2019s offense level by four if it finds the defendant to have been a minimal participant in the crime. Guideline \u00a7 3B1.2(a). Section 3B1.2(a) applies to defendants who \u201care plainly among the least culpable\u201d of those involved in the criminal activity. Application Note 1 to \u00a7 3B1.2(a). The defendant\u2019s lack of understanding of the enterprise\u2019s scope and structure and of the activities of others are indicative of the role of minimal participant. <em>Id. </em>Application of section 3B1.2(a) is appropriate, for example, to \u201csomeone who played no other role in a very large drug smuggling operation than to offload part of a single marihuana shipment\u201d or \u201cwas recruited as a courier for a single smuggling transaction involving a small amount of drugs.\u201d Application Note 2 to \u00a7 3B1.2(a). The section is designed to be applied infrequently, as many offenses are committed by actors of \u201croughly equal culpability so that none of them will receive an adjustment....\u201d Commentary to \u00a7 3B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">Nevarez-Arreola was not a minimal participant in this conspiracy. He accompanied Morales-Torres at the initial meeting with the government agents, which indicates the role of silent principal rather than errand-runner. Except for the .13 gram sample that Morales-Torres furnished to the first agent, Nevarez-Arreola alone had charge of and delivered the 107 grams of heroin. He also assented to the prosecutor\u2019s factual basis for conviction which described him as Morales-Torres\u2019 \u201cpartner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">This court has affirmed a finding that couriers whose only role in a drug offense was to transport a large amount of marijuana in an automobile are not entitled to minimal, or even minor, participant status. <em>Hewin, </em>877 F.2d at 4-5. Nevarez-Arreo-la\u2019s level of participation, deeper than that of a mere courier, compels the conclusion that the district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">Nevarez-Arreola\u2019s second contention, that the district court erred in determining that he had not accepted responsibility for his role in the offense, is also without merit. The determination of the sentencing court as to whether the defendant has accepted responsibility is entitled to even greater deference than that accorded under a pure clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Roberson, </em>872 F.2d 597, 610 (5th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Tellez, </em>882 F.2d 141, 143 (5th Cir.1989). This is so because the sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate whether the defendant has indeed accepted responsibility. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">Turning now to the substance of the guidelines, section 3E1.1(a) provides that the sentencing court must reduce the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>fense level by two if \u201cthe defendant clearly demonstrates a recognition and affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility for the offense.... \u201d A \u201cdefendant may be given consideration under this section without regard to whether his conviction is based on a guilty plea or finding of guilt by the court or jury....\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1(b). Furthermore, a guilty plea does not as a matter of right entitle the defendant to the reduction. \u00a7 3E1.1(c). A guilty plea may, however, be considered evidence of acceptance of responsibility. Commentary to \u00a7 3E1.1. This court has affirmed a downward adjustment for a defendant who voluntarily surrenders to authorities, <em>United States v. Toles, </em>867 F.2d 222, 223 (5th Cir.1989), and has affirmed the denial of the adjustment to one who had attempted to escape arrest. <em>United States v. Franco-Torres, </em>869 F.2d 797, 799 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The record amply supports a finding that the defendant did not accept responsibility. The district court found that the plea bargain was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in Nevarez-Arreola\u2019s pleading guilty. The overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt of each of the counts viewed against the lenience of the government\u2019s plea agreement supports this finding. Although he did not attempt to escape arrest, Nevarez-Arreola did not surrender; he was arrested. Moreover, Nevarez-Arreola failed to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding the offense to the probation officer which \u201cmay ... be considered in evaluating a defendant\u2019s sincerity in claiming acceptance of responsibility.\u201d Background commentary to guideline \u00a7 5K1.2. <em>See United States v. Barreto, </em>871 F.2d 511, 513 (5th Cir.1989). Finally, the defendant refused to allocute at sentencing, and the record reveals no other statement by Nevarez-Arreola expressing remorse or contrition. <em>See United States v. Gordon, </em>876 F.2d 1121, 1127-28 (5th Cir.1989). The district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Because the district court applied the guidelines in accordance with findings that were not clearly erroneous, the judgment and sentence under the Sentencing Reform Act are</p>\n<p id=\"AHZ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
