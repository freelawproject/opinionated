We review the alleged deficiency in the jury charge by looking to the entire charge in the total context of trial including arguments made to the jury. <em>United States v. Chagra, </em>807 F.2d 398, 402 (5th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 832, 108 S.Ct. 106, 98 L.Ed.2d 66 (1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">Reading the entire charge and looking at its use at trial makes it clear that the trial judge properly instructed the jury that the government had to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that Fotovich was presumed to be innocent. The government\u2019s closing argument included reference to the fact that the jury would have to believe that the government proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, as did the closing argument on behalf of Fotovich. Additionally, Fotovich\u2019s counsel argued to the jury that \u201c[w]e don\u2019t have to show you that he\u2019s innocent or he\u2019s a little bit innocent or whatever. The duty is upon them to show you beyond any reasonable doubt that he\u2019s in fact guilty....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-18\">Furthermore, the sentence in the charge to which Fotovich objected, when viewed in context, is appropriate. The trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-19\">Now, remember that you\u2019re here only to decide the guilt or innocence of Mr. Fotovich. You\u2019re not here to try anybody else. You\u2019re not here to decide whether or not anybody else is guilty or not. The only question is, is he guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM6Q\">The language used by the trial judge is found almost verbatim in the Pattern Jury Instructions prepared by the Fifth Circuit District Judges Association:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-20\">I caution you, members of the Jury, that you are here to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused from the evidence of this case. The Defendant is not on trial for any act or conduct or offense not alleged in the indictment. Neither are you called upon to return a verdict as to the guilt or innocence of any other person or persons not on trial as a Defendant in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-21\">U.S. Fifth Circuit District Judges Association, Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal Cases, p. 26 (1983); <em>see also id. </em>at 27, 47, 178, 191. <em>Cf.

Johnson, </em>575 F.2d 1347, 1367 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 907, 99 S.Ct. 1213, 59 L.Ed.2d 454 (1979) (\u201cThe trial court properly instructed the jury that they were to determine the guilt or innocence of each defendant based only upon the evidence against that defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Azz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>There was no deficiency in the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"A0k\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-14\">.
