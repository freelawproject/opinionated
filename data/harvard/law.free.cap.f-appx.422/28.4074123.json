PARKER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b52-17\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b52-18\">Rupinder Kaur appeals from her conviction by a jury of misappropriation of postal funds, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711, and making false entries and reports of moneys, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2073. Kaur principally argues that the Government violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(E) by failing to adequately disclose a video clip about which the Government elicited testimony during redirect examination of one of its witnesses. Kaur requests a new trial or a judgment of acquittal on account of the Government\u2019s alleged violation of Rule 16 of the Federal Criminal Rules of Procedure. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-19\">Rule 33(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a trial court \u201cmay vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\u201d \u201cThe test is whether \u2018it would be a manifest injustice to let the guilty verdict stand.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Guang, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>511 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>969 F.2d 1409, 1414 (2d Cir.1992)). A new criminal trial is proper if there is \u201c \u2018a real concern that an innocent person may have been convicted.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Parkes, </em>497 F.3d 220, 232 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Ferguson, </em>246 F.3d 129, 134 (2d Cir.2001)). This Court reviews a denial of a Rule 33 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u201cWe will not disturb [a] conviction if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, \u2018any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>631 F.3d 608, 613 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting <em>United States v. Xiao Qin Zhou, </em>428 F.3d 361, 370 (2d Cir.2005)). This Court reviews de novo a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In light of these principles, and after an exhaustive review of the record, we conclude for substantially the same reasons articulated by the district court that the district court properly denied Kaur\u2019s motion for a new trial and motion for a judgment of acquittal because the Government did not violate Rule 16 of the Federal Criminal Rules of Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">We have considered all of Kaur\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
