KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b755-19\">Plaintiff-Appellant Peter Rosa, a state inmate represented by counsel, seeks a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) so that he may challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. Because Mr. Rosa has not made the requisite showing to obtain a COA, we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-20\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-21\">Mr. Rosa was charged with first degree murder, tampering with evidence, and conspiracy to commit first degree murder for his involvement in the murder of a wheelchair-bound inmate while incarcerated. R. 1000-01. He confessed to holding the victim while another inmate stabbed him over 200 times. <em>Id. </em>at 1001. Mr. Rosa unsuccessfully sought to suppress the confession before trial and on appeal to the New Mexico Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>704-05. Before trial, Mr. Rosa agreed to waive his right to jury trial in exchange for the prosecution\u2019s agreement not to seek the death penalty. <em>Id. </em>at 1001. During the bench trial, defense counsel sought a provocation defense based on the victim\u2019s alleged attempted sexual assault on Mr. Rosa in an effort to reduce the murder charge from first degree to second degree or voluntary manslaughter. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge found Mr. Rosa guilty of all three charges and sentenced him to life imprisonment on February 21, 2000. <em>Id. </em>at 688. The New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 688-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Mr. Rosa filed a state habeas petition on January 6, 2008. <em>Id. </em>at 690. After an evidentiary hearing, the state district court denied the petition in a summary order dated October 30, 2006. <em>Id. </em>The New Mexico Supreme Court denied certiorari on December 28, 2006. <em>Id. </em>at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Mr. Rosa raised five claims in his federal habeas petition but abandoned two during the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1002, 1007. The remaining claims were based on the alleged ineffective assistance of his two trial attorneys. First, Mr. Rosa argued that counsel were ineffective for failing to ensure that his waiver of jury trial was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>Id. </em>at 1002. Mr. Rosa also argued that his attorneys failed to adequately investigate and pursue an insanity defense based on Mr. Rosa\u2019s psychiatric history at trial, and failed to use his mental health issues to suppress his confession. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Before reaching a conclusion on the merits, the magistrate judge held the action in abeyance to allow the state district judge to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the ineffective assistance of counsel claims that he rejected in the state habeas proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1003. The state district judge issued an order with findings affirming his October 30, 2006 order, and the New Mexico Supreme Court denied certiorari on November 25, 2009. <em>Id. </em>at 686, 783. The magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing on December 1, 2009, and recommended denial of the petition, as the state district court\u2019s rejection of Mr. Rosa\u2019s claims was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 1019. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendation, dismissed the petition with prejudice, and denied a COA. <em>Id. </em>at 1044, 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">On appeal, Mr. Rosa raises the same three ineffective assistance of counsel claims that were rejected by the federal district court. Before he may proceed, he must obtain a COA. A COA may issue only upon a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When the district court denies a habeas petition on the merits, a COA may issue only when the petitioner demonstrates \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We must incorporate deferential treatment of state court decisions and findings into our consideration of a request for a COA. <em>Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 938 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">To prevail on his \u00a7 2254 petition, Mr. Rosa must show that the state court\u2019s decision on the merits \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or ... was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (d)(2). We presume the factual findings of the state court are correct unless the petitioner rebuts that presumption by \u201cclear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">A state court\u2019s decision is contrary to clearly established federal law where \u201cthe state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law\u201d or \u201cthe state court decides a case differently than [the Court] has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court\u2019s decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law where it \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme Court\u2019s] decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An unreasonable application is something more than a federal court\u2019s independent judgment that the application is erroneous or incorrect; to warrant habeas relief the application must be objectively unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Mr. Rosa must show (1) deficient performance, and (2) prejudice, meaning \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201c[W]hen evaluating an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under \u00a7 2254(d)(1), our review is \u2018doubly deferential.\u2019 We defer to the state court\u2019s determination that counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient and, further, defer to the attorney\u2019s decision in how best to represent a client.\u201d <em>Crawley v. Dinwiddie, </em>584 F.3d 916, 922 (10th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1420, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">A. <em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Mr. Rosa first argues that counsel were ineffective in failing to ensure that Mr. Rosa\u2019s waiver of his right to a jury trial was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. Aplt. Br. at 13-20. Specifically, Mr. Rosa contends that counsel knew of his extensive psychiatric history and knew that he was taking psychotropic medications when he signed the jury waiver and that these conditions rendered Mr. Rosa incapable of understanding the waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 19-20. He also contends that counsel were ineffective because they were split on whether Mr. Rosa should waive his right to jury trial and because Mr. Rosa had limited time to make his decision. <em>Id. </em>at 17, 19. Finally, Mr. Rosa argues that he believed that counsel would pursue a defense based on his mental health history at the bench trial and not a provocation defense based on the victim\u2019s attempted sexual assault on Mr. Rosa. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">The state habeas court rejected these claims, holding that \u201c[t]he testimony of [Mr. Rosa\u2019s attorneys] clearly established that Peter Rosa made the decision after careful consideration and advice including the advantages and disadvantages of the waiver of a jury trial,\u201d and \u201c[p]art of the consideration of the waiver of the jury trial included the extreme prejudicial impact of the photographs of [the victim] documenting the injuries sustained and the corroboration presented in the autopsy report.\u201d R. 700-02. In addition, the court noted that \u201c[n]o adverse impact of any psychotropic medications was noted by this Court or defense counsel during the criminal proceedings. Peter Rosa appeared fully aware of the circumstances and alert throughout the criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693. Finally, the state district judge found that Mr. Rosa\u2019s testimony was not credible. <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(e)(1), we presume these factual findings to be correct, and Mr. Rosa has not rebutted this presumption by clear and convincing evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>dence. The federal district court concluded that Mr. Rosa did not establish either prong of <em>Strickland. Id. </em>at 1019. We conclude that reasonable jurists would not find the district court\u2019s resolution debatable or wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Mr. Rosa\u2019s argument that his counsel were ineffective under <em>United States v. Rossillo, </em>853 F.2d 1062 (2d Cir.1988) and <em>United States v. Cole, </em>813 F.2d 43 (3d Cir.1987) is misplaced. These cases addressed a district court\u2019s duty in determining the validity of a guilty plea in a Rule 11 proceeding, not counsel\u2019s effectiveness in explaining the benefits, burdens, and consequences of a bench trial. In addition, Rule 11 does not apply to state court proceedings. <em>Miles v. Dorsey, </em>61 F.3d 1459, 1467 (10th Cir.1995); <em>Warren v. Gartman, </em>297 Fed.Appx. 767, 769 (10th Cir.2008) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">B. <em>Failure to Investigate and Pursue an Insanity Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Mr. Rosa next argues that trial counsel were ineffective in failing to adequately investigate and pursue an insanity defense at trial. Aplt. Br. at 20-24. Relatedly, Mr. Rosa contends that counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and use his mental history to suppress his confession. <em>Id. </em>at 26. The primary thrust of his argument is that counsel should have used evidence that Mr. Rosa suffered from psychiatric and auditory hallucinations that caused homicidal and suicidal ideations. <em>Id,, </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">1. <em>Failure to Investigate and Pursue Insanity Defense at Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The record shows that trial counsel were aware of Mr. Rosa\u2019s mental history and knew that he had been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. R. 849, 955. The state habeas court concluded that counsel \u201cthoroughly investigated the insanity defense, considered the defense of insanity as a viable option and, as a matter of trial tactics and strategy, decided not to pursue this defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701. The court added that \u201c[p]art of the evaluation included whether or not an independent evaluation would be conducted and the impact if this evaluation was disclosed to the prosecution. A motion for an independent evaluation was prepared but not filed. The decision not to conduct an independent evaluation was a matter of trial strategy and tactics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703. In addition, the court noted that counsel did not pursue the insanity defense because they thought it would open the door to compromising evidence from Mr. Rosa\u2019s past, including the fact that he had attempted to kill his parents. <em>Id. </em>at 699-700. The federal district court concluded that Mr. Rosa did not establish either prong of <em>Strickland. Id. </em>at 1019. Reasonable jurists would not find the district court\u2019s conclusion debatable or wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The fact that certain psychiatric records were never presented before a state judge does not change our conclusion. <em>See </em>Aplt. Br. at 12. These records merely bolster what counsel already knew \u2014 that Mr. Rosa has a mental disorder. Trial counsel knew about and investigated Mr. Rosa\u2019s disorder, and as a matter of trial strategy, chose not to pursue an insanity defense because they feared that presenting this evidence at trial would ultimately harm Mr. Rosa\u2019s case. R. 849, 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">2. <em>Failure to Investigate and Pursue Insanity Defense at Suppression Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">With regard to the suppression hearing, counsel unsuccessfully sought to suppress Mr. Rosa\u2019s confession before trial and raised the issue on direct appeal before the New Mexico Supreme Court, arguing that the length and circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Mr. Rosa\u2019s detention before the confession \u2014 more than fifty straight hours in a cold cell in just boxers with little food and water, no running water, no access to his family or counsel, and a light that shined constantly, making it difficult to sleep\u2014 rendered the confession involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 243, 704-05. The New Mexico Supreme Court concluded that after examining the \u201cfacts surrounding the statement, the inferred psychological state of [Mr. Rosa] at the time he made the statement, and the legal ramifications of that inferred state of mind,\u201d Mr. Rosa made a voluntary confession. <em>Id. </em>at 311. The state habeas court adopted the New Mexico Supreme Court\u2019s holding on direct appeal that Mr. Rosa\u2019s confession was voluntary, and concluded that counsel were not ineffective in failing to use Mr. Rosa\u2019s mental health history to suppress the confession. <em>Id. </em>at 704-05. The court reached this conclusion notwithstanding the fact that at the state habeas hearing both counsel conceded that in hindsight, presenting evidence of Mr. Rosa\u2019s mental history may have helped in suppressing the confession. <em>Id. </em>at 705. The federal district court concluded that Mr. Rosa did not establish either prong of <em>Strickland. Id. </em>at 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We need not address whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because we conclude that Mr. Rosa has not shown that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (defendant must show deficient performance and prejudice). The state habeas court expressly held that Mr. Rosa \u201cappeared fully aware of the circumstances and alert throughout the criminal proceedings\u201d and, adopting the holding of the New Mexico Supreme Court, concluded that his confession was voluntary. <em>Id. </em>at 693, 704-OS, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Mr. Rosa has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that his confession would have been suppressed had counsel presented evidence of Mr. Rosa\u2019s mental health history. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Reasonable jurists would not find the district court\u2019s rejection of this claim debatable or wrong.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
