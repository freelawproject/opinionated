He traded these and other images for more child pornography by posting advertisements on a website and using e-mail to exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>files with persons who responded. Authorities eventually discovered and seized <em>from </em>Pruitt photos, DVDs, and over a thousand computer files containing child pornography. Because of his prior conviction for indecent solicitation of a child, Pruitt was a registered sex offender at the time of this offense. He pleaded guilty without a plea agreement to producing child pornography, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a), advertising child pornography, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2251(d)(1)(A), receiving child pornography, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(B), and possessing child pornography, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), and was sentenced to a total of 480 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Pruitt filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed lawyer has concluded that the case is frivolous and seeks permission to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Pruitt has not accepted our invitation to respond to counsel\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>CIR. R. 51(b). We confine our review to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Schulz, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir. 2002). Pruitt does not want his guilty pleas vacated, so counsel properly omits any discussion about the adequacy of the plea colloquy or the voluntariness of the pleas. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670-72 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Counsel further notes that Pruitt does not wish to challenge the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines or the statutory penalties, which leaves counsel with little else to discuss. Pruitt\u2019s total offense level of 42 and Category V criminal history yielded an imprisonment range of 360 months to life, and the parties agreed that the governing statutes required a minimum sentence of 420 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e) (mandating at least 25 years for persons who advertise child pornography after a prior conviction related to sexual abuse); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2260A (requiring 10-year consecutive term for registered sex offenders who violate \u00a7 2251). The court sentenced Pruitt to a total of 480 months, explaining that it had curbed its inclination to impose a life sentence because Pruitt had shown some remorse. But still, the court decided, a significant sentence was required: \u201c[A] lengthy sentence must be imposed to make sure that if you do live out a lengthy sentence that you\u2019ll be at an age where hopefully acting out is not appropriate, maybe not desired. But it will certainly be in a different lifetime. It will be when you\u2019re an old man.\u201d Counsel has not identified any reason to disregard the presumption of reasonableness we apply to sentences within the guidelines range. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Pape, </em>601 F.3d 743, 746 (7th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
