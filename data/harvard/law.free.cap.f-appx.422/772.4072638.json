Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1256 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.1990), overruled on other grounds by <em>United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc). The United States \u201cobjected] for the record.\u201d Record, Vol. 2 at 85.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dixon had no objections. <em>Id. </em>at 85-88. He now appeals his sentences, i.e., the total period of incarceration, 48 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Although he did not object to his sentences as required by <em>Jones, </em>Dixon asks us to entertain two objections he could have presented to the district court: (1) the district court\u2019s refusal to make a preliminary ruling on whether the Government had met its burden improperly shifted the burden of proof to Dixon and compelled him to testify in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, and (2) the district court erred in denying him a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), by misapplying the legal test for minor-role reductions set forth in <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>Specifically, he contends that the court failed to compare his relative culpability with that of his co-conspirators, ignoring his particular vulnerability in light of his personal circumstances and his motives for the commission of the crimes. Because Dixon did not present these objections to the district court, we consider them under the plain error doctrine. <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">To establish plain error, Dixon must show that: (1) the district court erred; (2) the error is plain; (3) it affects his substantial rights; and (4) it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id,. </em>In this circuit, \u201cat least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291. That is the situation here. Dixon points to nothing in the case law or statutory law or rules of procedure that would have informed the district court that it was committing the errors Dixon cites here. Accordingly, plain error did not occur, and Dixon\u2019s sentences are</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\">. The sentence range prescribed by the Guidelines for the conspiracy and bank fraud counts called for imprisonment for a term of 37 to 46 months. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A called for a consecutive sentence of 24-months\u2019 imprisonment. Hence, a total within-Guidelines sentence would fall between 61 months and 70 months, substantially in excess of the total sentence, 48 months, the court imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\">. We assume that the Government was objecting to the court's downward departure from the Guidelines prescribed sentence range for tile combined counts. The Government, however, has not appealed Dixon\u2019s sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
