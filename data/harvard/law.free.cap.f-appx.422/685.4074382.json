The district court sentenced him to twelve months and one day of imprisonment, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range. When he appealed, the United States moved to enforce the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Hahn, </em>359 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>F.3d 1315, 1328 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Under <em>Hahn, </em>in evaluating a motion to enforce a waiver, we consider: \u201c(1) whether the disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights; (2) whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) whether enforcing the -waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325. Mr. Beltran-Nino argues that his appellate issue is outside the scope of the waiver and that the waiver was not knowing and voluntary. Because he does not challenge the miscarriage-of-justice factor, we need not consider it. <em>See United States v. Porter, </em>405 F.3d 1136, 1143 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Mr. Beltran-Nino wishes to appeal the district court\u2019s application of Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6), which addresses \u201cintentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d The appeal waiver broadly \u201cwaives the right to appeal ... any sentence within the statutory maximum penalty authorized by law,\u201d Plea Agt. at 7, which in this case was ten years, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(B)\u00ae. Because he seeks to challenge a sentence that is well under the statutory maximum, the appeal is within the scope of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The reason Mr. Beltran-Nino argues to the contrary, and also why he argues that the waiver was not knowing and voluntary, is rooted in the parties\u2019 negotiations. Despite discussing various sentencing factors, neither party foresaw that the probation officer would suggest that the court apply \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6). Before this court, Mr. Beltran-Nino contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">It is fiction to contend that an appellant, believing he has addressed and satisfied all possible sentencing guideline factors in his plea agreement, knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights when he did not know that a sentencing enhancement would be imposed that neither he nor the United States contemplated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Resp. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\"><em>Hahn </em>specifically rejected the proposition that, because at the plea stage the defendant will not know what errors a district court might make later in the proceeding, a pre-sentencing waiver cannot be knowing and voluntary. 359 F.3d at 1326-27. Hahn also cautioned against \u201cthe logical failings of focusing on the result of a proceeding, rather than on the right relinquished, in analyzing whether an appeal waiver is unknowing or involuntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1326 n. 12. Thus, Hahn forecloses Mr. Beltran-Nino\u2019s argument that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary because he did not know how the court would apply the Guidelines. Although he urges us to overturn this aspect of Hahn and the cases following it, this panel is bound by the court\u2019s precedent absent an en banc reconsideration or a superseding decision by the Supreme Court. <em>In re Smith, </em>10 F.3d 723, 724 (10th Cir.1993) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">Moreover, Mr. Beltran-Nino\u2019s assertions of an unknowing and involuntary waiver contradict his representations during his plea colloquy. During the colloquy, the magistrate judge addressed the possibility that Mr. Beltran-Nino might receive a higher sentence than he anticipated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">THE COURT: Do you understand that the sentence the district judge gives you may be different than the sentence you\u2019ve discussed with your lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">DEFENDANT BELTRAN-NINO: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-14\">THE COURT: Do you understand that it\u2019s possible you could receive the maximum sentence allowed under the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>DEFENDANT BELTRAN-NINO:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATV\">Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">THE COURT: And even if you do, you\u2019re giving up your right to appeal and you\u2019re giving up your right to collaterally attack the sentence, except on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">DEFENDANT BELTRAN-NINO:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1t\">Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Mot. to Enforce, Attach. 1 (Plea Colloquy) at 11-12. Accordingly, not only is the argument legally precluded, but also it is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">The motion to enforce the plea agreement is GRANTED and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-18\"> This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
