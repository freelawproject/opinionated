We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-23\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that, even if Singh credibly established past persecution, any presumption of a well-founded fear was rebutted by evidence that he could reasonably relocate within India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(B); <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez, </em>336 F.3d at 998-99. Accordingly, Singh\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-24\">Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez, </em>336 F.3d at 1001 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-25\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Singh failed to demonstrate it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(3); <em>see also Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">We reject Singh\u2019s contention that the IJ failed to adequately consider his documentary evidence. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir.2000) (petitioner must overcome the presumption that the agency considered all the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We decline to review Singh\u2019s contention that he is eligible for humanitarian asylum because the BIA did not review this claim, <em>see Azanov v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1013, 1020-21 (9th Cir.2004), and he does not contend the BIA erred in failing to do so, <em>see Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b677-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
