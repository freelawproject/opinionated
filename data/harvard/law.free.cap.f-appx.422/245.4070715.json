In the plea agreement, Gardner reserved the right to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress evidence seized from his vehicle. Gardner contends on appeal that the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of Gardner\u2019s suppression motion, we review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Blake, </em>571 F.3d 331, 338 (4th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1104, 175 L.Ed.2d 919 (2010). Because the district court denied Gardner\u2019s motion, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Famor, </em>535 F.3d 210, 217 (4th Cir.2008). We also defer to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>United States v. Abu Ali, </em>528 F.3d 210, 232 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The Fourth Amendment guarantees \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure ... against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. This guarantee requires that \u201csearches be conducted pursuant to a warrant issued by an independent judicial officer.\u201d <em>California v. Carney, </em>471 U.S. 386, 390, 105 S.Ct. 2066, 85 L.Ed.2d 406 (1985). There are, however, \u201ca few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions\u201d to this general rule. <em>California v. Acevedo, </em>500 U.S. 565, 580, 111 S.Ct. 1982, 114 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">With these standards in mind, and having reviewed the transcript of the suppression hearing and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Gardner\u2019s motion to suppress. The record amply supports the district court\u2019s finding that a law enforcement officer asked Gardner for consent to search his vehicle and that Gardner voluntarily consented to the search. <em>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973) (recognizing that consent is an exception to the warrant requirement and that voluntariness of consent depends on the totality of the circumstances); <em>United States v. Lattimore, </em>87 F.3d 647, 650 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc) (listing factors appropriate for consideration in reviewing whether consent was voluntarily given).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <em>the court </em>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\"> Because we conclude that the evidence permitted the district court to conclude that Gardner voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle, we need not evaluate whether the officers involved also possessed probable cause to conduct the search.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
