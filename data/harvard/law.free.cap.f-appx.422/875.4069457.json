U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). Our review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the manner in which it was exercised has been arbitrary or capricious. <em>See Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir. 2005) (explaining the abuse of discretion standard in the context of a motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). A motion to reconsider that merely reiterates arguments previously presented to the BIA does not substitute specifying errors of facts or law as required for a successful motion to reconsider. <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Martinez\u2019s motion to reconsider failed to identify any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision upholding the IJ\u2019s denial of his application. Instead, Martinez merely reargued he was eligible for withholding of removal and extraordinary circumstances excused the untimely filing of his asylum application. Martinez reiterated that the FARC persecuted him because of an imputed political opinion, and that he faced persecution if he returned to Colombia. Martinez previously advanced those arguments before the BIA. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s decision to deny Martinez\u2019s motion was neither arbitrary nor capricious. Accordingly, we deny Martinez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
