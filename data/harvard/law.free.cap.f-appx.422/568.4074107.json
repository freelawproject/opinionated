We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-22\">Jackson contends that the Board of Prison Terms\u2019 2005 decision to deny him parole for five years was not supported by \u201csome evidence\u201d and therefore violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-23\">After briefing was completed in this case, this court held that a certificate of appealability is required to challenge the denial of parole. <em>See Hayward v. Marshall, </em>603 F.3d 546, 554-55 (9th Cir.2010) (en banc). Now the Supreme Court has held that the only federal right at issue in the parole context is procedural, and the only proper inquiry is what process the inmate received, not whether the state court decided the case correctly. <em>See Swarthout v. Cooke,\u2014 </em>U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 859, 178 L.Ed.2d 732 (2011) (per curiam). Because Jackson raises no procedural challenges regarding his parole hearing, a certificate of appealability cannot issue. Further, because Jackson has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, we decline to certify the remaining claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-26\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b592-28\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
