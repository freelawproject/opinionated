We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">As an initial matter, this Court has held that a litigant\u2019s failure to file objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, even when that litigant is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>waives any challenge to the report on appeal. <em>See Cephas v. Nash, </em>328 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201cAs a rule, a party\u2019s failure to object to any pm-ported error or omission in a magistrate judge\u2019s report waives further judicial review of the point.\u201d). A <em>pro se </em>litigant must be given notice of this rule; notice is sufficient if it informs the litigant that the failure to timely object will result in the waiver of further judicial review and cites pertinent statutory and civil rules of authority. <em>See Frank v. Johnson, </em>968 F.2d 298, 299 (2d Cir.1992); <em>Small v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>892 F.2d 15, 16 (2d Cir. 1989) <em>(pro se </em>party\u2019s failure to object to report and recommendation does not waive right to appellate review unless report explicitly states that failure to object will preclude appellate review and specifically cites 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), as well as Rules 72, 6(a), and former Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">Here, the magistrate judge gave Cooper adequate notice that he was required to file objections to the report and recommendation, and specifically informed him that failure to object to any portion of the report would preclude his right to appellate review, citing the pertinent statutory and civil rules. Accordingly, Cooper has waived his right to appellate review of the issues discussed in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. In any event, because Cooper does not challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims under \u00a7 104 of the LMRDA as moot, or the dismissal of his construed duty of fan-representation claims as untimely, these claims are abandoned. <em>See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995) (holding that claims raised below but not raised on appeal are abandoned, even as to <em>pro se </em>litigants).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">Nevertheless, following a <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we conclude that the district court properly adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and correctly granted the Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and denied Cooper\u2019s motion to amend his complaint. We thus affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the same reasons as set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s well-reasoned and thorough report and recommendation. We have considered Cooper\u2019s arguments on appeal, and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
