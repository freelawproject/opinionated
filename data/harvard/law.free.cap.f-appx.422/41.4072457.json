Apr. 21, 2010), <em>ajfg </em>No. A088 376 087 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 15, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. The IJ reasonably relied on inconsistencies between Dong\u2019s asylum application and his testimony regarding: (1) the date he entered the United States; (2) where he was staying at the time family planning officials destroyed his home; and (3) where he was staying when family planning officials were looking for him in 2005. The IJ also reasonably relied on Dong\u2019s non-responsive testimony after questions had been repeated to him and his most comfortable dialect had been verified. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005) (stating that the Court defers to an IJ\u2019s assessment of demeanor). Dong\u2019s explanations that he was nervous and confused do not compel us to find error in the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>at 80-81 (holding that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">To the extent Dong argues that the discrepancies in his testimony were not significant, the IJ was entitled to rely on the inconsistencies in assessing the totality of the circumstances, no matter how \u201cminor,\u201d because Dong\u2019s application is governed by the Real ID Act. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Finally, contrary to Dong\u2019s assertions, the IJ did not have a duty to further develop the record because the burden of establishing eligibility for asylum rested with Dong, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), and the IJ did attempt to have Dong clarify his inconsistent answers. <em>See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 148 n. 5 (2d Cir.2008) (noting that this Court has not held that an IJ has a duty to develop the record other than \u201cto identify and probe perceived inconsistencies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Given the inconsistencies and the demeanor finding, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), 1252(b)(4)(B). Because Dong\u2019s claims were all based on the same factual predicate, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was a proper basis for denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
