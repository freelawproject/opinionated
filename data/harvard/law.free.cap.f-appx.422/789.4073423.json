(\u201cSwire\u201d) on Counts I, II, and IV; (2) the district court\u2019s order, dated October 9, 2009, grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>ing Swire\u2019s motion to strike the testimony of Kaufman\u2019s experts, Jose Perea and Ralph Puig; and (3) the district court\u2019s dismissal order, dated June 23, 2009, dismissing with prejudice Kaufman\u2019s claims in Counts III and V. With respect to the dismissal order, Kaufman only appeals the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal with prejudice of Count V in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Even without considering Kaufman\u2019s experts, we conclude the district court erred in granting summary judgment as to Counts I, II, and IV and dismissing Count V in its entirety at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage. As to Count V, we conclude the complaint stated a cause of action for actual damages. As to Counts I, II, and IV, the record presents genuine issues of material fact unsuitable for resolution at the summary judgment stage. Because factual issues for trial are presented even without Kaufman\u2019s experts, we need not decide whether the district court abused its discretion in granting Swire\u2019s motion to strike in order to decide the summary judgment issues as to Counts I, II, and IV. Further, we note that the district court ruled \u201cthat Mr. Jose Perea and Mr. Ralph Puig\u2019s testimony be excluded unless timely offered for rebuttal.\u201d Given the reversal of the summary judgment order and the district court\u2019s allowing Kaufman\u2019s experts to testify anyway (albeit limited to rebuttal), we conclude both parties on remand should now be given adequate opportunity to depose each other\u2019s experts before trial and each party\u2019s experts should be allowed to testify at trial. We vacate the above district court orders to the extent stated above and remand this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-18\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR TRIAL.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
