WHITE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Defendant-Appellant Robert Jackson appeals the district court\u2019s revocation of his supervised release and imposition of a sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment and six months\u2019 supervised release. He argues that the district court violated his due process rights when it did not offer him an opportunity to cross examine the probation officer at the supervised-release revocation hearing, and that the court\u2019s sentence was procedurally unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Jackson pleaded guilty on July 13, 2009 to interfering with public service at a federal building in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 245(b). On October 14, 2009, he was sentenced to time served plus one day, to be followed by one year of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">In April 2010, the United States Probation Office filed a Petition for Warrant for Offender under Supervision, alleging six violations of the terms of Jackson\u2019s supervised release. The alleged violations were: 1) that he left the judicial district without permission (by driving to Indiana); 2) that he failed to submit monthly written reports to his probation officer for January, February, and March 2010; 3) that he failed to notify his probation officer of a change of address; 4) that he used marijuana (and admitted to the probation officer that he had done so); 5) that he committed a state offense in Indiana (resisting law enforcement); and 6) that he failed to take psychiatric medication as prescribed. The district court held a supervised-release revocation hearing on September 21, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">At the revocation hearing, Jackson admitted that he left the district without permission, that he did not file written reports with his probation officer in February and March of 2010, and that he was convicted of a state offense in Indiana. Jackson denied the other allegations (that he failed to inform his probation officer of a change of address, that he had admitted to using marijuana, and that he stopped taking, and admitted to not taking, his prescribed psychiatric medication). The district court found that based on the three admitted violations alone, Jackson would be guilty of a Grade B violation, which requires revocation of supervised release. The court then calculated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>maximum sentence for the violation under the Sentencing Guidelines: 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court heard from Jackson\u2019s counsel and from the government regarding their suggestions for sentencing, and provided Jackson with an opportunity to speak. The court then questioned the probation officer about the charges Jackson had denied, but did not place the probation officer under oath. The officer described his basis for alleging the three violations Jackson denied, the court credited his testimony and found Jackson guilty of all six alleged violations. The court revoked Jackson\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to six months\u2019 imprisonment followed by six months\u2019 supervised release, to be served in a residential reentry center. Jackson filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Jackson argues that the district court violated due process by failing to allow him to cross examine the probation officer, whose uncontested, and unsworn, statement provided the basis for the court\u2019s finding that Jackson committed the three alleged violations he did not admit. Jackson did not request to cross-examine the probation officer at the hearing and did not object to the lack of cross-examination or the court\u2019s failure to place the officer under oath. Therefore, this Court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Warman, </em>578 F.3d 320, 345 (6th Cir.2009). To constitute plain error, there must be \u201c(1) error (2) that was obvious or clear, (3) that affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights and (4) that affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 386 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">A district court may revoke a term of supervised release if it \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). \u201cThe same procedural requirements applicable to hearings regarding revocation of parole apply to hearings regarding revocation of supervised release.\u201d <em>United States v. Lowenstein, </em>108 F.3d 80, 85 (6th Cir.1997). In <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), the Supreme Court held that, although \u201cthe full panoply of rights due a defendant in [criminal prosecutions] does not apply to parole revocations,\u201d due process does require certain minimum procedural protections \u201cto assure that the finding of a parole violation will be based on verified facts and that the exercise of discretion will be informed by an accui-ate knowledge of the parolee\u2019s behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480, 484. As announced by the <em>Morrissey </em>Court, the minimum requirements of due process for revocation hearings include \u201cthe right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489; <em>see also Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973) (discussing due process guarantees in revocation-of-probation hearings); <em>United States v. Kirby, </em>418 F.3d 621, 627-28 (6th Cir.2005) (applying <em>Momssey </em>to supervised-release-revocation hearings). The constitutional requirements announced in <em>Morrissey </em>are codified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1, which provides that in a revocation hearing the defendant is entitled to \u201can opportunity to appear, present evidence, and question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2)(C); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 32.1, Advisory Committee Notes to the 2002 Amendments (explaining that in applying Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C), \u201c[t]he court is to balance the person\u2019s interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>constitutionally guaranteed right to confrontation against the government\u2019s good cause for denying it,\u201d and citing <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. 2598). The \u201cflexible evidentiary standard that applies to revocation proceedings allows consideration of evidence that would be inadmissible in a criminal prosecution,\u201d but it does not strip the defendant of all protections. <em>United States v. Whitely, </em>356 Fed.Appx. 839, 843 (6th Cir.2009) (unpublished). Thus, Jackson had a presumptive right to confront any adverse witness, which could be denied by the district court for good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Assuming, arguendo, that the court\u2019s 1) consideration of the unsworn statement of the probation officer and 2) failure to offer Jackson the opportunity to cross-examine the officer were error, that error did not affect Jackson\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Whitely, </em>356 Fed.Appx. at 843 (\u201c[W]e can assume, without deciding, that the district court\u2019s consideration of the unsworn probation officer\u2019s statements violated Whitely\u2019s rights and constituted an obvious error. We conclude, however, that any error was harmless because it did not affect Whitely\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d). For an error to affect substantial rights, \u201cin most cases ... the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>403 F.3d 813, 815 (6th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). Jackson cannot make that showing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Jackson admitted three of the alleged supervised-release violations. The court found that those violations, alone, constituted a Grade B violation of supervised release, which required revocation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a) (describing grades of supervised-release violations); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l) (\u201cUpon a finding of a Grade A or B violation, the court <em>shall </em>revoke ... supervised release.\u201d (emphasis added)). At the conclusion of the hearing, after crediting the testimony of the probation officer and finding Jackson guilty of all six violations, the court again determined that Jackson had committed a Grade B violation. Thus, finding Jackson guilty of the additional three violations as a result of the probation officer\u2019s statement had no effect on the grade of the violation, and thus no bearing on whether Jackson\u2019s supervised release would be revoked or the Guidelines range for the sentence upon revocation. With or without the officer\u2019s statement, the court was required to revoke Jackson\u2019s supervised release, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l), and, pursuant to \u00a7 7B1.4(b)(3)(A), Jackson was subject to a maximum sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment upon revocation. Thus, because Jackson has failed to demonstrate prejudice, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Jackson also argues that his sentence was proeedurally unreasonable because the district court miscalculated his Guidelines range. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">Jackson failed to object to the Guidelines\u2019 calculation before the district court, which would generally subject his reasonableness challenge to plain-error review. <em>See United States v. Simmons, </em>587 F.3d 348, 354 (6th Cir.2009). He argues that the court failed to ask the <em>Bostic </em>question, and therefore that the sentence should be reviewed for reasonableness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>498 F.3d 336, 340 (6th Cir.2007). Regardless of which standard applies, Jackson\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>A sentence is procedurally unreasonable \u201cwhen the district court \u2018fails to consider the applicable Guidelines range or neglects to consider the other factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and instead simply selects what the judge deems an appropriate sentence without such required consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moon, </em>513 F.3d 527, 539 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 243, 250-51 (6th Cir.2007)). Jackson contends that the court committed procedural error when it \u201cconsidered his Guidelines range to be 18-24 months, instead of the properly calculated 12 months.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. 12.) Jackson committed a Grade B violation, and had a criminal history category of V. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), the Guidelines range would be 18-24 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, \u00a7 7B1.4(b)(3)(A) provides that the sentence may not be \u201cgreater than the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute.\u201d The statutory maximum sentence is found at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), which sets the maximum term of imprisonment at 12 months based on the severity of Jackson\u2019s original offense (a misdemeanor). Therefore, Jackson\u2019s effective Guidelines range was a maximum of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The district court calculated a Guidelines range of 18-24 months pursuant to \u00a7 7B 1.4(a), but then immediately stated that \u201cpursuant to Section 3583(e)(3), Title 18, the maximum term of imprisonment upon revocation of Mr. Jackson\u2019s supervised release is 12 months.\u201d (Hr\u2019g Tr. 23.) The court then referenced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, discussed reasons justifying the chosen sentence, and announced a within-Guidelines sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment plus six months of supervised release. The court recognized the correct Guidelines range and sentenced Jackson within it. Contrary to Jackson\u2019s assertion, the court did not believe the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range was 18 months; it correctly identified the maximum possible sentence as 12 months. Therefore, the sentence was procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\">. After announcing the sentence, the court inquired: \"Comments, suggestions, objections ... ?\u201d (Hr\u2019g Tr. 26, R. 55.) It did not ask the full <em>Bostic </em>question as typically phrased.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
