Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo due process claims, <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence Perez-Gonzalez submitted with his motion to reopen was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See id. </em>at 601 (if \u201cthe BIA determines that a motion to reopen proceedings in which there has already been an unreviewable discretionary determination concerning a statutory prerequisite to relief does not make out a prima facie case for that relief,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 bars this court from revisiting the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>To the extent Perez-Gonzalez contends that the BIA failed to consider some or all of the evidence he submitted with the motion to reopen, he has not overcome the presumption that the BIA did review the record. <em>See id. </em>at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In light of our disposition, we do not reach Perez-Gonzalez\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b633-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
