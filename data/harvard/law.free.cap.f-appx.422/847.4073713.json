Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam). When a statute limits our review, we \u201cretain jurisdiction to determine the underlying jurisdictional facts at issue.\u201d <em>Resendiz-Alcaraz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>383 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2004). We have jurisdiction, under the REAL ID Act of 2005,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to decide questions of law or constitutional claims that an alien raises in a petition for review of a final order of removal. <em>Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-21\">Morales first argues that the BIA and IJ unfairly exercised their discretion, unreasonably adjudicated her claim, and committed prejudicial error when they determined that she failed to demonstrate extreme hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-22\">An alien deemed inadmissible (i.e., removable) for being convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude may apply for a waiver of inadmissibility if the alien\u2019s child is a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident and the alien\u2019s denial of admission would result in an \u201cextreme hardship\u201d to the child, and the Attorney General has discretion to grant the waiver upon such a showing. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (h)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (h)(1)(B). Because the grant or denial of a waiver based on \u201cextreme hardship\u201d is discretionary and does not present a constitutional claim or question of law, we lack jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>review such a grant or denial. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(i), (a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), (a)(2)(D) (as amended by the REAL ID Act); <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1297-98 (11th Cir. 2001) (analyzing \u201cextreme hardship\u201d and the associated jurisdictional bar under the substantially similar transitional IIRIRA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Because the BIA\u2019s determination that Morales failed to demonstrate extreme hardship did not involve a constitutional issue or question of law, we dismiss these claims for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Next, Morales contends that the BIA and IJ violated due process<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and committed a legal error by applying the wrong legal standard \u2014 requiring a showing of rehabilitation and contrition for her past crimes \u2014 to her application for a waiver of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review Morales\u2019s due process claim for two reasons. First, Morales\u2019s failure to exhaust her due process claim before the BIA deprives us of jurisdiction to review it. INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if \u2014 (1) the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right----\u201d); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1251 (\u201c[Petitioner\u2019s] allegation of a due process violation \u2014 that he was denied a full and fair hearing before a neutral factfinder \u2014 is precisely the kind of procedural error which requires exhaustion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">Second, even if Morales had exhausted her due process claim, we would lack jurisdiction to consider it because due process is not implicated by the denial of discretionary immigration relief. <em>Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1301-02 (11th Cir.1999) (concluding that because the failure to receive discretionary relief in an immigration context does not implicate due process, the failure to be considered for discretionary immigration relief cannot implicate due process). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction over Morales\u2019s due process claim, and it is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">However, we do have jurisdiction to consider the legal question of whether the IJ and BIA applied the wrong legal standard when they evaluated Morales\u2019s application for a waiver of inadmissibility. <em>See Frech v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>491 F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.2007). We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, but to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-17\">In this case, the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning concerning Morales\u2019s failure to demonstrate the requisite extreme hardship to a qualifying relative to establish her eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). But having made that determination, the BIA explicitly refused to consider whether Morales\u2019s circumstances merited a favorable exercise of discretion in connection with her application. The BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning regarding factors not listed within INA \u00a7 212(h)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(1)(B). Consequently, we will not review that portion of the IJ\u2019s opinion, <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>F.3d at 1284, and we deny Morales\u2019s claim concerning the application of an incorrect legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-17\">.
