He noted a timely appeal. Johnson\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he asserts that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questions the reasonableness of Johnson\u2019s sentence. Specifically, counsel argues that: (1) the government failed to prove the amount of loss attributable to Johnson; (2) the government failed to prove that the loss was foreseeable to Johnson; and (3) the district court erred in assigning a two-level enhancement for abuse of a position of public trust. Although advised of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, Johnson has not done so. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The guidelines provide that the amount of loss for purposes of sentencing enhancements is the greater of the actual loss or the intended loss. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 3(A) (2008). The amount of loss is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Loayza, </em>107 F.3d 257, 265 (4th Cir.1997). A sentencing court makes a \u201creasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>316 F.3d 495, 503 (4th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>USSG 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(C). A sentencing enhancement need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Miller, </em>316 F.3d at 503. \u201cIntended loss\u201d is defined as \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense ... and ... includes intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur[.]\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3 (A)(ii). The intended loss amount may be used to determine a sentence, \u201ceven if this exceeds the amount of loss actually possible, or likely to occur, as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>316 F.3d at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Here, the district court determined that the amount of loss (both intended and actual) was $2,565,580.31. This finding was based on the evidence and testimony of FBI Agent Mike McNeely, who testified at Johnson\u2019s sentencing hearing that the loss was calculated by totaling the loan amounts on inflated properties and their actual fair market <em>value </em>\u2014 ie., the \u201cprofit\u201d realized by the members of the conspiracy. Accoi\u2019ding to Agent McNeely, the estimate of loss was a conservative one because it included only those transactions in which Johnson was directly involved between October 2002 and June 2003, even though the conspiracy continued through March 2005. Also, the loss amount did not include two additional transactions in which Johnson later admitted his involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination of the loss amount attributable to Johnson nor in the court\u2019s conclusion that these losses were reasonably foreseeable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">With respect to the enhancement for abuse of a position of trust, we review de novo a district court\u2019s legal interpretation of whether a defendant abused a position of trust under USSG \u00a7 3B1.3 and review its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Ebersole, </em>411 F.3d 517, 535-36 (4th Cir.2005). Section 3B1.3 provides that a defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased by two levels \u201c[i]f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust, or used a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d Accordingly, the enhancement applies if \u201cthe defendant abused a position of trust and that abuse significantly contributed to the commission or concealment\u201d of the underlying offense. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 203 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">The enhancement was applied here because Johnson, a former attorney, acted pursuant to a power of attorney in the closing of two fraudulent mortgage loans. We find no error in the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>conclusion that Johnson\u2019s position and conduct warranted the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Johnson, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Johnson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
