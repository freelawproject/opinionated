See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b663-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-23\">Antonio Diaz-Delgado appeals from his jury-trial conviction and 38-month sentence imposed for being a deported alien found in the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-24\">Diaz-Delgado contends that the admission into evidence of a certificate of nonexistence of record (\u201cCNR\u201d) at trial violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. The admission of the CNR was harmless error because the CNR was cumulative of other evidence demonstrating Diaz-Delgado\u2019s lack of permission to re-enter the United States, including Diaz-Delgado\u2019s admission that he returned illegally, and an Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent\u2019s testimony that there was no evidence of permission to re-enter in Diaz-Delgado\u2019s A-file or computer databases. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Acosta, </em>607 F.3d 1156, 1161-62 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-25\">Diaz-Delgado also contends that <em>Nijhawan v. Holder,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009), effectively overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), such that his prior felony conviction had to be found by a jury before subjecting him to a greater maximum sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). The district court did not err by treating Diaz-Delgado\u2019s prior felony conviction as a sentencing enhancement and increasing his statutory maximum sentence. <em>See United States v. Grajeda, </em>581 F.3d 1186, 1197 (9th Cir.2009) (holding that Almenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>rez-Torres is binding unless it is expressly-overruled by the Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Finally, Diaz-Delgado contends the district court failed to properly apply the parsimony principle embodied in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The record reflects that the district court did not procedurally err, and that Diaz-Delgado\u2019s sentence is not substantively unreasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991-93 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
