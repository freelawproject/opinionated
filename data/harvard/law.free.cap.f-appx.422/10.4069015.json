May 28, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-25\">Generally, we review the BIA\u2019s denial of Huang\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful that such motions are disfavored. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). In this case, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>ever, the fugitive disentitlement doctrine arguably applies. <em>See generally Nen Di Wu v. Holder, </em>617 F.3d 97, 100-01 (2d Cir.2010); <em>Gao v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 173, 175-77 (2d Cir.2007). On September 8, 1998, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice to Huang directing him to surrender for deportation on October 16, 1998. Huang did not claim the notice or surrender as directed but instead filed a motion to reopen over ten years later. In an affidavit submitted with his motion to reopen, Huang did not deny receiving the surrender notice but asserted that he \u201cdecided to stay in the U.S. and wait for a new opportunity to adjust [his] immigration status.\u201d Although Huang now contends that the surrender notice was not delivered, he offers no evidence to overcome the presumption of delivery that we ordinarily accord to notices sent via certified mail in immigration proceedings, <em>e.g., Lopes v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir.2006) (notice of removal hearing), even where such notice is returned unclaimed, <em>see Fuentes-Argueta v. INS, </em>101 F.3d 867, 871-72 (2d Cir. 1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We need not decide whether to exercise our equitable discretion pursuant to the fugitive disentitlement doctrine because, in any event, there is no merit to Huang\u2019s petition. An alien may file only one motion to reopen and must do so within 90 days of the final administrative decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although Huang\u2019s motion was indisputably untimely, there is no time or numerical limitation if the alien establishes materially \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that the birth of Huang\u2019s U.S. citizen son, as well as his alleged practice of Falun Gong in the United States, constituted a change in his personal circumstances, rather than a change in country conditions sufficient to excuse the untimely filing of his motion to reopen. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169-72 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">With respect to Huang\u2019s claim based on his alleged violation of the family planning policy, he abandoned any challenge to the BIA\u2019s dispositive finding that he failed to establish changed country conditions by not raising the issue in his brief to this court. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">With respect to Huang\u2019s Falun Gong claim, there is no merit to his argument that \u201cwhile it is true that the authorities launched [their] campaign of crackdown on Falun Gong several years ago,\u201d he could establish changed country conditions \u201cso long as the authoritiesf] <em>continuous suppression </em>bears a material relationship to [his] successive asylum claim.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. 20-21 (emphasis added). To the contrary, the plain language of the regulation required Huang to demonstrate a material <em>change </em>in country conditions since the time of his hearing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The BIA also reasonably declined to credit an unauthenticated notice, purportedly issued by the village committee in Huang\u2019s hometown in China, based on the Immigration Judge\u2019s underlying adverse credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>bility determination. <em>See Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b35-7\">. As the government notes, a copy of the surrender notice was also sent, and successfully delivered, to Huang\u2019s last counsel of record. Counsel represented Huang before the Immigration Court, but Huang proceeded <em>pro se </em>before the BIA. Thus, it is unclear whether counsel would have been in a position to inform Huang of his obligation to surrender.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
