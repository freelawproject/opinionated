Counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning whether Hayes\u2019s sentence was unduly harsh. Hayes was informed of his right to file a supplemental brief, but he has not done so. After our initial review, we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing whether the district court adequately stated its reasons for imposing the chosen sentence and, if not, whether its failure to do so constitutes harmless error. Having fully considered the arguments raised by Hayes and the Government, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Because counsel preserved any procedural challenge to the sentence by arguing for a below-Guidelines sentence, our review is for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 578, 581, 583-84 (4th Cir.2010). If the district court procedurally erred and thus abused its discretion, we must reverse unless the error is harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 581, 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">In determining the procedural reasonableness of a sentence, this court considers whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, analyzed any arguments presented by the parties, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cRegardless of whether the district court imposes an above, below, or within-Guidelines sentence, it must place on the record an individualized assessment based on the particular facts of the case before it.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where, as here, the district court imposed a within-Guidelines sentence, the explanation may be \u201cless extensive, while still individualized.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>587 F.3d 625, 639 (4th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2128, 176 L.Ed.2d 749 (2010). However, that explanation must be sufficient to allow for \u201cmeaningful appellate review\u201d such that the appellate court need \u201cnot guess at the district court\u2019s rationale.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 329-30 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">Although the district court properly calculated the Guidelines range, allowed counsel to argue in mitigation, and afforded Hayes an opportunity to allocute, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in failing to place on the record an individualized assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors relating to Hayes. \u201cSentencing courts are statutorily required to state their reasons for imposing a particular sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Boulware, </em>604 F.3d 832, 837 (4th Cir.2010). In this case, although the district court briefly stated that it had considered the statutory sentencing factors, the court erred by failing to indicate the basis for rejecting counsel\u2019s arguments for a below-Guidelines sentence. <em>See Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 584 (\u201c[T]he court must offer <em>some </em>\u2018individualized assessment\u2019 justifying the sentence imposed and rejection of arguments for a higher or lower sentence based upon \u00a7 3553.\u201d) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586); <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 328-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Having concluded that the district court proeedurally erred, we next consider whether the error is harmless. In this context, \u201cthe [Government may avoid reversal only if it demonstrates that the error did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the result[,]\u201d such that \u201cwe can [ ] say with fair assurance! ] that the district court\u2019s explicit consideration of [the defendant\u2019s] arguments would not have affected the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Boulware, </em>604 F.3d at 838 (internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted). Relevant factors in this analysis include whether the record leaves any doubt that the district court considered the defendant\u2019s arguments in light of the relevant \u00a7 3553 factors and any other information submitted, <em>id. </em>at 839, and the strength of the defendant\u2019s arguments for a different sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 839 \u2014 40; <em>Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">With these standards in mind, we conclude that the Government met its burden. In this case, the district court indicated that it had performed its duties to consider the relevant \u00a7 3553 factors in light of the arguments and evidence presented by Hayes\u2019s counsel. Moreover, the arguments for leniency Hayes advanced at sentencing were less than compelling, and Hayes \u201cproduced no evidence that the effects on others from [his] imprisonment would be unusually severe.\u201d <em>Boulware, </em>604 F.3d at 840. Thus, any procedural error is harmless and does not require reversal. Finally, with regard to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, Hayes has failed to rebut our presumption that his within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178,193 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Hayes, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Hayes requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdi'aw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Hayes. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
