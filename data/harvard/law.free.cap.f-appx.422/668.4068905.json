Because Rodriguez has failed to satisfy the standards for the issuance of a COA, we deny his request and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b692-23\">On August 30, 2006, Rodriguez pled guilty to possession of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(viii). On April 30, 2007, the district court sentenced Rodriguez to a term of 250 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Rodriguez appealed to this court, challenging the district court\u2019s findings regarding the amount of methamphetamine found in his possession. On April 14, 2008, we affirmed Rodriguez\u2019s sentence in an unpublished opinion. <em>United States v. </em>Rodriguez, 285 Fed.Appx. 518, 522 (10th Cir.2008). Rodriguez then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, which the Court denied on October 6, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>On October 21, 2009, Rodriguez filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging that he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. The district court denied Rodriguez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition because it was not timely filed. Following the district court\u2019s order, Rodriguez filed with this court a notice of appeal and a request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">A petitioner must obtain a COA in order to appeal a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. A COA may be issued only upon a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). Where a district court has rejected a petitioner\u2019s constitutional claim on the merits, the petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1), an individual has one year from the date a judgment of conviction becomes final to file a petition for habeas relief. In this case, Rodriguez\u2019s judgment of conviction became final on October 6, 2008, when the Supreme Court denied his petition for certiorari. Thus, Rodriguez had until October 6, 2009 to file a habeas petition. Although Rodriguez argues that he mailed the petition on October 4, 2009, the district court concluded that he filed the petition on October 21 and denied the petition based on the one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Rodriguez argues that his petition was timely under the prisoner mailbox rule. The mailbox rule states that an inmate who places a habeas petition \u201cin the prison\u2019s internal mail system will be treated as having \u2018filed\u2019 [the petition] on the date it is given to prison authorities for mailing to the court.\u201d <em>Price v. Philpot, </em>420 F.3d 1158, 1165 (10th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988)). \u201cHowever, the inmate must attest that such a timely filing was made and has the burden of proof on this issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Ceballos-Martinez, </em>387 F.3d 1140, 1143 (10th Cir.2004)). In order to establish timely filing, an inmate must either (1) prove that he made timely use of the prison\u2019s legal mail system if a satisfactory system is available; or (2) if a legal mail system is not available, prove timely use of the prison\u2019s regular mail system by submitting a notarized statement or a declaration under penalty of perjury indicating the date on which the document was given to prison officials for mailing. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Ceballos-Martinez, </em>387 F.3d at 1144-45).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">Rodriguez claims his habeas petition was timely because he placed it in the prison mail system on October 4, 2009. He wrote on the outside of the envelope that the petition was \u201cPut in mailbox 10-4-09 Before the 10-6-09 deadline.\u201d ROA Vol. 1, at 31. Rodriguez also affirmed in the petition itself that \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d the petition was placed \u201cin the prison mailing system on 10 \u2014 3\u2014[09].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">Despite evidence that Rodriguez mailed the petition by October 4, the district court did not receive the petition until October 21 because Rodriguez placed the wrong address on the envelope. Although he indicated that the letter was to go to the \u201cFederal Courthouse\u201d; Rodriguez wrote the address for the United States Attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ney\u2019s Office in Tulsa, Oklahoma, rather than the correct address for the federal courthouse in Tulsa. <em>Id. </em>at 31. The United States Attorney\u2019s Office forwarded the petition to the courthouse, but it did not arrive until October 21. After receiving the habeas petition, the district court ordered Rodriguez to provide it with \u201ca certified copy of the prison mail log showing that he placed his pleading in the prison mail system on or before October 6, 2009.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72. The district court stated that if Rodriguez \u201cfail[ed] to establish that the envelope was, in fact, placed in the prison mail system on or before October 6, 2009, his motion [would] be dismissed as untimely.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">In response to the district court\u2019s order, Rodriguez submitted a document from \u201cD. Lloyd\u201d, a counselor at the Federal Correctional Complex in Forrest City, Arkansas. <em>Id. </em>at 76. According to Lloyd, Rodriguez \u201csent the letter to [the] court on October 4, 2009 ... [but] did not send it certified so there is no way to track it from [the prison] to [the] court.\u201d <em>Id,. </em>Nonetheless, Lloyd stated that he \u201ctalked to Rodriguez [on] October 4, 2009 about his case\u201d and \u201cRodriguez told him he was mailing the letter to [the] court\u201d that day. <em>Id. </em>Because Lloyd \u201cwas going in the direction of the institutional mail room, [he] escorted Rodriguez[ ] to the mail officer and witnessed him give the letter to the officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Despite Lloyd\u2019s statement on this matter, the district court concluded that Rodriguez\u2019s habeas petition was untimely because he \u201cwas ultimately responsible for having his Motion to Vacate delivered to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office and the motion was not filed for more than fourteen days after the statute of limitations expired ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">We deny Rodriguez\u2019s request for a COA because his habeas petition is barred by the one-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Rodriguez affirmed under penalty of perjury that he mailed his petition prior to the October 6 deadline, <em>see id. </em>at 25, he has not demonstrated \u2014 as is required in this circuit \u2014 that he did not have access to a legal mail system and thus could send his petition through regular mail and still qualify for the mailbox rule. <em>See Price, </em>420 F.3d at 1166 (the mailbox rule does not apply when an inmate mails a document through the prison\u2019s regular mail system without establishing that the jail did not have a legal mail system). Neither does the fact that a counselor in the prison saw Rodriguez place the letter in the \u201cinstitutional mail\u201d system avail Rodriguez of the mailbox rule. ROA Vol. 1, at 72. We have made clear that \u201c[alleging ... use[ ] [of the] \u2018institutional mails\u2019 is insufficient to connote use of the \u2018legal mail system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Price, </em>420 F.3d at 1166. Because an inmate must prove his compliance with the mailbox rule and because Rodriguez has neither alleged nor proven that the prison in which he is incarcerated does not have a legal mail system, the mailbox rule is inapplicable here. We therefore conclude that his habeas petition was untimely, and we deny his request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Accordingly, Rodriguez\u2019s request for a COA is DENIED and this matter is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b692-15\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-10\">. Rodriguez actually stated in his habeas petition that the petition was mailed on \"10-3-06.\" We assume that Rodriguez meant to indicate that the petition was mailed in 2009, not 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-5\">. The district court denied Rodriguez's habeas petition in large part because he sent his petition to the wrong address. Rather than determine whether an inmate qualifies for the mailbox rule when he uses an incorrect mailing address, we deny Rodriguez's request for a COA because he failed to otherwise qualify for the mailbox rule under the criteria set forth in <em>Price v. Philpot, </em>420 F.3d 1158 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
