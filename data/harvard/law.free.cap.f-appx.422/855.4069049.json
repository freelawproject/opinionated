On appeal, Smith argues that the ALJ\u2019s finding of a severe combination of listed impairments at step two of the evaluation was not supported by substantial evidence because the evidence showed that four other impairments were also severe. Smith contends that the ALJ failed to consider an opinion of a non-examining consultant in making the determination of severe impairments. Smith also asserts that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) legally erred by failing to consider her mental and physical impairments in combination when evaluating her level of disability. Further, Smith argues that the evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Smith\u2019s testimony was not entirely credible, and Smith challenges the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity determination, which was predicated, in part, on the credibility determination, and also provided the basis for the ultimate finding that Smith was not disabled. Finally, Smith argues that the ALJ\u2019s findings were not sufficient to allow meaningful appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">We review a Commissioner\u2019s decision denying Social Security benefits to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were applied. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). The Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are conclusive if, \u201csupported by substantial evidence,\u201d but the Commissioner\u2019s \u201cconclusions of law, including applicable review standards, are not presumed valid.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990) (quotation omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1158 (quotation omitted). We \u201cmay not decide facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the [Commissioner\u2019s] factual findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>894 F.2d at 1529.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step process used to determine whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). Under the first step, the claimant has the burden to show that she \u25a0is not currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i). At step two, the claimant must show that she has a severe impairment or combination of impairments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii). Third, she must attempt to show that the impairment meets or equals the criteria contained in one of the Listings of Impairments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii). Fourth, if the claimant cannot meet or equal the criteria, the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity is assessed, and she must show that she has an impairment which prevents her from performing her past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv). Fifth, once a claimant establishes that she cannot perform her past relevant work due to some severe impairment, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show that significant numbers of jobs exist in the national economy which the claimant can perform. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v); <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">At step two of the sequential analysis, the claimant bears the burden of proving that she has a severe impairment or combination of impairments to demonstrate a qualifying disability. <em>See Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the regulations place \u201ca very heavy burden\u201d on the claimant to demonstrate a qualifying disability); <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1237 (noting that the second step of the analysis requires the ALJ to consider the severity of the claimant\u2019s impairments alone or in combination). Impairments, alone or in combination, are severe if they \u201c \u2018significantly limit\u2019 the claimant\u2019s \u2018physical or mental ability to do basic work skills.\u2019\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1237 (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">When a claimant attempts to establish disability through her own testimony concerning pain or other subjective symptoms, the claimant must satisfy two parts of a three-part \u201cpain standard,\u201d which requires evidence of an underlying medical condition, and either (A) objective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain stemming from that condition, or (B) that the objectively determined medical condition is so severe that it can reasonably be expected to cause the alleged pain. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cAfter considering a claimant\u2019s complaints of pain, the ALJ may reject them as not creditable, and that determination will be reviewed for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Marbury v. Sullivan, </em>957 F.2d 837, 839 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Generally, the opinions of examining or treating physicians are given more weight than non-examining or non-treating physicians unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1), (2); <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir. 1997). Good cause exists to discredit a physician\u2019s testimony when a physician\u2019s opinion is conclusory, contrary to or unsupported by the evidence of record, or inconsistent with the physician\u2019s own medical records. <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. \u201c[Findings and other opinions of State agency medical and psychological consultants ... [are considered] as opinion evidence ...\u201d of non-examining sources. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(f)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">In this case, a review of the entire record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs reflects that the ALJ\u2019s finding of a severe combination of certain listed impairments was supported by substantial evidence, as was the conclusion that the other four impairments named by Smith did not affect Smith\u2019s ability to work, were not severe, and did not impact the severity of the combination of impairments. The ALJ properly followed the opinion of the examining physician over the opinion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>nonexamining consultant, in characterizing the severe impairments. <em>See 20 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1) and (f)(2)\u00ae. The record also reflects that the ALJ considered Smith\u2019s impairments in combination and did not legally err in this regard because the ALJ\u2019s analysis and ultimate determinations were properly predicated on the combined effect of Smith\u2019s impairments and symptoms. Further, the ALJ\u2019s determination was clearly articulated and supported by substantial evidence. Based on all of Smith\u2019s impairments, the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity determination was also supported by substantial evidence. This determination was supported by an examining physician\u2019s opinion, by the opinions of nonexamining consultants, and by the testimony of a vocational expert. Based on the record, we cannot say the ALJ erred in concluding that Smith was not disabled, and the ALJ\u2019s decision was sufficiently supported and articulated to allow our meaningful review.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
