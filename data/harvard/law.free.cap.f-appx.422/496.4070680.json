Downstairs, agents found digital scales, a drug-cutting agent, and a construction press modified to make kilogram-sized bricks of cocaine. Akins pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 140 months\u2019 imprisonment. He now challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of a firearm in connection with a drug-trafficking offense, arguing there was no connection between the gun found and the crimes to which he pled guilty. We review the district court\u2019s determination under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Darwich, </em>337 F.3d 645, 664 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-23\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides, in drug trafficking cases, \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed, increase by 2 levels.\u201d For the enhancement to apply, the Government must initially establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>defendant \u201cactually or constructively possessed the weapon.\u201d <em>United States v. Wheaton, </em>517 F.3d 350, 367 (6th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). If the Government establishes the defendant possessed a weapon, a presumption arises that the weapon was connected to the offense and the burden shifts to the defendant to show it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected to the crime. <em>Id.; United States v. Hough, </em>276 F.3d 884, 894 (6th Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Here, Akins clearly had possession of the gun. It was found in his bedroom, under his own bed. Although he claims the gun belonged to his roommate, this is of no moment because the location of the gun supported the court\u2019s finding that Akins had possession, and, in any event, the law recognizes joint possession. <em>See Hough, </em>276 F.3d at 894 (rejecting argument that because the home was not exclusively defendant\u2019s residence, and the other individuals in the home were armed drug dealers, the guns found there could not be attributed to defendant). Accordingly, the burden shifts to Akins to show that it was \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The district court\u2019s finding that Akins failed to meet this burden was not clearly erroneous. This Circuit has upheld the firearm enhancement in similar cases. For example, in <em>Wheaton, </em>we upheld the enhancement where officers found a loaded gun under a couch cushion in the defendant\u2019s house, even without drugs located inside. 517 F.3d at 367. And in <em>United States v. Gross, </em>we upheld the enhancement where the defendant was arrested for drug trafficking outside his home and police found guns and drug paraphernalia \u2014 though no drugs \u2014 inside his home. 77 Fed.Appx. 338, 340 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Just as in <em>Wheaton </em>and <em>Gross, </em>no drugs were found inside Akins\u2019s home, but there was sufficient other evidence supporting the enhancement, including $90,000 cash, digital scales, a drug-cutting agent, and a construction press modified to make kilogram-sized bricks of cocaine. Further, wiretaps confirmed Akins was receiving large quantities of cash at his home for drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Finally, Akins\u2019s reliance upon <em>United States v. Peters, </em>15 F.3d 540 (6th Cir.1994) and <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995) fails as well. This Court previously considered, and rejected, these arguments. As explained in <em>United States v. Keszthelyi, </em>308 F.3d 557, 579-80 (6th Cir.2002), <em>Peters </em>upheld the district court\u2019s decision <em>declining </em>to apply the enhancement, whereas Akins argues the district court erred in <em>applying </em>it; and <em>Bailey, </em>in construing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), \u201cinterpreted statutory language that was significantly different than the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579 n. 4. Accordingly, neither <em>Peters </em>nor <em>Bailey </em>controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
