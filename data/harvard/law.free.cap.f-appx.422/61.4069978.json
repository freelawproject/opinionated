PARKER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Appellant Maher Fadel Mohammad, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his complaint regarding a default judgment resulting from his student loan. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Because Appellant\u2019s claims against defendant-appellees Overton, Russell &amp; Doerr and Jeffrey S. Doerr were voluntarily dismissed, and Appellant may apply to reinstate his action against those defendants after further proceedings in the Albany County Supreme Court, to the extent that Appellant seeks review of the district court\u2019s order granting voluntary dismissal, we decline to address the merits of that ruling. <em>See Palmieri v. Defaria, </em>88 F.3d 136, 140 (2d Cir.1996) (finding that plaintiffs that receive voluntary dismissals generally cannot prosecute an appeal from the order of dismissal because such an appeal would constitute \u201can end-run around the final judgment rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">Furthermore, the dismissal of the claims against defendant-appellee New York State Higher Education Services Corporation is affirmed. We review the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, </em>construing the complaint liberally and accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true. <em>See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002). The complaint must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Although all allegations contained in the complaint are assumed to be true, this tenet is \u201cinapplicable to legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>-U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). A claim will have \u201cfacial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, even after <em>Twombly, </em>the district court remains obligated to construe <em>pro se </em>complaints liberally. <em>See Hams v. Mills, </em>572 F.3d 66, 71-72 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint on Rule 8 grounds for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Simmons v. Abruzzo, </em>49 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir.1995) (reviewing <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal pursuant to Rule 8 for an abuse of discretion). \u201c[A] district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an <em>error of </em>law (such as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly erroneous factual finding, or ... its decision \u2014 though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding \u2014 cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Wynder v. McMahon, </em>360 F.3d 73, 76 (2d Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). Rule 8(a)(2) provides that a complaint must include \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d The statement must be sufficient to give the defendants \u201cfair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 512, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Having conducted an independent review of the record in light of these principles, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in its thorough and well-reasoned order.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
