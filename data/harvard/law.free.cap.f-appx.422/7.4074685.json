Ashcroft, </em>392 F.3d 549, 550 (2d Cir.2004) (per curiam). \u201cUnder the common law \u2018abuse of the writ\u2019 doctrine, a court need not entertain a petition that abuses the habeas process. One frequently recognized indicator of abusiveness is whether the petitioner could have asserted his present claims in his prior petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, where a petitioner has failed to appeal a previous unfavorable habeas decision, raising a subsequent habeas petition with the same claim abuses the writ. <em>See id. </em>at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-18\">Generally, the government bears the burden of pleading abuse of the writ. <em>McCleskey v. Zant, </em>499 U.S. 467, 494, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991); <em>see also Lewis v. McElroy, </em>294 Fed.Appx. 637, 640 (2d Cir.2008). Nevertheless, this procedural rule that places the burden on the government does not prevent district courts from invoking the doctrine <em>sua sponte, </em>so long as the district court conforms to the same \u201cclarity and particularity requirements set forth in <em>McClesky.\u201d Femia v. United States, </em>47 F.3d 519, 523 (2d Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Before invoking the doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>sua sponte, </em>district courts must provide notice, except in circumstances where the petition, liberally construed, \u201cadmits of no possibility of actual prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Here, it is clear that no prejudice ensued from the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>invocation of the abuse of the writ doctrine. We hold that Garcia\u2019s continued detention is lawful for substantially the same reasons as the district court provided when it denied his second petition. <em>See Garcia v. Heron, </em>No. 09-CV-416, 2009 WL 3231924, at *2-6 (W.D.N.Y. Oct. 1, 2009). Garcia is detained under INA \u00a7 236 pending our review of his claims, rather than INA \u00a7 241, which authorizes detention pending removal. <em>Id. </em>at *2. <em>Zadvydas </em>applies to INA \u00a7 241, not INA \u00a7 236. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 146 (2d Cir.2003). Thus, <em>Zadvydas </em>is inapplicable. In addition, Garcia\u2019s removal has been stayed at his own request. This self-inflicted wound cannot establish grounds for a <em>Zadvydas </em>claim. <em>See Abimbola v. Ridge, </em>181 Fed.Appx. 97, 99 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, a review of Garcia\u2019s second \u00a7 2241 petition shows that he was released from detention in January 2008, but violated the conditions of his release, removed his GPS device, absconded, and subsequently was re-detained after arrest by fugitive operations. These circumstances suggest Garcia is a flight risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Garcia\u2019s third habeas petition is AFFIRMED to the extent that the petition alleged an unconstitutional, prolonged detention. We make no decision about Garcia\u2019s claim of derivative citizenship in his appeal docketed number 09.-4211-pr, which remains pending before this Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
