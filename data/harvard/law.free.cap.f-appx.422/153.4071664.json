Lentz\u2019s claim under the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cBLBA\u201d). After the administrative law judge awarded benefits in 2006, the Board vacated the ALJ\u2019s decision in part and remanded for reconsideration of the proffered medical opinion testimony. The ALJ again awarded benefits on May 5, 2008, and, this time, the Board affirmed. Ispat/Inland, the mine operator responsible for paying benefits, moved unsuccessfully for reconsideration of the Board\u2019s decision and then filed a timely appeal with this Court. We will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Congress enacted BLBA to compensate miners who are totally disabled by pneumoconiosis, which the statute defines as \u201ca chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901(a), 902(b). To recover benefits under BLBA, a claimant must demonstrate (1) he suffers from pneumoconiosis; (2) he is \u201ctotally disabled\u201d; and (3) pneumoconiosis is a \u201csubstantial contributing cause\u201d of his total disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.201-204.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the statute, pneumoconiosis may be \u201cclinical\u201d or \u201clegal.\u201d The former label refers to the category of diseases recognized by the medical community as pneumoconiosis. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(1). The latter is defined as \u201cany chronic lung disease or impairment ... arising out of coal mine employment\u201d including, without limitation, \u201cany chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(2). An obstructive pulmonary condition caused by coal dust exposure satisfies the definition of legal pneumoconiosis. <em>See id.; La-belle Processing Co. v. Swarrow, </em>72 F.3d 308, 315 (3d Cir.1995). Chronic bronchitis, along with emphysema and certain forms of asthma, is a species of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 65 Fed.Reg. 79939 (Dec. 20, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">On appeal, Ispat/Inland contends the ALJ improperly created a presumption in favor of entitlement to benefits by discounting their medical opinion testimony to the effect that Lentz\u2019s pulmonary obstruction was solely attributable to his extensive history of cigarette smoking and that the contribution of coal dust exposure to his condition was \u201cclinically insignificant.\u201d However, the ALJ, on remand, found Lentz to be suffering from both clinical and legal pneumoconiosis. Therefore, because we can affirm the award of benefits on grounds unrelated to this allegedly impermissible presumption, we need not conduct a detailed analysis of Ispat/Inland\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">In 2006, the ALJ awarded Lentz\u2019s claim for benefits based on legal pneumoconiosis after assessing the competing medical testimony. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4) (\u201cA determination of the existence of pneumoconiosis may also be made if a physician, exercising sound medical judgment, notwithstanding a negative X-ray, finds that the miner suffers or suffered from pneumoconiosis as defined in \u00a7 718.201.... Such a finding shall be supported by a reasoned medical opinion.\u201d). Although the ALJ found the x-ray evidence did not support a finding of clinical pneumoconiosis, he credited the testimony of Lentz\u2019s medical witness, Dr. John T. Schaff, in concluding Lentz\u2019s pulmonary condition arose out of his coal mine employment and thus qualified under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>statute and regulations as legal pneumoconiosis. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(b); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(2). The ALJ discounted the opinion of the employer\u2019s competing medical witness, Dr. Gregory J. Fino, as inconsistent with the regulations. Specifically, the ALJ found Dr. Fino erroneously believed Lentz had to establish the presence of clinical pneumoconiosis in order to qualify for recovery under BLBA. Additionally, the ALJ found Lentz had satisfied the other elements of entitlement: the parties stipulated to the existence of a totally disabling pulmonary impairment pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(b), and Lentz successfully demonstrated pneumoconiosis was a substantial contributing cause of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The Board vacated the ALJ\u2019s award and remanded for further consideration of the medical testimony. Notably, the Board wrote: \u201cIf the administrative law judge finds that claimant has met his burden under Section 718.202(a)(4), he must then weigh all of the evidence relevant to the existence of pneumoconiosis together to determine whether the presence of the disease has been established at Section 718.202(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">On remand, the ALJ again awarded benefits. Conceding Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion was not contrary to the regulations, the ALJ nevertheless found it poorly reasoned and ill-substantiated. The ALJ opined that Dr. Fino had both confused the issues of disease causation (whether his pulmonary condition arose out of exposure to coal dust) and disability causation (whether pneumoconiosis contributed to his total disability) and had failed to offer a reasoned explanation for why coal dust exposure was not a factor in Lentz\u2019s chronic bronchitis. More importantly, however, in heeding the Board\u2019s instruction to reweigh all the evidence on the existence of pneumoconiosis, the ALJ reexamined the x-ray evidence and discovered he had made factual errors in reaching his initial decision. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(1) (\u201cA chest X-ray conducted and classified in accordance with \u00a7 718.102 may form the basis for a finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis.... [Wjhere two or more X-ray reports are in conflict, in evaluating such X-ray reports consideration shall be given to the radiological qualifications of the physicians interpreting such X-rays.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Upon revisiting the x-ray evidence and reanalyzing the diverging medical opinions, the ALJ concluded Lentz \u201cestablished the existence of both clinical and legal pneumoconiosis by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d As for disability causation, the ALJ found Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion unworthy of credence because it rested largely on the premise that the x-ray evidence was negative for pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Ispat/Inland again appealed to the Board, challenging the ALJ\u2019s findings of legal pneumoconiosis and disability causation. On this occasion, the Board affirmed the award. It concluded the ALJ had acted in accordance with its instructions in reevaluating the evidence and determining Lentz had established both clinical and legal pneumoconiosis. Consequently, it found the ALJ acted within his discretion in according little weight to Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion on the issue of disability causation because it conflicted with the ALJ\u2019s finding on remand that the x-ray evidence evinced clinical pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Under BLBA, both clinical and legal pneumoconiosis are compensable forms of the disease; a miner need only prove the existence of one form to achieve eligibility for benefits. Before this Court, Ispat/Inland challenges exclusively the ALJ\u2019s findings as to legal pneumoconiosis. However, the ALJ, upon review of the x-ray evidence on remand, found Lentz to be afflicted with clinical pneumoconiosis. The Board acknowledged the ALJ had, in adhering to the Board\u2019s admonition to reconsider \u201call of the evidence relevant to the existence of pneumoconiosis, ... determined that clinical and legal pneumoconiosis had been established at Section 718.202(a).\u201d Ispal/Inland did not contest this finding before the Board and has not raised the issue in its brief on appeal. Therefore, for our purposes, the finding of clinical pneumoconiosis is a settled matter. <em>See Balsavage v. Dir., OWCP, </em>295 F.3d 390, 395 (3d Cir.2002) (\u201cIf substantial evidence exists, we must affirm the ALJ\u2019s interpretation of the evidence even if we might have interpreted the evidence differently in the first instance.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted); <em>Penn Allegheny Coal Co. v. Mercatell, </em>878 F.2d 106, 110 (3d Cir. 1989) (declaring an issue waived if not presented to the Board on administrative appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Lentz established each of the other elements of entitlement. Under the statute, a miner suffering from clinical pneumoconiosis who worked for ten or more years in coal-mine-related employment is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that his pneumoconiosis arose out of that employment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.203(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ispat/Inland conceded Lentz was totally disabled due to a pulmonary condition. And the Board held the ALJ \u201cpermissibly accorded little weight to Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion\u201d on the issue of disability causation because it was predicated on the assumption that Lentz did not have clinical pneumoconiosis. By contrast, the ALJ found Dr. Schaffs opinion on disability causation \u201cadequately reasoned\u201d and concluded Lentz had satisfied his burden with regard to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s finding \u201cthat the weight of the evidence of record was sufficient to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis at Section 718.202(a), and disability causation at Section 718.204(c).\u201d Significantly, the Board did not differentiate between \u00a7 718.202(a)(1), which allows for a finding of the existence of pneumoconiosis based on positive xray reports, and \u00a7 718.202(a)(4), which allows for a claimant to satisfy his burden through medical opinion testimony even in the face of negative x-rays. The Board ordered the ALJ to reconsider all evidence relevant to pneumoconiosis, the ALJ revisited both the x-ray reports (which he concluded established clinical pneumoconiosis under \u00a7 718.202(a)(1)) and the testimony (which he concluded established legal pneumoconiosis under \u00a7 718.202(a)(4)), and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s finding with regard to \u201cthe existence of pneumoconiosis at Section 718.202(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Therefore, the Board found the ALJ acted appropriately in finding Lentz had satisfied each element of his claim, and we discern neither an error of law nor a deviation from the Board\u2019s standard of review. Given Ispat/Inland\u2019s cognizance of the ALJ\u2019s revised stance on the weighting of the x-ray evidence and the Board\u2019s acceptance of the ALJ\u2019s findings, we are able to affirm the Board\u2019s decision without pronouncing, in this particular case, on the propriety of the ALJ\u2019s treatment of the competing medical testimony on the issue of legal pneumoconiosis. <em>See Lombardy, </em>355 F.3d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review and affirm the order of the Benefits Review Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\">.

We review a Board decision to determine whether an error of law has been made and whether the Board has adhered to its own standard of review. <em>Lombardy v. Dir., OWCP, </em>355 F.3d 211, 213 (3d Cir.2004). We review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>and we note the Board is bound by an ALJ's findings of fact \"if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">Mr. <em>Lentz, </em>died on Feb. 11, 2009, without having received any benefit payments from Ispat/Inland. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, administered by the Director, commenced paying interim benefits. Our affirmance of the Board's award will obligate Ispat/Inland to reimburse the Trust Fund. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. 725.603(a). Therefore, the adversity between these parties presents us with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>justiciable case or controversy regardless of whether the interest retained by Mr. Lentz's estate (if such exists) would independently suffice to confer jurisdiction. <em>See Krolick Contracting Corp. v.

Originally, the ALJ found the x-ray evidence to be in equipoise. However, upon review, he realized he had erroneously listed the qualifications of the two physicians who read a June 12, 2003 x-ray. Whereas in his first decision he stated that a \"B-reader\u201d had interpreted the x-ray as positive for pneumoconiosis and a \"duly-qualified physician\u201d had interpreted the x-ray as negative, he realized upon review that it was in fact the duly-qualified physician who had interpreted the x-ray as positive. Because the interpretation proffered by the B-reader is entitled to less weight, this reversal allowed the ALJ to find the June 12 x-ray was positive for pneumoconiosis. Moreover, the ALJ discovered he had listed a reading of a May 13, 2003 x-ray as negative when it was, in fact, simply a \"rereading for quality only\" that did not include any findings as to the pi'esence or absence of pneumoconiosis. Removing that \"re-reading\u201d from the calculus, the ALJ found the May 13 x-ray to be positive for pneumoconiosis as well. Weighing all the x-rays together, tire ALJ found one to be in equipoise and three to be positive. Accordingly, he found Lentz had indeed established clinical pneumoconiosis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b181-6\">. Ispat/Inland disputed whether Lentz\u2019s legal pneumoconiosis arose out of his coal-mine work but did not rebut the presumption as to clinical pneumoconiosis.
