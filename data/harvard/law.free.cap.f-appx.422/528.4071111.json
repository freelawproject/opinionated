In 2008 an administrative law judge denied her disability insurance benefits but awarded her supplemental security income beginning that year. The district court upheld the ALJ\u2019s decision. Ms. Phillips contends on appeal that the ALJ \u201coverlooked\u201d her 2002 injuries or mistakenly set July 2008 as the onset date of her disability. She seeks \u201cback pay,\u201d by which she appears to mean a retroactive award of benefits for the period from February 2002 to July 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-21\">Ms. Phillips, however, is mistaken about the nature of the ALJ\u2019s decision. The ALJ acknowledged her claim that she had been disabled since 2002 but implicitly rejected it, concluding that she became disabled for purposes of supplemental securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ty income only on July 29, 2008, five months before her 50th birthday. In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ generously gave Ms. Phillips the benefit of a \u201cborderline\u201d age determination as a \u201cperson closely approaching advanced age\u201d rather than a \u201cyounger person.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.963(c) (defining \u201cyounger person\u201d as one under age 50), 416.963(d) (defining \u201cperson closely approaching advanced age\u201d as one who is age 50 to 54); SSR 83-10, 1983 WL 31251, at *8 (1983). With the change in her age category, Medical-Vocational Guideline 201.10 directed a finding that Ms. Phillips was disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, \u00a7 201.10. Because Ms. Phillips was not disabled as of March 31, 2007, her date last insured for disability benefits, the ALJ properly concluded that she was not entitled to disability benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)(A), (c)(1); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.131; <em>Briscoe ex rel. Taylor v. Barnhart, </em>425 F.3d 345, 348 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Ms. Phillips offers no legal or factual basis for disturbing the ALJ\u2019s decision, which reflects thorough consideration of the record. To the extent Ms. Phillips believes that the ALJ needed to reconsider her previous applications, she is incorrect; the doctrine of res judicata applies to them. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.957(c)(1); <em>Keith v. Barnhart, </em>473 F.3d 782, 784 n. 6 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
