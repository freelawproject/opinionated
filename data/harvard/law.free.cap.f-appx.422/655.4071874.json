We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, and de novo due process claims. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Xu\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because the motion was filed more than 90 days after the issuance of the BIA\u2019s final order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Xu failed to establish either changed circumstances in China, <em>see He v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1128, 1131-32 (9th Cir.2007) (change in personal circumstances does not establish changed circumstances in the country of origin-excusing untimely motion to reopen), or that he acted with the due diligence required to warrant equitable tolling of the time limitation, <em>see Itumbarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (equitable tolling is available to a petitioner who is prevented from filing due to deception, fraud, or error, and exercises due diligence in discovering such circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In light of our disposition, we do not reach Xu\u2019s contention that his former attorney\u2019s performance caused him prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b679-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
