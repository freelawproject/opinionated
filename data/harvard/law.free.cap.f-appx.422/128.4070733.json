For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">Robinson was admitted to the United States in 1982 as a lawful permanent resident. In 1992, he was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, of statutory rape, corruption of minors, and two counts of retail theft. In February 2009, Robinson was convicted by the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas for theft from a motor vehicle. The Department of Homeland Security subsequently issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) and sought to remove Robinson under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) \u2014 which makes an alien removable if he is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission\u2014 and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) \u2014 which makes an alien removable if he is convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">At a hearing before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), Robinson, represented by counsel, admitted the factual allegations in the NTA, but denied that he was removable. The IJ found Robinson removable due to an aggravated felony conviction, concluding that his statutory rape conviction \u201cwould qualify either as a rape conviction or probably more likely as a sexual abuse of a minor conviction[.]\u201d The IJ also determined that Robinson\u2019s theft convictions were separate crimes involving moral turpitude, also making Robinson removable. Robinson sought relief from removal in the form of a waiver of inadmissibility under former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed), combined with cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. The IJ held that Robinson could not obtain both a \u00a7 212(c) waiver and cancellation of removal, and therefore was ineligible for relief from removal. Accordingly, Robinson was ordered removed to Jamaica.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">On appeal to the BIA, Robinson argued that the IJ erred in concluding that his statutory rape conviction constituted the aggravated felony of rape. In the BIA\u2019s decision, rather than address the issue of whether the statutory rape conviction qualified as rape, it concluded that the statutory rape conviction constituted sexual abuse of a minor under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Accordingly, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision that Robinson was removable for committing an aggravated felony. Robinson filed a timely petition for review, and now argues that his conviction for statutory rape does not constitute sexual abuse of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-16\">We have jurisdiction over Robinson\u2019s petition for review pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). <em>See Stubbs v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>U.S., </em>452 F.3d 251, 253 n. 4 (3d Cir.2006). Although we do not have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal based on a finding that the alien committed an aggravated felony, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1252(a)(2)(C), \u201cwe have always had jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction by engaging in an analysis of whether an alien was convicted of a non-reviewable aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Stubbs, </em>452 F.3d at 253 n. 4. We also have jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law, even when they are raised by an alien found removable for an aggravated felony conviction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Papageorgiou v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 356, 358 (3d Cir.2005). We review de novo the legal question of whether Robinson\u2019s offense is an aggravated felony. <em>Stubbs, </em>452 F.3d at 253 n. 4. The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes \u201cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor[.]\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Robinson argues that his conviction for statutory rape under 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 3122 (repealed 1995) does not qualify as sexual abuse of a minor under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). We employ a \u201ccategorical approach\u201d to determine whether a conviction constitutes sexual abuse of a minor, an approach that \u201crequires a two step analysis: first, we must ascertain the definition for sexual abuse of a minor, and second, we must compare this \u2018federal\u2019 definition to the state statutory offense in question[.]\u201d <em>Restrepo v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the U.S., </em>617 F.3d 787, 791 (3d Cir.2010). Here, neither the federal enumerating statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), nor the state statute, 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 3122 (repealed 1995), \u201cinvite[s] further inquiry into the facts.\u201d <em>Stubbs, </em>452 F.3d at 254; <em>see Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 144, 161-63 (3d Cir. 2004). Accordingly, under the categorical approach, we need not consider the facts underlying Robinson\u2019s conviction. <em>See Singh, </em>383 F.3d at 147-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In <em>Restrepo v. Attorney General of the United States, </em>617 F.3d at 796, we held that the phrase \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d must be defined broadly through reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509, which provides in part that \u201cthe term \u2018sexual abuse\u2019 includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child to engage in ... sexually explicit conduct[.]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(a)(8). The statute under which Robinson was convicted defined statutory rape as follows: \u201cA person who is 18 years of age or older commits statutory rape, a felony of the second degree, when he engages in sexual intercourse with another person not his spouse who is less than 14 years of age.\u201d 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 3122 (repealed 1995); <em>Maranca v. Pa. Bd. of Prob. &amp; Parole, </em>830 A.2d 644, 647 (Pa.Commw.Ct.2003) (quoting former \u00a7 3122). There is no dispute that the Pennsylvania statute punishes a crime committed against a \u201cchild,\u201d because \u00a7 3509 defines a child as a person under the age of eighteen. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(a)(2). There is also no question that the Pennsylvania statute encompasses \u201csexually explicit conduct,\u201d which is defined by \u00a7 3509 to include \u201csexual intercourse.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(a)(9)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Robinson argues, however, that the words \u201cemployment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion\u201d in \u00a7 3509 all imply manipulation to secure a child\u2019s consent to engage in sexual activities. Under this reading, \u00a7 3509 only covers crimes where the defendant somehow manipulated the child. Robinson further argues that statutory rape as defined in Pennsylvania does not require such manipulation. Instead, it covers consensual acts of sex that involve no trace of manipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>We have not yet decided whether statutory rape under Pennsylvania law categorically constitutes sexual abuse of a minor in light of \u00a7 3509\u2019s definition. The weight of authority from other circuits, however, dictates that statutory rape does qualify as sexual abuse of a minor. In a case involving New York\u2019s statutory rape law, which is similar to Pennsylvania\u2019s,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Second Circuit held that the conduct prohibited by the state statute involved \u201cthe employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a person under 18 to engage in sexual intercourse.\u201d <em>Mugalli v. Ashcroft, </em>258 F.3d 52, 61 (2d Cir.2001). Other circuits have also found similar or arguably less egregious behavior to constitute sexual abuse of a minor. <em>See Gaiskov v. Holder, </em>567 F.3d 832, 836-37 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that the crime of touching a minor with sexual intent constitutes sexual abuse of a minor); <em>Gattem v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 758, 765-67 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that conviction for sexual solicitation, which did not require the defendant to physically touch the victim, qualified as a conviction for sexual abuse of a minor); <em>Bahar v. Ashcroft, </em>264 F.3d 1309, 1310-13 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (holding that \u201ctaking indecent liberties\u201d with a child under sixteen for sexual gratification constitutes sexual abuse of a minor, even without physical contact). <em>But see Estrada-Espinoza v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 1147, 1152-60 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (holding that statutory rape does not qualify as sexual abuse of a minor, but doing so under a definition of sexual abuse of a minor guided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">We find this case law from our sister circuits persuasive. As the Second Circuit noted in <em>Mugalli: </em>\u201cCentral to the concept of \u2018statutory rape\u2019 is the notion that a person less than a certain age is legally incapable of giving consent and thus that statutory rape involves a sexual act committed by one partner \u2018against\u2019 the other.\u201d <em>Mugalli, </em>258 F.3d at 59 n. 6. This concept is also emphasized by Pennsylvania case law construing \u00a7 3122. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em>497 Pa. 49, 438 A.2d 964, 966 (1981) (\u201cThe primary consideration in prohibiting unlawful, consensual intercourse with an underage female has been traditionally attributed to the legislative desire to protect those who are too unsophisticated to protect themselves.\u201d) (internal citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">As a result, even if, as Robinson argues, the words \u201cemployment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion\u201d all imply manipulation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it would not change the conclusion that statutory rape qualifies as sexual abuse of a minor. Because statutory rape necessarily involves a sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>act committed by the defendant against a child, it always involves some level of manipulation by the defendant. Accordingly, Robinson\u2019s arguments are unpersuasive, and we conclude that his conviction for statutory rape qualifies as the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Robinson also asserts that the BIA\u2019s analysis regarding why statutory rape constitutes sexual abuse of a minor was conclusory to the point of being inadequate for judicial review. As a general rule, \u201c[i]n order for us to be able to give meaningful review to [a BIA] decision, we must have some insight into its reasoning.\u201d <em>Awolesi v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 227, 232 (3d Cir. 2003). That does not mean, however, that a BIA decision is insufficient \u201cmerely because its discussion of certain issues could have been more detailed.\u201d <em>Toussaint v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the U.S., </em>455 F.3d 409, 414 (3d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although the BIA\u2019s analysis in Robinson\u2019s case was brief, it made clear that, in the BIA\u2019s view, under the categorical approach the state law conviction for statutory rape constituted sexual abuse of a minor, and therefore an aggravated felony. Accordingly, the BIA decision was adequately developed for purposes of judicial review, and Robinson\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Based on the above, the BIA correctly determined that Robinson\u2019s conviction for statutory rape qualifies as sexual abuse of a minor and thus made Robinson a removable alien based on an aggravated felony conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In light of the above, we will deny Robinson\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-5\">. \" 'A person is guilty of rape in the third degree when: ... [b]eing twenty-one years old or more, he or she engages in sexual intercourse with another person to whom the actor is not married less than seventeen years old[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Mugalli v. Ashcroft, </em>258 F.3d 52, 60-61 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.25 as it read when Mugalli was convicted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-6\">. Robinson argues that the categorical approach precludes us from considering the theoretical basis for statutory rape because the analysis must be confined strictly to the statutory elements of the offense. Although the categorical approach is restrictive in the sense that we may \u201cnot consider other evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s prior crimes, including, the particular facts underlying [a] conviction[J\u201d <em>Singh, </em>383 F.3d at 147-48 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), it does not prohibit us from considering the theoretical underpinnings of a statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-12\">. We note that the terms \u201cemployment\u201d and \"use\u201d may not imply the sort of manipulation that Robinson refers to. Based on our above analysis, however, we need not definitively rule on the meaning of \"use\u201d or \"employment\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 3509.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\">. We note that Robinson does not challenge the denial of his requests for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver and cancellation of removal. Before the BIA, Robinson argued that the IJ erred in denying a \u00a7 212(c) waiver by relying on an online docket sheet to establish Robinson\u2019s 2009 conviction for theft from a motor vehicle. The BIA held that the IJ did not err, because at his removal hearing Robinson, through counsel, admitted his 2009 conviction. Regardless of his argument before the BIA, Robinson failed to raise any challenge to the denial of his requests for relief in his petition for review before this Court. Accordingly, the issue is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
