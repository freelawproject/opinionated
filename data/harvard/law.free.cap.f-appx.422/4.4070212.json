MINER, JOHN M. WALKER, JR., RICHARD C. WESLEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b29-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Defendant-Appellant Luis Pesta\u00f1a appeals from a July 17, 2009 judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Keenan, <em>J.) </em>revoking his supervised release and sentencing him to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment for violation of the conditions of his supervised release. In the same proceeding, the district court also sentenced Pesta\u00f1a to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, following a guilty plea, for conspiring to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Pesta\u00f1a is foreclosed by an appellate waiver from disputing this latter sentence, but he contends on appeal that his sentence for violating the conditions of his supervised release \u2014 which the district court ordered to run consecutively with his other sentence \u2014 is substantively unreasonable. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Pesta\u00f1a concedes that his sentence is not procedurally unreasonable, but suggests that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the court considered the fact that he was on supervised release when both (1) calculating his criminal history and (2) sentencing Pesta\u00f1a for violations of the terms of his supervised release. Pestana\u2019s dispute is unpersuasive because the Sentencing Guidelines specifically contemplate that such \u201cdouble counting\u201d will occur. According to a Policy Statement set forth by the Sentencing Commission in the Sentencing Guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">Any term of imprisonment imposed upon the revocation of probation or supervised release shall be ordered to be served consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is serving, whether or not the sentence of imprisonment being served resulted from the conduct that is the basis of the revocation of probation or supervised release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (policy statement). A consecutive sentence is appropriate because a sentence for violation of supervised release is \u201cnot intended to be a sanction for [the defendant\u2019s] conduct, but rather for the \u2018breach of trust\u2019 committed against the District Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Sweeney, </em>90 F.3d 55, 57 (2d Cir.1996), <em>abrogated on other grounds as recognized in United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 99 n. 5 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, Pestana\u2019s sentence is not rendered substantively unreasonable based on what Pesta\u00f1a characterizes as the district court\u2019s \u201cdouble counting\u201d of his violation of the terms of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">Furthermore, the court sentenced Pesta\u00f1a only to 12 months when the applicable range was 24 to 30 months. Particularly in light of this below-range sentence, Pesta\u00f1a has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">We have considered Pestana\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
