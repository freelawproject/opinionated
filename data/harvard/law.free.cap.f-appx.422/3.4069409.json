We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural histoiy, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \u201cconstruing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 <em>F.3d 147, 152 (2d </em>Cir.2002). We review the denial of a motion for leave to amend the complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>McCarthy v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., </em>482 F.3d 184, 200 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">For substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned memorandum and order, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Bishop\u2019s complaint and denied his motion to amend as futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">We have considered all of Bishop\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
