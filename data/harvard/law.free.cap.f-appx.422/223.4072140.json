The district court sentenced Robinson to a total of 162 months of imprisonment, and Robinson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because Robinson was assigned to criminal history category III. Counsel concedes, however, that this issue appears to be precluded by Robinson\u2019s plea waiver and states that he is \u201cunable to identify any meritorious issues for review not covered by [the] appeal waiver contained in [Robinson\u2019s] plea memorandum.\u201d Despite being informed of his right to do so, Robinson has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">The Government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal of Robinson\u2019s sentence based on the appellate waiver in the plea agreement, which Robinson, through counsel, opposes as premature. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal of Robinson\u2019s sentence and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, a defendant may waive his appellate rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2006). <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). This court reviews the validity of an appellate waiver de novo, and will enforce the waiver if it is valid and the issue appealed is within the scope of the waiver. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">An appeal waiver is valid if the defendant knowingly and intelligently agreed to the waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 169. To determine whether a waiver is knowing and intelligent, this court examines \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the experience and conduct of the accused, as well as the accused\u2019s educational background and familiarity with the terms of the plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 400 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Genex-ally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that Robinson knowingly and intelligently entered into the plea agreement and waived his right to appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of Robinson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>sentence. Although Robinson\u2019s plea waiver does not preclude a direct appeal of his conviction, we have examined the entire record in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Robinson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">This court requires that counsel inform Robinson, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Robinson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Robinson. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
