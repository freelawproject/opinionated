California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Rojo has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The alternative motion for a hearing is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">The record reveals a clerical error in the judgment. Although the record shows that the district court orally imposed and intended to impose a total fine of $2,000, the written judgment also states that a $2,000 fine was \u201cimposed as to each of Counts 1, 3, and 4\u201d to reach the total fine of $2,000. The case is therefore REMANDED for the correction of this clerical error. Fed. R.Crim. P. 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
