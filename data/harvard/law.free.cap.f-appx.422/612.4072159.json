Corrigan appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his action alleging that defendants abused Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 in two prior actions. We review de novo. <em>Shanks v. Dressel, </em>540 F.3d 1082,1086 (9th Cir.2008). We may affirm on any basis supported by the record, <em>Thompson v. Paul, </em>547 F.3d 1055, 1058-59 (9th Cir.2008), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-23\">The district court properly dismissed Corrigan\u2019s claim concerning defendants\u2019 failure to satisfy Rule 11\u2019s safe harbor provision in his 2003 action. <em>See Holgate v. Baldwin, </em>425 F.3d 671, 680 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201cThe appropriate remedy for ... failure to satisfy safe harbor is a denial of [the] request for Rule 11 sanctions....\u201d). Further, Corrigan\u2019s claims alleging Rule 11 abuses were barred under the doctrine of res judicata because he could have raised them in prior actions. <em>See Stewart v. U.S. Bancorp, </em>297 F.3d 953, 956 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cRes judicata, or claim preclusion, prohibits lawsuits on any claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>were raised <em>or could have been raised </em>in a prior action.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in entering a pre-filing order against Corrigan because he was provided with notice and an opportunity to respond, and the district court created an adequate record of Corrigan\u2019s prior actions, found the actions to be frivolous and harassing, and narrowly tailored its order to address Corrigan\u2019s particular abuses. <em>See Molski v. Evergreen Dynasty Corp., </em>500 F.3d 1047, 1056-61 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (setting forth standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting defendants Hille\u2019s and Scudder\u2019s motion for Rule 11 sanctions because Corrigan\u2019s filing of successive complaints based on previously-rejected propositions of law constituted harassment. <em>See Buster v. Greisen, </em>104 F.3d 1186, 1189-90 (9th Cir.1997) (setting forth standard of review and upholding Rule 11 sanctions); <em>United Energy Owners Comm., Inc. v. U.S. Energy Mgmt. Sys., Inc., </em>837 F.2d 356, 358 (9th Cir.1988) (district court retained jurisdiction to impose sanctions while plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from judgment of dismissal was pending).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">We do not consider matters not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Corrigan\u2019s remaining contentions, including those of judicial bias, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
