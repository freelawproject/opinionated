GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Christopher Francis pleaded guilty to child neglect in 2005 and is currently serving his sentence in an Oklahoma state penitentiary. In 2010, Mr. Francis filed a petition for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court dismissed Mr. Francis\u2019s petition after determining it was untimely, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), and that none of the potential grounds for statutory or equitable tolling of the limitations period could save the petition. Seeking to appeal that dismissal, Mr. Francis asked the district court for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), which the court denied. Now before this court, Mr. Francis renews his request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">We may issue a COA only if the petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). And where, as here, the district court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition on procedural grounds, we may issue a COA only if \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d Slack <em>v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We conclude, however, that no reasonable jurist would debate the district court\u2019s holding that Mr. Francis\u2019s petition is time-barred, and for substantially the same reasons given by the district court. Accordingly, we deny Mr. Francis\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss this appeal. We also deny his motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and his \u201cMotion to Consider Designation of Record.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-9\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
