Almonte, through a <em>pro se </em>supplemental letter brief, contends for the first time on appeal that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s parsimony clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In applying that standard, we must \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, giving due deference to the sentencing judge\u2019s exercise of discretion, and bearing in mind the institutional advantages of district courts.\u201d <em>United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 190 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc). We will not \u201csubstitute our own judgment for the district court\u2019s on the question of what is sufficient to meet the \u00a7 3553(a) considerations in any particular case,\u201d and will \u201cset aside a district court\u2019s <em>substantive </em>determination only in exceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision \u2018cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189 (quoting <em>United States v. Rigas, </em>490 F.3d 208, 238 (2d Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">Here, the district court noted that Almonte is a violent offender who has been convicted of six crimes since 2002; weighed the relevant mitigating factors, particularly the sentence\u2019s effect on Almonte\u2019s children; and imposed a within-Guidelines sentence designed to achieve deterrence in light of Almonte\u2019s present conviction for illegally reentering the United States. This does not present one of the \u201cexceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 189 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s decision, let alone plain error!</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">We have reviewed Almonte\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-9\">. We construe Almonte\u2019s letter challenging the sentence\u2019s \"fairness\u201d as a substantive reasonableness challenge. \"It is well established that the submissions of a <em>pm se </em>litigant must be construed liberally and interpreted to raise the strongest arguments that they <em>suggest.\u201d Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-15\">In addition to Almonte\u2019s letter, we have also considered a supplemental letter filed at the Court\u2019s request by Almonte\u2019s counsel on April 26, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
