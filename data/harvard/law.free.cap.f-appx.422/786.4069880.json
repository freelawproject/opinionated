Peeples argues that his prior convictions for burglary of unoccupied dwellings do not qualify as violent crimes under ACCA because the offenses created no risk or possibility of violence. This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>whether a conviction constitutes a violent felony under ACCA. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>466 F.3d 1271, 1273 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-17\">ACCA defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-18\">any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-19\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-20\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-21\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-22\">In <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that an offense constitutes \u201cburglary\u201d under ACCA when \u201ceither its statutory definition substantially corresponds to \u2018generic\u2019 burglary, or the charging paper and jury instructions actually required the jury to find all the elements of generic burglary in order to convict the defendant.\u201d 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2160, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). The Court defined \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d as \u201chaving the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598-99, 110 S.Ct. at 2158. Most pertinent for our purposes, the <em>Taylor </em>Court noted that Congress never proposed to limit the predicate offense to \u201csome special subclass of burglaries that might be especially dangerous, such as those where ... the building is occupied,\u201d and that Congress\u2019s \u201cchoice of language indicate[d] that Congress thought ordinary burglaries ... presented a sufficiently \u2018serious potential risk\u2019 to count toward en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>hancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588, 597, 110 S.Ct. at 2153, 2158.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">\u201cThe main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another\u2019s property, but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party \u2014 whether an occupant, a police officer, or a bystander \u2014 who comes to investigate.\u201d <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 203, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1594, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (holding that attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA); <em>see also United States v. Matthews, </em>466 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.2006) (determining that burglary of the curtilage of a structure \u201cis indeed a crime that \u2018presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Peeples\u2019s argument that his burglary convictions presented no risk of physical injury to others because they involved unoccupied dwellings fails under <em>Taylor </em>and our precedent. Because his crimes presented a very real risk of physical injury to innocent third parties, the district court properly categorized Peeples\u2019s prior convictions as violent crimes under ACCA. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
