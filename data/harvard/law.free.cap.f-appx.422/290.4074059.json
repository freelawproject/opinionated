During the pendency of Jones\u2019 sentencing hearing, he and the Government reached an as to sentencing. The district court imposed the agreed upon 210-month at the conclusion of Jones\u2019 hearing. Jones then filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"pAS7\">Jones\u2019 attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning the reasonableness of his sentence Because we find no meritorious grounds for appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"pANQ\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness under an standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir. 2007). This review requires appellate of both the procedural and reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In determining procedural reasonableness, this court considers whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, any arguments presented by the and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>Finally, this court reviews the substantive reasonableness of the \u201cexamin[ing] the totality of the to see whether the sentencing court abused its discretion in concluding that the sentence it chose satisfied the standards set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 216 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"pAWg\">Here, the district court followed the procedural steps in sentencing Jones, properly calculating the Guidelines sentence, considering the \u00a7 3553(a) and sentencing Jones to a negotiated sentence of 210 months-some 150 months below the bottom of his advisory Guidelines range. Hence, we determine that the sentence imposed by the district court was both proeedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"pAT5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that inform Jones in writing of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Jones that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"pArqa\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"pAxf\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
