De la Pena was arrested driving away from a hotel in a nearby town in a vehicle registered in Colorado to one of the men arrested during or following the raid. On appeal, de la Pena argues there was insufficient evidence to convict him of knowing participation in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-23\">At trial, James Page, one of ten men arrested at the farm who began cooperating when arrested, testified that he had arranged the farm drop site at the request of his off-and-on marijuana supplier in New Mexico, Luis Virgin-Nunez. When Nunez advised that a large shipment was ready for delivery, Page met Nunez and others at the farm to check it out. Nunez approved the farm but said he needed \u201cNo. l\u2019s right-hand man\u201d to look at the site and approve it. Nunez had previously described \u201cNo. 1\u201d as the \u201cbiggest drug lord in Mexico.\u201d Nunez then introduced Page to this \u201cright-hand man,\u201d de la Pena, who approved the delivery site and said he needed to place a call to \u201cNo. 1\u201d to \u201clet him know that it was okay.\u201d Early the next morning, a large milk tanker pulled by a semi truck delivered the marijuana to the farm, where it was seized a short time later. The government also introduced cell phone records tending to show that de la Pena had been in contact with the men <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>at the farm, and a plea agreement signed by de la Pena some months earlier in which he admitted knowing participation in an agreement or understanding to distribute marijuana on the date it was seized at the farm. De la Pena testified in his own defense. He denied participating in the marijuana delivery, provided an exculpatory explanation as to how he came to stay at the hotel with two men and borrow one\u2019s car for a trip home to Kansas, and said he was coerced into signing the false plea agreement stipulation by the fear of a long prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">We have \u201crepeatedly upheld jury verdicts based solely on the testimony of co-conspirators and cooperating witnesses, noting that <em>it is </em>within the province of the jury to make credibility assessments and resolve conflicting testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Ragland, </em>555 F.3d 706, 715 (8th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). Here, if believed by the jury, Page\u2019s testimony, corroborated by de la Pena\u2019s earlier confession and circumstantially corroborated by other evidence, was more than sufficient to convict de la Pena of knowing participation in the conspiracy. It was for the jury to assess the credibility of de la Pena\u2019s conflicting testimony that, if believed, would tend to establish his mere acquaintance with some members of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
