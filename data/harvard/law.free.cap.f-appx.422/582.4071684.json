We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-17\">The record does not compel the conclusion that petitioner\u2019s late-filed asylum application is excused by any changed or extraordinary circumstances. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208(a)(4)(5); <em>Dhital v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to their asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-18\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because of inconsistencies regarding Reyes\u2019 age when his mother was attacked, the date of the attack, and the date of his mother\u2019s resignation letter. The inconsistencies go to the heart of petitioners\u2019 claims. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001) (sustaining adverse credibility determination where claims \u201cwere implausible in light of the background evidence\u201d); <em>Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000) (sustaining adverse credibility determination where inconsistencies between testimony and doeu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>mentary evidence concerned dates of the alleged incident of persecution). The IJ reasonably rejected Reyes\u2019 explanations for the inconsistencies. <em>See Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2007). In the absence of credible testimony, petitioners\u2019 withholding of removal claim fails. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Because petitioners\u2019 CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and they point to no other evidence the agency should have considered, substantial evidence also supports the denial of CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b607-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
