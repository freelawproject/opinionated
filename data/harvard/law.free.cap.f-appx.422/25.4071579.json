Petitioner pleaded guilty to racketeering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) and was sentenced, principally, to 68 months in prison. Under the plea agreement, petitioner agreed \u201cnot to file an appeal or otherwise challenge by petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 or any other provision the conviction or sentence in the event that the Court impose[d] a term of imprisonment of 78 months or below.\u201d A little over one year later, petitioner sought to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, claiming that his representation had been constitutionally ineffective in not filing a direct appeal in violation of his request to do so. Our Court granted a Certificate of Appealability regarding, among other things, the question of whether the District Court \u201cshould have conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine if petitioner instructed his attorney to file a notice of appeal.\u201d We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case and the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-22\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a hearing under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 for abuse of discretion, and any factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>See Chang v. United States, </em>250 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>2001); <em>cf. Sims v. Blot, </em>534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cA district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or rendered a decision that cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d (alteration, citations, and quotation marks omitted)). <em>\u201cA </em>finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); <em>accord Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574-75, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (\u201cIf the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently. Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">For substantially the same reasons stated by the District Court in its careful Memorandum and Order, <em>Ostap Kapelioujnyi v. United States of America, </em>08-CV-2414 (JS), 2009 WL 7868860 (E.D.N.Y. July 29, 2009), we hold that the District Court did not clearly err, much less abuse its discretion, in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing before dismissing the habeas petition. Specifically, contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention that his attorney failed to consult with him regarding appeal, petitioner\u2019s own affidavit states that, after petitioner \u201cexpressed interest\u201d in appealing, his counsel explained that petitioner had waived his appeal rights and that the sentence was within the plea agreement\u2019s stipulated Guidelines range. Petitioner does not aver that he expressed any further interest in appealing after hearing this advice. Under these circumstances, we identify no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s denial of a hearing because the record demonstrates that counsel consulted sufficiently with petitioner regarding appeal. <em>See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 478, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000) (stating that \u201cconsult\u201d requires advising client regarding \u201cadvantages and disadvantages\u201d of appeal and \u201cmaking a reasonable effort to discover\u201d client\u2019s wishes). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment disposing of all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
