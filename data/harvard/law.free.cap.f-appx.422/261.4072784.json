We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Davis argues that the district court committed procedural sentencing error by failing to consider an amendment to the Guidelines, pending at the time of Davis\u2019s sentencing, that would eliminate the recency enhancement of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4Al.l(e) (2009). Davis contends that despite the absence of an objection below, \u201cproper consideration of the [Guidelines by the district court would have given deference to the [Sentencing] Commission\u2019s considered view that recency points did not serve the purpose of sentencing under [18] U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a) (2006).\u201d The Government asserts that Davis\u2019s explicit waiver of this argument at the sentencing hearing waived his right to appeal this issue. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u201cWhereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)). When a defendant fails to raise an argument before the district court, it is forfeited and we review the issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Massenburg, </em>564 F.3d 337, 342 (4th Cir.2009). In contrast, waiver extinguishes potential error under Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b). <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770. When a claim of error has been waived, \u201cit is not reviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Claridy, </em>601 F.3d 276, 284 n. 2 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-33, 113 S.Ct. 1770).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We conclude that Davis did not merely fail to raise before the district court the argument he now advances; Davis raised the argument and waived it. Counsel indicated that Davis had asked him to waive two objections to the Presentence Report, including application of USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(e). Davis confirmed his intention to waive these arguments. Moreover, he maintained this position throughout the hearing. Therefore, the issue is not reviewable by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
