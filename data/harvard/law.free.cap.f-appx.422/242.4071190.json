On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">First, Roe challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction. Specifically, Roe contends that no witness ever saw him in possession of the firearm. He also asserts that his DNA, which was found on the gun, could have been placed on the gun by an incidental secondary transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.2006). A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavy burden. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). A jury verdict must be sustained \u201cif, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the verdict is supported by \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>451 F.3d at 216. Substantial evidence is \u201cevidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe jury, not the reviewing court, weighs the credibility of the evidence and resolves any conflicts in the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Beidler, </em>110 F.3d at 1067 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cReversal for insufficient evidence is reserved for the rare case where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2006), the Government must prove that: (1) Roe was a convicted felon; (2) he knowingly possessed a firearm; and (3) the firearm traveled in interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 136 (4th Cir.2001). Roe stipulated that he had previously been convicted of a felony and that the firearm traveled in interstate commerce. Thus, the Government had only to prove Roe\u2019s knowing possession. To prove possession under \u00a7 922(g)(1), the Government need not show \u201cactual or exclusive possession; constructive or joint possession is sufficient. The Government may prove constructive possession by demonstrating that the defendant exercised, or had the power to exercise, dominion and control\u201d over the firearm. <em>Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d at 136-37 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we find that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Roe constructively possessed the firearm. Deltasha Taylor, Roe\u2019s girlfriend, testified that the guns were Roe\u2019s and that he acknowledged his possession by agreeing to remove them from her home and by requesting permission to store them in the basement. Roe also told Taylor, after the seizure of the guns from a vehicle in which he was a passenger, that the police took them, supporting an inference that the guns in the car and the house were one and the same. Moreover, the firearm with which Roe was charged was found in the glove compartment of the car in which he was seated in the front passenger seat. Even more incriminating, the firearm had Roe\u2019s DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>on it. The evidence presented by the Government was more than sufficient for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Roe had dominion and control over the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Roe claims that the district court misunderstood its authority to grant a variance and incorrectly believed that it was constrained from granting a variance on the grounds of lack of youthful guidance. However, the record, read in its entirety, reveals that the district court understood its authority to impose a variance sentence, but declined to do so. The court heard from both Roe and the Government on this issue, noted the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines, made certain comments regarding its opinions on the Guidelines\u2019 departure rules, and explicitly recognized that departures and variances are treated differently. The district court concluded that the arguments proffered by Roe at sentencing were not sufficient to diverge from the Guidelines range. We find that the district court\u2019s decision was proper. <em>See United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006) (variance must be supported by the facts of the particular case).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Roe next claims that the district court\u2019s explanation for the chosen sentence was insufficient. In evaluating the sentencing court\u2019s explanation of a selected sentence, we have consistently held that, while a district court must consider the statutory factors and explain its sentence, it need not explicitly reference 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006), or discuss every factor on the record, particularly when the court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). But, at the same time, the district court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Moreover, the district court must state the individualized reasons that justify a sentence, even when sentencing a defendant within the Guidelines range. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-57, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The reasons articulated by the district court for a given sentence need not be \u201ccouched in the precise language of \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d so long as the \u201creasons can be matched to a factor appropriate for consideration ... and [are] clearly tied [to the defendant\u2019s] particular situation.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 658 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Here, the district court stated that it would not vary the sentence on the grounds proffered by Roe, concluded that a Guidelines sentence was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary,\u201d and delineated the \u00a7 3553 factors that applied to Roe\u2019s case. While the court did not give explicit reasons as to why it was declining to vary Roe\u2019s sentence or how specifically the \u00a7 3553 factors applied in Roe\u2019s case, the court\u2019s reasoning, along with the court\u2019s earlier statements regarding Roe\u2019s criminal history and the relatively small variance Roe was seeking, was sufficient. Importantly, the court explicitly concluded that a Guidelines sentence satisfied the statutory sentencing factors. We conclude that there was no error in the district court\u2019s explanation of Roe\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Finally, Roe asserts that the district court plainly erred in calculating his criminal history category by giving him a point for a crime he committed as a minor when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the sentence for that crime was imposed more than five years before the commencement of the instant offense. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(B) (2009). The Government does not dispute that an error was committed but contends that the removal of one criminal history point would not have altered Roe\u2019s criminal history score. In response, Roe agrees that his score would not have been altered but argues that the removal of the one point, together with the application of Amendment 742 to an unrelated Guidelines section,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> would have placed Roe in a lower Criminal History Category.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">However, in his reply brief, Roe admits that he is raising \u201cthis issue now so that he can raise it before the district court when this case goes back for resentencing.\u201d Presumably admitting that he would not otherwise be entitled to relief under this provision,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Roe states that the \u201cCourt need not rule on this issue now, but Mr. Roe requests that when the Court remands this case, it instruct the district court to consider the issue.\u201d Given the fact that none of his other claims entitle him to relief, Roe has waived consideration of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm Roe\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\">. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.1 (amended on November 2010 to remove \"recency\" point for commission of the instant offense less than two years after release from imprisonment).
