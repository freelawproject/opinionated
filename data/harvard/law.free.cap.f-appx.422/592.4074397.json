R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b617-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Luis Soto-Guevara appeals from the 17-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for being a deported alien found unlawfully in the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Soto-Guevara contends that the staleness of his prior conviction and minimal criminal history renders his sentence substantively unreasonable. In light of the totality of the circumstances and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, Soto-Guevara\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991-93 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Soto-Guevara also contends that his sentence is unreasonable because his prior conviction for sale a controlled substance, in violation of California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a), would not have triggered the 12-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) for a prior felony drug trafficking conviction before the November 1, 2008 amendments. The district court did not plainly err in applying the enhancement where Soto-Guevara committed the current illegal re-entry offense following the November 1, 2008 amendment\u2019s addition of \u201coffer to sell\u201d to the 12-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-18\">Finally, Soto-Guevara contends that his sentence is unreasonable because his prior sale of a controlled substance conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony. The district court did not plainly err because Soto-Guevara concedes his prior conviction qualified as a drug trafficking offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), and thus, the 12-level enhancement was appropriate even though Soto-Guevara\u2019s prior offense was not a statutory \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b617-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
