(\u201cSTOA\u201d). In her amended complaint Jones alleged that STOA violated the ADA by firing her based on a disability or perceived disability stemming from a highly contagious staph infection that kept her out of work for 10 days. On appeal, Jones argues that the district court erred in granting STOA\u2019s motion to dismiss because she sufficiently alleged that STOA fired her because it perceived her contagious illness as substantially limiting and preventing her from working. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>accepting the allegations in the complaint and amended complaint as true and construing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>See Mills v. Foremost Ins. Co., </em>511 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2008). To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint need not contain \u201cdetailed factual allegations,\u201d but it must contain sufficient factual allegations to suggest the required elements of a cause of action. <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); Watts <em>v. Fla. Int\u2019l Univ., </em>495 F.3d 1289, 1295-96 (11th Cir.2007). \u201c[A] formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Nor will mere labels and legal conclusions withstand a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>Under the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Twombly, </em>the complaint must contain \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570,127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The ADA, which was originally enacted in 1990, prohibits employers from discriminating against persons with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101; <em>American Ass\u2019n of People with Disabilities v. Harris, </em>605 F.3d 1124, 1134 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cUnder the controlling law in this Circuit, the burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination claims is applicable to ADA claims.\u201d <em>See Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., </em>492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2007). In the first step of the burden-shifting analysis, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case. \u201cTo establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (l)[s]he is disabled; (2)[s]he is a qualified individual; and (3)[s]he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of [her] disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255-56. The ADA and the regulations define \u201cdisability\u201d as: (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of the individual; (2) a record of such impairment; or (3) being regarded as having an impairment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(1) and (2); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(j)(l); <em>Carruthers v. BSA Adver., Inc., </em>357 F.3d 1213, 1215 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) regulations construing the ADA previously explained that an individual \u201cregarded as\u201d having an impairment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-9\">(1) [h]as a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by a covered entity as constituting such limitation; (2) [h]as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment; or (3) [h]as none of the impairments defined in paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section but is treated by a covered entity as having a substantially limiting impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-10\"><em>D\u2019Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, </em>422 F.3d 1220, 1228 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 29 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>\u00a7 1630.2(Z)). Thus, an employer ran afoul of the ADA when it made \u201can employment decision based on a physical or mental impairment, real or imagined, that is regarded as substantially limiting a major life activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">For a plaintiff to prevail under the \u201cregarded as\u201d theory of disability, she has to establish two points: (1) that the perceived disability involves a major life activity, and (2) that the perceived disability is \u201csubstantially limiting\u201d and significant. <em>Sutton v. Lader, </em>185 F.3d 1203, 1208 (11th Cir. 1999). The ADA did not define the phrase \u201cmajor life activity,\u201d but the Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe word \u2018major\u2019 denotes comparative importance and suggests that the touchstone for determining an activity\u2019s inclusion under the statutory rubric is its significance.\u201d <em>Bragdon v. Abbott, </em>524 U.S. 624, 638, 118 S.Ct. 2196, 141 L.Ed.2d 540 (1998) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). In determining whether a physical impairment substantially limited a major life activity, the regulations instructed this Court to consider \u201c(1) the nature and severity of the impairment; (2) the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (3) the permanent or long term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment.\u201d <em>Sutton, </em>185 F.3d at 1208-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Accordingly, major life activities included \u201cfunctions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning and working.\u201d <em>Rossbach v. City of Miami, </em>371 F.3d 1354, 1357-58 &amp; n. 4 (11th Cir. 2004) (relying on regulations interpreting the Rehabilitation Act because the ADA\u2019s definition of a disability is drawn almost verbatim from the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s definition of a \u201chandicapped individual\u201d). Moreover, the inability to perform a single, particular job did not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working. <em>Id. </em>at 1359. Consequently, an impairment must have precluded \u2014 or at least be perceived to have precluded\u2014 \u201can individual from more than one type of job, even if the job foreclosed is the individual\u2019s job of choice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">Here, the district court did not err when it found that Jones\u2019s complaint did not allege enough facts to present a plausible case that she was disabled or had a perceived disability within the meaning of the ADA. In particular, Jones did not allege how, aside from missing work for several days, any major life activity was impaired or perceived to be impaired by her staph infection, or that she suffered or was regarded as suffering from any long-term impacts. <em>See id. </em>at 1357-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">Likewise, it is not clear from the face of the complaint that STOA believed that one of Jones\u2019s major life activities was impaired, or that she had or was expected to have a long-term impairment resulting from her staph infection. <em>See Sutton, </em>185 F.3d at 1208-09. Instead, the allegation that STOA initially allowed her to work for the remainder of the month plausibly suggests that the company did not perceive her to have a \u201csubstantially limiting\u201d and significant disability. <em>See id. </em>at 1208. Nor does this plausibly show that STOA believed she was unable to perform a single, particular job, but even if it did, this would not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working. <em>Rossbach, </em>371 F.3d at 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\">. The ADA was amended in relevant part, with an effective date of January 1, 2009 (after the present cause of action accrued), but the parties do not argue, and there is no indication, that Congress intended these amendments to apply retroactively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
