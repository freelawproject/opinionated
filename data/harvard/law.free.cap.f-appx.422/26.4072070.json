Daidone was convicted of various racketeering and loansharking charges in 2004. We affirmed his conviction and sentence in 2006. <em>See United States v. Daidone, </em>471 F.3d 371 (2d Cir.2006). In his petition for habeas relief, Daidone alleged constitutionally ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel for consenting to (or, in the case of appellate counsel, failing to contest on appeal) the admission at trial of a letter (\u201cthe letter\u201d) detailing the history of cooperation by a government witness, and for failing to object to references made by the government during summation to a letter filed pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case, and the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See, e.g., Overton v. Newton, </em>295 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir.2002). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance, the defendant must establish: \u201c(1) that counsel\u2019s performance was so unreasonable under prevailing professional norms that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment ... and (2) that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness prejudiced the defendant such that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>United States v. Gaskin, </em>364 F.3d 438, 468 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). In applying the first prong of the test, we \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d and that \u201c[ejven the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To prevail, a defendant must also meet the test of the second prong of <em>Strickland </em>\u2014 that is, defendant must also show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">Substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Berman in his comprehensive and careful Decision and Order, <em>Louis Daidone v. United States of America, </em>08Civ.2545(RMB), 2009 WL 2611943 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2009), we hold that the District Court did not err in dismissing Diadone\u2019s petition for habeas review. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>note that, although the government agrees that certain provisions of the letter should have been redacted before being admitted, such a small portion of a letter in a trial in which overwhelming evidence was presented is not sufficient to warrant the extraordinary remedy of overturning the conviction in this case. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment disposing of all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
