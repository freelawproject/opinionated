For the reasons stated below, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">This court reviews a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Llamas, </em>599 F.3d 381, 387 (4th Cir.2010). Our review requires appellate consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In determining procedural reasonableness, we consider whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, analyzed any arguments presented by the parties, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">\u201cRegardless of whether the district court imposes an above, below, or within-Guidelines sentence, it must place on the record an individualized assessment based on the particular facts of the case before it.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). This explanation \u201cneed not be elaborate or lengthy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 330, and the district court\u2019s explanation will withstand appellate scrutiny as long this court has a basis from which to determine \u201cthat [the district court] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">At his sentencing hearing, Ledbetter asked the district court to impose his 120-month sentence to run concurrently to a pending state sentence. The district court then imposed the sentence to be served \u201cconsecutively to any sentence the defendant is presently serving\u201d without further comment. On appeal, Ledbetter only questions the sufficiency of the district court\u2019s explanation for imposing the sentence consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">Assuming, without deciding, that the district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence was inadequate, we conclude that any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 268, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (noting that appellate courts may apply the plain error and harmless error doctrines in determining whether resentencing is required); Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(a) (stating that an appellate court may disregard any error that does not affect substantial rights). A district court may impose a consecutive sentence when \u201cmultiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time\u201d or when the \u201cdefendant ... is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 (2006). Here, the district court imposed a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u201cconsecutive to any sentence [Ledbetter] is now serving.\u201d The record in this case, however, establishes Ledbetter was not then serving a sentence as of the date the district court imposed judgment; instead, he was only being held in state custody \u201cfor some pending charges.\u201d (J.A. 39). Because those charges had not yet been adjudicated, Ledbetter was not yet serving an undischarged term of imprisonment. Thus, the district court\u2019s pronouncement of a consecutive sentence was of no effect and did not infringe Ledbetter\u2019s rights. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
