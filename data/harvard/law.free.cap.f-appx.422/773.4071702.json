He amended his motion on February 24, 2009, to provide the bases for such relief: (1) he was not mentally competent to plead guilty; (2) his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request a psychiatric evaluation and a competency hearing; and (3) his sentence was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-15\">The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge, who issued a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) on August 11, 2009, recommending that the motion be denied. The R &amp; R stated that the record of the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 plea hearing established that Petrola was competent to proceed, that his lawyer was not ineffective in failing to request a competency hearing, and that his sentence was not excessive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>2009, the district court adopted the R <em>&amp; </em>R and entered an order denying Petrola \u00a7 2255 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">On May 10, 2010, 237 days after the court entered the September 16 order, Petrola, through retained counsel, moved the court to grant him leave to file an out-of-time application for a certificate of appeal-ability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and notice of appeal. His motion stated that he had not received notice of the entry of the September 16 order. The district court concluded that Petrola was not entitled to relief under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6) because he had not filed his motion within 180 days after the September 16 order, as required by the rule. Referring to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Vencor Hospitals, Inc. v. Standard Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>279 F.3d 1306 (11th Cir.2002), the district court noted that \u201cRule 4(a)(6) provides the exclusive method for extending a party\u2019s time to appeal for failure to receive actual notice that a judgment or order has been entered,\u201d and that Petrola was not entitled to the requested extension. Petrola moved the district court to reconsider its ruling. The court denied his motion. He filed a second motion for reconsideration; it, too, was denied. Petrola now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his second motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">On appeal, Petrola argues that the district court erred in denying his second motion for reconsideration, to-wit: the court should have tolled the time period from the date of the decision denying his \u00a7 2255 motion, September 16, 2009, until the date that he discovered his petition had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen the time period to file a notice of appeal, pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6), for abuse of discretion. <em>See McDaniel v. Moore, </em>292 F.3d 1304, 1305 (11th Cir.2002) (reviewing the issue of whether the district court abused its discretion by denying the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petitioner\u2019s request to reopen the time period to file a notice of appeal). \u201c[We] review <em>de novo, </em>however, a district court\u2019s interpretation of [Rule 4(a)(6) ].\u201d <em>Vencor Hosps., Inc., </em>279 F.3d at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">A party must file a notice of appeal within 30 days after the judgment or order being appealed is entered, or within 60 days if the government is a party. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), (B); <em>Vencor, </em>279 F.3d at 1309.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ordinarily, a habeas petitioner\u2019s failure to timely file a notice of appeal is \u201cfatal\u201d to his appeal, \u201cbecause the timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Hollins v. Dep\u2019t of Corn., </em>191 F.3d 1324, 1326 (11th Cir.1999). Although Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d) requires the clerk of court to provide the parties with notice of judgments and orders, \u201clack of notice of the entry by the clerk does not affect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed, except as provided by [Rule 4(a) ].\u201d <em>Vencor, </em>279 F.3d at 1309 (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">Rule 4(a) includes two provisions that address a district court\u2019s authority to extend the time to file a notice of appeal\u2014 subsection (5) (Motion for Extension of Time), and subsection (6) (Reopening the Time to File an Appeal). <em>See generally </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a). A party relying on Rule 4(a)(5) must file his motion \u201cno later than 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). Where a party claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>time to file a notice of appeal should be extended or reopened because he did not receive notice of an appealable order or judgment, the claim is best analyzed under Rule 4(a)(6), which was designed to address this situation. <em>See Sanders v. United States, </em>113 F.3d 184, 186 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6), the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of 14 days after the date when its order to reopen is entered, but only if all the following conditions are satisfied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">(A) the court finds that the moving party did not receive notice under [Fed. R.Civ.P. 77(d) ] of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed \"within 21 days after entry;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">(B) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 14 days after the moving party receives notice under [Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d) ] of the entry, whichever is earlier; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">(C) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). The advisory committee notes to Rule 4(a)(6) provide that this provision \u201cestablishes an outer time limit of 180 days for a party who fails to receive timely notice of entry of a judgment to seek additional time to appeal.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4 advisory committee\u2019s note to 1991 amendment. Rule 4(a)(6) \u201cbalances the inequity of foreclosing appeals by parties who do not receive actual notice of a dispositive order against the need to protect the finality of judgments.\u201d <em>Vencor, </em>279 F.3d at 1309. A district court is not authorized to reopen the time to file a notice of appeal based on lack of notice when more than 180 days have passed since the entry of the judgment or order at issue, and \u201c[t]o permit extensions of the time to appeal beyond the 180-day limit ... would effectively thwart the purpose of [Rule 4(a)(6)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1310-11. The Supreme Court has. interpreted the time limit provided by Rule 4(a)(6) as a jurisdictional bar to appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Because Congress specifically limited the amount of time by which district courts can extend the notice-of-appeal period in \u00a7 207(c), that limitation is more than a simple \u201cclaim processing rule.\u201d As we have long held, when an \u201cappeal has not been prosecuted in the manner directed, within the time limited by the acts of Congress, it must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\"><em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 213, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">Having considered this body of law, we conclude that the district court did not err by denying Petrola\u2019s second motion for reconsideration of the order denying Petrola\u2019s motion to file an out-of-time notice of appeal and application for a COA. The court\u2019s hands were tied by Rule 4(a)(6). The court could not extend the time period for taking an appeal; it lacked the authority to fashion an exception to this rule since Petrola\u2019s motion to file an out-of-time notice of appeal exceeded the 180 days provided for by the Rule 4(a)(6) exception. <em>See Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 214, 127 S.Ct. at 2366; <em>see Vencor, </em>279 F.3d at 1310-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\">. At the time he committed the offense, Petrola was a licensed osteopathic physician in Palm Beach County, Florida. In addition to the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 offense, the indictment charged him with two counts of dispensing controlled substances \u2014 Roxicodone/Oxicodone, Valium/Diazepam, and Klonopin/Clonazepam \u2014 outside the course of professional medical practice, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. He pled guilty to the \u00a7 846 offense pursuant to a plea agreement which required the Government to dismiss the other two counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-17\">.
