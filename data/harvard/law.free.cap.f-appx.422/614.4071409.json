Patwardhan appeals his conviction following a jury trial for (1) conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, (2) introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with intent to defraud or mislead, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a), 333(a)(2), 352(c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>352(f)(1), (3) smuggling goods into the United States, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545, (4) aiding and abetting smuggling, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a), (b), and (5) criminal forfeiture, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 981(a)(1)(C), 982(a)(2)(B), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(p), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 853(p), 2461(c). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">I. Conviction of Introducing Misbranded Drugs into Interstate Commerce</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Patwardhan was convicted of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce with intent to defraud or mislead. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a), 333(a)(2), 352(c), 352(f)(1). We reject Patwardharis argument that he cannot be convicted of these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Under the relevant statutory scheme, prescription drugs are per se misbranded. <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.5; <em>see also United States v. Evers, </em>643 F.2d 1043, 1051 (5th Cir.1981) (accepting the FDA\u2019s assertion that \u201csince a prescription drug by definition can be used only under a physician\u2019s supervision ... it is impossible to provide \u2018adequate directions for use\u2019 to a layman\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Articles of Drug, </em>625 F.2d 665, 673-75 (5th Cir.1980)). Prescription drugs legally flow through interstate commerce only when they fall under one of two exceptions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 201.100, 201.115; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 353(b)(2); <em>see also Evers, </em>643 F.2d at 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">Patwardhan does not argue, nor does an independent review of the record support the conclusion, that the non-FDA approved foreign medicine he brought into the United States for later distribution to his patients qualifies for either exception. Thus, Patwardhan can be convicted of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a), 333(a)(2), 352(c), 352(f)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">Further, there was sufficient evidence presented at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, for \u201c <em>any </em>rational trier of fact [to find] ... beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d that Patwardhan acted with the intent to defraud or mislead. <em>United States v. Nevils, </em>598 F.3d 1158, 1161 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original)). Patwardhan told his staff not to give patients foreign medicine for at-home use after a patient\u2019s mother expressed con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>cern about one label, which was written in Hindi. Patwardhan never informed his patients that the drugs administered to them during in-office treatments were not FDA-approved. To the contrary, the IV bags used to administer the foreign medicine contained only the names of the FDA-approved counterparts. Additionally, there was evidence that Patwardharis staff hid foreign medicine during an audit, and used the codes corresponding to the FDA-approved drugs, not the foreign medicines that had actually been used, when billing Medicare for reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">II. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We also conclude that the district court\u2019s mid-trial ruling excluding the testimony of expert witness Patrick Egan after that testimony was referenced in the defense opening statement does not warrant a new trial. \u201cEvidentiary rulings will be reversed for abuse of discretion only if such nonconstitutional error more likely than not affected the verdict.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Hankey, </em>203 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir. 2000). Patwardhan, however, has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Overwhelming evidence supported the guilty verdict, and thus the district court\u2019s ruling did not affect the outcome of the trial. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Maldonado, </em>115 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 1997), upon which Patwardhan relies to argue that he suffered prejudice as a result of the district court\u2019s mid-trial ruling, is distinguishable. In <em>Gonzalez-Maldonado, </em>the district court\u2019s mid-trial ruling prevented the defense from introducing important impeachment testimony of the prosecution\u2019s key witness, testimony that defense counsel had promised in his opening statement the jury would hear. In contrast, Egan\u2019s testimony was not critical to Patwardharis defense, because Patwardhan never suggested that he was confused by the particular laws Egan was going to address. Defense counsel mentioned Egan only briefly in his opening statement, and the district court prohibited the prosecution from arguing that defense counsel had broken its promise by failing to introduce Egan\u2019s testimony. Thus, Patwardhan has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s mid-trial decision to exclude Egan\u2019s testimony prejudiced him as to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\">. Because the parties are familiar with the facts of the case, we repeat them here only to the extent necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\">. <em>Exception 1: </em>Under 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 201.100, 201.115, a prescription drug is not considered misbranded if the drug is in the possession of someone who can lawfully engage in the dispensing of drugs, and the label contains, <em>inter alia, </em>the statement \u201cRx only,\u201d the recommended dosage, the route of administration, the amount of each active ingredient, the names of inactive ingredients (if the drug is for oral use), and a lot or control number.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\"><em>Exception 2: </em>Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 353(b)(2), \"[a]ny drug dispensed by filling or refilling a written or oral prescription of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug shall be exempt from the requirements of [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352] ... if the drug bears a label containing the name and address of the dispenser, the serial number and date of the prescription or of its filing, the name of the prescriber, and, if stated in the prescription, tire name of the patient, and the directions for use and cautionary statement, if any, contained in such prescription.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-14\">. Patwardhan relies on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Evers, </em>643 F.2d 1043, to argue that it is legally impossible for a physician who administers prescription medicine to his patients to be convicted under the misbranding statute. His reliance is misplaced. Evers was charged under a different provision, section 33 l(lc), which prohibits causing a drug to become misbranded while held after shipment in interstate commerce. In contrast, Patwardhan was charged with introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce under section 331(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
