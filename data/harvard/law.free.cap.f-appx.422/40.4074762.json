Mar. 22, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-20\">Because Jones is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2) (relating to convictions of crimes of moral turpitude), we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s factual findings and discretionary determinations. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Although we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Jones\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s determination that her motion to reopen was untimely filed and that she failed to establish eligibility for an exception to the timeliness requirement raises no such argument. Jones contends that the BIA\u2019s \u201cgross errors\u201d deprived her of due process. A petitioner must do more than merely assert that some error violated her due process rights. <em>See Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 40 (2d Cir.2008) (concluding that the Court lacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>jurisdiction to review \u201cinsubstantial and frivolous\u201d constitutional claims and questions of law). Instead, the petitioner must assert a claim that actually raises a substantial constitutional question. Here, Jones fails to assert such a claim, as the substance of Jones\u2019s arguments is only that the BIA erred in finding that the changes in Haiti due to natural disasters were not material to her claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Her unsupported and conelusory constitutional claim does not provide us with jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s fact-finding. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329-30 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">To the extent Jones alleges a violation of due process because she contends that the agency failed to consider material evidence, this argument is also so insubstantial that it does not provide us with jurisdiction. <em>See Barco-Sandoval, </em>516 F.3d at 40. Jones\u2019s cursory contention that the BIA did not consider evidence of country conditions is belied by her contrary contention that the BIA erred in its assessment of that evidence. Moreover, contrary to her assertions, the BIA did explicitly refer to Jones\u2019s evidence of changed conditions in Haiti, and this Court does not require the BIA to \u201cexpressly parse or refute on the record each individual argument or piece of evidence offered by the petitioner\u201d to establish that it has considered the evidence. <em>See Jian Hui Shoo v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 337 n. 17 (presuming that the agency \u201chas taken into account all of the evidence before [it], unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
