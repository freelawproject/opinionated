Betancourt, </em>586 F.3d 303, 308-09 (5th Cir. 2009), <em>cert. denied,</em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1920, 176 L.Ed.2d 390 (2010), which reaffirmed the holding in <em>United States v. Gamez-Gonzalez, </em>319 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir.2003), that knowledge of drug type and quantity is not an element of the offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. He also raises arguments that he concedes are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006), which held that a district court may order a term of imprisonment to run consecutively with an unimposed state sentence. Finally, Hernandez raises arguments that he acknowledges are foreclosed by <em>United States v. London, </em>568 F.3d 553, 564 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 631, 178 L.Ed.2d 507 (2010). The Supreme Court adopted the position advanced in <em>London. See Abbott v.
