Ruszkowski, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s decision granting Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendant and dismissing Appellant\u2019s complaint brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d), as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>orders granting summary judgment, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Havey v. Homebound Mortg., Inc., </em>547 F.3d 158, 163 (2d Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). For summary judgment purposes, a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d exists where the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could decide in the non-moving party\u2019s favor. <em>Nabisco, Inc. v. Warner-Lambert Co., </em>220 F.3d 43, 45 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Appellant\u2019s discrimination claims are governed by the three-step burden shifting analysis from <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under this familiar framework, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving a prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence by establishing that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position for which he applied; (3) he was denied the position; and (4) the denial occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817; <em>Vivenzio v. City of Syracuse, </em>611 F.3d 98, 106 (2d Cir.2010). Once a plaintiff alleges a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, the burden of production shifts to the employer to demonstrate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision not to hire the plaintiff. <em>Vivenzio, </em>611 F.3d at 106. The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to present evidence that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is a pretext for an impermissible motivation. <em>Id. </em>A plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case based on \u201cpurely conclusory allegations of discrimination, absent any concrete particulars.\u201d <em>Meiri v. Dacon, </em>759 F.2d 989, 998 (2d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">Here, Appellant cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII or the ADEA. With respect to the position of phlebotomy supervisor, Appellant cannot show that he was qualified for the position, as he admittedly had no prior supervisory experience. With respect to the positions of medical laboratory technician and phlebotomy technician, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>if Appellant\u2019s limited experience 14 years prior to his application for employment with Appellee qualified him for the jobs, there is no evidence that Appellee\u2019s failure to hire Appellant occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. <em>See McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Additionally, Appellant testified that he could not recall whether he had provided his national origin on his application, and that he did not believe that he had indicated his race or color. Appellant\u2019s conclusory statements regarding general societal attitudes toward, and harassment of, people- of Polish and/or German descent and his above-average DNA and test results are insufficient to establish a prima facie case that Appellee did not hire him based on his race, color, gender, or national origin. Finally, absent any evidence that Appellant was eligible to apply for the positions at issue, he has failed to establish a prima facie case that his age was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of Appellee\u2019s failure to hire him.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\">. Although <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>concerned the burden and allocation of proof under Title VII, its framework is also applied to claims under the ADEA. <em>See Gorzytiski v. Jetblue Airways Corp., </em>596 F.3d 93, 110 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\">. The Court notes that, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>- U.S. -,---, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 2350-51, 174 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009), a claimant bringing suit under the ADEA must demonstrate that age was not just a motivating factor behind the adverse action, but rather the \"but-for\u201d cause of it. <em>See id. </em>Title VII, on the other hand, does authorize a \"mixed motive\u201d discrimination claim. <em>See id. </em>at 2350 n. 3 (\"Congress amended Title VII to allow for employer liability when discrimination was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice, but did not similarly amend the ADEA. We must give effect to Congress\u2019 choice.\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">. We also note that Appellee has consistently maintained \u2014 and provided documents supporting its contention \u2014 that it never received Appellant\u2019s application and that, on October 6, 2005, neither of those positions would have been available to external applicants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
