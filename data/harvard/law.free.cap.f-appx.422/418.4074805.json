Zorida BLEWETT, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b442-8\">No. 09-5300.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b442-9\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b442-11\">May 5, 2011.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b442-13\">Before: DAUGHTREY, MOORE, and CLAY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b442-14\">MARTHA CRAIG DAUGHTREY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">The defendant, Zorida Blewett, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base, aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base, and aiding and abetting distribution of cocaine base. In May 2002, the district court concluded that Blewett was a career offender, as defined by section 4B1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and sentenced him to an effective term of 262 months in prison. However, following the 2007 amendment to section 2D 1.1(c) of the Guidelines \u2014 an amendment that reduced the base offense calculation for most crack cocaine offenses by two levels \u2014 the district court directed the probation department to recalculate the defendant\u2019s potential sentence \u201c[a]s a result of the retroactive application of the crack cocaine amendment.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG SuppApp. C, Amend. 706 (effective Nov. 1, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-17\">After performing that recalculation, the probation department determined that Blewett\u2019s sentencing range \u2014 262 to 327 months \u2014 would remain the same, even after the amendment, because the career-offender guidelines, under which the defendant had been sentenced, had not been altered by Amendment 706. The district court agreed with the probation office\u2019s assessment and overruled Blewett\u2019s objections to the recalculation. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from that ruling and now seeks sentencing relief from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-18\">On appeal, Blewett quotes the explicit language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in arguing that the sentence imposed upon him should be modified. In that subsection, Congress provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-19\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment <em>based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-20\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-21\">The defendant insists that, because Amendment 706 reduced by two the base offense levels for the crack cocaine amounts that were previously listed in section 2Dl.l(e) of the Guidelines, his career-offender-enhanced sentence should also be reduced. Blewett reasons that one step in assessing punishment for a career offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>is determining whether \u201cthe offense level for a career offender from the table in [\u00a7 4Bl.l(b)] is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Thus, he contends, a court must necessarily calculate \u201cthe offense level otherwise applicable\u201d and, because that offense level has been reduced through operation of Amendment 706, he has in fact \u201cbeen sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Blewett\u2019s argument, however, is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Perdue, </em>572 F.3d 288 (6th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1537, 176 L.Ed.2d 133 (2010). In <em>Perdue, </em>we recognized that any \u201calternative base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 ultimately [does] not affect the calculation of the sentencing range under the career offender classification, \u00a7 4B1.1,\u201d and that, as a result, \u201cAmendment 706 has no effect on the ultimate sentencing range imposed ... under the career-offender Guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293. That determination is now the \u201claw of the circuit\u201d and \u201cremains controlling authority unless an inconsistent decision of the United States Supreme Court requires modification of the decision or this Court sitting en banc overrules the prior decision.\u201d <em>Salmi v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">In an alternative argument contained in his brief filed prior to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010), Blewett contends that <em>all </em>Guidelines provisions are advisory only and, therefore, that a sentence modification occasioned by operation of Amendment 706 would not necessarily be limited to a two-level reduction and, inferentially, would not necessarily be constrained by any career-offender provisions. In <em>Dillon, </em>however, the Court ruled that even <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which directed courts to treat Guidelines sentencing ranges as advisory rather than mandatory, does not permit district courts in proceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) to reduce a sentence below the revised Guidelines range authorized by Amendment 706. <em>See Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691-92. Instead, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoN\">[Section 3582(c)(2) ] permits a sentence reduction [only] within the narrow bounds established by the [Sentencing] Commission. The relevant policy statement instructs that a court proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cshall substitute\u201d the amended Guidelines range for the initial range \u201cand shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). Because the aspects of his sentence that Dillon seeks to correct were not affected by the Commission\u2019s amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1, they are outside the scope of the proceeding authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the District Court properly declined to address them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 2694.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">Similarly, Amendment 706 effected no change to the Guidelines\u2019 career-offender provisions. <em>Dillon </em>thus does not undermine our prior decision in <em>Perdue. </em>Bound as we are by that earlier ruling, we are not now free to grant Blewett the relief he seeks. The judgment of the district court is, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
