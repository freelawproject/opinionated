The Federal Public Defender appointed to represent Taylor has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Taylor has not filed a response. In revoking Taylor\u2019s probation, the district court imposed a sentence of 10 months of imprisonment with no additional term of probation or supervised release. During the pendency of this appeal, Taylor completed his term of imprisonment and has been discharged from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, sua sponte, if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Article III, section 2, of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to actual cases and controversies. <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). The case-or-controversy requirement demands that \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole \u2014 some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction \u2014 must exist if the suit is to be maintained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 118 S.Ct. 978. Because Taylor has completed the entire sentence imposed for his probation revocation, there is no case or controversy for us to address. <em>See Spencer, </em>523 U.S. at 7, 14-18, 118 S.Ct. 978; <em>United States v. Clark, </em>193 F.3d 845, 847-48 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is DISMISSED as moot, and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
