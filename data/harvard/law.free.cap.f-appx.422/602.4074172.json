We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions and review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Barrios v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 849, 854 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Coreas-Giron failed to establish the extortion demands and threats from gang members were on account of a protected ground. <em>See id. </em>at 856 (evidence supported conclusion that gang victimized the petitioner for economic and personal reasons rather than on account of a protected ground); <em>see also Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he REAL ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). Accordingly, because Coreas-Giron failed to demonstrate he was persecuted or fears persecution on account of a protected ground, we deny the petition as to his asylum and withholding of removal claims. <em>See Barrios, </em>581 F.3d at 856; <em>see Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 865 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAsylum generally is not available to victims of civil strife, unless they are singled out on account of a protected ground.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because petitioners did not establish a likelihood of being tortured in El Salvador. <em>See Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 747-48 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Finally, we reject Coreas-Giron\u2019s contention that his case should be remanded to the BIA in order to assess the impact of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Public Law 110457, 122 Stat 5044. Since he lives with his mother in the United States, Coreas-Giron fails to meet the requirement for an unaccompanied alien child-that \u201cno parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody.\u201d See 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 279(g)(2)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
