BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b695-29\">On October 10, 2008, a 2005 Dodge pickup truck owned and operated by Blutone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Enterprises, LLC, was involved in an accident resulting in personal injury to three individuals. Thereafter, Mid-Continent Casualty Company brought this diversity action against Blutone Enterprises, LLC, Ray Lawrence, and Eugene Radford (collectively, \u201cBlutone\u201d), seeking a declaratory judgment that at the time of the accident the truck was not covered by the commercial auto policy issued by Mid-Continent to Blutone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A jury returned a verdict for Mid-Continent, finding defendants had \u201cnot established by the greater weight of the evidence that the 2005 Dodge pickup involved in the collision ... was covered under the ... policy.\u201d ApltApp. at 325. Blutone appeals, contending the district court erroneously excluded (1) an Insurance Identification Card, and (2) Proposed Jury Instruction No. 16.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The parties are familiar with the facts so we provide only a brief summary. It is undisputed in this case that \u201c[ojnly vehicles on the policy at the time of an accident are covered vehicles.\u201d ApltApp. at 59. It is also undisputed that the 2005 Dodge pickup truck was not listed as a covered vehicle at the time of the accident, and that Blutone never received a bill or paid a premium for this vehicle. Notwithstanding, Blutone maintains that its employee, Donna Lawrence, asked Mid-Continent\u2019s agent, Kristina Donaldson, to add the truck to the policy during a forty-seven second telephone conversation on February 20, 2008.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Trial testimony established that Blutone\u2019s commercial auto policy allowed for Blutone to add or delete a vehicle by notifying Mid-Continent\u2019s agent, and that this was routinely done without incident \u2014 until this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Prior to trial, Mid-Continent filed a motion in limine explaining that Blutone claimed it had an Insurance Identification Card in its file for the 2005 Dodge pickup, and that Blutone intends to argue that the Card shows it \u201crequested the 2005 Dodge to be added\u201d to the policy \u201cand that Mid-Continent did add [it].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. Mid-Continent asserted that \u201c[s]uch a claim is false, irrelevant to the single issue [in the case], confusing, and prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In support, Mid-Continent explained that the reason Blutone had a Card in its file was because Mid-Continent\u2019s agent had sent Blutone extra cards \u201c[b]ecause when you have a fleet card you can use it in any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>your vehicles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. In other words, unlike a personal auto policy, a commercial auto policy\u2019s identification cards do not list an individual vehicle; rather, under \u201cMAKE/MODEL\u201d the cards say \u201cFleet,\u201d Aplee. SuppApp. at 3. Since the Insurance Identification Card does not list an individual vehicle, reasoned Mid-Continent, it \u2014 and/or testimony about it \u2014 is not relevant to proving or disproving whether Ms. Lawrence asked Ms. Donaldson to add the 2005 Dodge pickup truck to the policy on February 20, and is therefore inadmissible. In the alternative, Mid-Continent argued that any evidence regarding the Card should be ruled inadmissible because it would be confusing and prejudicial since the jury might believe that the Card lists the individual vehicle the way an individual vehicle is listed on a personal auto policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Blutone filed a response to Mid-Continent\u2019s motion in limine, contending that the Insurance Identification Card was generated to allow it to obtain title to the 2005 Dodge pickup truck and thereby comply with Oklahoma law. Blutone urged that the Card was relevant because \u201c[i]t is evidence of whether ... [Blutone] thought it had insurance on the 2005 Dodge Pickup.\u201d ApltApp. at 33. Blutone further argued that the Card evidenced \u201cMid-Continent\u2019s manner of doing business,\u201d stating that Mid-Continent \u201ccan and should have to explain to the Court and jury why the [Card] was produced and given to Blutone.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">After considering the parties\u2019 filings and hearing argument on Mid-Continent\u2019s motion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">Here is what I\u2019m going to do. I will sustain the same ruling that I previously made[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] with regard to the insurance verification form, except that you [ (counsel for Blutone) ] will be given permission to approach the bench if you think [the Insurance Identification Card] becomes relevant, or if you think you can persuade the Court that it becomes relevant by anything said or done by [counsel for Mid-Continent], then you may approach the bench and we\u2019ll have a discussion with regard to what I will call a reserve ruling on the motion in limine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 83-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">On appeal, Blutone takes issue with the district court\u2019s exclusion of the Insurance Identification Card and asserts that we should review the district court\u2019s exclusion of the Card for an abuse of discretion. Mid-Continent counters that because the district court reserved ruling on the motion in limine, the proper standard of review is the rigorous plain error standard. <em>See Perkins v. Silver Mountain Sports Club &amp; Spa, LLC, </em>557 F.3d 1141, 1146-47 &amp; n. 4 (10th Cir.2009). We need not engage in a standard of review inquiry, however, because even applying the more lenient abuse-of-discretion standard we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">Blutone submits that the district court abused its discretion because the Insurance Identification Card is relevant and admissible under Federal Rules of Evidence 401 and 402 \u2014 it is \u201chow Mid Continent chooses to allow its insureds to prove they are in compliance with Oklahoma\u2019s mandatory liability insurance law,\u201d and it \u201cshow[s] ownership and Blutone\u2019s state of mind as to whether it believed it was insured.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 11. Blutone also directs our attention to the jury\u2019s two questions to the court during deliberations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u201c(1) Was the Truck tag[g]ed; and (2) was it registered to Blutone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12 (citing Aplt.App. at 65). Blutone argues that the jury \u201cknew that a person cannot tag or register a vehicle without showing proof of insurance,\u201d which \u201cis generally accomplished by submitting an insurance verification form to the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. Therefore, argues Blutone, \u201c[t]he jurors were without the very piece of evidence that was at the heart of their questioning,\u201d and this relevant evidence\u2019s probative value outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice or confusion. <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed.R.Evid. 403). We disagree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">\u201c[A] trial court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant, and its decision will not be reversed on appeal absent a showing of clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Hill v. Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc., </em>790 F.2d 817, 825 (10th Cir.1986). In this case, the Insurance Identification Card was irrelevant to the single issue before the jury \u2014 -whether Blutone\u2019s Ms. Lawrence asked Mid-Continent\u2019s agent, Ms. Donaldson, to add the truck to the policy during a forty-seven second telephone conversation on February 20, 2008. The Card did not tend to prove or disprove this question because, among other things, it does not include a vehicle identification number, make, model, or year of a vehicle; instead, it only says \u201cFleet,\u201d Aplee. Supp.App. at 3. Accordingly, we are not \u201cfirmly convinced that a mistake [was] made\u201d by the district court. <em>Hill, </em>790 F.2d at 826. Indeed, the court invited Blutone\u2019s counsel \u201cto approach the bench if you think [the Insurance Identification Card] becomes relevant, or if you think you can persuade the Court that it becomes relevant by anything said or done by\u201d counsel for Mid-Continent. Aplt.App. at 83^1. But Blutone did not make any proffer on this issue at trial. We conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to exclude this evidence was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Blutone next contends the district court abused its discretion in refusing to give Blutone\u2019s Proposed Jury Instruction No. 16, and that doing so caused confusion amongst the jury members. In a diversity case such as this, \u201cthe substance of a jury instruction is a matter of state law, but the grant or denial of a tendered instruction is governed by federal law.\u201d <em>Blanke v. Alexander, </em>152 F.3d 1224, 1232 (10th Cir.1998). Although we review the district court\u2019s refusal to give a particular instruction for an abuse of discretion, \u201c[w]e review de novo whether, as a whole, the district court\u2019s jury instructions correctly stated the governing law and provided the jury with an ample understanding of the issues and applicable standards.\u201d <em>Martinez v. Caterpillar, Inc., </em>572 F.3d 1129, 1132 (10th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe reverse only in those cases where we have a substantial doubt whether the jury was fairly guided in its deliberations ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Proposed Jury Instruction No 16 stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">ACTIONS OF INSURANCE AGENT ARE ACTIONS OF INSURER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-11\">Act performed by the insurance agent can bind the insurance company within the scope of his authority, which includes the taking and preparation of applications for insurance for submission to the insurance company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-12\">You should consider the actions of Messer-Bowers [ (the agent<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) ] as those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>actions of Mid-Continent because Messer-Bowers[\u2019] actions in taking information and preparing applications falls with the scope and authority of the agency of Messer-Bowers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Aplt.App. at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">But, as Mid-Continent points out, the district court read the parties\u2019 stipulations to the jury, which stated, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The parties have agreed to the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">(2) Messer Bowers Company, Inc., is Mid-Continent Casualty Company\u2019s agent. Notice to Messer-Bowers would be notice to Mid-Continent Casualty Company. Likewise, failure to notify Messer-Bowers would be failure to notify Mid-Continent Casualty Company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 59. Thus, counters Mid-Continent it would be confusing \u201cfor the jury to be told the parties stipulated to the agency relationship but then be instructed that agency was an issue to be decided,\u201d Aplee. Br. at 11-12, especially when \u201c[fjactual stipulations withdraw a fact from issue and dispense with the need for proof of the fact,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12 (citing <em>Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of the Univ. of Cal., Hastings Coll, of the Law v. Martinez,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014\u2014,-, 130 S.Ct. 2971, 2983, 177 L.Ed.2d 838 (2010)). We agree with Mid-Continent. In deciding to exclude Proposed Jury Instruction No. 16, the district court concluded that the stipulation adequately covered the agency issue and that the instruction that Blutone proffered would be duplicative of the stipulation. This determination was not an abuse of discretion and we do not have any doubt that the jury \u201cwas fairly guided in its deliberations.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>572 F.3d at 1132 (10th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b695-18\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-6\">. Mid-Continent also named as defendants the three people injured in the accident (Scott Turner, Joyce Turner, and Mary Sue Heitz), but they are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\"><em>. </em>To the extent Blutone asserts on appeal that the jury was confused by the district court\u2019s preliminary statement and by Jury Instructions Nos. 3 and 8, Blutone waived appellate review \u2014 other than for plain error, which we do not here discern \u2014 by failing to object to the instructions in the district court. <em>See Williams v. W.D. Sports, N.M., Inc., </em>497 F.3d 1079, 1094 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201d[W]hen a party does not object to an instruction before the district court ... we can review the district court\u2019s decision ... only for plain error. Under that standard, we. will affirm unless the instructions were patently, plainly erroneous and prejudicial.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b696-13\">.
