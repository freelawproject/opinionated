We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Holder, </em>559 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-23\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based upon the omission from his asylum application and declaration of the tip Chen received that the police were investigating his family, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-64 (9th Cir.2004) (omissions and inconsistencies that go to the heart of the petitioner\u2019s claim support an adverse credibility finding), and his failure to provide reasonable explanations for the omission, <em>see Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2007). Substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>also supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Chen\u2019s vague testimony regarding his Christian practices in the United States. <em>See Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 724 (9th Cir.1997) (vague testimony regarding religious affiliation supported adverse credibility determination). In the absence of credible testimony, Chen\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal based on his membership in an underground Christian church fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Chen failed to establish that the Chinese government \u201cforced\u201d his fiancee to have an abortion. <em>Cf. Ding v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 1131, 1139 (9th Cir. 2004). Accordingly, Chen\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B) fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b666-24\"> This disposilion is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
