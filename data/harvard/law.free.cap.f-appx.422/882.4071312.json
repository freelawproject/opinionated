Gore &amp; Associates, Inc. moves to dismiss Pella Corporation\u2019s appeal due to waiver of appeal rights. Pella opposes. W.L. Gore replies. W.L. Gore also submits a correction to the official caption.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Andersen sued W.L. Gore and Pella of infringement of its patent related to a reduced visibility insect screen. W.L. Gore manufactured screen fabric material, and Pella converted the screen material into finished window screens that were sold as insect screens. The parties eventually settled the underlying dispute except for one claim involving indemnification for costs and fees in this matter that related back to a 2003 supply agreement between W.L. Gore &amp; Pella.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">In pertinent part, the settlement agreement in this case provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-12\">If not previously resolved by agreement of the parties, the Indemnification Dispute will be submitted to the honorable Franklin L. Noel, Magistrate Judge, U.S. District Court District of Minnesota, for binding resolution based on the briefing of the parties. The decision rendered by Magistrate Noel shall be final.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">Subsequently, the magistrate considered Pella\u2019s request that W.L. Gore indemnify Pella for costs and fees incurred in the litigation, amounting to $4,049,249.43. The magistrate denied Pella\u2019s motion and determined that W.L. Gore was not required to indemnify Pella. The magistrate issued his determination in a \u201cReport and Recommendation\u201d which indicated that written objections could be filed with the district court. Pella objected and appealed the magistrate\u2019s determination to the district court. The district court held that because the parties agreed that the magistrate\u2019s determination would be final, the magistrate\u2019s determination was \u201cclearly an Order which the parties agreed would be final and not appealable.\u201d Thus the district court expressly declined to review the order, although it noted \u201c[parenthetically, even if the Court did review the Magistrate\u2019s Order, it would affirm, as the Order is neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law.\u201d The district court dismissed the appeal of the magistrate\u2019s order to that court and directed the clerk of that court to docket the report and recommendation as an order. The clerk entered the magistrate\u2019s order on the docket and Pella filed an appeal, seeking review of the final order by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">W.L. Gore moves to dismiss the appeal, arguing that Pella waived its right to appeal to this court when it agreed in the settlement agreement that the indemnification matter would be submitted to the magistrate for \u201cbinding resolution\u201d and that the magistrate\u2019s determination would be \u201cfinal.\u201d Pella argues that the agreement did not waive its right to appeal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>this court but only waived its right to seek district court review of the magistrate\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">We agree with Pella that the agreement\u2019s language indicating that the magistrate\u2019s determination would be \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cbinding\u201d did not indicate that it was waiving its right to appeal to this court. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 72, a nondispositive matter may be referred to a magistrate, who shall issue proposed findings and recommendations. Any party may file written objections and the district court reviews the objections accordingly. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 73, a magistrate may decide dispositive matters by consent of the parties, and there is no right to file objections to the district court. Instead, \u201can appeal from a judgment entered at a magistrate judge\u2019s direction may be taken to the court of appeals as would any other appeal from a district-court judgment.\u201d By indicating that the magistrate\u2019s ruling would be \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cbinding,\u201d it is reasonably clear that the parties intended that the magistrate\u2019s ruling would not be subject to review by the district court and would thus constitute the district court\u2019s final ruling on the matter. Any waiver of the right to appeal to this court would need to be more clear and express. <em>See, e.g., Goodsell v. Shea, </em>651 F.2d 765 (C.C.P.A.1981) (finding waiver of appellate rights when parties\u2019 agreement stated that \u201ceach party hereby waives any and all rights of appeal from any such decision\u201d); <em>In re Lybarger, </em>793 F.2d 136 (6th Cir.1986) (parties\u2019 consent decree stated that \u201cthe parties waive all rights of appeal and further review of or relief from the Court\u2019s Order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">(1) The motion to dismiss is denied. The appellant\u2019s opening brief is due within 21 days of the date of filing of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">(2) The motion to reform the caption is granted. The revised official caption is reflected above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
