GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b764-18\">Chicago Insurance Co. (\u201cCIC\u201d) filed this diversity case seeking a declaratory judgment that Jan Hamilton wasn\u2019t covered for losses she incurred as a result of disciplinary proceedings brought by the Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners. When Ms. Hamilton failed to file a timely answer to CIC\u2019s complaint and missed multiple discovery deadlines, a magistrate judge recommended default judgment in favor of CIC. He advised Ms. Hamilton of her right to object to the recommendation, the deadline for doing so, and that failing to object would prejudice review in the district and appellate courts. Nonetheless, Ms. Hamilton did not file any objection. She now appeals the resulting default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-21\">Unless a party files a timely objection in the district court, she can\u2019t ordinarily challenge the magistrate\u2019s factual or legal conclusions on appeal. <em>See Duffield v. Jackson, </em>545 F.3d 1234, 1237 (10th Cir.2008). But we have recognized two exceptions: 1) when a <em>pro se </em>litigant has not been informed of the time period for objecting and the consequences of failing to object; or 2) when the interests of justice require review. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Hamilton can\u2019t invoke the first exception: there\u2019s no dispute that the magistrate judge informed her both of the time period for objecting and the consequences of failing to do so. Neither can she prevail on the second. The \u201cinterest of justice\u201d standard is, this court has held, akin to plain error review, and Ms. Hamilton simply doesn\u2019t explain how default judgment in this case \u2014 entered after she repeatedly failed to comply with the magistrate\u2019s orders \u2014 \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>See Morales-Fer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number><em>nandez v. INS, </em>418 F.3d 1116, 1122-23 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Because Ms. Hamilton failed to present any nonfrivolous arguments in support of the issues on appeal, her motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>is denied, as are all other motions pending in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b764-19\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
