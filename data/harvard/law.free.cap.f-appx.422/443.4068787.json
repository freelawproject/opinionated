Lecadio LEON, Defendant-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b467-12\">No. 08-3422.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b467-13\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b467-15\">May 10, 2011.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b467-17\">Before: SUHRHEINRICH, MOORE, and COOK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b467-18\">COOK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b467-19\">When Lecadio Leon, an undocumented immigrant, pleaded guilty to one cocaine-conspiracy charge, the district court imposed a conditional sentence. Leon received 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, but the court noted that it would reduce his sentence to 87 months if he submitted voluntary-deportation documents within two weeks and if the government agreed to the downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-20\">Leon eventually received the lower sentence, but not without some confusion. One week after the sentencing hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>court issued a written judgment that imposed the 108-month sentence but made no mention of the conditional reduction. Two days later, and within the two-week period that the court afforded him, Leon submitted the requisite immigration paperwork. The next day, however, the court received the government\u2019s motion opposing any further sentencing reduction. The district court never acted on the government\u2019s motion, and neither party appealed the judgment. Yet thirty-three months later, the court, citing Leon\u2019s earlier submission of the immigration documents, reduced his sentence to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">On appeal, the government contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 to enter the sentence-reduction order, and that the court\u2019s original judgment imposed an invalid conditional sentence. Because we agree, we vacate both the order reducing Leon\u2019s sentence and the original judgment and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">A court may modify an imposed term of imprisonment only in the limited circumstances described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), one of these being \u201cto the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). The parties agree, however, that Rule 35 does not authorize the order reducing Leon\u2019s sentence. And since neither party cites a statute that \u201cotherwise expressly permits\u201d the reduction, nothing in \u00a7 3582(c) supports the court\u2019s sentence-reduction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Leon nevertheless argues that the court appropriately reduced his sentence because the order merely attempted to impose his original, conditional sentence. Sixth Circuit case law questions the validity of conditional sentences. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>312 Fed.Appx. 801, 807 (6th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (\u201c[T]he legal validity of a conditional sentence is not a foregone conclusion, in this circuit or elsewhere.\u201d). But \u201cto the extent conditional sentencing [is] acceptable,\u201d the sentence must be precise and unequivocal, and \u201cthe fulfillment of the condition must rest within \u2018the personal control of the defendant and not some independent third party or entity.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Martin, </em>913 F.2d 1172, 1176 (6th Cir. 1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">The conditional sentence that the district court imposed here hinged on one condition not within Leon\u2019s control \u2014 the government\u2019s consent. <em>See Martin, </em>913 F.2d at 1176. As a result, even if conditional sentencing generally is proper, this one fails to satisfy the personal-control requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">Because the parties concede Rule 35\u2019s inapplicability, and because the district court\u2019s initial sentence fails to satisfy the requirements of a valid conditional sentence, we VACATE both the order reducing Leon\u2019s sentence to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment and the judgment imposing a 108-month sentence and REMAND for resentencing. <em>See Garcia, </em>312 Fed.Appx. at 809.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
