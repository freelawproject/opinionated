We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">1. In calculating Romero-Rodriguez\u2019s criminal history category, the district court correctly added two points each for his 1999 and 2005 state convictions. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4Al.l(b) permitted the district court to add two criminal history points \u201cfor each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least 60 days\u201d which Romero-Rodriguez actually served. In each case, the Los Angeles County Superior Court imposed a partially suspended sentence with a term of incarceration of at least 60 days as a condition of probation. Romero-Rodriguez actually served time in jail for both convictions. Therefore, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b), the district court properly assigned two points for each conviction. <em>See United States v. Buzo-Zepeda, </em>609 F.3d 1024, 1026 (9th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Morales, </em>347 F.3d 772, 778 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">2. The district court also added one point for a 2008 state conviction for felony transportation of marijuana, to which Romero-Rodriguez pled <em>nolo contendr\u00e9. </em>This was correct, at the time. The 2008 case was dismissed without entry of judgment, however, so the additional point is now improper. <em>See United States v. Guthrie, </em>931 F.2d 564, 572 (9th Cir.1991). Nonetheless, this error is harmless because Romero-Rodriguez remains in the same criminal history category of V, placing him within the same guidelines sentencing range of 46 to 57 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 5A. The district court thoroughly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Romero-Rodriguez to 46 months, the lowest end of the range. Therefore, even without the 2008 conviction, these same \u00a7 3553(a) factors would apply and the district court would have imposed the same sentence. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992); <em>United States v. Cruz-Gramajo, </em>570 F.3d 1162, 1174 (9th Cir.2009). Romero-Rodriguez has shown no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">3. Romero-Rodriguez failed to show a likelihood that his sentence would have changed had his trial counsel objected to the calculation of his criminal history points, and therefore there is not a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b638-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
