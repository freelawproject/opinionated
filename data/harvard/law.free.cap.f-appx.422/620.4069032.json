Taylor appeals pro se from the tax court\u2019s decision upholding the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\u2019s denial of his request for innocent spouse relief for tax years 1986 and 1987. We have jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). We review for clear error the tax court\u2019s determination that a taxpayer is not entitled to innocent spouse relief. <em>Guth v. Comm\u2019r, </em>897 F.2d 441, 443 (9th Cir.1990). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-22\">The Tax Court did not clearly err in denying Taylor innocent spouse relief because the evidence in the record, including Taylor\u2019s guilty plea to tax evasion for 1987 and the stipulated decision imposing fraud penalties for 1986 and 1987, supported its conclusion that Taylor had actual knowledge of the items giving rise to the tax deficiencies when he prepared and signed the relevant joint federal income tax returns. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6015(b)(1)(C), (c)(3)(C) (no entitlement to innocent spouse relief where taxpayer knew or had reason to know of understatement, or had actual knowledge of items giving rise to deficiencies). In light of these circumstances, the Commissioner\u2019s discretionary decision to deny equitable relief was also reasonable. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6015(f) (providing for innocent spouse relief where equitable).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-23\">Taylor\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-24\">Taylor\u2019s motion to supplement his reply brief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b644-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
