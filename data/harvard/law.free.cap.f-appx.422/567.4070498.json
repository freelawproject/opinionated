We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-19\">We reject Lopez-Castillo\u2019s argument that the burden was on Respondent to show that Lopez-Castillo was not entitled to equitable tolling. Rather, Lopez-Castillo had the burden to establish two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way. <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2562, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010); <em>Mendoza v. Carey, </em>449 F.3d 1065, 1068 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-22\">It was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny an evidentiary hearing on the issue of Lopez-Castillo\u2019s entitlement to equitable tolling, and the district court properly dismissed the petition as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Lopez-Castillo did not adequately allege that he acted with the requisite diligence in pursuing his rights, nor did he offer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>bring forward sufficient evidence of diligence in response to the magistrate judge\u2019s specific inquiry about what evidence he would present if granted a hearing. <em>See Bills v. Clark, </em>628 F.3d 1092, 1100-01 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Mendoza, </em>449 F.3d at 1069-71 &amp; n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b591-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
