Martinez-Perez pleaded guilty, and the district court sentenced him to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, the mandatory statutory minimum. Martinez-Perez noted a timely appeal. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">On appeal, Martinez-Perez argues that the facts on the record do not support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Martinez-Perez was a leader, supervisor, or manager within the meaning of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) (2009). He asserts that, because the district court erroneously applied the leadership enhancement, it also improperly failed to sentence him in accordance with the safety valve provisions of USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The district court\u2019s determination that a sentencing enhancement is warranted is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Kellam, </em>568 F.3d 125, 147-M8 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 657, 175 L.Ed.2d 501 (2009). We will reverse only if we are left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>532 F.3d 326, 337 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">A defendant qualifies for a two-level enhancement if he was an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d in any criminal activity that did not involve five or more participants and was not otherwise extensive. USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Factors distinguishing a leadership or organization role from lesser roles include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApQ\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4; <em>United States v. Cameron, </em>573 F.3d 179, 184 (4th Cir.2009). The leadership enhancement \u201cis appropriate where the evidence demonstrates that the defendant controlled the activities of other participants or exercised management responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Slade, </em>631 F.3d 185, 190 (4th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The facts establishing the enhancement must be by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Harvey, </em>532 F.3d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">We find that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the Government met this burden. Martinez-Perez obtained cocaine in Texas for sale in South Carolina. He used multiple individuals and bank accounts to transfer the proceeds back to Texas. The district court permissibly concluded that in doing so, Martinez-Perez did more than simply sell cocaine to local suppliers \u2014 he actively managed the movement of the proceeds of those sales from South Carolina back to Texas. Moreover, because the district court did not clearly err in applying the leadership enhancement, Martinez-Perez does not meet the requirements for the safety valve. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 (a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
