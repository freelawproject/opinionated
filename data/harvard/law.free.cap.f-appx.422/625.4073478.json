Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Lu\u2019s arrest, detention, and mistreatment by Chinese authorities on account of his participation in a Christian house church do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Gu, v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1019-21 (9th Cir.2006) (detention, beating, and interrogation did not compel a finding of past persecution by Chinese police on account of unsanctioned religious practice); <em>see also Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cAlthough a reasonable factfinder <em>could </em>have found this incident sufficient to establish past persecution, we do not believe that a factfinder would be compelled to do so.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Lu failed to demonstrate he had a well-founded fear of future persecution due to his participation in a Christian house church. <em>See Gu, </em>454 F.3d at 1021-22; <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1096 (9th Cir.2002) (when a petitioner has not established past persecution the agency is entitled to rely on a State Department report in considering whether there is a good reason to fear future persecution). The evidence in the record does not support Lu\u2019s arguments, raised for the first time in his brief to the court, that he is a member of a disfavored group, or that he is a member of a group subject to a pattern or practice of persecution. Accordingly, Lu\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-16\">Because Lu failed to establish his eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the higher standard of eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-17\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Lu has not shown that it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to China. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, 558 </em>F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b650-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
