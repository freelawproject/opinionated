The plea agreement provided that neither party would seek an enhancement or reduction from the applicable Guidelines range. We vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The presentence investigation report recommended enhancements based on Keller\u2019s possession of a firearm and role in the offense. Keller objected to the sentencing enhancements as violative of the plea agreement. At the sentencing court\u2019s direction, the Government offered corroborating evidence of Keller\u2019s possession of a firearm. The Government also offered evidence demonstrating Keller\u2019s leadership role in the conspiracy. Although the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) stressed that the Government was not seeking the enhancements, he summarized the evidence in favor of each enhancement, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">First, as to being a leader, ... it\u2019s very clear from all co-conspirators that Mr. Keller was a ranking member of the Hidden Valley Kings---- [H]e clearly has a leadership role within the gang. That\u2019s pretty much undisputed. As to the shooting, Your Honor, the evidence is pretty strong on this, Your Honor. First, we have Mr. Bridges saying he always carries a 9mm with him. And, of course, Your Honor, as I stated during the last sentencing, we would not rely on that alone, but in this case it is corroborated by independent evidence. Evidence, that I might add, Your Honor, has been developed over the prosecution of this case before and after the Plea Agreement with Mr. Keller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">Over the investigation, it\u2019s pretty clear from multiple sources, including the victim [that Keller was involved in shootings].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-12\">So the evidence is certainly beyond a preponderance of the evidence in this case that Mr. Keller possessed a gun in relation to drug trafficking, as you heard from Mr. Bridges\u2019 debrief that he always carries it and he\u2019s a drug dealer, and from the fact that they had a drug dispute ... and the shooting occurred as a result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-13\">So I believe that the totality of the evidence beyond a preponderance of the evidence shows that Mr. Keller did possess a gun in relation. There was a nexus to the drug dealing. And, therefore ... the two points probably should be upheld.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">Defense counsel again objected, arguing that the AUSA\u2019s statements advocated imposition of sentencing enhancements in violation of the plea agreement. The court found ample evidence supported the enhancements and specifically ruled that the Government did not violate the plea agreement \u201cby merely providing the evidence supporting the Probation Office\u2019s recommendation\u201d of the enhancements. The court applied the enhancements and sentenced Keller to 293 months of imprisonment. Keller noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">The Government has conceded its failure to uphold the spirit of the plea agreement, and the parties have jointly moved to remand for resentencing on Keller\u2019s allegations of sentencing error, breach of the plea agreement, and prosecutorial misconduct. The Government alternatively requests dismissal of the appeal based on Keller\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal included in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Absent a breach of the plea agreement, an appeal waiver should be enforced if the record shows the waiver is valid and the challenged issue falls within the scope of the waiver. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>459 F.3d 490, 495 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cWhen a claim of breach of a plea agreement has been preserved, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of principles of contract interpretation de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>633 F.3d 262, 267 (4th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Keller preserved appellate review by objecting to the sentencing enhancements, our review is for harmless error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">A concession of error on the part of the Government does not end this court\u2019s inquiry, as this court is \u201cnot at liberty to vacate and remand for resentencing on the Government\u2019s concession of error alone.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415 n. 6 (4th Cir.2006). Rather \u201cour judicial obligations compel us to examine independently the errors confessed.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>460 F.3d 550, 558 n. 7 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Courts have a vital interest in assuring that plea agreements are adhered to and handled properly. <em>Lewis, </em>633 F.3d 262, 267. \u201cWhen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Despite reassurances to the contrary, the AUSA specifically advocated for application of the enhancements when he commented in detail on the strength of evidence supporting the enhancements. We accordingly conclude that the Government breached the plea agreement. That the breach may have occurred while complying with the court\u2019s directive for presentation of corroborating evidence does not lessen its impact. <em>Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 262, 92 S.Ct. 495. Because Keller did not secure the benefit to which he was entitled when the Government sought sentencing enhancements, which the court applied, we find that the error affected Keller\u2019s substantial rights and was not harmless. <em>Lewis, </em>633 F.3d 262, 271-72. We therefore do not enforce the appeal waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Accordingly, we grant the parties\u2019 joint motion to remand, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing. We deny Keller\u2019s motion for remand based on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220,124 Stat. 2372. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
