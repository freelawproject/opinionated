We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Midwater Trawlers Coop. v. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 393 </em>F.3d 994, 1002 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-22\">In his complaint, Lopez alleges that defendants violated his due process rights when they ceased storing his property after he was reclassified. Lopez contends that defendants were not authorized to donate his property without a hearing and that prison regulations required that his property be stored until his return to the general population.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-23\">\u201c[A]n unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by a state employee does not constitute a violation of the procedural requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if a meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>available.\u201d <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); <em>see also Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 816 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201c[Negligent or intentional deprivation of a prisoner\u2019s property fails to state a claim under section 1983 if the state has an adequate post deprivation remedy.\u201d). We have specifically held that the California Tort Claims Act, Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 810 et seq., provides an adequate postdeprivation remedy for loss of property. <em>See Barnett, </em>31 F.3d at 816-17. Therefore, because Lopez had an adequate state law tort remedy for the taking of his electronic property, he did not allege a cognizable due process claim and his complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b614-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
