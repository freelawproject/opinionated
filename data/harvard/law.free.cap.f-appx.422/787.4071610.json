(\u201cFlorida Cleanex\u201d), in this action for damages stemming from alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219. Tapia asserts that he was denied overtime wages in violation of the FLSA. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Florida Cleanex after finding that Tapia \u201cfailed to demonstrate a material issue of fact as to the existence of jurisdiction for an overtime violation under the FLSA.\u201d As relevant to this appeal, the court accepted Florida Cleanex\u2019s defense that any cleaning supplies that had entered into interstate commerce had also \u201ccome to rest\u201d prior to their purchase by Florida Cleanex, and held that the FLSA does not impose enterprise coverage on a defendant who engages in certain intrastate purchases of products, even if those products are made out-of-state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">After receiving full briefing in Tapia\u2019s appeal, this Court decided <em>Polycarpe v. E &amp; S Landscaping Serv., Inc., </em>616 F.3d 1217 (11th Cir.2010), in which we expressly rejected the interpretation of FLSA applied by the district court in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 1221. Specifically, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-15\">if a district court, ruling for a Defendant, applied the \u201ccoming to rest\u201d doctrine \u2014 for instance, by looking at where Defendant bought an item instead of where an item was produced, we must vacate the judgment for the Defendant if there is a question about where the \u201cgoods\u201d or \u201cmaterials\u201d were produced or where they have moved. The district courts will need to make some further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>decisions about the interstate history of the items in these cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-6\"><em>Id. </em>Our opinion in <em>Polycarpe </em>also recognized that enterprise coverage under the FLSA may depend upon whether items that have moved in interstate commerce are classified as either \u201cgoods\u201d or \u201cmaterials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1221-27. But we refused to make these factual findings in the first instance, choosing instead to \u201callow[ ] [the district court] to resolve ultimately these factual questions on remand as it finds them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1228 n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">We reach the same result here. First, the district court\u2019s summary judgment order is predicated entirely upon the location of where certain cleaning supplies were purchased, rather than where they originated. But Tapia has alleged and provided evidence that these items traveled in interstate commerce, and thus \u201c[t]he district court[] will need to make some further factual decisions about the interstate history of the items in [this] case[].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1221. Second, Florida Cleanex concedes \u201cit is not clear whether the cleaning supplies at issue are \u2018goods\u2019 ... or whether they are \u2018materials.\u2019 \u201d Thus, as in <em>Polycarpe, </em>we must remand in order for the district court to resolve this issue in the first instance. <em>See Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir. 2000) (explaining that \u201c[i]f there is an issue that the district court did not decide in the first instance, it is not properly before this Court and we remand for the district court\u2019s consideration\u201d). For these reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s summary judgment order and remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>Polycarpe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-12\">. The district court also concluded that the FLSA's individual coverage provisions did not apply to Florida Cleanex. Tapia did not appeal that aspect of the court\u2019s order, and therefore our opinion is limited solely to the district court\u2019s conclusions regarding enterprise liability. <em>See e.g., Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (issues not raised on appeal are deemed waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
