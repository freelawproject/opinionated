Gullett appeals his 51-month sentence, imposed above his guideline range of 27 to 33 months, after a jury convicted him of four counts of subscribing to a false U.S. individual income tax return in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-19\">Although it is disputed whether Gullet preserved his reasonableness challenge, we find his sentence to be both procedurally and substantively reasonable under either a plain-error or an abuse-of-diseretion standard of review, for the following reasons. Gullett\u2019s 51-month sentence was procedurally reasonable. The district court properly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Moreover, despite Gullett\u2019s contentions, the district court adequately explained at sentencing why a sentence within the guidelines range would not satisfy the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Likewise, the district court\u2019s explanation of its reasons for varying upward was sufficiently justified to support the degree of the variance. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (explaining that when a district court varies from the applicable guidelines range, the justification must be \u201csufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-20\">Gullett\u2019s 51-month sentence was also substantively reasonable. The district court did not err when weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because it did not give undue weight to any particular factor and focused on the relevant factors in imposing its sentence. The record shows that the district court correctly calculated the guideline range, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and heard Gullet\u2019s arguments in mitigation. The district court neither abused its discretion nor committed plain error in concluding that an upward variance sentence was necessary to comply with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a) \u2014 Gullett\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>sentence was appropriate to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, provide adequate deterrence, and protect the public from further crimes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Gullett has failed to carry his burden of showing that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
