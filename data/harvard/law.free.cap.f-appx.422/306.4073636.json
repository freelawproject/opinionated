At the time of his death, Salvador was covered under a group life and accidental death insurance policy (hereinafter policy) issued by American United Life Insurance Company (AUL) and subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-46. Salvador\u2019s wife, Araceli Medina Garcia (Araceli), submitted a claim under this policy following his death. AUL denied Araceli\u2019s claim because Salvador was living illegally in the United States and made material misrepresentations regarding his identity during the application process. Subsequently, Araceli filed suit, and the district court found in AUL\u2019s favor. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">Tatum Excavating, Inc. and Tatum Excavating, Inc. Employee Benefit Plan (collectively, Tatum) signed a contract for a group policy for several of its employees with AUL. The policy offered life insurance coverage in the amount of $20,000 and accidental death and dismemberment coverage in the amount of $20,000 per eligible employee. A few months after Tatum entered into this agreement, Salvador signed a group enrollment form to apply for the policy (hereinafter the enrollment form). The enrollment form reflected Salvador\u2019s alleged date of birth as August 19, 1966 and purported Social Security Number (SSN) as XXX-XX-XXXX, but did not designate a beneficiary. Later, Salvador completed a beneficiary designation form, naming Araceli as sole beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-17\">On January 25, 2006, Salvador died in a traffic accident. Subsequently, Tatum sent AUL a proof of death form, notifying AUL of Salvador\u2019s death, Araceli\u2019s Mexican identification card, and Salvador\u2019s death certificate, identifying his date of birth as August 19, 1966, place of birth as Mexico City, Mexico, and SSN as XXX-XX-XXXX. In order to verify eligibility, AUL requested additional documentation because, based on Salvador\u2019s place of birth, there was no indication from the documents that Tatum sent that Salvador <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>was a United States citizen. Tatum then sent AUL another copy of Araceli\u2019s alien registration card and a copy of Salvador\u2019s 1-9 form,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which reflected a SSN for Salvador of XXX-XX-XXXX and Alien Resident Card number of 048-931-385 with an expiration date of May 26, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">On that same day, AUL initiated an eligibility investigation, seeking verification of Salvador\u2019s alien status and the SSN. The results of the eligibility investigation indicated that the SSN (reflected on the enrollment form, 1-9, death certificate, and proof of death form) did not belong to Salvador. AUL sent Araceli a letter rescinding Salvador\u2019s policy and denying Araceli\u2019s claim. Araceli appealed AUL\u2019s decision, but did not submit additional records in support of her claim. AUL then re-opened its eligibility investigation. The reinvestigation confirmed the prior results. Specifically, the investigation report stated that the Social Security Administration (SSA) records reflected that the SSN that Salvador provided on the enrollment form belonged to a woman who died in 1966 and that the SSA was not able to find any SSN matching Salvador\u2019s name. The report further stated that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had no information in their system that matched the information provided for Salvador. After AUL confirmed these findings, it sent Araceli another letter explaining the reasons for AUL\u2019s denial and rescission of coverage, and providing additional information supporting its decision. Shortly thereafter, Araceli filed suit under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">AUL and Araceli filed cross motions for summary judgment. Accepting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, the district court found in AUL\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Araceli appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">At issue on appeal is (1) whether ERISA preempts Texas common law governing the rescission of an insurance policy, (2) whether the district court applied the correct standard of review, and (3) whether the district court erred in determining that Salvador made a \u201cmaterial\u201d misrepresentation that allowed AUL to rescind the policy and deny Araceli\u2019s claim. We conclude that federal law applies in this case and that the district court applied the correct standard of review. We further conclude that the district court did not err in concluding that Salvador made a \u201cmaterial\u201d misrepresentation that justified AUL\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">\u201cWe review ERISA preemption of state law claims <em>de novo.\u201d Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. v. Sharpless, </em>364 F.3d 634, 640 (5th Cir.2004). There are two types of ERISA preemption-complete and conflict. <em>Haynes v. Prudential Health Care, </em>313 F.3d 330, 333 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cComplete preemption exists when a <em>remedy </em>falls within the scope of or is in direct conflict with [ERISA], and therefore is within the jurisdiction of federal court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Conflict preemption is applicable in this case. \u201cUnder conflict preemption, ERISA preempts state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Liberty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>Life Assur. Co. of Boston, </em>394 F.3d 262, 275 (5th Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As an exception, however, ERISA\u2019s savings clause allows state laws that regulate insurance, banking, or securities to survive ERISA preemption. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Araceli argues that Texas law should apply in this case. She claims that ERISA does not preempt Texas law governing the rescission of an insurance policy in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kentucky Association of Health Plans, Inc. v. Miller, </em>538 U.S. 329,123 S.Ct. 1471, 155 L.Ed.2d 468 (2003). Thus, she claims this court should overrule its decision in <em>Tingle v. Pacific Mut. Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 105 (5th Cir.1993) <em>(\u201cTingle II </em>\u201d), where we interpreted Louisiana law and held that in a case governed by ERISA, federal common law determined whether an insurer could rescind a health insurance policy on the grounds that an insured misrepresented material facts on his application. <em>Id. </em>at 110. Araceli\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Preemption is typically a defense to a party\u2019s state law claims. <em>Gutierrez v. Flores, </em>543 F.3d 248, 252 n. 5 (5th Cir. 2008). However, preemption does not apply in this case. Specifically, Araceli does not raise preemption as a defense nor does she raise any state law claims. Her only claim is the improper denial of benefits through her right to sue AUL directly under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a) (\u201cA civil action may be brought [by a] beneficiary ... to enforce ... the terms of the plan.\u201d). To the extent that she argues that state law should apply to this court\u2019s evaluation of AUL\u2019s decision to rescind Salvador\u2019s policy, the Supreme Court explained in <em>Howlett v. Rose, </em>496 U.S. 356, 110 S.Ct. 2430, 110 L.Ed.2d 332 (1990), that the \u201celements of, and the defenses to, a federal cause of action are defined by <em>federal law.\u201d Id. </em>at 375, 110 S.Ct. 2430 (emphasis added). Thus, because Araceli raises only federal claims, federal law governs this case and our determination, regarding whether AUL erred in rescinding Salvador\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">We review the district court\u2019s summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u201capplying the same standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>592 F.3d 645, 651 (5th Cir.2009). However, as a threshold matter, we must determine whether the district court applied the correct standard of review. We conclude that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">1. Whether the district court applied the correct standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">If a plan gives the administrator discretion to make claim determinations, the court must apply an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the administrator\u2019s decision. <em>Atteberry v. Memorial-Hermann Healthcare Sys., </em>405 F.3d 344, 347 (5th Cir.2005). The policy in this case demonstrates that AUL possessed the power to determine eligibility benefits for applicants, as well as any benefits owed to beneficiaries. Specifically, the policy states: \u201cENTIRE CONTRACT: This policy, the enrollment forms of the individuals, the application of the Group Policyholder and any amendments made from time to time constitute the entire contract.\u201d Salvador\u2019s beneficiary designation form, an amendment to the policy designating Araceli as Salvador\u2019s beneficiary, states that \u201c[t]he undersigned understands and agrees ... benefits under any policy will be paid only if AUL decides in its discretion the applicant is entitled to them.\u201d Taken together these documents indicate that the policy gives AUL discretion to make claim determinations. Araceli\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Specifically, Araceli notes that the policy states the following regarding amendments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">AMENDMENT and CHANGES: This policy may be amended by mutual agreement between the Group Policyholder and AUL but without prejudice to any valid claim incurred prior to the effective date of the amendment. No change in this policy is valid until approved by the Chief Executive Officer, President or Secretary of AUL. No agent has the authority to change this policy or waive any of its provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The policy also notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">GROUP POLICYHOLDER means the sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, firm, school, school district, or other instrumentality of a state or political subdivision thereof that employs Persons and that is covered under this policy as shown on the Title Page. Any references to Group Policyholder used in this policy shall included Insured Units.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS\">Pursuant to these provisions, Araceli argues, <em>all </em>policy amendments require the mutual agreement of AUL\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, President or Secretary and a representative from Tatum. She claims that the beneficiary designation form is not an amendment because it does not meet these requirements. Araceli\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">To begin, her argument impermissibly ignores the text of the policy, as discussed above and, moreover, ignores the text of the beneficiary designation form. <em>See Sharpless, </em>364 F.3d at 641 (\u201cFederal common law governs rights and obligations stemming from ERISA-regulated plans, including the interpretation of [a policy.] When construing ERISA plan provisions, courts are to give the language of an insurance contract its ordinary and generally accepted meaning if such a meaning exists.\u201d). The beneficiary designation form clearly provides: \u201cIt is understood and agreed upon receipt of this beneficiary designation by AUL at its principal office, such beneficiary designation will become effective.\u201d In other words, the beneficiary designation form explains how it becomes an amendment for purposes of the policy. Moreover, Araceli\u2019s argument, taken to its logical conclusion, would lead to the unduly burdensome and nonsensical requirement that every time an insured changes her named beneficiary this change must not only be approved by a representative from Tatum, but also AUL\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, President or Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Thus, we conclude that the beneficiary designation form is an amendment to the policy and gives AUL discretion to make claim determinations. Therefore, the district court correctly applied the abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Atteberry, </em>405 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">2. Abuse of Discretion Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">To determine whether a plan administrator has abused its discretion, we apply a two-step analysis. <em>Crowell v. Shell Oil Co., </em>541 F.3d 295, 312 (5th Cir.2008). The first step is to determine whether the administrator\u2019s decision was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Pickrom v. Belger Cartage Sen., Inc., </em>57 F.3d 468, 471 (5th Cir. 1995)). To address the question of whether the administrator\u2019s interpretation of the policy was legally correct, we consider three factors: 1) whether the administrator gave the policy a uniform construction; 2) whether the administrator\u2019s interpretation is consistent with a fair reading of the policy; and 3) whether different interpretations of the policy will result in unanticipated costs. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">If the determination was legally correct, our inquiry ends because a legally correct decision precludes any abuse of discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>Stone v. UNOCAL Termination Allowance Plan, </em>570 F.3d 252, 257 (5th Cir. 2009). Conversely, if the administrator\u2019s interpretation was not legally correct, we review the decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Because we determine that the administrator\u2019s interpretation of the plan was legally correct, we do not explore whether the determination was an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We now turn to the merits of the case and analyze whether AUL abused its discretion when it rescinded the policy and denied Araceli\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">As previously noted, to determine whether an administrator\u2019s interpretation of the policy was legally correct, we consider three factors: 1) whether the administrator gave the policy a uniform construction; 2) whether the administrator\u2019s interpretation is consistent with a fair reading of the policy; and 3) whether different interpretations of the policy will result in unanticipated costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Araceli does not argue that AUL did not give a uniform construction to the policy, nor is there evidence in the record to support this conclusion. Specifically, Araceli does not point to any similarly situated individuals whose claims were treated differently from her own. <em>Stone, </em>570 F.3d at 259. To the contrary, as the district court noted, the record indicates that, since 2001, AUL has examined the citizenship status of its insureds and has denied benefits, on multiple occasions, based entirely or in part on AUL\u2019s determination that the insured was not legally living or working in the United States. Furthermore, Araceli does not argue that different interpretations of the policy will result in unanticipated costs, and there is no evidence in the record to support this conclusion. Therefore, we base our decision on whether AUL\u2019s interpretation is consistent with a fair and reasonable reading of the policy. <em>James v. La Laborers Health and Welfare Fund, </em>29 F.3d 1029, 1033 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Stone, </em>570 F.3d at 258 (\u201cThe most important factor in this three-part analysis is whether the administrator\u2019s interpretation was consistent with a fair reading of the plan.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">An administrator\u2019s decision is \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d if the decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Pylant v. Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>497 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as sufficient to support the conclusion. <em>Wade v. Hewlett-Packard Dev. Co., </em>493 F.3d 533, 541 (5th Cir.2007). We conclude that the administrator\u2019s decision was legally correct because a reasonable and fair reading of the policy indicates that Salvador made a material misrepresentation warranting rescission and denial of Araceli\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">As \u201ca general rule ... intentional misrepresentation, by the applicant for an insurance policy, of a material fact, if relied on by the insurer, is ground for rescission of the policy by giving notice that the policy is cancelled.\u201d <em>Apperson v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>318 F.2d 438, 441 (5th Cir. 1963) (citing cases from various circuits, including the Fifth Circuit, and states holding that an intentional misrepresentation cancels an insurance policy); <em>see also Sharpless, </em>364 F.3d at 641 (explaining that, under federal common law, if an insurer wants to rescind a policy, claiming that the insured made a fraudulent misstatement, the insurer must prove that the alleged misstatement was material). It remains undisputed that Salvador provided a false SSN, and Araceli does not argue that Salvador has a valid SSN or that he was legally entitled to be present and work in the United States. Araceli\u2019s primary ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>gument is that Salvador\u2019s providing a false SSN on his application was not a material misrepresentation that could justify AUL\u2019s decision to rescind Salvador\u2019s coverage and deny Araceli\u2019s claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">An insured\u2019s misrepresentation is \u201cmaterial\u201d if the facts that were misrepresented or omitted would have affected the insurance company\u2019s decision to issue the policy. <em>See Sharpless, </em>364 F.3d at 641-42; <em>see also Wiley v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., </em>585 F.3d 206, 210 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201c[A] fact is \u2018material\u2019 only if its resolution would affect the outcome of the action.\u201d). For example, in <em>Sharpless, </em>the insured claimed on her policy application that \u201cshe had never had any known indication of a mental or emotional disorder, had never sought treatment for alcohol use, and had never used barbiturates.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 641. However, it later came to light that she had attempted suicide, had taken barbiturates, and suffered from depression and alcoholism. <em>Id. </em>These statements, we determined, were \u201cmaterial\u201d misstatements because the insurer\u2019s policy guidelines called \u201cfor policy administrators to take into account all relevant information about drug and alcohol use and mental impairments.\u201d <em>Id, </em>As such, the insurance company would not have issued the policy, if the company knew the relevant information. <em>Id. </em>at 641-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Salvador\u2019s misrepresentations were clearly material and of the type that would have prevented AUL from issuing the policy. A SSN is an integral part of the process by which a party\u2019s identity can be verified. <em>See generally Sherman v. U.S. Dept. of the Army, </em>244 F.3d 357, 364-66 (5th Cir.2001) (discussing the significant privacy interest an individual has in her SSN because it could be used to uncover her financial information, as well as other identity-related information). Because Salvador provided a false SSN and inhibited AUL\u2019s ability to verify his identity, he not only placed AUL at risk of severe penalties, but also inhibited AUL\u2019s ability to assess the underwriting risk involved in issuing him the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">To begin, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) maintains the Specially Designated Nationals List (hereinafter the List), which includes the names of individuals designated, for example, as terrorists, drug dealers, and money launderers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Insurance companies are prohibited from engaging in transactions that in any way involve individuals on the List. <em>See, e.g., </em>31 C.F.R. \u00a7 595.204 (2011) (\u201cExcept as otherwise authorized, no U.S. person may deal in property or interests in property of a specially designated terrorist, including the making or receiving of any contribution of funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of a specially designated terrorist.\u201d). Punishment for violations of this law can be substantial. Notably, criminal penalties can reach up to $1,000,000 and 20 years of imprisonment for \u201c[a] person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or willfully conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission\u201d of certain violations. <em>See </em>50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705(c); <em>see also </em>31 C.F.R. \u00a7 595.701(a) (2011) (citing \u00a7 1705). As AUL explained in its denial letter to Araceli, \u201c[t]he misrepresentation respecting [Salvador\u2019s identity] and his ability to work and reside in the U.S. would not permit AUL\u2019s compliance with\u201d federal regulations, regarding the List. Thus, Salvador\u2019s misrepresentation made AUL vulnerable to substantial civil and criminal penalties, such as those enumerated in \u00a7 1705. We conclude that AUL would not have issued the policy if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the company knew that Salvador provided a false SSN, preventing AUL from verifying whether Salvador was on the List.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Additionally, without accurate information about a proposed insured\u2019s identity, an insurance company cannot properly assess the business risk involved in issuing a policy. As AUL noted in its correspondence with Araceli, insurance companies rely on an individual\u2019s identity, including their SSN, to obtain information used to assess the applicant\u2019s potential health risks, the financial and moral fitness of an applicant, and the likelihood that the insured would file a false claim. By relying on the false SSN that Salvador provided, AUL could not properly assess this information to accurately determine whether it would take on the business risk of insuring Salvador. Thus, we further conclude that AUL would not have issued the policy if the company knew that Salvador did not provide a valid SSN and that the company could not accurately verify his identity to assess the possible financial risks posed by insuring him.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Araceli would have this court overlook the fact that Salvador submitted a false SSN and exposed AUL to substantial liability, ostensibly to become employed by Tatum, so that Araceli may benefit from a policy for which Salvador would not otherwise have been eligible. We decline to do so and conclude that AUL was legally correct in determining that Salvador made a \u201cmaterial\u201d misrepresentation that allowed AUL to rescind Salvador\u2019s policy and deny Araceli\u2019s claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">III.
