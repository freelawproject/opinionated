Davis approached Defendant A &amp; E Television Networks with the concept that he maintains became the reality television series \u201cFlip This House.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This dispute arises out of the parties\u2019 disagreement over an alleged oral agreement to split equally net revenues of the show. Plaintiff sued Defendant in state court for breach of that oral contract in 2006, demanding approximately $7.5 million in damages, <em>ie., </em>half of the net revenues from the three seasons that had completed filming prior to trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant successfully removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. After five days of trial in South Carolina federal district court, a jury returned a verdict awarding Plaintiff a little over $4 million, essentially half of the first season\u2019s net revenues. The district court subsequently denied Defendant\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 59, respectively. Defendant argues we should reverse and direct judgment in its favor because the evidence was legally insufficient to support a finding of an oral contract under New York law or, alternatively, order a new trial because of claimed errors in jury instructions and evidentiary rulings. We exercise our appellate jurisdiction provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. After careful review of the record submitted on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion for a judgment as a matter of law de novo. <em>Sloas v. CSX Transp. Inc., </em>616 F.3d 380, 392 (4th Cir.2010). In conducting that review, we ask \u201c \u2018whether there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, to find for that party. If reasonable minds could differ about the verdict, we are obliged to affirm.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. McMillan, </em>594 F.3d 301, 312 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>ABT Bldg. Prods. Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>472 F.3d 99, 113 (4th Cir.2006)) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1) (providing a court may grant a party judgment as a matter of law if \u201ca reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for\u201d the nonmoving party). We review the entire record, \u201cdisregard[ing] all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 151, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">Given that standard of review, we have gleaned and so present the following facts necessary to explain our holding. Plaintiff is a South Carolina real estate broker who buys underpriced properties to renovate and sell, engaging in a process we are told is commonly known as \u201cflipping.\u201d In 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Plaintiff conceived of the idea of a television show to document the flipping process and later developed a pilot episode of the show. In 2004, Plaintiff submitted the pilot to multiple television networks, including Defendant. Defendant\u2019s vice president directed him to deal with Charles Nordlander, director of lifestyle programming for Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">After Nordlander viewed the pilot, the two spoke over the phone for a little less than an hour on June 3, 2004 about turning the show into a series. Essentially, Plaintiff proposed that he would assume all of the financial risk relating to the purchase and resale of the real estate but that they would otherwise equally split the net revenues of the television show. In response to Plaintiffs offer, Plaintiff maintains Nordlander said \u201cOkay, okay, I get it.\u201d Thus, Plaintiff argues that by the end of this June 3 telephone conversation he and Defendant, via Nordlander, had entered into an oral contract to produce a television series based on Plaintiffs pilot and to share all resulting net revenues equally, subject to approval by Defendant\u2019s board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Plaintiff testified that Nordlander arranged a conference call shortly thereafter during which Plaintiff confirmed the terms of the contract with three other representatives of Defendant. Nordlander also arranged a meeting in New York on June 14 between a production company, Departure Films, and Plaintiff. With Departure Films on board, filming for the pilot began in August 2004. In March 2005, Defendant\u2019s Senior Vice President e-mailed Plaintiff that \u201c[t]he board approved the money for our series.\u201d Plaintiff and Departure Films then began filming season one.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The parties never reduced any oral agreement to writing. Nonetheless, they filmed thirteen episodes of \u201cFlip this House.\u201d By all accounts, the show was a commercial success. But, as must be the case since the parties came knocking on the Court\u2019s door, their business relationship fell apart in 2006. The parties could not resolve the matter of Plaintiffs compensation. Defendant offered to pay Plaintiff an appearance fee per episode and a five percent share of incremental revenue attributable to the show. Plaintiff rejected that offer and signed a talent agreement with another television network. Defendant went on to produce three more seasons of \u201cFlip this House\u201d without Plaintiffs participation. Defendant never paid Plaintiff any money, let alone half of the series\u2019 net revenue, for his role in its production. At trial, Defendant denied ever entering into any contract with Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">We start by setting forth the principles of contract law relevant to Defendant\u2019s claim that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \u201c[Bjecause the matter is before us in diversity, we are bound by the applicable state substantive law.\u201d <em>Benner v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>93 F.3d 1228, 1234 (4th Cir.1996). And, because neither party contests the district court\u2019s ruling that New York law controls, we apply the laws of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Absent prohibition by the statute of frauds, oral contracts are just as binding as written contracts under New York law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Stein v. Gelfand, </em>476 F.Supp.2d 427, 431 (S.D.N.Y.2007). To establish Defendant breached their oral contract, Plaintiff must, of course, first prove that they formed such a contract. <em>Cleveland Wreck</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>ing Co. v. Hercules Constr. Corp., </em>23 F.Supp.2d 287, 292 (E.D.N.Y.1998). \u201c \u2018To form a valid contract under New York law, there must be an offer, acceptance, consideration, mutual assent and intent to be bound.\u2019 \u201d <em>Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc., </em>356 F.3d 393, 427 (2d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Louros v. Cyr, </em>175 F.Supp.2d 497, 512 n. 5 (S.D.N.Y.2001)). \u201c \u2018[M]utual assent is essential to the formation of a contract and a party cannot be held to have contracted if there was no assent or acceptance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Maffea v. Ippolito, </em>247 A.D.2d 366, 668 N.Y.S.2d 653, 654 (N.Y.App.Div. 1998)). \u201cThere must, in other words, be \u2018an objective meeting of the minds sufficient to give rise to a binding and enforceable contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Int\u2019l Bus. Mach. Corp. v. Johnson, </em>629 F.Supp.2d 321, 330 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (quoting <em>Tractebel Energy Mktg., Inc. v. AEP Power Mktg., Inc., </em>487 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir.2007)), <em>aff'd, </em>355 Fed.Appx. 454 (2d Cir.2009). The same is true whether the parties formed the contract orally or with the written word. However, where an alleged contract is oral, the party asserting its enforceability bears an even heavier burden of proving more than agreement on or acceptance of all material terms, but also overall agreement to be bound by the oral agreement without a writing. When the alleged contract is oral, \u201c[mjore is needed than agreement on each detail [to create a binding obligation. There must be] overall agreement ... to enter into the binding contract.\u201d <em>N.F.L. Ins. Ltd. by Lines v. B &amp; B Holdings, Inc., </em>874 F.Supp. 606, 613 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (addition in original) (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also Shaftel v. Dadras, </em>39 F.Supp.2d 217, 226 (E.D.N.Y.1999) (detailing the four-factor test New York law employs to discern whether parties intended to be bound by their oral agreement without a writing), <em>aff'd </em>78 Fed.Appx. 169 (2d Cir.2003).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u201cGenerally, courts look to the basic elements of the offer and the acceptance to determine whether there is an objective meeting of the minds sufficient to give rise to a binding and enforceable contract.\u201d <em>Express Indus., </em>693 N.Y.S.2d 857, 715 N.E.2d at 1053. \u201cThe first step\u201d in that analysis requires a court \u201cto determine whether there is a sufficiently definite offer such that its unequivocal acceptance will give rise to an enforceable contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, even assuming Plaintiffs offer was sufficiently definite, Defendant maintains Plaintiffs assertion of its acceptance of his offer was not. We therefore move to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>next step in the mutual assent analysis: acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">As long as the offer does not dictate otherwise, \u201coral acceptance of an offer is valid.\u201d 22 N.Y. Jur.2d Contracts \u00a7 45. Parties may also manifest the \u201c\u2018assent necessary to form a contract ... by ... act, or conduct which <em>evinces the intention of the parties to contract.\u2019 \u201d Register.com, </em>356 F.3d at 427 (quoting <em>Majfea, </em>668 N.Y.S.2d at 654). Plaintiff accordingly asked the district court to instruct the jury that \u201ca contract is an obligation which arises from actual agreement of the parties, manifested by words, oral or written, or by conduct.\u201d Supp. J.A. at 2. The district court, however, refused to give that instruction, concluding the trial had revealed no \u201cconduct ... that could be interpreted as constituting an acceptance by the [Djefendant of any offer made by [Plaintiff] so as to make a contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. Instead, the court instructed the jury that \u201c[a] contract is an obligation which arises from actual agreement of the parties, manifested by words, oral or written.\u201d J.A. at 559-60. On appeal, Plaintiff neither challenges the district court\u2019s ruling and subsequent instruction nor contends that Defendant accepted his offer by conduct. To the contrary, Plaintiff contends \u201cNor[d]lander agreed to the terms [of his offer], saying, \u2018Okay, okay, I get it.\u2019\u201d Aple. Resp. Br. at 6 (quoting J.A. at 258); <em>see also id. </em>at 19 (\u201c[Plaintiff] specifically testified that Nor[d]lander agreed to the terms, saying, \u2018Okay, okay, I get it.\u2019\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because Plaintiff has evidently abandoned his claim that Defendant accepted his offer by virtue of its conduct, we must decide only whether a reasonable jury could conclude from the trial evidence that Defendant accepted Plaintiffs offer through oral or written words. <em>See King, </em>594 F.3d at 312 (explaining the standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 50 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Generally, \u201cin order for an acceptance to be effective, it must comply with the terms of the offer and be clear, unambiguous and unequivocal.\u201d <em>King v. King, </em>208 A.D.2d 1143, 617 N.Y.S.2d 593, 594 (N.Y.App.Div. 1994); <em>see also 2 </em>Williston on Contracts \u00a7 6:10 (4th ed. 2007) (\u201cAs a general principle, at common law an acceptance, in order to be effective, must be positive and unambiguous.\u201d). When an offeree communicates \u201can acceptance [that] is ambiguous or equivocal \u2014 that is, an acceptance that a reasonable person could view as assent, rejection, or an invitation to bargain further ... it is the offeror\u2019s reaction to that ambiguous acceptance that controls whether the parties have entered into a contract.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>629 F.Supp.2d at 330.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABI\">[B]y their nature, equivocal responses are capable of being understood either as the offeree apparently intends them ... or as the offeror might apparently understand them.... To the extent that either interpretation is plausible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the offeree can hardly complain if the offeror understands the communication as the offeree apparently intended; and the offeror who reasonably treats an equivocal response as an acceptance may hold the offeree to a contract. This rule ... operates to protect the offeror who acts reasonably in relation to what it supposes is intended to operate as an acceptance, yet provides the offeror with significant flexibility as the master of the offer. <em>In short, how the offeror treats the offeree\u2019s language will, assuming that treating the language either as language of acceptance or treating it as language requiring further discussion is reasonable, determine the language\u2019s effect.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 330-31 (quoting 2 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 6:10 (4th ed. 2004)). So long as the offeror\u2019s interpretation of the offeree\u2019s equivocal acceptance is plausible or reasonable, New York courts will find a contract has been formed. \u201cIn other words, where an offeree communicates an ambiguous acceptance, the offeree must assume the risk of the offeror\u2019s misinterpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">As Judge Learned Hand once explained: \u201c \u2018A contract has, strictly speaking, nothing to do with the personal or individual intent of the parties. A contract is an obligation attached by mere force of law to certain acts of the parties, usually words, which ordinarily accompany and represent a known intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>S.S.I. Investors Ltd. v. Korea Tungsten Min. Co., Ltd., </em>80 A.D.2d 155, 438 N.Y.S.2d 96, 100 (NY.App.Div. 1981) (quoting <em>Hotchkiss v. Nat\u2019l City Bank, </em>200 F. 287, 293 (S.D.N.Y.1911)), <em>aff'd </em>by 55 N.Y.2d 934, 449 N.Y.S.2d 173, 434 N.E.2d 242 (N.Y.1982). Therefore, ours is an objective inquiry. We do not care about the \u201cparties\u2019 after-the fact professed subjective intent.\u201d <em>Cleveland Wrecking, </em>23 F.Supp.2d at 292 (internal quotations omitted). Rather, in deciding whether parties have reached an agreement, we must look to the parties\u2019:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">[Objective intent as manifested by their expressed words and deeds at the time.... In determining whether the parties entered into a contractual agreement and what were its terms, \u201cdisproportionate emphasis is not to be put on any single act, phrase or other expression, but, instead, on the totality of all of these, given the attendant circumstances, the situation of the parties, and the objectives they were striving to attain. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Reprosystem, B.V. v. SCM Corp., 522 </em>F.Supp. 1257, 1275 (S.D.N.Y. 1981)). Therefore, \u201c[wjhether an acceptance is ambiguous or equivocal ... depends not on the subjective, undisclosed intent of the offeree, but rather on the offeree\u2019s words and actions as viewed from the perspective of a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>629 F.Supp.2d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Finally, we must also note that \u201c \u2018[wjhile the existence of a contract is a question of fact, the question of whether a certain or undisputed state of facts establishes a contract is one of law for the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gui\u2019s Lumber &amp; Home Ctr., Inc. v. Mader Constr. Co., Inc., </em>13 A.D.3d 1096, 787 N.Y.S.2d 555, 556 (N.Y.App.Div.2004) (quoting <em>Cortland Asbestos Prods, v. J. &amp; K. Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., </em>33 A.D.2d 11, 304 N.Y.S.2d 694, 696 (N.Y.App.Div.1969)). More specifically, \u201cquestions as to what the parties said, what they intended, and how a statement by one party was understood by the other are questions of fact; however, the matter of whether or not there was a contract, in light of the factual findings on these questions, is an issue of law.\u201d <em>Ronan Assocs. v. Local 94-94A-94B, </em>24 F.3d 447, 449 (2d Cir.1994) (citing <em>Four Seasons Hotels, Ltd. v. Vinnik, </em>127 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>A.D.2d 310, 515 N.Y.S.2d 1, 6 (N.Y.App. Div.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Defendant argued in its Rule 50(b) motion before the district court that Plaintiff had failed to provide any evidence of Defendant\u2019s assent. The district court did not see it that way, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">[I]n [Plaintiffs] testimony he says clearly and unequivocally that Mr. Nordlander accepted those terms, and that he reached an oral contract with the [Defendant which incorporated those terms that he has stated. He was asked, \u201c... did Charles Nordlander ever say to you, did he in plain English say, yes, sir, I agree [Defendant] will share 50 percent of its profits? Answer: Absolutely he did. Absolutely.\u201d There are statements like that throughout the record, where he said he told Mr. Nordlander what he wanted.... I think that testimony where he says he made the proposal to [Defendant, and Mr. Nordlander accepted it and agreed to it absolutely, indicates that the parties did have a meeting of the minds, they did reach a contract, as stated from the portions of the record I just quoted, and that [Defendant breached that contract, because they did not pay to [P]laintiff the compensation therefore that they agreed to pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aod\">J.A. at 526-28 (quoting J.A. at 253-54).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">On appeal, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs testimony that the district court relied upon (quoted above) constitutes conclusory assertions as to the legal meaning, or his own subjective interpretation, of Nordlander\u2019s statements during the June 3 phone call. As a result, Defendant asserts such testimony cannot be relied upon to determine what it is Nordlander actually said and whether any such statement objectively constitutes assent to Plaintiffs offer. Despite Plaintiffs repeated declaration that he and Nordlander had an agreement, Defendant claims that the only specific words of acceptance Plaintiff at trial ever attributed to Nordlander were \u201cOkay, okay, I get it.\u201d Defendant contends that statement does not constitute unambiguous acceptance because it conveys at most that Nordlander understood the terms of the offer, not that he accepted the offer on behalf of Defendant. So, Defendant maintains a contract was never formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Context matters \u2014 a saying as old as time because it is true. Because we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, we start with Plaintiffs evidence of the context of the June 3 phone conversation. According to Plaintiffs testimony, he and Nordlander discussed the pilot and making it into a series:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">A: And then [Nordlander] said, \u201cAll right, Richard,\u201d basically you know, \u201cCan you do this again?\u201d.... And I said, \u201cCharles it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d And he said, \u201cHow much do you have in it?\u201d And I went through the same thing again. \u201cI\u2019ve got 85,000 in it.\u201d.... His job is \u2014 I assumed was to acquire the show, because he said, \u201cHow much do you want?\u201d And I said, \u201cCharles, this is not for sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">A. And at one point, we started talking numbers, and he was talking about what \u2014 you know, how much did that house go for, how much did I spend, and at the time I remember projecting \u2014 his concern was that to make sure that that partnership was fair, and he was saying, \u201cHow much do you think you are going to spend?\u201d And the rough numbers that I remember was basically you know, they are going to have about $2 million in it, and that, you know, they want to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>make sure that I didn\u2019t, you know, come in on the light end.... But, you know, my rough estimate was that I was going to spend about $4 million....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 147,156-57. The two agreed Defendant would hire a New-York based, third-party production company to film future episodes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">A: And [Nordlander] said, ... \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time getting these guys to let you \u2014 we like to have production companies that are right here that are real close that are in New York.... I\u2019ve got a company \u2014 there is two or three companies I want you to talk to. These guys are working on something for me right now. They are editors from HBO, and that\u2019s what they do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">So anyway, we started talking about how we were going to engage a third-party production company, and you know, threw out, like I said, a couple of names, and he wanted me to meet these guys and talk with them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 148, 150. They discussed the series\u2019 revenues. Plaintiff stated his belief that he thought the show would be profitable, but Nordlander disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">A: But in this situation, it was, \u201cCharles, it\u2019s not for sale. I own this thing. I have been \u2014 you know, I was told by somebody that this thing could make money.\u201d And Charles said, \u201cRichard, don\u2019t take this the wrong way. Y\u2019all did a really good show, but these kind of shows ... don\u2019t make money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 149. Nordlander also explained that Defendant would not accept any risk of the real estate aspect of the series.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">Q. Did you reach agreement concerning the real estate, the risk associated with acquiring and refurbishing real estate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">A. Absolutely. It was very firm from him that I was 100 percent on my own on that, that A <em>&amp; </em>E would not have any of the risk, any liability. It wouldn\u2019t be on deeds. It had nothing to do with that. It was clearly, totally separate, and they did not want any of the liability, any financial obligation of the risk with that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 156. \u201c[Plaintiff] assured Nor[d]lander that [Defendant] would bear none of the financial risk (or reward) relating to the purchase and resale of the real estate.\u201d Aple.

Well, he went through a couple of different things. He talked about shows not making money....

Charles, look, I\u2019m a real estate guy.... [I]f I\u2019m brokering the deal, I take a commission.... I used an example, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>bought a hotel years ago in Mount Pleasant. I bought it out at a foreclosure sale, and I bought it for $2.1 million. ... So I called this gentleman up....

The next day, I went and bid on the property. I got it. I needed my five percent. He wired it down.... And so he had obligated, he was committed, fully ready, willing and able to send me down 2.1 million. I ended up not even having to take it. We took our piece of paper and we sold our position to Red Roof Inn.... I said, \u201cWe took that, we took the profits, we paid our expenses.\u201d We had ... seven or eight checks that we paid expenses first, and then we took what was left over and we chopped it in half, and he got his check and I got mine.

It \u2014 to this day, absolutely, yes, sir. J.A. at 253-59 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-35\">Plaintiff testified over and over again in unequivocal terms as to his interpretation or characterization of his June 3 phone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>conversation with Nordlander. He repeatedly declared they \u201cabsolutely\u201d had a deal. Consequently, we accept, as we must, that Plaintiff subjectively believed by the end of his June 3 phone conversation with Nordlander he had a deal with Defendant to make a television show and to split the revenues equally. But, our review of the record makes clear that Plaintiff was only able to specify one statement of acceptance by Nordlander: \u201cOkay, okay, I get it.\u201d We take Plaintiffs word for it, as we must, that Nordlander said \u201cOkay, okay, I get it.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We can safely say that statement does not objectively convey unambiguous and unequivocal acceptance of Plaintiffs offer. We cannot say, however, that such a statement made in a certain tone of voice or in a given context could not plausibly mean \u201cI accept.\u201d As we explained, if Plaintiff reasonably or plausibly understood Nordlander\u2019s equivocal statement as an acceptance, then a contract was formed. Therefore, we must decide whether Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that a reasonable person would have interpreted Nordlander\u2019s statement as an acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Plaintiffs testimony reveals that he and Nordlander extensively negotiated, discussing production costs, production crew, production credits, real estate risk, raising revenue, and splitting revenue, among other things. Nordlander stated his deal-breaker \u2014 bearing any risk for the real estate \u2014 and the one condition on going forward with production of the series \u2014 board approval. And, Plaintiff stated his deal-breaker \u2014 splitting all revenue equally\u2014 numerous times in various ways, even illustrating this term of his offer with a lengthy recounting of a prior deal. To this, Plaintiff testified Nordlander said \u201cOkay, okay, I get it.\u201d He also testified Nordlander said their making the television series was contingent on board approval. Tellingly, accordingly to Plaintiff, Nordlander did not indicate their deal was contingent on anything else or give any indication that Defendant would not accept a fifty-fifty split of revenue, only that such a split would likely not be a beneficial arrangement for Plaintiff. Furthermore, no evidence suggests Nordlander explained that the board would only approve the series and the money to produce the series without approving the agreement to split net profits equally. And, Defendant eventually notified Plaintiff that \u201c[t]he board approved the money for our series.\u201d J.A. at 625. Though the board approved the making of the show, it seems undisputed that the board neither considered nor approved any revenue sharing agreement. Nothing in the record suggests that any of Defendant\u2019s representatives conveyed to Plaintiff that the board approved \u201cmoney for our series,\u201d but did not approve a fifty-fifty agreement. From this evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude a reasonable person in Plaintiffs position after such extensive bargaining could plausibly interpret \u201cOkay, okay I get it,\u201d in conjunction with the statement that the only condition is board approval, as acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In addition, there is sufficient, though not unequivocal, evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff objectively treated Nordlander\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>ment as an acceptance of his offer to make a television series and split the revenues equally. Plaintiff allowed himself and his company to be the subject of thirteen television shows made by Defendant. Plaintiff testified that he worked hard to obtain sponsors and advertisers for the show. J.A. at 181. He also coordinated with Defendant on using certain products in the course of business to take advantage of product placement opportunities, thereby increasing the show\u2019s revenue. <em>Id. </em>at 182-86. In an e-mail to one of Defendant\u2019s representatives, Plaintiff expressed his frustration in not having been presented with a written agreement that reflected his conversation with Nordlander: \u201cI was asked up front how much I wanted for the show and I told Charles then \u2018I don\u2019t want to sell, I want to partner and share the risk and return\u2019 because I knew this would be a hit.... I envisioned a partnership, it feels more like indentured servant at this point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706. He said in an e-mail to a representative of the third party production company \u201cCharles isn\u2019t [employed by Defendant] anymore but that doesn\u2019t change the deal he and I cut prior to me even meeting you guys.... If you guys are participating with advertising, sponsorship, dvd sales, ectm [sic] without us, that was not what I was promised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 698. In addition, Plaintiff testified he attempted to get a written confirmation of his agreement with Nordlander from one of Defendant\u2019s representatives. During one of those discussions he reiterated that his \u201cdeal was 50/50.\u201d J.A. at 218. The representative\u2019s notes from that discussion reflect Plaintiff told her of his expectation of a fifty-fifty split. J.A. at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Naturally, Defendant points to other statements by Plaintiff that it claims are inconsistent with his claim to have made a revenue-sharing agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We acknowledge that is a plausible, reasonable interpretation of those communications. But, Plaintiff also proffers another reasonable interpretation. Plaintiff testified those statements referred to the \u201cproduction and talent\u201d aspect of his role in the series, which was separate from his agreement to share revenues. Plaintiff additionally argues that the jury could also have believed he and Defendant were renegotiating their agreement for season two. That would seem to have been the case, given that the jury awarded Plaintiff half of only the first season\u2019s profits. And, as Plaintiff correctly notes, the jury was entitled to reject some portions of his testimony, while accepting other portions. <em>See In re Dana Corp., </em>574 F.3d 129, 152 (2d Cir.2009) (\u201cBut a jury is free to believe part and disbelieve part of any witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d). Moreover, we \u201cmust disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.\u201d <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097. None of the evidence Defendant has pointed to requires our belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Even if Plaintiff and Nordlander agreed orally, Defendant argues the agreement is unenforceable for indefiniteness because Plaintiff and Nordlander did not discuss let alone agree on the following \u201cmaterial\u201d terms: (1) the categories of revenue that would be included in \u201cnet revenue,\u201d (2) the categories of expenses that would be deducted from \u201cnet revenue,\u201d (3) the duration of the agreement, (4) the grounds for termination, or (5) the identities of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u201cUnder New York law, no contract exists, nor may one be implied, where parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>do not agree to its material terms.\u201d <em>Cleveland Wrecking, </em>23 F.Supp.2d at 292 (internal quotations omitted). Courts do not relish refusing to enforce agreements for indefiniteness; but:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">[I]f the terms of the agreement are so vague and indefinite that there is no basis or standard for deciding whether the agreement had been kept or broken, or to fashion a remedy, and no means by which such terms may be made certain, then there is no enforceable contract. Moreover, there [can be] no contract if the parties [have] failfed] to agree on all essential terms, and if the missing terms cannot be supplied through reasonable construction that is consistent with the parties\u2019 intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\"><em>Best Brands Beverage, Inc. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>842 F.2d 578, 588 (2d Cir. 1987) (applying New York law) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Nonetheless, \u201c[s]triking down a contract as indefinite and in essence meaningless \u2018is at best a last resort.\u2019\u201d <em>166 Mamaroneck Ave. Corp. v. 151 E. Post Rd. Corp., </em>78 N.Y.2d 88, 91, 571 N.Y.S.2d 686, 575 N.E.2d 104 (1991) (quoting <em>Cohen &amp; Sons v. M. Lurie Woolen Co., </em>232 N.Y. 112, 114, 133 N.E. 370 (1921)). The Court of Appeals of New York has warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">Contracting parties are often imprecise in their use of language, which is, after all, fluid and often susceptible to different and equally plausible interpretations. Imperfect expression does not necessarily indicate that the parties to an agreement did not intend to form a binding contract. A strict application of the definiteness doctrine could actually defeat the underlying expectations of the contracting parties. Thus, where it is clear from the language of an agreement that the parties intended to be bound and there exists an objective method for supplying a missing term, the court should endeavor to hold the parties to their bargain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">As to the categories of revenue and expenses, the district court explained the parties\u2019 agreement was simple and clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOs\">[Plaintiff] didn\u2019t want to sell the show, he wasn\u2019t going to sell the show, he was responsible for the real estate, he\u2019d put the people there to produce the show, he paid his expenses, [Defendant] paid [its] expenses, they deduct those expenses, and then split the profits fifty-fifty. If he said that from the stand, he said it 25 times. As far as expenses are concerned, I mean, he bought 44 tickets ... to the World Series. And [Defendant] rejected those, because .... [t]hey were not related to the project. So I think it\u2019s easy to assume, and I think the parties dealt with this assumption, that the expenses were to be those reasonably incurred in connection with the production of the show. And that\u2019s how they acted. So the fact that they didn\u2019t have some formula, that [Plaintiff] didn\u2019t propose some formula in his proposal to [Defendant] for arriving at expenses is unimportant. I think it\u2019s clear that those expenses can be computed without any difficulty. And it can be determined which are reasonably related to the production, and therefore, deducted before the profits are split.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">J.A. at 524-25. Plaintiff also testified all revenue generated by the airing of the show would be included in the contract\u2019s \u201crevenues.\u201d He explained that their agreement did not differentiate revenue from advertising during the show by companies that had previously done business with or already bought advertising from Defendant from other forms of revenue generated by the show. J.A. at 266-68. All can reasonably mean all, without having to list every item included in all. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>therefore conclude sufficient evidence exists from which a reasonable jury could find that the parties reached an agreement with sufficiently clear definitions of expenses, revenue, and \u201cnet profits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Contrary to Defendant\u2019s assertion, Plaintiff testified that he and Nordlander discussed the duration and termination of their enterprise. Plaintiff testified he and Nordlander agreed in their June 3 phone conversation that the series was subject to renewal each year based upon the ratings the series received and could have been canceled at any point by Defendant, though Plaintiff admittedly hoped the show would continue indefinitely. <em>Id. </em>at 263-64. Aside from deciding not to renew the series at the end of each season based on its ratings, Plaintiff concedes he and Nordlander did not discuss the exact circumstances under which either party could cancel the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 262. Nonetheless, Plaintiff testified they agreed Defendant could cancel the show at any time. <em>Id,, </em>at 264. From this evidence, a jury could reasonably conclude the parties agreed the series would continue as long as it was successful, <em>i.e., </em>received ratings, Plaintiff promised to continue as long as Defendant did not terminate the show, and Defendant possessed the right to terminate at will. Plaintiff also contends that if Defendant could terminate at will, it is objectively reasonable to assume so could he, of course, subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Either understanding is reasonable, sufficiently definite, and consistent with the parties\u2019 ultimately actualized intent to make a reality television series together. Therefore, Plaintiff presented sufficient evidence upon which a jury could conclude the parties agreed upon duration and termination of their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">As to the identity of the parties to the contract, Defendant does not actually make an argument other than to declare in a single sentence the contract was fatally indefinite as to who the parties were. <em>Wahi v. Charleston Area Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>562 F.3d 599, 607 (4th Cir.2009) (explaining that a party\u2019s single declarative sentence, without citations to authorities or the record, is insufficient to raise an argument on appeal). Regardless, sufficient evidence exists from which a jury could conclude Defendant knew who Plaintiff was and that Plaintiffs real estate flipping business organization was called Trademark Properties. <em>See </em>J.A. at 590 (Nordlander explaining that Plaintiff made clear to him that Plaintiff wanted to take his real estate company, Trademark, national). Defendant provides no argument or authority as to why it is material to the oral contract whether Nordlander agreed on behalf of Defendant to do business with Plaintiff or Trademark or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Defendant contends that New York law holds that contracts that are sufficiently novel and complex must be in writing to be enforceable and that this agreement is one such contract. In addition, Defendant maintains that Plaintiffs repeatedly-asserted expectation that their agreement be reduced to writing proves that the pax-ties only intended to be bound by a writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Defendant\u2019s statement of New York law is not entirely corx-ect. We can find no case, nor has Defendant cited one, in which a New York court declax-ed that as a matter of law a contract was so novel and complex that it had to have been in writing to be enforced. Instead, under New York law whether an ox-al agreement in the absence of a writing is binding depends on the parties\u2019 objectively-manifested intent. <em>Winston v. Mediafare Entm\u2019t Corp., 777 </em>F.2d 78, 80 (2d Cir. 1985). And, the sole case Defendant cites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>on this point makes clear that to discern that intent, we consider a number of factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">(1) whether a party has made an \u201cexplicit statement that it reserves the right to be bound only when a written agreement is signed,\u201d (2) \u201cwhether one party has partially performed,\u201d (3) \u201cwhether there was literally nothing left to negotiate or settle, so that all that remained to be done was to sign what had already been fully agreed to,\u201d and (4) <em>\u201cwhether the agreement concerns those complex and substantial business matters where requirements that contracts be in writing are the norm rather than the exception.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\"><em>Braun v. CMGI, Inc., </em>64 Fed.Appx. 301, 303 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>R.G. Group, </em>751 F.2d at 75-76 (applying New York law)) (emphasis added). \u201cNo single factor is decisive, but each provides significant guidance.\u201d <em>R.G. Group, </em>751 F.2d at 75. Therefore, contrary to Defendant\u2019s assertion, \u201cwhether the agreement concerns those complex and substantial business matters where requirements that contracts be in writing are the norm\u201d is just one factor the fact-finder considers in deciding whether the parties intended to be bound without a written document. <em>Id. </em>at 76; <em>see also Consarc Corp. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A., </em>996 F.2d 568, 576 (2d Cir. 1993) (explaining that these factors guide the fact-finder\u2019s determination of the parties\u2019 intention to be bound without a writing).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">First, Defendant contends because the alleged contract in this case \u201cinvolved potentially millions of dollars, was a sharp departure from [its own] and industry practice ... and by [Plaintiffs] own account could run for decades .... [a] writing therefore was legally necessary to bind the parties.\u201d Aplt. Op. Br. at 42. We agree that the contract involved a \u201csubstantial business matter\u201d and it may well not have been Defendant\u2019s typical practice to split revenues. But we also note a reasonable jury could find that the contract at issue was not so complex. Hiring a third-party production company, adding all revenue, subtracting all reasonable expenses, splitting the remainder in two, and renewing each year depending on the show\u2019s ratings are easy enough concepts to understand. The jury could have also considered Defendant\u2019s demonstrated willingness to produce, pay for, and air a television series \u2014 a substantial business matter even without any agreement to share revenue \u2014 without a written contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Second, Defendant argues \u201c[t]he evidence that the parties intended and attempted to reach a written agreement strongly confirms that the purported oral agreement was unenforceable\u201d without a writing. Aplt. Op. Br. at 43. Again, Defendant cannot escape the fact that by its own admission it undertook to develop and air a television series featuring Plaintiff without a written contract. It is not such a far leap from that fact to infer that Defendant and Plaintiff also intended to be bound by their oral agreement as to how to compensate Plaintiff without a written contract. There is also no evidence that Nordlander or any other of Defendant\u2019s representatives ever stated Defendant would not be obligated to Plaintiff without a formally executed document. Furthermore, we agree with the district court that the jury could have reasonably concluded from the trial testimony that Plaintiff \u201cthought he had an oral contract, but expected a written contract.... [M]ost people feel more comfortable with a written contract than with an oral contract. And I think that based upon his testimony, which the jury could have believed, he was promised a written contract by Mr. Nordlander, and he thought he was going to get one.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>J.A. at 525. That a party wants an oral contract reduced to writing does not necessarily mean the parties did not intend to be bound until such reduction; it may just reveal that the party wants to avoid a \u201che said, she said\u201d argument down the road as to what the parties orally agreed. <em>See Winston, 777 </em>F.2d at 80 (\u201cThis freedom to contract orally remains even if the parties contemplate a writing to evidence their agreement. In such a case, the mere intention to commit the agreement to writing will not prevent contract formation prior to execution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Defendant claims that two releases Plaintiff signed entitle it to judgment as a matter of law because the language of these releases protects it from Plaintiffs breach of contract claim. \u201cThe meaning and scope of a release must be determined within the context of the controversy being settled, and a general release cannot be construed to cover matters which the parties did not desire or intend to dispose of,\u201d <em>In re Brown, </em>65 A.D.3d 1140, 885 N.Y.S.2d 222, 223 (2009) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Plaintiff signed two releases after the June 3 phone conversation, but before he filed suit. The \u201cStandard Location Release\u201d grants Departure (the production company that filmed and edited the episodes) and its assigns the right to \u201crecord as desired the premises located at Trademark Properties\u201d and to \u201cexhibit, display and transmit ... all or any portion of the Footage\u201d and indemnifies Departure and its assigns \u201cfrom and against all claims, losses, costs, expenses, settlements, demands, and liabilities of every kind ... arising out of or incurred by reason of use of the Footage in accordance herewith or the inaccuracy, alleged breach or actual breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement ... made herein.\u201d J.A. at 690. The \u201cStandard Personal Release\u201d grants Departure and its assigns \u201cthe irrevocable right and license to use [Plaintiffs] name and biographical material concerning [Plaintiff], and the right to exhibit, distribute, transmit, display ... edit, alter and modify any video tape ... made by ... Departure Films ... of [Plaintiffs] likeness ... made by [Departure] ... without additional compensation to [Plaintiff]\u201d and releases Departure and its assigns from \u201call claims ... arising out of the production, exhibition, distribution, promotion and/or advertising of \u2018untitled project\u2019 ... including without limitation, any claim for defamation, slander or invasion of privacy.\u201d J.A. at 691. It is undisputed that Departure subsequently assigned all of its rights to Defendant. These documents only release Defendant from any claims Plaintiff might have arising from the display of the footage of Trademark\u2019s premises (the Location Release) and the \u201cproduction, exhibition, distribution, promotion and/or advertising\u201d of the show (the Personal Release). Thus, the releases do not immunize Defendant from liability for breach of the parties\u2019 contract to share revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Now, we turn to Defendant\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s incorrect jury instructions and evidentiary rulings entitle it to a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial and its rulings on the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>See Figg v. Schroeder, </em>312 F.3d 625, 641 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201cWe review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial ... under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59.\u201d); <em>Schultz v. Capital Intern. Sec., Inc., </em>466 F.3d 298, 310 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.\u201d). \u201cA trial court\u2019s exercise of such discretion is entitled to substantial deference, and will be upheld so long as it is not arbitrary or irrational.\u201d <em>United States v. Myers, </em>589 F.3d 117, 123 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotations and citations omitted). But, \u201c[ujnless justice requires otherwise, no error in admitting or excluding evidence ... is ground for granting a new trial.... At every stage of the proceeding, the court must disregard all errors and defects that do not affect any party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. We only grant a new trial when we can say \u201c \u2018with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was ... substantially swayed by the error, [therefore] it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bank of Montreal v. Signet Bank, </em>193 F.3d 818, 834 (4th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Defendant claims the district court should have admitted Paragraph 11 of Plaintiffs complaint, pursuant to Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A) and 801(d)(2)(A). According to Defendant, Paragraph 11 states Plaintiff made the alleged oral agreement in an in-person meeting with Nordlander and another representative of Defendant, witnessed by a representative of Departure Films. Defendant maintains Paragraph 11 is inconsistent with Plaintiffs testimony that the contract was formed during his June 3 phone conversation with Nordlander and therefore \u201ckey evidence that discredited\u201d Plaintiffs account. Aplt. Op. Br. at 51. Plaintiff objected to its admission. The district court ruled it inadmissible because it was not clearly adopted by Plaintiff and not clearly inconsistent with his trial testimony. J.A. 307-OS.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Even if the district court erred in deciding the complaint did not satisfy the requisites for admissibility, we conclude the error was harmless. Defendant impeached Plaintiff on the same point through the introduction of Plaintiffs answer to Interrogatory Number 9 and his deposition testimony. Defendant asked Plaintiff at trial about his answer to Interrogatory 9 in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">The agreement was reached and discussed between Charles Nor[d]lander with [Defendant] and [Plaintiff], A conference call was then held between Charles Nor[d]lander, Thomas Moody, Nancy Dubuc, and Richard C. Davis at which time it was agreed that the Plaintiffs and the Defendant ... would be equal 50/50 partners of [Plaintiffs] concept and treatment ... and would share equally in all net revenues and proceeds generated from the exploitation of the series.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 811; <em>see also id. </em>at 269-70 (defense counsel cross-examines Plaintiff about his interrogatory answer). Defendant also played at trial a part of Plaintiffs videotaped deposition testimony during which Plaintiff stated about the conference call, \u201c T remember that being the defining moment of when I struck this deal with [Defendant].\u2019\u201d J.A. at 276. This evidence contradicts Plaintiffs trial testimony that the revenue-sharing contract was formed during the June 3 telephone conversation with Nordlander. Therefore, the admission of Plaintiffs complaint would have only reiterated Plaintiffs conflicting account.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">In support of its defense that Nordlander and Plaintiff never made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>revenue-sharing contract, Defendant sought to introduce testimony from Nordlander and two of its other employees to the effect that reality television stars never receive revenue-sharing contracts. Defendant argues that their testimony is not \u201cexpert\u201d testimony but \u201cfactual context.\u201d As such, Defendant claims the witnesses should have been able to \u201c \u2018offer an opinion on the basis of relevant historical or narrative facts [they have] perceived\u2019 \u201d without being deemed \u201cexperts.\u201d Aplt. Op. Br. at 57 (quoting <em>MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. Wanzer, </em>897 F.2d 703, 706 (4th Cir.1990) (internal quotations and citations omitted)). Plaintiff objected to this testimony and the district court sustained this objection on the basis that these individuals had not been designated as experts pretrial and so could not testify as to industry practice. In summary, the district court ruled as to all three of the controverted witnesses\u2019 opinions: \u201c[T]his witness was not disclosed as an expert. He has been asked to express an opinion as to a certain practice prevailing or not prevailing in the industry in which he works, and he cannot do that.\u201d J.A. at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">A witness testifying not as an expert must limit his opinion testimony: \u201cto those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 701. Defendant did not seek to admit solely the witnesses\u2019 lay opinion testimony based on \u201crecords kept by [them] personally under [them] control,\u201d and \u201cpredicated on [their] personal knowledge and perception.\u201d <em>Wanzer, </em>897 F.2d at 706. Rather, Defendant sought to admit the witnesses\u2019 specialized knowledge as to the entire television industry. Defendant was certainly entitled to present testimony regarding its own standard practices and each witness was allowed to testify that based upon their experience and knowledge of historical facts no one had ever made a fifty-fifty revenue sharing deal with Defendant. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that to present any specialized knowledge of the television industry, the Defendant should have disclosed and qualified these witnesses as experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Defendant next argues the district court improperly allowed Plaintiff to testify that he \u201cowned\u201d the television series and that Defendant stole it from him despite Defendant\u2019s objections and incorrectly refused to issue a curative instruction on the subject to the jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court overruled Defendant\u2019s objection to that testimony because \u201cthe word \u2018own\u2019 has a common meaning, and ... when [Plaintiff] makes that expression, that\u2019s expressing his intent, and his <em>understanding of </em>the status <em>of </em>the pilot [episode].... [H]e has a perfect right to testify to that.\u201d J.A. at 170-71. And, the court told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">What counsel is saying is that when he says he owns it, that\u2019s a legal conclusion, and he may own it and he may not own it legally. And the reason I let him testify to it is because that\u2019s what he says because he thinks he owns it, and he expressed that thought in his conversation. I\u2019m not sure what will develop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>in this case at any later period of time. It may be that the question of ownership is a serious issue that you have to decide. And if it does become an issue that you have to decide, then I may be required to charge you the law as to ownership, and what it takes for someone to own a property such as this. And if that is the case, then you can decide that issue of ownership if it becomes necessary. And the fact that this witness has said he owned it, and I let him testify to it, may or may not be critical as to that issue, if we do get to that issue and if you are called upon to decide it. So it\u2019s a legal conclusion that you may have to decide, and if you do, I\u2019ll give you the law upon which you can decide it, you finding the facts. But if it\u2019s not a legal conclusion, and that has to be decided, and he can express his opinion about it, then his testimony can come in. Okay? I don\u2019t mean to confuse you, but I can\u2019t predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen in the case. And if ownership does become a legal issue, then I will submit that issue to you to decide, based upon applicable law. Okay?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 171-72. Defendant requested a jury instruction that Plaintiffs statements as to ownership and theft are irrelevant to Plaintiffs contract claim. The district judge rejected the charge, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">[M]y charge says nothing about ownership. It says to prove a breach of contract, you\u2019ve got to prove this, this, and this.... [Plaintiff] inserted those words [of ownership and theft], but ownership is not necessary ... I\u2019m going to tell them what he has to prove, and he doesn\u2019t have to prove ownership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 438-39.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in either failing to sustain Defendant\u2019s objection or refusing to give the requested curative instruction. The court informed the jury that it would let the jury know if ownership was an issue it needed to decide and that if it was not, then Plaintiffs statements on the subject were essentially irrelevant. When the court did not instruct the jury on ownership it was left to decide the only issue it was given instructions to decide \u2014 the contract claim. Moreover, we can infer from the jury\u2019s award of half of only the first season\u2019s profits, rather than an \u201cowner\u2019s\u201d half of all seasons\u2019 profits, that it was not influenced by Plaintiffs allegations of ownership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Defendant next complains the district court erroneously failed to instruct the jury on the requirement of \u201cspecific words of assent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439-40. \u201cWe review challenges to jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>S. Atl., </em>284 F.3d at 530. \u201cInstructions are adequate if \u2018construed as a whole, and in light of the whole record, [they] adequately [inform] the jury of the controlling legal principles without misleading or confusing the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Spell v. McDaniel, </em>824 F.2d 1380, 1395 (4th Cir.1987)). Even if we detect error, we do not reverse \u201cunless the error seriously prejudiced the challenging party\u2019s ease.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">Defendant submitted thirty-six proposed jury instructions. Then at trial, Defendant\u2019s counsel orally requested another jury instruction to the effect that under New York law formation of an oral contract requires \u201cspecific words of assent\u201d based upon two cases, <em>Gomez v. Bicknell, </em>302 A.D.2d 107, 756 N.Y.S.2d 209 (2002), and <em>Agrie. Ins. Co. v. Matthews, </em>301 A.D.2d 257, 749 N.Y.S.2d 533 (2002). Defendant did not submit to the district court a copy of the specific instruction it requested on this issue. <em>See </em>J.A. at 439-40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>(\u201cYour Honor, the last thing we would request is a charge that we don\u2019t have a specific charge for, but is incorporated in the Gomez case, and the Agricultural Insurance Company that I passed up, which is an oral contract in New York, there was a requirement for specific words of assent.\u201d). Nor does it provide the text of this hypothetical instruction on appeal. The joint appendix on appeal only provides two pages of the transcript of the discussion of this proposed instruction which does not reveal how the court ultimately ruled on the instruction (though we can tell by the instructions it did give, it refused to give this requested instruction) and, more importantly, why it so ruled. Nonetheless, Defendant argues on appeal its requested instruction was necessary because without it the jurors were free to conclude, allegedly contrary to New York law, \u201cthat they could recognize a contract by cherry-picking Plaintiffs conclusory statements about the existence of an agreement while disregarding all of Plaintiffs contradictory admissions and writings.\u201d Aplt. Op. Br. at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The district court instructed the jury there are three essential elements to the formation of a binding contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">First, that there is a contractual intent on the part of all parties to the contract ... both of those people have got to have an intent, a desire to enter into a contract. You don\u2019t enter into a contract by accident.... And the second essential element is ... an actual meeting of the minds of the parties.... In other words, they agree on all of the elements of the contract. You can\u2019t have a contract if you don\u2019t agree on everything.... Now, there are some contracts in our law that must be in writing.... But this is not such a contract ... and this one can be agreed upon, can be made, can be made to the point of being enforced if it is oral, or partially oral and partially written. But there has to be an offer and an acceptance for there to be a contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">J.A. at 460-61. As our extensive discussion of the requirements for contract formation under New York law make clear, the district court\u2019s instructions on acceptance and mutual assent to material terms are adequate and do not misstate New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Lastly, Defendant challenges the district court\u2019s response to a jury question. During its deliberations, the jury asked: \u201cDo we need to determine that there is a revenue sharing contract between the two parties? Do we need to determine that there is a 50/50 revenue split contract between the two parties?\u201d The district court responded by explaining that it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">[Djidn\u2019t suggest any particular type [of] contract to you. And [it] didn\u2019t do that because that\u2019s really not part of the law; that\u2019s a part of the facts. But I did say to you that when you considered this first element, the existence of a contract, and if you find that [P]laintiff has proven the existence of a contract ... then you will know what that contract provides .... [I]f he has proven it, you know what it is; you know whether it\u2019s a 50/50 split; you know whatever the evidence supports. And I can\u2019t tell you you have to find a particular kind of contract because that\u2019s just not my job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 470-71.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to respond to a jury\u2019s question, and the form of that response, for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Foster, </em>507 F.3d 233, 244 (4th Cir.2007). \u201c \u2018[I]n responding to a jury\u2019s i\"equest for clarification on a charge, the district court\u2019s duty is simply to respond to the jury\u2019s apparent source of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>confusion fairly and accurately without creating prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v.

By failing to answer the questions, Defendant claims the district court essentially invited the jury to craft its own version of a contract \u2014 which is what it claims the jury did by awarding only half of the revenue from the first season to Plaintiff, rather than awarding half of the revenue of all three seasons to which Plaintiff asserted he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">First, the district court\u2019s answer did not misstate the law or the facts. Second, its answer did not invite the jury to \u201ccraft\u201d its own contract, but it did properly remind the jury that only the jury could \u201cfind\u201d or \u201cdetermine\u201d whether a contract existed and, upon the basis of that conclusion, decide what the terms of the contract were. And, lastly, the jury was free to believe parts and disregard parts of Plaintiffs testimony and evidence. Based on the jury\u2019s verdict, it likely concluded based upon Plaintiffs testimony and other evidence that the parties had agreed to split equally the show\u2019s revenues, but disregarded other parts of Plaintiffs testimony and evidence in deciding that Plaintiff was not entitled to half of the revenue from the second and third seasons because the parties had only reached an agreement as to the first season.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">For the reasons herein, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motions for a judgment as a matter of law and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-9\">.

Defendant makes much of the following text from an unpublished decision, suggesting it represents a unique and stringent standard for proving the existence of oral contracts under New York law: \"But, despite any multi-factor inquiry [as to whether the parties intended to be bound without a writing], if the Court finds substantial ambiguity regarding whether both parties have mutually assented to all material terms, then the Court can neither find, nor enforce, a contract.\u201d <em>Barbarian Rugby Wear, Inc. v. PRL USA Holdings, Inc., </em>No. 06 Civ. 2652(JGK), 2008 WL 5169495, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec.9, 2008). The citations <em>Barbarian </em>provides for support of that statement, however, make clear that the statement is simply another way of saying the following basic precepts of oral and written contract law: \u201cIf an agreement is not reasonably certain in its material terms, there can be no legally enforceable contract,\u201d <em>Missigman v. USI Ne., Inc., </em>131 F.Supp.2d 495, 506 (S.D.N.Y.2001), and \"To create a binding contract, there must be a manifestation of mutual assent sufficiently definite to assure that the parties are truly in agreement with respect to all material terms,\u201d <em>Express Indus. &amp; Terminal Corp. v.

We discuss the definiteness of Defendant\u2019s acceptance and the agreement\u2019s material terms, <em>infra. </em>But because we need not consider the definiteness of the agreement\u2019s material terms if we determine Defendant did not manifest acceptance at all (which is hotly disputed), we begin by evaluating whether Nordlander expressed acceptance to Plaintiff\u2019s offer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b228-5\">. Plaintiff does not fail to mention the parties\u2019 conduct altogether. In his brief, Plaintiff argues \u201d[t]he parties' nearly complete performance of their respective obligations under the contract ... is likewise 'of major significance.\u2019 \u201d Aple. Resp. Br. at 28 (quoting <em>R.G. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Horn &amp; Hardart Co., </em>751 F.2d 69, 75 (2d Cir.1984)). But he contends that the parties\u2019 performance is of \" 'major significance' \u201d to \"the determination of whether the parties intended to be bound in the absence of a written agreement^]\u201d not to the determination of whether the parties had reached an oral agreement in the first place, i.e., whether Nordlander or Defendant accepted Plaintiff's offer. Aple. Resp. Br. at 27 (citing R.G. <em>Group, </em>751 F.2d at 75-76 (detailing four factors New York courts use to decide whether \u201cthe parties' words and deeds, within a given bargaining context, show an intent to be bound only by a written agreement.\u201d)). Plaintiff must first clear the hurdle of demonstrating Defendant\u2019 assented to his offer in order to reach the issue of whether the parties\u2019 intended to be bound by their oral agreement without a written document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\">. This is also why the subsequent emails between Plaintiff and representatives of Defendant in which Plaintiff refers to his \"deal,\u201d \"contract,\u201d or \"partnership\u201d with Defendant are irrelevant to the present inquiry. None of those emails indicate what Nordlander said in the June 3 phone conversation to accept Plaintiff's offer. Rather, they reflect what we have already accepted as true \u2014 that Plaintiff believed he had reached an agreement with Nordlander in that June 3 phone conversation to make a television series and split the resulting profits equally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\">. Defendant refers to statements Plaintiff made to investors, representatives of Defendant, and other television networks. Aplt. Op. Br. at 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b242-5\">. The substance of Defendant's arguments as to the court's failure to sustain its objection and issue its requested jury instruction on Plaintiff's statements as to ownership and theft of the show are the same. We review both claims of error for abuse of discretion. S. <em>Atl. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Riese, </em>284 F.3d 518, 530 (4th Cir.2002). Therefore, we treat both issues simultaneously in this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b245-11\">DUNCAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahx\">dissenting from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">I am in full agreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Davis deserves to be compensated for the services he indisputably provided A &amp; E Television Networks. Davis\u2019s position is made all the more sympathetic by the fact that A &amp; E bears significant responsibility for the failure to reduce a contract memorializing its understanding to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">Moreover, it certainly appears that Davis had viable claims. He could have brought an action in quantum meruit. As the majority recognizes, Davis also asserted acceptance by conduct, on which the district court, inexplicably, declined to instruct. Unfortunately, however, the jury was not asked to find facts undergirding either such theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">We are thus left with the contention that Nordlander\u2019s statement, \u201cOkay, okay, I get it,\u201d J.A. at 258, constitutes \u201cclear, unambiguous and unequivocal\u201d acceptance, <em>IBM Corp. v. Johnson, </em>629 F.Supp.2d 321, 330 (S.D.N.Y.2009), which is simply not the law. The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Johnson </em>for its conclusion that \u201cif [Davis] reasonably or plausibly understood Nordlander\u2019s equivocal statement as acceptance, then a contract was formed,\u201d (Maj. Op. at 211) runs contrary to the basic legal principles underlying contract formation. Contracts require mutual assent, and a unilateral understanding, by definition, cannot meet that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">Because I do not believe a reasonable person would interpret \u201cOkay, okay, I get it,\u201d alone as acceptance, or indeed as any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>thing other than \u201cI understand what you are saying,\u201d I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
