We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Bruce v. Ylst, </em>351 F.3d 1283, 1287 (9th Cir.2003). We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal based on failure to exhaust, and for clear error its factual findings. <em>O\u2019Guinn v. Lovelock Corr. Ctr., </em>502 F.3d 1056, 1059 (9th Cir.2007). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record, <em>id., </em>and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on Losoya\u2019s due process claim because he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants are retaining him in the Security Housing Unit with insufficient evidence and denying him periodic reviews. <em>See Bruce, </em>351 F.3d at 1287-88 (prison gang validation proceeding subject to the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-22\">The district court properly dismissed Losoya\u2019s four remaining claims to the extent that they are based on events after February 2001 because he failed to properly exhaust the prison grievance process prior to filing suit. <em>See Ngo v. Woodford, </em>539 F.3d 1108, 1109-10 (9th Cir.2008) (affirming dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and rejecting continuing violations theory). To the extent that Losoya\u2019s four remaining claims are based on events prior to February 2001, dismissal was proper because they are time-barred. <em>See Cholla Ready Mix, Inc. v. Civish, </em>382 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that, for \u00a7 1983 claims, federal courts borrow the applicable state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury claims); <em>Knox v. Davis, </em>260 F.3d 1009, 1013 (9th Cir.2001) (a \u00a7 1983 \u201c \u2018claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); <em>see also </em>Cal. Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 335.1 (two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims); Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 352.1(a) (prisoners entitled to two years of statutory tolling).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Losoya\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We construe Losoya\u2019s \u201cJudicial Notice,\u201d received on August 12, 2010, as his reply brief and order it filed. We decline to consider issues raised for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See Smith v.
