The district court granted relief by providing Sakyi fourteen days in which to appeal his criminal judgment, but dismissed the remainder of the \u00a7 2255 claims on the ground that they were without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">An attorney who fails to file a direct appeal when requested to do so by his criminal defendant client \u201cdeprives the defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel, notwithstanding that the lost appeal may not have had a reasonable probability of success.\u201d <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir. 1993). Counsel is not absolved of his duty to file a requested notice of appeal by a waiver of appeal rights in a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Poindexter, </em>492 F.3d 263, 271 (4th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In this Circuit, where a prisoner successfully moves, pursuant to \u00a7 2255, to reinstate his right to a direct appeal, the proper remedy is to vacate the underlying judgment of eonviction and reenter the judgment to permit the Fed. R.App. 4(b) appeal period to run anew. <em>See Peak, </em>992 F.2d at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">Despite the district court\u2019s grant of the relief described above, Sakyi\u2019s judgment of conviction was not vacated and reentered. Furthermore, while the district court denied relief on the merits as to the remainder of Sakyi\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims, we note that those claims could otherwise be raised in Sakyi\u2019s reinstated direct appeal. When a prisoner such as Sakyi has wrongly been denied the right to a direct appeal, he should not be forced to raise all possible claims against his judgment of conviction in his first \u00a7 2255 motion and thereby, \u201cmake the substantive objections to his conviction and sentence that his lawyer would have made for him on direct appeal.\u201d <em>In re Goddard, </em>170 F.3d 435, 437 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">To place Sakyi in the proper posture to proceed with his criminal appeal, we grant Sakyi a certificate of appealability and vacate that portion of the district court\u2019s order and judgment granting leave to file an out-of-time appeal. We remand with instructions to vacate and reenter Sakyi\u2019s judgment of conviction. We further modify the district court\u2019s denial of relief on Sakyi\u2019s remaining \u00a7 2255 claims to be without prejudice and affirm the denial of relief as modified. We dispense with oral arguments because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and arguments would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AS MODIFIED, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\"> In this case, the district court declined to find counsel ineffective, but found that granting Sakyi relief on this claim \u201cis in the efficient administration of justice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
