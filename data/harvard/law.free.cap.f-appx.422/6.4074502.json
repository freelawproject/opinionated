We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \u201cconstruing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002). We review the denial of a motion for leave to amend the complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>McCarthy v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., </em>482 F.3d 184, 200 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-19\">For substantially the same reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s well-reasoned report and recommendation, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Leak\u2019s complaint and denied her motion to amend as futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-20\">We have considered all of Leak\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
