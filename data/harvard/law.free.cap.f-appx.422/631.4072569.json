Rose, a Montana state prisoner, appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that prison officials violated his constitutional right to access the courts. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-23\">The district court properly dismissed Rose\u2019s access-to-courts claims because ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>ther they pertained to state law tort causes of action, or Rose failed to allege facts showing how defendants\u2019 acts hindered his efforts to pursue challenges to his criminal conviction or prison conditions. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 354-55, 116 S.Ct. 2174,135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (the right to access the courts is limited to cases in which prisoners challenge their convictions or prison conditions); <em>Phillips v. Hust, </em>588 F.3d 652, 655 (9th Cir.2009) (to state an access-to-courts claim, \u201can inmate must show that official acts or omissions hindered his efforts to pursue a [non-frivolous] legal claim\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the complaint without leave to amend because the defects of Rose\u2019s complaint are not curable. <em>See Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (a district court need not grant leave to amend if the defects of the complaint cannot be cured).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Rose\u2019s remaining contentions, including those concerning a preliminary injunction, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b655-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
