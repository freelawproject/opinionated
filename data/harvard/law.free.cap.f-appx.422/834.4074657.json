Doepke makes two contentions: first that the Administrative Law Judge erred when it found that his previous jobs qualified as \u201cpast relevant work,\u201d and second that the ALJ erred when it found that Doepke could work full time.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">\u201cWe review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1439).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">The ALJ was required to follow a \u201cfive-step sequential evaluation process ... to decide whether [Doepke was] disabled.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920. The ALJ properly followed that process. Doepke argues, however, that the ALJ erred at the fourth step in that process, where it was required to determine \u201cwhether a claimant can perform past relevant work despite his or her impairment.\u201d <em>Crayton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">One of the jobs that the ALJ found to be past relevant work was Doepke\u2019s job as a deli worker. Doepke fails to argue that his job as a deli worker would not constitute past relevant work. Thus, the ALJ did not err in finding that Doepke\u2019s job as a deli worker constituted past relevant work. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1335 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe will not address a claim that has been abandoned.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">The ALJ then found that Doepke could perform unskilled or semi-skilled work, which included his past job as deli worker. Therefore, the only question is whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Doepke can perform his past relevant work as a deli worker. Doepke does not have any physical conditions that would prevent him from being able to perform that work; one of his treating physicians said that \u201c[his][t]hought content and form are productive, goal directed, rational and coherent ... [his] [i]ntellectual ability is above average and shows no impairment of attention span ... [and his] judgment is not impaired with respect to managing daily activities and making reasonable life decisions\u201d; another one of his physicians found that he is \u201cable to function satisfactorily\u201d when dealing with \u201cwork pressures in a usual work setting,\u201d and that he can \u201c[interact appropriately with supervisor(s) ... [and] co-workers\u201d; neither of the two state agency psychologists indicated that Doepke would be unable to complete a normal workday; when the vocational expert was asked whether Doepke could \u201cmaintain a 40 hour week,\u201d he responded that Doepke\u2019s impairment \u201ccertainly does not preclude the ability to function and sustain the pace, persistence, and concen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>tration\u201d; and Doepke agreed that he is \u201cable to get up and go to work\u201d even when he does not want to \u201c[bjecause if [he] do[es not] then [he will] get fired.\u201d Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Doepke can perform past relevant work.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
