(collectively, Plaintiffs), sued the Rock Hill School District Board of Education (Board) and Superintendent Lloyd Evans (collectively, Defendants) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and state law following an incident in which another student threatened S.M.\u2019s life. The district court granted summary judgment to Defendants. Plaintiffs now appeal, asserting that the district court erred by granting summary judgment on their claims that (1) Evans retaliated against McComas in violation of her First Amendment rights; (2) the Board retaliated against McComas in violation of her First Amendment rights; (3) Defendants violated Plaintiffs\u2019 right to expressive association; (4) Defendants violated McComas\u2019s right to petition; and (5) Defendants violated S.M.\u2019s substantive due process rights. We reverse the grant of summary judgment to Evans on McComas\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim and affirm in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">A. The Knife Incident</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">This case stems from a dispute between S.M. and her classmate, K.C. Following a confrontation between these two students over romantic notes that one sent to the other\u2019s boyfriend, K.C. told S.M.\u2019s friend, J.C., that \u201cshe wasn\u2019t going to fight [S.M.] without her knife.\u201d The next day, K.C. told J.C. that she brought her knife to school and that S.M. \u201cshould watch her back.\u201d Another student later said that \u201c[K.C.] told alot [sic] of people that she was going to kill [S.M.].\u201d S.M. and J.C. reported these events to the assistant principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">Though an initial search of K.C.\u2019s belongings did not yield the knife, at least two students reported that K.C. told them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>that she hid the knife before turning her purse over to administrators. Later that day, S.M.\u2019s boyfriend discovered the knife in KC.\u2019s purse and gave it to the assistant principal. K.C. then admitted to threatening to use the knife on S.M. and to bringing the knife to school \u201cjust like [she] [did] every day.\u201d The assistant principal turned the knife over to the authorities. Principal Steven Lambert suspended K.C. for ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">When K.C. arrived home, she denied threatening S.M. or taking the knife to school and claimed that school administrators coerced her into signing a false confession. K.C.\u2019s mother admitted that the knife found at school looked like K.C.\u2019s knife. She told Superintendent Evans, however, that K.C. found her knife in her room the next weekend. Following this conversation, Evans told Lambert that they might \u201cnot be able to prove that [K.C.] had a knife at school.\u201d Evans relayed K.C.\u2019s parents\u2019 position to the Board. Upon learning that K.C. recanted her story and that the school might permit K.C. to return, McComas \u2014 S.M.\u2019s mother and a teacher at Rock Hill \u2014 complained and asked Lambert to investigate further. McComas also expressed her concerns to Evans and the Board via letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">At the end of her suspension, K.C. returned to Rock Hill for one day and attended classes with S.M. The two did not speak. But, during one shared class, K.C. got up to sharpen her pencil and stared at S.M., leaving her \u201ccompletely terrorized.\u201d S.M. found K.C.\u2019s presence so upsetting that she missed two Ohio Graduation Tests administered that week. McComas again spoke to Lambert about allowing K.C. back at school.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Soon after this incident, McComas appeared before the Board (the March 2007 Board meeting) to argue against K.C.\u2019s permanent return to campus. She read and distributed a prepared statement, explaining that the failure to expel K.C. resulted in anger at S.M. and student speculation that the incident was blown out of proportion. During this meeting, Evans said that he \u201cunderstood] that [S.M.] initially was the aggressor.\u201d K.C.\u2019s parents removed her from school due to headaches and home-schooled her the rest of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">B. The Questionnaire</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">To gather more information for the prosecution, which had charged K.C. with a felony for bringing a weapon to school\u2014 a charge of which K.C. was ultimately convicted \u2014 McComas created a questionnaire at home. McComas gave S.M. the questionnaire, which S.M. distributed to students at school. The questionnaire asked whether the students had \u201cheard [K.C.] brag about bringing a knife to school,\u201d \u201cseen fresh cuts on [her] arms,\u201d heard her \u201ctalk[] about cutting herself with razors,\u201d or \u201cseen her with a razor or knife at school.\u201d Upon learning of the questionnaire, Lambert and Evans expressed concern over McComas\u2019s involvement and the use of K.C.\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">A few weeks later, McComas met with Evans, Lambert, and McComas\u2019s union representative (the May 2007 meeting). According to McComas, Evans assumed an \u201cangry, threatening, and intimidating\u201d demeanor. Evans accused McComas of revealing confidential health information about a student via the questionnaire and said she must have accessed K.C\u2019s health file. Evans told McComas that \u201cit [was] not [her] job to be the prosecutor,\u201d and reiterated \u201c[his] understanding that [S.M.] jumped [K.C.].\u201d Evans said he planned to suspend McComas for three days.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">After the meeting, McComas discussed the dispute between S.M. and K.C. in class and informed her students of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>suspension. McComas conceded the unprofessional nature of this conversation. Lambert issued McComas a letter of reprimand in connection with her in-class actions. She then received a letter from Evans suspending her pending a disciplinary hearing before the Board (the June 2007 Board meeting). Following this meeting, and pursuant to Evans\u2019s recommendation, the Board rescinded Lambert\u2019s earlier reprimand and imposed a ten-day suspension without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">C. The Color-Guard Tryouts</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">School policy prohibited K.C. (as a long-term home-instruction student) from attending school functions. But administrators permitted K.C. to return to try out for the field-commander position for the next school year at the same time S.M. would vie for a color-guard spot. While walking to the gym for her tryout, S.M. came within three feet of K.C. and her parents. S.M. reported that K.C. \u201cstared at [her] menacingly\u201d and that \u201c[she] was intimidated and terrified and started crying.\u201d S.M. \u201cabsolutely fell apart\u201d during her tryout and failed to make the team; K.C. earned the position of field commander.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The following fall, S.M. overdosed on a prescription drug. In her suicide note, S.M. \u201cexpressed a desire to die because of the breakup with her boyfriend,\u201d as well as \u201congoing anxiety and fear and a sense of injustice and unfairness that she had felt she had no other option other than to transfer ... because she did not feel safe attending [R]ock Hill High School where she would not[ ], she knew, be protected in any way from this student.\u201d When released from the hospital, S.M. began attending South Point High School.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">D. The Ohio Department of Education (ODE) Report</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">During the next school year, authorities arrested McComas for domestic violence. According to deposition testimony, Evans raised the possibility of filing an ODE report regarding this incident to Lambert and provided him with relevant documentation. An outside consultant advised Evans and Lambert to report the incident; the consultant filled out the report himself, and Lambert signed it. A court ultimately acquitted McComas of the domestic violence charge and the ODE took no disciplinary action against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, affirming if, viewing all of the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, no genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Bishop v. Children\u2019s Ctr. for Developmental Enrichment, </em>618 F.3d 533, 536 (6th Cir.2010); <em>Vereecke v. Huron Valley Sch. Dist., </em>609 F.3d 392, 399 (6th Cir.2010). In a \u00a7 1983 action, the plaintiff must demonstrate the deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States caused by a person acting under color of state law. <em>McQueen v. Beecher Cmty. Sch., </em>433 F.3d 460, 463 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">A. First Amendment Retaliation Claim Against Evans</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">McComas first claims that Evans retaliated against her in violation of her First Amendment rights. To establish this claim, she must show that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-15\">(1) [she] was engaged in a constitutionally protected activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-16\">(2) the defendant\u2019s adverse action caused [her] to suffer an injury that would likely chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that activity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-17\">(3) the adverse action was motivated at least in part as a response to the exercise of [her] constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>Jenkins v. Rock Hill Local Sch. Dist., </em>513 F.3d 580, 585-86 (6th Cir.2008). \u201cIf the plaintiff meets this burden, the burden of production shifts to the defendant, but if the defendant can show he would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected activity, he is entitled to summary judgment.\u201d Id at 586 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">1. Constitutionally Protected Activities</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Because she is a public employee, to establish that her speech enjoyed constitutional protection, McComas must show that (1) her speech involved a \u201cmatter[ ] of public concern\u201d; (2) her interest, as a citizen, in commenting on the matter outweighed \u201cthe interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees\u201d; and (3) that she spoke as a citizen rather than \u201cpursuant to [her] official duties.\u201d <em>Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ., </em>624 F.3d 332, 337-38 (6th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We treat \u201cthe question of whether, in a First Amendment retaliation action, a public employee\u2019s speech is protected as one of law.\u201d <em>Fox v. Traverse City Area Pub. Sch. Bd. of Educ., </em>605 F.3d 345, 350-51 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 643, 178 L.Ed.2d 478 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The Defendants concede that McComas engaged in protected activity when she wrote to Evans and the Board in March 2007, addressed the Board that same month, and filed this lawsuit. The parties only dispute the constitutional protection accorded to McComas for (a) raising concerns to the administration about harassment in the high school; (b) addressing the Board in June 2007; and (c) preparing the questionnaire. None of these additional activities warrants constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">a. Raising Concerns to the Administration</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">McComas fails to identify precisely what concerns she raised, when, or to whom she raised them, or to link any alleged adverse action to such vaguely described incidents. We thus deem this argument encompassed by McComas\u2019s other specific examples of times she brought her concerns to the administration and find it forfeited as an independent source of constitutionally protected expression. <em>See United States v. Mobley, </em>618 F.3d 539, 550 (6th Cir.) (deeming an issue not fully developed as forfeited), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 810, 178 L.Ed.2d 541 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">b. Addressing the Board in June 2007</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">In June 2007, McComas addressed the Board \u201cto respond to the charges against [her] as an employee.\u201d She read portions of a prepared statement that described the actions she took to prepare for the hearing and noted her previous requests for an investigation of the matter between her daughter and K.C. and demands that the Board follow its policy of expelling students found in possession of a weapon on school property. The Board did not permit McComas to read the portions of her statement that bore on the knife incident or named particular students. She submitted the full text of her prepared statement for the Board\u2019s private review.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">Neither her speech nor her written statement constitutes constitutionally protected conduct. The meeting served as McComas\u2019s suspension hearing, and the speech she delivered concerned her discipline by her employer \u2014 a matter of private, not public, concern. <em>See Fitzpatrick v. City of Frankfort, </em>305 Fed.Appx. 258, 262 (6th Cir.2008) (noting that speech does not address a matter of public concern when it deals \u201cwith internal personnel dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>putes\u201d). The first half of the written statement, moreover, specifically addresses McComas\u2019s employment. The second half concerns events relating to S.M., but appears to serve primarily to explain the background events that prompted McComas\u2019s allegedly inappropriate professional conduct \u2014 again, not a matter of public concern. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">c. Preparing the Questionnaire</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">McComas asserts that her preparation of the questionnaire constitutes protected activity under both the Free Speech and Petition Clauses of the First Amendment. With respect to McComas\u2019s attempt to ground her argument in her right to free speech, we find that she fails to establish that the questionnaire touched on a matter of public concern. Several of the questions relate to the private matter of KC.\u2019s medical health. <em>See Lyons v. Sullivan, </em>602 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1979) (per curiam) (\u201c[Statements ... pertaining to plaintiffs alleged medical condition are not statements on issues of public concern.\u201d). In fact, under Ohio law, far from constituting a matter of public concern, such information receives legal protection prohibiting disclosure. <em>See </em>Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 3319.321(B) (protecting from release most personally identifiable student information). McComas argues KC.\u2019s medical condition \u201cwas common knowledge,\u201d but cites no authority establishing that distributing well-known student medical information merits constitutional protection. McComas fails, moreover, in light of the sensitive medical information highlighted in the questionnaire, to convince us that her interest in this speech outweighs the school\u2019s interest in regulating it to protect a student. See <em>Barr v. Lafon, </em>538 F.3d 554, 567-68 (6th Cir.2008) (recognizing the competing rights of expression and \u201crights of other students to be secure and to be let alone\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">McComas fares no better when grounding her argument on her right to petition. McComas submits the questionnaire as the \u201cpetition,\u201d claiming that she prepared it to assist in prosecuting K.C. As discussed above, though, the questionnaire did not touch on a matter of public concern and thus lacks protection. <em>See Jenkins, </em>513 F.3d at 587 n. 2 (\u201c[T]he public concern test applies to petitioning activity for public employees.\u201d). And, although \u201c[t]he plain language of the First Amendment makes clear that a \u2018petition\u2019 triggers the amendment\u2019s protections,\u201d <em>Holzemer v. City of Memphis, </em>621 F.3d 512, 521 (6th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), McComas fails to establish that the questionnaire so qualifies. At the time McComas prepared the document, the prosecutor\u2019s office had already initiated K.C.\u2019s prosecution. McComas thus did not issue the questionnaire to air a grievance or to spur the government to take any particular action. <em>See id. </em>We thus find that creating and distributing the questionnaire did not constitute protected activity for McComas\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">2. Adverse Action / Motivation</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">With respect to McComas\u2019s activities that the parties agree constitute protected conduct \u2014 writing to Evans and the Board in March 2007, addressing the Board that same month, and filing this lawsuit \u2014 we next consider whether McComas suffered \u201can adverse action that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In addition, McComas must show that her protected conduct \u201cwas a substantial or motivating factor\u201d of the retaliatory action. <em>Rondigo, L.L.C. v. Casco Twp., </em>330 Fed.Appx. 511, 523 (6th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">a. McComas\u2019s Suspension</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">McComas first argues that Evans suspended her in retaliation for her protected activity. Evans attributed the suspension to McComas\u2019s preparing and distributing the questionnaire without approval, \u201cinvolving students in a discussion concerning Rock Hill and (two) particular students\u201d after being warned not to do so, and failing to perform \u201cteaching duties in a professional manner by being involved in other matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The district court correctly evaluated Evans\u2019s first two rationales for suspending McComas as not implicating protected conduct; it overlooked, however, Evans\u2019s reference to \u201cother matters\u201d as a basis for McComas\u2019s suspension. When asked what \u201cother matters\u201d meant, Evans initially explained that \u201c[McComas\u2019s] involvement in the investigation and on-going did take class time throughout this period of time.\u201d When asked specifically whether these \u201cother matters\u201d referred only to the questionnaire and McComas\u2019s in-class discussion of the knife incident, Evans said that he thought \u201cthere [were] probably also other kind[s] of things going on.\u201d We agree with McComas that this evidence supports her argument that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Evans\u2019s motivation included McComas\u2019s Mareh 2007 letter or address to the Board, both of which the Defendants concede constitute protected conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">b. ODE Report</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">McComas next argues that Evans retaliated against her when he ordered Lambert to report her domestic violence charge to the ODE. The district court concluded that she suffered no adverse action because public records documented the arrest, the report did not include any inaccurate or misleading information, and the ensuing ODE investigation did not result in any punitive action.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">We see this too as falling short of the summary judgment standard. Administrators \u2014 who had no obligation to do so\u2014 submitted the report to an organization with the power to conduct hearings and to remove a teacher\u2019s certification. Lambert conceded that he expected McComas \u201cwould be upset\u201d by the filing of the report, and Evans testified that a report to the ODE \u201c[c]ertainly\u201d qualifies as a very serious matter for a teacher. As a result of the ODE report, moreover, McComas incurred additional attorney expenses. Submitting this report thus does not constitute the sort of \u201cinconsequential action! ]\u201d subject to summary judgment. <em>See Holzemer, </em>621 F.3d at 524 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). McComas, moreover, produced evidence that her protected conduct \u201cwas a substantial or motivating factor\u201d of the retaliatory action. <em>See Rondigo, </em>330 Fed.Appx. at 523 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). According to Lambert, \u201cthere[ ] [was] some discussion\u201d about the lawsuit amongst the group deciding whether to file the report. And McComas attested that, when she confronted Lambert about the report, he said, \u201cWell, you are suing [or are in a lawsuit with] the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">Evans disputes liability by claiming he did not actually cause the adverse action, which he characterizes as solely Lambert\u2019s doing. The record suggests otherwise. Lambert first learned of McComas\u2019s charge and the possibility of filing an ODE report upon talking to Evans. Evans concedes that he gave Lambert a copy of the restraining order against McComas that Lambert ultimately submitted to the ODE, and that he told Lambert that the docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ment could be part of the case. According to Lambert, Evans said that \u201cschool officials could \u2014 if they don\u2019t report misconduct, they could have their certificate^] pulled.\u201d Though Evans denied making such a statement \u2014 and a consultant advised the two that they should report the incident \u2014 we believe that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding Evans\u2019s responsibility for the ODE report.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">c. Characterizing S.M. as the Initial Aggressor</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">McComas did not raise Evans\u2019s characterization of S.M. as the initial aggressor during the March 2007 Board meeting as a potential adverse action before the district court, and we thus need not consider it here. <em>See United States v. Ninety-Three (93) Firearms, </em>330 F.3d 414, 424 (6th Cir.2003). Evans\u2019s statement, nevertheless, is not sufficiently embarrassing to constitute an adverse action. <em>Compare Fritz v. Charter Twp. of Comstock, </em>592 F.3d 718, 727 (6th Cir.2010) (finding that defendant\u2019s statements that there was a neighborhood petition against plaintiff and that plaintiff violated township ordinances did not constitute adverse action), <em>with Bloch v. Ribar, </em>156 F.3d 673, 681 (6th Cir.1998) (finding adverse action where defendant publicly released \u201cirrelevant, humiliating, and confidential information\u201d concerning \u201cthe private details of [a] rape\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">d. Bullying and Intimidating McComas</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">In support of her claim that Evans bullied and intimidated her in his office, McComas pinpoints only one particular statement: \u201cWhy do you think you should investigate this[?] ... Are you trying to be the prosecutor!?] You have no reason to do this.\u201d Evans\u2019s statement refers to McComas\u2019s creation of the questionnaire, which, as discussed above, does not constitute protected conduct, ending this inquiry. <em>See Fox, </em>605 F.3d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">e. Not Expelling K.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Finally, McComas fails to establish that Evans decided not to expel K.C. and to allow her to return to school grounds in retaliation for McComas\u2019s protected conduct. She posits only that \u201cEvans had political associations and friendships at stake,\u201d \u201che maintained close interactions with KC.\u2019s family,\u201d and that, \u201cto protect the aforementioned friendships and associations, Evans retaliated against [her].\u201d But deposition testimony reveals that Evans considered only permissible factors in determining whether to expel K.C. Evans testified that he did not expel her because, once K.C. rescinded her confession, he had doubts about whether she brought the knife to school. K.C., moreover, appeared on school grounds on only two occasions during the school year after the knife incident \u2014 for one day following her ten-day suspension and for field-commander tryouts. With respect to the field-commander tryouts, in accordance with past practice, administrators permitted K.C.\u2019s brief return because doing so would allow her to participate in the activity during the next academic year. No evidence suggests that they did so in response to any protected conduct, rendering summary judgment appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">B. First Amendment Retaliation Claim Against the Board</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">As to the Board, McComas first claims that it \u201crubber-stamped\u201d Evans\u2019s disciplinary recommendation in retaliation for her protected conduct. Following a hearing, the Board suspended McComas for ten days \u201cfor insubordination\u201d and directed her \u201cto comply with Ohio and Federal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>regarding the duty of school employees not to release personally identifiable student information.\u201d The Board\u2019s reasoning refers exclusively to the unprotected questionnaire incident and the admittedly improper in-class discussion. McComas thus lacks evidence that the Board took any unconstitutional action. <em>See Scarbrough v. Morgan Cnty. Bd. of Educ., </em>470 F.3d 250, 261 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201cA governmental entity ... can be held liable under \u00a7 1983 only if a plaintiff establishes an unconstitutional action that implements or executes a ... decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">McComas also seeks to fault the Board for failing to investigate Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. But McComas offers no evidence that the Board had a constitutional duty to investigate McComas\u2019s or S.M.\u2019s claims, <em>see id., </em>or that the Board had a \u201cclear and persistent pattern\u201d of failing to investigate such claims, <em>see Williams ex </em>rel. <em>Hart v. Paint Valley Local Sch. Dist., </em>400 F.3d 360, 369 (6th Cir.2005) (explaining standard for establishing a \u00a7 1983 claim based on a failure to act). To the extent that McComas attempts to hold the Board liable based on Evans\u2019s actions, this claim also fails. <em>See Jenkins, </em>513 F.3d at 589 (\u201c[T]here is no respondeat superior liability in actions under \u00a7 1983.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">C. Plaintiffs\u2019 Right to Expressive Association and McComas\u2019s Right to Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Plaintiffs next press us to find that, based on the questionnaire incident, the Defendants violated their right to expressive association and McComas\u2019s right to petition. But, as discussed above, the creation and distribution of this question-name \u2014 in the school setting \u2014 gets no constitutional protection. Without protected conduct, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims fail. <em>See Anderson v. City of LaVergne, </em>371 F.3d 879, 881 (6th Cir.2004) (recognizing right to expressive association to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment); <em>Holzemer, </em>621 F.3d at 520 (noting that \u201cwhether the plaintiffs conduct deserves constitutional protection\u201d serves as the \u201cthreshold question\u201d for right-to-petition claims (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">D. S.M.\u2019s Substantive Due Process Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Finally, S.M. claims that the Defendants violated her substantive due process rights in constructively expelling her. \u201cInterests protected by substantive due process ... include those protected by specific constitutional guarantees, ... freedom from government actions that shock the conscience, and certain interests that the Supreme Court has found so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be fundamental.\u201d <em>Bell v. Ohio State Univ., </em>351 F.3d 240, 250 (6th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">S.M. claims her \u201cconstructive expulsion\u201d from Rock Hill deprived her of a fundamental right. As an initial matter, we did not \u2014 as S.M. claims \u2014 recognize constructive expulsion as a cause of action in <em>Salehpour v. University of Tennessee. </em>159 F.3d 199, 207 (6th Cir.1998) (noting merely that, \u201cto the extent that one could argue that Plaintiff may have been \u2018constructively\u2019 expelled, we believe that Defendants more than afforded Plaintiff his procedural process rights\u201d). Nor need we now determine whether to do so. Before the district court, S.M. attempted to establish a substantive due process violation by tying such constructive expulsion to her right to travel and her rights to intimate and expressive association. Here she does not. Thus, even if she did suffer constructive expulsion, S.M. fails to identify any funda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>mental right thereby impaired. <em>See Bell, </em>351 F.3d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">For the above reasons, we reverse the grant of summary judgment to Evans on McComas\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim, and affirm the district court judgment in all other respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
