We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion. <em>F.J. Hanshaw Enters., Inc. v. Emerald River Dev., Inc., </em>244 F.3d 1128, 1135 (9th Cir.2001); <em>De Long v. Hennessey, </em>912 F.2d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir. 1990). We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">The district court did not clearly err by finding that the Duffs engaged in bad faith conduct by willfully refusing to appear at hearings and by filing duplicative and frivolous documents, and thus the court had the inherent power to sanction them. <em>See Gomez v. Vernon, </em>255 F.3d 1118, 1133-34 (9th Cir.2001). The Duffs\u2019 contentions that the district court lacked jurisdiction to sanction them or jurisdiction over the action are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">However, we vacate the $23,149.98 sanction imposed. The sanction was criminal in nature, because it was intended to punish the Duffs for their conduct and to vindicate the court\u2019s authority, not solely to compensate plaintiff or coerce the Duffs into compliance with a court order. <em>See F.J. Hanshaw Enters., </em>244 F.3d at 1137-38. The amount of the sanction was a \u201cserious criminal penalt[y].\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1138. Because the sanction was criminal in nature and the amount was a \u201cserious\u201d penalty, the Duffs were entitled to the full due process protections of a criminal jury trial, <em>see id., </em>which they did not receive. On remand, the district court may reinstitute criminal sanction proceedings so long as the Duffs are provided the requisite protections. <em>See id. </em>at 1141-42. Alternatively, the district court may impose a monetary sanction that is civil in nature or not \u201cserious,\u201d without further proceedings, because the Duffs were previously given-adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>See Lasar v. Ford Motor Co., </em>399 F.3d 1101, 1110-12 &amp; n. 7 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">We also vacate the entry of the prefiling review order. On remand, the district court should consider whether <em>De Long v. Hennessey </em>allows imposition of a pre-filing review order against a defendant, and if so, the court should expressly address the <em>De Long </em>factors in determining whether to impose a pre-filing review order against the Duffs. <em>See </em>912 F.2d at 1147-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">The Duffs shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b665-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
