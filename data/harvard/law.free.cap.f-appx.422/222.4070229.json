Defendants contend that the district court erred in calculating them advisory Guidelines ranges by assessing a two-level enhancement to their offense levels for their roles in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>The district court\u2019s determination that a sentencing enhancement is warranted is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Thorson, </em>633 F.3d 312, 316-17 (4th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Slade, </em>631 F.3d 185, 188 (4th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Kellam, </em>568 F.3d 125, 147-48 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 657, 175 L.Ed.2d 501 (2009). Reversal for clear error is warranted only where we are left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>532 F.3d 326, 337 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">A defendant qualifies for a two-level enhancement if he was an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\u201d that did not involve five or more participants or was not otherwise extensive. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(c) (2008). The leadership enhancement \u201cis appropriate where the evidence demonstrates that the defendant controlled the activities of other participants or exercised management responsibility.\u201d <em>Slade, </em>631 F.3d at 190 (internal quotation marks omitted). The facts establishing the enhancement must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Harvey, </em>532 F.3d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement. The testimony of co-conspirators at sentencing established that the Defendants directed co-conspirators in the robbery of a trailer load of cigarettes, paid others in the conspiracy, negotiated the sale of the stolen goods, and recruited participants in the crime. Defendants\u2019 contention that their roles in the offense were indistinguishable from the others involved is belied by the record, and we find that the district court\u2019s factual findings in this regard are supported by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Next, Defendant Grant requests remand to the district court for amendment of his sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Grant filed a Rule 36 motion in the district court while his case was on appeal, asking the court to add a recommendation that he be housed in a Bureau of Prisons facility as close as possible to his place of residence, and to allow him to participate in the inmate financial responsibility program. The district court acknowledged the oversight but denied the motion without prejudice, as it was without jurisdiction to grant relief while the matter is on appeal. We decline to remand, as we note that Grant may refile his motion in the district court once this appeal has concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgments. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
