Hong argues that the evidence is insufficient to establish that she intended to or actually entered an agreement to deposit a fraudulent check. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Ample evidence establishes that Hong conspired with Marcus Rogozinski to present a fraudulent check to a bank for payment and to profit from the fraud. Hong created and mailed to Rogozinski what appeared to be a check for over $10 million that Hong had designed using check printing software and blank check stock. The check named as payee the \u201cTreasury/UCC Contract Trust\u201d located at \u201c1500 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20220,\u201d bore the routing number for the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, and listed a payor, payee, and numeric and written amounts. Although the check had several \u201cred flags,\u201d including the large dollar amount, trusts named as both the pay- or and payee, and included the statement \u201cSignature Not Required\u201d on the signature line, the Bank of America processed the check when Rogozinski presented it for deposit because the check bore the characteristics of a negotiable instrument. When Hong later spoke to Rogozinski in three recorded telephone calls, Hong\u2019s remarks revealed that she had agreed with Rogozinski to deposit the fraudulent check as part of a scheme to defraud. Hong expressed excitement after learning that the bank had accepted the check; Hong said that she \u201cdefinitely want[ed] something\u201d from the proceeds; she agreed three times to obtain other checks to \u201ctry doing it again\u201d; she explained that she had asked Rogozinski to add a \u201cpasscode\u201d to the signature card for his bank account so that \u201cnobody [could] retrieve it ... except [him] and [her]\u201d; and, when making final plans to travel and meet Rogozinski based on his representations that the check had cleared, Hong inquired if the funds had been \u201cmoved.... Like [she][had] told\u201d Rogozinski. Federal agents arrested Hong after she met Rogozinski in Orlando, Florida, and Hong admitted to the agents that \u201cshe had indeed manufactured the check\u201d and had created other checks from which she had profited \u201cpossibly in the thousands.\u201d Although Hong told the agents that she was due the money from the Social Security Administration \u201cbased on the work she had done and the funds she had paid in,\u201d Hong conceded that she had never earned $10 million. In addition, Hong\u2019s testimony at trial about choosing an uneven amount for the check based on Rogozinski\u2019s \u201cexperience with ... Secret Service and Homeland Security and ... with his friends at the bank and lawyers\u201d supported the theory of the United States that Hong and Rogozinski had entered into a conspiracy to defraud a bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Hong challenges the denial of her motion for a judgment of acquittal on two grounds, but both her arguments fail. First, Hong argues that her convictions rest on information solicited by Rogozinski during them telephone conversations and those conversations are not sufficient evidence of the conspiracy because Rogozinski called her as an agent of the United States, not as a \u201cculpable conspirator.\u201d <em>United States v. Arbane, </em>446 F.3d 1223, 1228 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIf there are only two members of a conspiracy, neither may be a government agent or informant who aims to frustrate the conspiracy.\u201d). Whether or not the conspiracy ended before the conversations occurred, Hong\u2019s remarks to Rogozinski can be reasonably interpreted to relate to an preexisting agreement for Rogozinski to present the check at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>Bank of America. Hong\u2019s remarks, the evidence of her role in the conspiracy, and her admissions to federal agents and during the trial, established Hong\u2019s participation in a conspiracy to defraud. Second, Hong argues that she was entitled to an acquittal because her testimony that she created the check to transfer money between trust funds held by the United States Treasury provided an innocent explanation for her \u201cmisguided,\u201d \u201cmisinformed,\u201d and \u201ceccentric\u201d conduct. The jury was entitled to discredit Hong\u2019s testimony and treat it as substantive evidence of her guilt. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314 (11th Cir.1995). The district court did not err by denying Hong\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Hong\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
