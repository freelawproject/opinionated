The district court granted the motion, reducing Scott\u2019s sentence by one month. Scott filed a timely notice of appeal, and he argues that the district court should have reduced his sentence below his Guidelines range by the same percentage it departed below his original range. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-19\">We review an order granting or denying a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Munn, </em>595 F.3d 183, 186 (4th Cir.2010). A district court abuses its discretion if it fails or refuses to exercise discretion, or if it relies on an erroneous factual or legal premise. <em>DIRECTV, Inc. v. Rawlins, </em>523 F.3d 318, 323 (4th Cir.2008) (citing <em>James v. Jacobson, </em>6 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"Aeh\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court may modify the term of imprisonment \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced ... based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered,\u201d if the amendment is listed in the Guidelines as retroactively applicable. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(c), p.s. (2010). Amendment 706 of the Guidelines lowered the offense levels for drug offenses involving certain amounts of crack cocaine. Under Amendment 706, a defendant whose offense of conviction involved crack cocaine is eligible for a reduced sentence only if the Amendment lowers his applicable Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Lindsey, </em>556 F.3d 238, 244 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 182, 175 L.Ed.2d 114 (2009); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), p.s. \u201c[T]he decision about whether to reduce a sentence is discretionary on the part of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>595 F.3d 197, 200 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-23\">The Guidelines provide that, where the original term of imprisonment imposed was below a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, \u201ca reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range\u201d may be appropriate following a successful 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>(b)(2)(B). In <em>United States v. Fennell, </em>592 F.3d 506 (4th Cir.2010), we found that the district court committed reversible procedural error where it believed it was required to depart from a defendant\u2019s amended Guidelines range using the same methodology with which it departed from the original Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 509. Here, there is no evidence that the district court believed it lacked authority to calculate the departure using a different method.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Accordingly we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral arguments because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <em>the </em>court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
