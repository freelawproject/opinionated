We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-27\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Wenas established changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the delay in filing his asylum application beyond the one-year deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 656-58 (9th Cir. 2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to Wenas\u2019 asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Wenas did not suffer past persecution based on the two discriminatory incidents he experienced in Indonesia. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1059-60 (being beaten by youths, robbed of sandals and pocket money, and accosted by a threatening mob did not compel a past persecution finding). Thus, contrary to Wenas\u2019 contention, he is not entitled to a presumption of future fear. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003). Further, the record does not compel the conclusion that Wenas demonstrated a clear probability of future persecution in Indonesia. <em>See Ramadan, </em>479 F.3d at 658; <em>Nagoulko, </em>333 F.3d at 1018 (possibility of future persecution too speculative). Accordingly, Wenas\u2019 withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Wenas did not establish a likelihood of torture by, at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity in Indonesia. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-949 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b610-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
