After oral argument, review of the record, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-21\">We have determined, and Peterson does not dispute, that the District Judge advised Peterson about the meaning and effect of the appeal waiver at the time he entered his plea of guilty. The plea agreement stated Peterson \u201cvoluntarily and expressly waives the right to appeal his sentence ... on any ground, except that the defendant may file a direct appeal if the sentence imposed contains a term of imprisonment in excess of twenty-five (25) years.\u201d Peterson\u2019s plea agreement also stated he agreed to \u201cpay any fine and/or restitution imposed by the Court.\u201d The restitution includes any interest imposed by statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(f). Therefore, the appeal-waiver provision in Peterson\u2019s plea agreement covers appeals regarding interest payments on restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
