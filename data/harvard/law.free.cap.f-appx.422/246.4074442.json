The district court sentenced him to be imprisoned for a term of forty-six months. On appeal, Castillo-Felipe\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which she states that she finds no meritorious issues for appeal. Counsel calls two issues to our attention: (1) whether the district court fully complied with the dictates of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 in taking Castillo-Felipe\u2019s guilty plea; and (2) whether Castillo-Felipe\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. The Government elected to file no response. Castillo-Felipe was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Castillo-Felipe has no valid claim to relief. Because Castillo-Felipe did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525-26 (4th Cir. 2002). \u201cTo establish plain error, [Castillo-Felipe] must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Muhammad, </em>478 F.3d 247, 249 (4th Cir.2007). Even if Castillo-Felipe satisfies these requirements, \u201ccorrection of the error remains within [the Court\u2019s] discretion, which [the Court] should not exercise ... unless the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">The district court failed to inform Castillo-Felipe that it would consider the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) in determining his sentence or that he had the right to appointed counsel and to have counsel present at every stage of the proceeding. These errors do not rise to the level of plain error in this case because the record does not evidence a reasonable probability that, but for the errors, Castillo-Felipe would not have entered his plea of guilty. <em>United States v. Massenburg, </em>564 F.3d 337, 343 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">We review a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Castillo-Felipe\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is afforded a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007). We have found nothing in the record to rebut that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Castillo-Felipe\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Castillo-Felipe, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Castillo-Felipe requests that a petition be filed, but counsel be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>lieves that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Castillo-Felipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
