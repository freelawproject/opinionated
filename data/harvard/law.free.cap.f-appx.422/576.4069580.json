Hundal also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to remand. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-18\">As a threshold matter, we decline to review Hundal\u2019s argument that the IJ abused her discretion in granting the government\u2019s motion to reopen. The IJ granted the government\u2019s motion to reopen on August 6, 2004. Hundal did not appeal that decision to the BIA. Although the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s April 21, 2005 decision, pursuant to <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>that decision addressed only the issue of whether Hundal\u2019s asylum application was fraudulent. Hundal thus failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as to the government\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Arreguin-Moreno v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 1229, 1232 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-19\">Where an IJ reopens removal proceedings for the purpose of terminating a grant of asylum, the government has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that \u201c[tjhere is a showing of fraud in the alien\u2019s application such that ... she was not eligible for asylum at the time it was granted.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.24(a)(1) &amp; (f). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>We must uphold the IJ\u2019s factual finding that the asylum application was fraudulent \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">There is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s finding that Hundal\u2019s asylum application was more likely than not fraudulent. Boota Basi, the person who prepared Hundal\u2019s asylum application, testified extensively about the process by which he and his partner, Kashmir Malhi, created fraudulent asylum applications. Basi gave a detailed account of how he had several templates of false stories of which he would change certain biographical and background information to specifically cater to each individual, and that none of the applications he prepared, including Hundal\u2019s, were true. The characteristics of Basi\u2019s work that reappeared in all of the applications he prepared were all apparent in Hundal\u2019s application. The IJ properly assessed Hundal\u2019s testimony and considered Basi\u2019s credibility and any incentive he may have had to testify falsely, and determined that Hundal was not entitled to asylum at the time it was granted. Because a reasonable factfinder would not have been compelled to conclude otherwise, we hold that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Hundal\u2019s asylum application was fraudulent. <em>See I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 88 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">An applicant who fails to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Because Hundal did not present any new evidence in support of her CAT claim that was different from her asylum claim, her CAT claim must also fail. <em>Id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The BIA properly denied Hundal\u2019s motion to remand for adjustment of status based on her marriage to a U.S. citizen that took place during her removal proceeding. A motion to remand for adjustment of status will not be granted on the basis of a marriage entered into during removal proceedings unless the petitioner qualifies for the bona fide marriage exception. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(e); <em>see also Yepremyan v. Holder, </em>614 F.3d 1042, 1044 (9th Cir.2010). To qualify for this exception, the petitioner must present clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that her marriage is bona fide. <em>Yepremyan, </em>614 F.3d at 1044-45 (citing <em>In re Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002)). In denying her motion to remand, the BIA concluded that Hundal did not satisfy the requirements set out in <em>Velarde-Pacheco </em>because Hundal failed to submit sufficient evidence demonstrating a strong likelihood that her marriage is bona fide. <em>See also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.2(a)(l)(iii)(B)(l)-(6) (listing the types of evidence which tend to establish that the marriage is bona fide). The record supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Hundal failed to submit the types of evidence listed in \u00a7 204.2(a)(l)(iii)(B). Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Hundal\u2019s motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Petition for review DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b601-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
