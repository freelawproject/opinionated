Batson <em>claims: </em>The prosecutor gave race-neutral reasons for exercising peremptory challenges to dismiss three African-American jurors. <em>See Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 98, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986); <em>see also Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995) (per curiam). Specifically, G. admitted that her religious beliefs would affect her ability to sit in judgment of Lievanos. W. agreed with the district court that his family\u2019s negative experiences with subprime lenders created \u201cemotional issues with this whole business of subprime lending.\u201d L. wasn\u2019t candid about his previous work for a subprime lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">The district court\u2019s finding that the dismissals weren\u2019t the result of purposeful racial discrimination is supported by the record. <em>See Snyder v. Louisiana, </em>552 U.S. 472, 477, 128 S.Ct. 1203, 170 L.Ed.2d 175 (2008). The prosecutor dismissed for cause a non-minority juror who shared G.\u2019s religious scruples. <em>See Ali v. Hickman, </em>584 F.3d 1174, 1192-93 (9th Cir.2009) (performing a comparative analysis to determine whether minority juror\u2019s religious belief was a pretext for purposeful discrimination). And ample evidence supports the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for dismissing W. and L.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">2. <em>Suppression motion: </em>The record also supports the district court\u2019s finding that Lievanos\u2019s statements to the FBI were voluntary. <em>See United States v. Heller, </em>551 F.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir.2009). The agents interviewed Lievanos in her home; they didn\u2019t coerce her or take any other steps that would have made the interviews custodial. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>372 F.3d 1048, 1060-61 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc); <em>United States v. Haswood, </em>350 F.3d 1024, 1028 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that coercion typically requires \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d). Their observation that Lievanos could go to jail wasn\u2019t a threat because she wasn\u2019t about to be arrested. <em>Cf. United States v. Patayan Soriano, </em>361 F.3d 494, 502-03 (9th Cir.2004). That the agents\u2019 stated reason for interviewing Lievanos was pretextual didn\u2019t render her statements involuntary. <em>See Crawford, </em>372 F.3d at 1060-61 (\u201cTrickery [and] deceit ... do not render a [statement] inadmissible, certainly in noncustodial situations .... \u201d (internal quotation mark omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence: </em>Because Lievanos didn\u2019t renew her Rule 29 motion at the close of evidence, we review this claim \u201conly to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice, or for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarez-Valenzuela, </em>231 F.3d 1198, 1201 (9th Cm.2000). The government introduced extensive evidence that Lievanos was a willing participant in the loan fraud conspiracy and lied to the FBI about the $20,000 check. Based on this evidence, a rational fact-finder could find Lievanos guilty of all charges against her. <em>See United States v. Nevils, </em>598 F.3d 1158, 1161 (9th Cir.2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The jury\u2019s acquittal of Lievanos on wire fraud in connection with one of the loans doesn\u2019t require the reversal of her conviction for laundering the proceeds of that loan. Wire fraud requires \u201cspecific intent to defraud.\u201d <em>United States v. McNeil, </em>320 F.3d 1034, 1040 (9th Cm. 2003); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. Money laundering doesn\u2019t, so there\u2019s no inconsistency between the verdicts. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957(a). Lievanos\u2019s claim that her false statements were lawful \u201cexculpatory no[s]\u201d must fail because there\u2019s no such thing. <em>See Brogan v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 398, 401, 408, 118 S.Ct. 805, 139 L.Ed.2d 830 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">4. <em>Restitution and, sentencing: </em>The district court didn\u2019t abuse its discretion when it ordered Lievanos, in light of her participation in the loan fraud conspiracy, to pay restitution for the entire loss on one of the loans. <em>See United States v. Brock-Davis, </em>504 F.3d 991, 999 (9th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[W]hen the crime of conviction includes ... conspiracy ... the restitution order [may] include acts of related conduct for which the defendant was not convicted.\u201d (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>189 F.3d 838, 846-47 (9th Cir.1999). The jury\u2019s acquittal of Lievanos on one wire fraud charge doesn\u2019t render the restitution order an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Booth, </em>309 F.3d 566, 571, 575-76 (9th Cir.2002) (affmming restitution order for entire loss caused by scheme to defraud when jury convicted on some fraud charges and acquitted on others).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Lievanos conceded the substantive reasonableness of her prison sentence at the start of oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b629-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
