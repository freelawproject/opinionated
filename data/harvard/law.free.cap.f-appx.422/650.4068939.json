We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Perez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Gomez\u2019s second motion to reopen as untimely and numerically barred where the motion was filed over a year and a half after the BIA\u2019s final administrative order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Gomez failed to establish changed circumstances in Mexico to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time and numerical bar for filing motions to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen as to her cancellation of removal claim, because it correctly determined that Gomez had overstayed the period of voluntary departure, and was therefore statutorily ineligible for the requested relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d)(l); <em>Granados-Oseguera v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 1011, 1015-16 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We grant Gomez\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as attorney of record. The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect that Gomez is proceeding pro se. The Clerk shall serve this order on Gomez at the address provided in the certificate of service: 21 S. Canada St. # B, Santa Barbara, CA 93103.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b674-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
