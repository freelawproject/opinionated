In the court below Orr brought inconsistent claims. Orr sought a copy of an agreement allegedly entered into 20 years ago when she had worked as a pharmacist in the United States Army. Orr also claimed that such an agreement did not exist but that the district court should order the Army to enter into an agreement to negotiate a contract to provide her transportation costs for an alleged relocation -that occurred 20 years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-21\">Orr cites no authority that would allow the district .court to entertain her suit against the United States for a contract that does not exist. Even assuming such a 20-year old contract exists that requires payment for her transportation costs, a claim against the United States is barred if not timely brought within six years of its accrual. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-22\">The judgment of dismissal is AFFIRMED. Orr\u2019s motion to strike portions of the Appellee\u2019s brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
