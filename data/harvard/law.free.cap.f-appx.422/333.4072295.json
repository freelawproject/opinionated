The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>district court sentenced him to 210 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. The district court also ordered that Espinosa pay, jointly and severably with his codefendants, $9,000 in restitution. Espinosa appeals, arguing that the district court erred when it applied a six-level guidelines enhancement based on its finding that a ransom demand was made and a two-level guidelines enhancement based on its finding that firearms were used during the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that the demanding of a ransom was the purpose of the offense and was a reasonably foreseeable act of one of Espinosa\u2019s coconspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy, because these findings are plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B); <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 461-62 (5th Cir.2002). The district court also did not clearly err in finding that Espinosa\u2019s co-conspirators pointed pistols at the victims or err in determining that such conduct qualified as \u201cotherwise us[ing]\u201d firearms during the offense conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(3), \u00a7 2A4.1, comment, (n.2); <em>United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 504-06 (5th Cir.2009). Further, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the use of firearms was reasonably foreseeable to Espinosa, as Espinosa viewed his coconspirators in possession of the pistols at the time of the offense. <em>See Solis, </em>299 F.3d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
