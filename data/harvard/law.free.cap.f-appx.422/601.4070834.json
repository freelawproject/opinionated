We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions and review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Barrios v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 849, 854 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Alas-Lemus has waived any challenge to BIA\u2019s finding that his asylum application was untimely by failing to argue the issue in his opening brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Even if Alas-Lemus testified credibly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Alas-Lemus\u2019 withholding of deportation claim because the threats made against him did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000). Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Alas-Lemus failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution because it is too speculative he will be persecuted in El Salvador on account of a protected ground. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (record evidence did not show petitioner had objectively reasonable basis for future fear).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Alas-Lemus did not establish a likelihood of being tortured in El Salvador. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-49 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
