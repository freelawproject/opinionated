Mitchell\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether Mitchell\u2019s sentence is plainly unreasonable. Mitchell, advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, has not done so. The Government has moved to dismiss Mitchell\u2019s appeal to the extent it challenges his sentence, invoking the waiver of appellate rights in Mitchell\u2019s plea agreement. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Manigan, </em>592 F.3d 621, 627 (4th Cir.2010). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 400-01 (4th Cir.2002). The question of whether a defendant validly waived his appeal rights is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. <em>Manigan, </em>592 F.3d at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Mitchell knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence. We therefore grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of Mitchell\u2019s sentence and dismiss this portion of the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no issues that are meritorious and outside the scope of the waiver. We therefore affirm Mitchell\u2019s conviction. This court requires that counsel inform Mitchell, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Mitchell requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Mitchell. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-9\"> Mitchell\u2019s waiver preserved the right to raise sentencing claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct not known to Mitchell at the time of his plea. He does not raise such claims, and we perceive no meritorious claims in our <em>Anders </em>review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
