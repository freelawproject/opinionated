Specifically, Martinez-Pioquinto admitted to knowingly assisting his fiancee to \u201center the United States in violation of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae. The family reunification exception to removability does not aid Martinez-Pioquinto, because it is applicable only to waivers of admissibility, not to the establishment of \u201cgood moral character,\u201d <em>see Sanchez v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 1028, 1032 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc); and even then applies only to aliens who assisted \u201cthe alien\u2019s spouse, parent, son, or daughter (and no other individual)\u201d before May 5, 1988, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(l)(E)(ii). The smuggling incident here occurred after May 5, 1988, and involved petitioner\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, not his wife.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-18\">Like the dissent, we recognize that Martinez-Pioquinto is a sympathetic figure. But like the immigration judge, we are bound by the law as it is, not the law as it might (or should) be. The IJ did not err in denying Martinez-Pioquinto\u2019s application for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-19\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b597-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

While the dissent is correct that the smuggling incident occurred more than ten years before this appeal, it occurred less than three years before the immigration judge rendered his ruling, and the statute required the immigration judge to determine whether MartinezPioquinto had been a person of \"good moral character\u201d during the ten-year period immediately preceding his application for relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>PREGERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AW_\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The majority leans heavily on <em>Sanchez v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 1028 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc). I continue to abide by my view that <em>Sanchez </em>should be overturned because it makes a mockery of our nation\u2019s core values. <em>See id. </em>at 1036 (Pregerson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Like <em>Sanchez, </em>this is a case about a good and industrious husband and father who established a loving home for himself, his wife, Guillermina Carrera Abad (\u201cGuillermina\u201d), and their five American-born citizen children. Martinez-Pioquinto works as an assembler in Anaheim, California, with the same company he has worked for since 1990. He has paid his taxes every year since arriving in the United States. The couple\u2019s children have done well in school. The family attends church together. Martinez-Pioquinto has never been detained by immigration officials and has not been convicted of any criminal misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Martinez-Pioquinto and Guillermina both applied for cancellation of removal based on the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship that their deportation would cause to their qualifying U.S.-citizen children. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). Their second son was born prematurely and suffers from developmental delays and neurological abnormalities. He attends the Rehabilitation Institute in Anaheim, California, to improve his development. The couple\u2019s second daughter suffers from febrile seizures, high fevers, and vomiting. She has difficulty breathing, and has required several emergency room visits. Although she takes medications regularly, doctors have been unable to give her a specific diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) originally denied both Martinez-Pioquinto\u2019s and Guillermina\u2019s applications for cancellation of removal for reasons unrelated to an analysis of whether the U.S.-citizen children would suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d should their parents be deported. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). The IJ denied Guillermina\u2019s application for failure to establish the requisite ten years physical presence for cancellation of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A). The BIA, however, severed Guillei'mina\u2019s case from her husband\u2019s and remanded her case to the IJ because of a change in the law. On remand, the IJ granted Guillermina cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">But the IJ denied Martinez-Pioquinto\u2019s application because he concluded that Martinez-Pioquinto was ineligible for cancellation because he lacked the requisite \u201cgood moral character\u201d to cancel removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(B). That finding was based on Martinez-Pioquinto\u2019s truthful answers to the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) attorney\u2019s questions at his hearing before the IJ on his application for cancellation of removal regarding an incident that occurred now more than ten years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">DHS attorney: The second time that [Guillermina] went back to Mexico [in January 2001], do you know why she went back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">Martinez-Pioquinto: She went back to Mexico because she wanted to see her father, he was sick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">DHS attorney: Okay. Did you accompany her on that occasion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-13\">Martinez-Pioquinto: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-14\">DHS attorney: And how did she come back to the United States?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-15\">Martinez-Pioquinto: That\u2019s the second time she returned. She returned illegally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-16\">DHS attorney: Did she use the assistance of a smuggler?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Martinez-Pioquinto: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">DHS attorney: And you were here in the United States, did you in anyway assist in those arrangements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">Martinez-Pioquinto: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">DHS attorney: And how did you help?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">Martinez-Pioquinto: I paid the money where he could pass her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">DHS attorney: And how much money did you pay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">Martinez-Pioquinto: About $1,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">DHS attorney: And after you paid that money, did he assist her in coming to the United States illegally, the smuggler?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">Martinez-Pioquinto: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">DHS attorney: Nothing further, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">Is such an honest man a man of bad moral character?</p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">In <em>Sanchez, </em>this court held that an alien who arranged for his wife to be smuggled into the United States cannot demonstrate the \u201cgood moral character\u201d necessary to cancel removal. <em>Sanchez, </em>560 F.3d at 1034. As I wrote in my dissent in <em>Sanchez, </em>\u201cthe majority struggle[d] through a labyrinth of complex statutory interpretation to conclude that Congress intended that people like Sanchez be deemed to have \u2018bad moral character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1038 (Pregerson, J., dissenting). As in <em>Sanchez, </em>I find the result here to be absurd. This is not a story about a man with \u201cbad moral character.\u201d It is instead \u201cthe story of a good man making every attempt for himself, his wife, and his [five] American children to live the American dream.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-16\">The en banc panel in <em>Sanchez </em>overturned <em>Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089 (9th Cir.2005) by applying a misguided view of congressional intent. I continue to find the reasoning of <em>Moran </em>to be much more compelling. <em>See Sanchez, </em>560 F.3d at 1038 (Pregerson, J., dissenting). In <em>Moran, </em>we held that Congress intended the \u201cfamily unity\u201d waiver employed in the inadmissibility context to apply to cancellation of removal proceedings, where an \u201cindividual\u2019s involvement in \u2018alien smuggling\u2019 is limited to helping their own family members, including spouses and children.\u201d <em>Moran, </em>395 F.3d at 1090. \u201c[B]y establishing a \u2018family unity\u2019 waiver, Congress has shown that it <em>wants </em>to help immigrant men and women maintain their marriages and families.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>560 F.3d at 1039 (Pregerson, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">Moreover, the result of this case is unconscionable. Martinez-Pioquinto\u2019s wife was granted cancellation of removal based on the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the couple\u2019s American-born citizen children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if their mother were deported, meaning that she successfully demonstrated that her children \u201cwould suffer hardship that is <em>substantially beyond </em>that which would ordinarily be expected to result from [her] deportation.\u201d <em>In re Monreal-Aguinaga, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56, 59 (BIA 2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-19\">In this case, the government is substituting one extreme hardship that U.S.citizen children will suffer with another by deporting the sole breadwinner of the family. Our government has <em>already </em>determined that <em>extreme and unusual hardship </em>will be inflicted on five American-born citizen children if their mother is deported. Martinez-Pioquinto\u2019s deportation will undoubtedly cause his children to suffer the extreme and unusual hardship the government sought to prevent when it canceled the removal of their mother. This absurd result hurts not only the children, but also burdens our government, which will likely have to provide assistance to the family in their father\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>This unconscionable result deprives American-born citizen children of their constitutionally protected right to remain in the country of their birth with their family intact. This outcome is unjust and violates due process. <em>See, e.g., Moore v. City of Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 503-05, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (plurality opinion) (\u201cOur decisions establish that the Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972) (recognizing that \u201c[t]he integrity of the family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d). This suffering inflicted on five American-born citizen children, we are told, is required by <em>Sanchez. </em>But I continue to believe that the opinion in <em>Sanchez </em>\u201cdisregard^] the explicit intent of Congress\u201d to preserve family unity. 560 F.3d at 1039 (Pregerson, J., dissenting). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
