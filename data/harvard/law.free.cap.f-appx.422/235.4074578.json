We affirm Sumpter\u2019s conviction, vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">Sumpter first challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to grant him a two-level reduction of his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. He claims that, because the form of the indictment was such that all three robberies were included as objects in the single conspiracy charge of Count One, he was forced to go to trial on that charge because, despite his admitted involvement in the Friedman\u2019s robbery, he was not guilty of participating in either the Perry Brothers or Ora robber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ies. He asserts that had he pled guilty to Count One, he would necessarily be admitting to participating in the other two robberies even though he did not so participate, and would have exposed himself to sentencing based on conduct of all three robberies, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 lB1.2(d). He claims that, under those unique circumstances, the district court should have granted him an acceptance of responsibility reduction despite the fact he went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to deny an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>289 F.3d 254, 261 (4th Cir.2002). Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, a reduction for acceptance of responsibility is appropriate \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense ...\u201d and \u201cis not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt....\u201d USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, App. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Here, prior to trial, at the time Sumpter pled guilty to the Friedman\u2019s robbery, the Government\u2019s factual proffer set forth all the essential factual elements necessary to convict him of the conspiracy charged in Count One, which count expressly listed the Friedman\u2019s robbery as an overt act in the conspiracy. Accordingly, in light of his plea to the Friedman\u2019s robbery, Sumpter knew or should have known that a reasonable jury would have found him guilty of Count One. As the district court noted, that he sought to put the Government to its burden on Count One as a trial tactic hoping the jury would not convict him of conspiracy in the Friedman\u2019s robbery because he was not guilty of the other two robberies, does not support an acceptance of responsibility reduction. Moreover, while Sumpter did not dispute his guilt on the commission of the Friedman\u2019s robbery, he never admitted his guilt in the conspiracy to commit the Friedman\u2019s robbery, and thus did not fully accept responsibility for all his actions relative to the Friedman\u2019s robbery. The record reveals that the district court carefully considered all the relevant facts and issues relating to Sumpter\u2019s request for an acceptance of responsibility reduction, including whether Sumpter accepted responsibility for all the actions of, and relating to, the Friedman\u2019s robbery. Under these circumstances, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s decision not to award Sumpter an acceptance of responsibility reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Sumpter next argues that the district court failed to adequately explain the term of imprisonment it imposed, contrary to the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) (2006) . Specifically, he asserts that the reasons given by the district court for its sentence, <em>i.e., </em>Sumpter\u2019s career offender status, the 84-month consecutive term for his guilty plea to a \u00a7 924(c) offense, and his violent history, constituted an \u201cunacceptably sparse rationale\u201d and were redundant because all had been considered previously by Congress and the Sentencing Commission in developing the advisory guideline range applicable to Sumpter\u2019s crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence for reasonableness, and \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range,\u201d we apply a \u201cdeferential abuse-of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) . First, we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Only if the sentence is procedurally reasonable can we evaluate the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, again us<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ing the abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009). In our determination of whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, we look to any failure in the calculation (or the improper calculation) of the Guidelines range, the treatment of the Guidelines as mandatory, any failure to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, any selection of a sentence using clearly erroneous facts, and any failure to adequately explain the chosen sentence and any deviation from the advisory Guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented\u201d when rendering a sentence, <em>id., </em>applying the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the specific circumstances of the case and the defendant, and must \u201cstate in open court\u201d the particular reasons supporting its chosen sentence. <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 328; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) (2006). A brief statement of the reasons suffice under \u00a7 3553(c)(1). <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-57, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">We conclude that the reasons stated by the district court following imposition of its 584-month sentence in this case were not sufficiently individualized such that we can conclude that the sentencing court considered Sumpter \u201cas an individual and [his] case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes' mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 52, 128 S.Ct. 586 (internal quotation marks omitted); Carter 564 F.3d at 328. As we stated in <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 584 (4th Cir.2010), \u201ca district court\u2019s explanation of its sentence need not be lengthy, but the court must offer <em>some </em>\u2018individualized assessment\u2019 justifying the sentence imposed and rejection of arguments for a higher or lower sentence based on \u00a7 3553.\u201d We express no view of course on the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The final issue Sumpter raises on appeal is a challenge to the $250,000 fine imposed, on the basis that the district court failed to consider the congressionally-mandated factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572 (2006), as to his ability to pay. The Government agrees that the sentencing court\u2019s failure to make findings concerning Sumpter\u2019s ability to pay a fine prior to ordering payment of the fine constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings with respect to the imposition of a fine under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. <em>United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 665 (4th Cir.1999). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a), the district court, prior to imposing a fine, must consider the defendant\u2019s income, financial resources, and earning capacity, as well as the burden a fine would impose on the defendant or on any person financially dependent on the defendant. The district court\u2019s findings about a defendant\u2019s ability to pay must be made expressly. <em>See United, States v. Castner, </em>50 F.3d 1267, 1277 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Arnoldt, </em>947 F.2d 1120, 1127 (4th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>885 F.2d 181, 182-83 (4th Cir.1989). While the requirement for such findings may be satisfied by the district court\u2019s adoption of the PSR that includes adequate factual findings to allow effective appellate review of the fine imposed, <em>Castner, </em>50 F.3d at 1277, in this case, the probation officer noted that Sumpter had a negative net worth of $2,719 and no income, and concluded that Sumpter was, without the ability to pay a fine in addition to court-imposed restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">On these facts, we find plain error in the district court\u2019s failure to make the required findings relative to Sumpter\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>ability to pay a fine. Accordingly, we affirm Sumpter\u2019s convictions, vacate his sentence, and remand for resentencing. In resentencing, we direct the district court to give specific consideration to <em>Gall </em>and <em>Carter, </em>to make findings concerning Sumpter\u2019s ability to pay a fine, to modify the fine if necessary, and to reconcile the installment payment amounts in the written judgment with the amounts specified during the oral pronouncement of Sumpter\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\">. In furtherance of this conspiracy, the Grand Jury alleged three overt acts: First, that Sumpter and one other person on April 22, 2005, robbed the Perry Brothers jewelry store in Raleigh, North Carolina (\"Perry Brothers\u201d), at gunpoint; second that Sumpter and others on April 29, 2005, robbed the Ora jewelry store in Raleigh, North Carolina (\"Ora\u201d), at gunpoint; and third that Sumpter and others on June 8, 2005, robbed the Friedman\u2019s jewelry store in Dunn, North Carolina (\"Friedman's\u201d), at gunpoint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-15\">. The jury found Sumpter not guilty of Counts Two through Five of the indictment, which charged Hobbs Act and firearms violations relative to the Perry Brothers and Ora robberies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-15\">. The written judgment erroneously states that Sumpter's restitution payment while under supervised release is to be payable in $100 per month installments, while the oral pronouncement of the district court was that such payments be made in $50 per month installments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
