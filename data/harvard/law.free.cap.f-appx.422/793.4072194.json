Thomas argues that her sentence was substantively unreasonable because her crime leading to her revocation was minor, her probation history was otherwise clean, she accepted responsibility, and all parties had agreed that the proper punishment was an anti-theft program.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-18\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Thomas\u2019s sentence. The sentence fell in the middle of the applicable 4-10 month guideline range, and we ordinarily expect guideline sentences to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). And Thomas\u2019s sentence achieved the purposes of sentencing as stated in \u00a7 3553(a). The term of imprisonment, anti-theft program, and restitution deterred Thomas, protected the public from further crimes, took into account the nature of the offense and the characteristics of Thomas, provided Thomas with needed correctional treatment, and provided compensation to Thomas\u2019s victim. The district court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we affirm Thomas\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
