(\u201cState Farm\u201d) on Plaintiffs claim of slander. Plaintiff also appeals the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) order dismissing Plaintiffs tortious-interference-with-a-business-relationship claim. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">Gunder\u2019s is an automobile repair shop in Polk County, Florida. For many years, Gunder\u2019s was a member of State Farm\u2019s \u201cpreferred program.\u201d Repair shops participating in State Farm\u2019s \u201cpreferred program\u201d agree to perform repairs at the cost to which State Farm has agreed to reimburse its insureds: the \u201cprevailing compete itive rate\u201d as determined by State Farm. So, a State Farm insured who selects a \u201cpreferred program\u201d shop is assured that the shop will not charge the customer more than State Farm is willing to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">Gunder\u2019s was terminated from the \u201cpreferred program\u201d in 2004. Gunder\u2019s alleges its termination resulted from its communications with other \u201cpreferred program\u201d repair shops about State Farm\u2019s refusal to pay for certain repair procedures. Gunder\u2019s also alleges that, after its termination, State Farm began \u201csteering\u201d Gunder\u2019s current and potential customers to other shops; that State Farm \u201cintentionally and unjustifiably\u201d interfered with Gunder\u2019s relationship with it customers and prospective customers by telling its insureds that Gunder\u2019s overcharged customers; and that Gunder\u2019s repairs were untimely, inefficient and sub-standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">We review a grant of summary judgment by a district court <em>de novo </em>applying the same legal standards that bound the district court and viewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>favorable to the non-movant. <em>Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Landstar System, Inc. </em>622 F.3d 1307, 1316 (11th Cir.2010). Our review of a grant of a motion to dismiss also is <em>de novo; </em>we accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and construe them in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. CSX Transp., Inc. </em>522 F.3d 1190, 1193-1194 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level ... on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (internal citations omitted). And pleadings offering only labels and legal conclusions couched as factual allegations enjoy no presumption of truth and offer no support to the sufficiency of the complaint. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal</em>,\u2014.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949-50, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">To recover for slander in Florida, the claimant must show (1) publication of a false statement; (2) about the plaintiff; (3) to a third party; and (4) damage resulting to plaintiff from the publication. <em>Furmanite America, Inc. v. T.D. Williamson, Inc., </em>506 F.Supp.2d 1134, 1140 (M.D.Fla.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">To state a claim for tortious interference in Florida, the claimant must show (1) the existence of a business relationship; (2) knowledge of the relationship on the part of the defendant; (3) an intentional and unjustified interference by the defendant; and (4) damage from the breach of the relationship. <em>Gossard v. Adia Servs., Inc., </em>723 So.2d 182, 184 (Fla.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">\n<em>The Slander Claim.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Although denied by State Farm, we assume the statements allegedly made by State Farm disparaging Gunter\u2019s were made and are untrue. Nonetheless, we agree with the district court that State Farm\u2019s statements were privileged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-12\">A communication made in good faith on any subject matter by one having an interest therein, or in reference to which he has a duty, is privileged if made to a person having a corresponding interest or duty, even though it contains matter which would otherwise be actionable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-13\"><em>Nodar v. Galbreath, </em>462 So.2d 803, 809 (Fla.1984) (quoting 19 Fla. Jur.2d <em>Defamation and Privacy </em>\u00a7 58 (1980)). Because all statements were made to State Farm insureds in the context of a claim under a State Farm insurance policy, and because all statements concerned a matter of mutual interest to the insureds and State Farm \u2014 the quality, timeliness and costs of vehicles repairs \u2014 the statements were privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">The privilege raises a presumption of good faith on the part of the speaker, but the privilege is not absolute. The privilege is forfeited if the statements are made with express malice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-15\">[wjhere a person speaks upon a privileged occasion, but the speaker is motivated more by a desire to harm the person defamed than by a purpose to protect the personal or social interest giving rise to the privilege, then it can be said that there was express malice and the privilege is destroyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 811. As long as the communication is motivated by a desire to protect the interest giving rise to the privilege, the privilege is not forfeited merely because hostility or ill will also are felt by the speaker. <em>Id. </em>at 812. And \u201c[wjhile malice may be inferred from the communication, it is not inferable from the mere fact that the statements are untrue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810, <em>quoting Coogler v. Rhodes, </em>38 Fla. 240, 21 So. 109, 112 (1897). To overcome the privilege and recover for slander, a plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>bears the burden of showing express malice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Gunder\u2019s failed to proffer sufficient evidence of express malice to raise a material issue of fact for a jury. The statements of which Gunter\u2019s complains \u2014 even assuming their falsity \u2014 supports no inference of malice, and Gunter\u2019s failed to proffer extrinsic evidence of express malice. Summary judgment was due on Gunder\u2019s slander claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">\n<em>The Tortious-Interference Claim.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Gunder\u2019s makes no allegation that State Farm interfered with customers or prospective customers of Gunder\u2019s who were not State Farm insureds. As a matter of law, \u201c[tjhere can be no claim [for tortious interference with a business relationship] where the action complained of is undertaken to safeguard or promote one\u2019s financial or economic interest.\u201d <em>Barco Holdings, LLC v. Terminal Inv. Corp., </em>967 So.2d 281, 293 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007) (second alteration in original), <em>quoting Genet Co. v. Annheuser-Busch, Inc., </em>498 So.2d 683, 684 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Because State Farm is obligated to indemnify its insureds for repair work done on its insureds\u2019 cars, State Farm is no stranger to the business relationship between Gunder\u2019s and customers who are insured by State Farm. <em>See id.; see also Palm Beach County Health Care Dist. v. Prof. Medical Educ., Inc., </em>13 So.3d 1090, 1094 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009) (\u201c[u]nder Florida law, a defendant is not a stranger to a business relationship, and thus cannot be held liable for tortious interference, when it has a supervisory interest in how the relationship is conducted or a potential financial interest in how a contract is performed.\u201d). Allegations set out in the complaint show that State Farm had a protectible interest in the relationship between Gunder\u2019s and State Farm insureds. In the light of that protectible interest, the First Amended Complaint failed to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Gunder\u2019s argues that if State Farm is considered to enjoy a privilege which otherwise protects State Farm from a tortious-interference claim, State Farm lost that privilege: \u201ca tortious interference claim may succeed if improper methods were used.\u201d <em>KMS Restaurant Corp. v. Wendy\u2019s International, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 1321, 1327 (11th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But, as the district court determined in denying Gunter\u2019s motion for reconsideration, Gunder\u2019s failed to raise its \u201cimproper means\u201d argument in response to State Farm\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion; and, in arguing improper means in the motion for reconsideration, Gunder\u2019s relied on paragraphs of the complaint that had been stricken earlier by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">On appeal, Gunder\u2019s cites \u2014 for the first time \u2014 paragraph 19 of the amended complaint to claim it pleaded improper means. Even if Gunder\u2019s has preserved this argument, the only arguably improper means Gunder\u2019s alleged in Paragraph 19 are the statements Gunder\u2019s claims State Farm made to its insureds about the costs, quality, and timeliness of Gunder\u2019s repairs. These statements are the same statements upon which Gunder\u2019s grounds its slander claims. Even assuming the falsity of those statements, as earlier discussed, those statements were privileged; they fail to show the improper means needed to defeat State Farm\u2019s privilege against a tortious<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>interference claim. <em>See Networkip, LLC v. Spread Enterprises, Inc., </em>922 So.2d 355, 358 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006) (\u201ca cause of action for tortious interference requires a showing of both intent to damage the business relationship and a lack of justification to take the action which caused the damage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\"> The privilege may also be forfeited if \"malice is the <em>sole </em>basis for the interference. In other words, the party must be interfering <em>solely </em>out of spite, to do harm, or for some other bad <em>motive.\" KMS Restaurant Corp., </em>361 F.3d at 1326, <em>quoting Ernie Haire Ford, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>260 F.3d 1285, 1294 n. 9 (11th Cir.2001). We have already noted in our discussion of the slander claim that Gunder's failed to proffer sufficient evidence of malice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
