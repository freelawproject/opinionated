FLAUM, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b570-4\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Lervon Campbell pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and received the 15-year mandatory minimum sentence to run concurrent to an unrelated state sentence he was then serving. We vacated the sentence on appeal and remanded the case so that the district court could exercise its discretion to adjust Campbell\u2019s sentence to account for the time he had served on his undischarged state term. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>617 F.3d 958, 961-62 (7th Cir. 2010). On remand the district court granted Campbell\u2019s request to make the sentences fully concurrent and adjusted his sentence downward to account for the 24 months that Campbell already had served in state prison. Campbell now appeals his new sentence, but his appointed counsel has concluded that the appeal is frivolous and seeks to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We invited Campbell to comment on counsel\u2019s submission, <em>see </em>CIR. R. 51(b), but he did not respond. Our review is limited to the potential issue identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Cano-Rodriguez, </em>552 F.3d 637, 638 (7th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The only issue that counsel considers raising is whether Campbell could challenge the district court\u2019s determination, at his initial sentencing, that he qualified as a career offender under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Counsel considers whether Campbell could argue that the ACCA does not apply to him because his three qualifying burglary convictions did not involve illegal entries of a \u201cdwelling,\u201d as required under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) of the Sentencing Guidelines. But as counsel points out, this argument is not only frivolous, but also waived because, in his plea agreement, Campbell stipulated that he qualified as an ACC for having three qualifying burglary convictions. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>230 F.3d 1054, 1058-59 (7th Cir.2000). Moreover, the law-of-the-case doctrine would preclude Campbell from challenging the career-offender penalty for the first time in this successive appeal. <em>See United States v. Sumner, </em>325 F.3d 884, 891 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Even if Campbell could raise the issue, it would be fruitless to argue that Campbell did not qualify as an armed career criminal. \u201c[A] person has been convicted of burglary for purposes of a \u00a7 924(e) enhancement if he is convicted of any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <em>see United States v. Woods, </em>233 F.3d 482, 485 (7th Cir.2000). Thus burglary includes breaking into structures not limited to residential dwellings, <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 576, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <em>United States v. Gallman, </em>907 F.2d 639, 644 (7th Cir.1990), and his convictions count four purposes of \u00a7 924(e). The Supreme Court specifically rejected Campbell\u2019s belief that a burglary only qualifies if it involves a residential dwelling. <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 576, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Accordingly, we GRANT the motion to withdraw and DISMISS Campbell\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
