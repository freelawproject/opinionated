He argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court did not consider his cultural assimilation and his mental illness. He has failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-the-guidelines sentence on appellate review. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). The district court considered and rejected his arguments for a below-the-guidelines sentence and determined that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range was appropriate. Beltran-Castro has not shown that the district court erred in balancing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; his arguments reflect a disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the factors. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Given the deference due to a district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and its reasons for the sentencing decision, Beltran-Castro has not demonstrated that his 27-month within-the-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-23\">Beltran-Castro asserts that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the goals of \u00a7 3553(a) in part because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis. As he acknowledges, this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>nied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). This court may not overrule the decision of a prior panel in the absence of en banc consideration or a superceding Supreme Court decision. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Beltran-Castro further contends that the sentence imposed by the district court was excessive because it failed to account for the sentence disparity between defendants sentenced in fast-track programs and those like Beltran-Castro who cannot avail themselves of such programs. As he concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 563 &amp; n. 4, and this court may not overrule the decision of a prior panel in the absence of en banc consideration or a superceding Supreme Court decision. <em>See Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d at 313 n. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
