Brunson argues that the district court clearly erred in imposing a two-level vulnerable victim adjustment to his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) because the victim\u2019s age and Brunson\u2019s parental relationship to the victim had already been taken into account by two other separate guidelines enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ments. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2G2.1(b)(l)(A); \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(5). He contends that the double-counting is proscribed by the application notes to the vulnerable victim Guideline. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3A1.1, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u201c[T]he determination of whether a victim is vulnerable is a factual finding that the district court is best-suited to make.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilcox, </em>631 F.3d 740, 753-54 (5th Cir.2011). We \u201creview the district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines <em>de novo,\u201d </em>and \u201ca finding of unusual vulnerability for clear error and to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion was plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>119 F.3d 1205, 1218 (5th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Based on the testimony presented at sentencing, the district court found that the victim was especially vulnerable. This finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole and, thus, is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Somner, </em>127 F.3d 405, 406-07 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Robinson, </em>119 F.3d at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Brunson further argues that the district court plainly erred in assessing two points for his 1999 conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, resulting in his placement in criminal history category II. The Government concedes that the district court\u2019s assessment of two criminal history points for the 1999 conviction was clear and obvious error for purposes of plain error review but contends that Brunson fails to show that the error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">As Brunson concedes, plain error review applies because he did not object to the calculation of his criminal history score in the district court. <em>See United States v. Jasso, </em>587 F.3d 706, 709 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The district court\u2019s assessment of two criminal history points based on Brunson\u2019s 1999 unauthorized use of a motor vehicle conviction was clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d 382, 385 (5th Cir.2006); \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l)~(3); \u00a7 4A1.2(k)(2)(B). Because Brunson\u2019s 360-month sentence was 33 months above the upper end of the correct advisory guidelines range, Brunson has demonstrated that his substantial rights were affected and that the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See United, States v. Jones, </em>596 F.3d 273, 277 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 93, 178 L.Ed.2d 58 (2010); <em>United States v. John, </em>597 F.3d 263, 285-86 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Accordingly, we vacate Brunson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
