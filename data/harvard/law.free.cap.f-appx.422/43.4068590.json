June 18, 2010), <em>affg </em>No. A088 663 118 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 11, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-19\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions. <em>Yun-Zui Gum v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir.2007). \u201cWe defer to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mulcasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies in his statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. In finding Liu not credible, the IJ reasonably relied in part on Liu\u2019s unresponsive demeanor while testifying about his claim for relief based on his membership in an underground church in China. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2005). The IJ also reasonably relied on inconsistencies in the record regarding whether Liu had ever been arrested and when government officials had raided his underground church. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 163-64, 166-67. Moreover, a reasonable fact finder would not be compelled to credit Liu\u2019s explanations for these inconsistencies. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81. Thus, we find no error in the agency\u2019s denial of Liu\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief on credibility grounds insofar as those claims were based on his purported membership in an underground church, <em>see Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006), and we need not consider his additional arguments related to those claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">As to Liu\u2019s claim that he fears persecution and torture for having illegally departed China, the agency reasonably noted that punishment for violating a generally applicable criminal law does not constitute persecution. <em>See Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992). Moreover, we have held that an applicant, such as Liu, cannot demonstrate that he will more likely than not be tortured \u201cbased <em>solely </em>on the fact that [he] is part of the large class of persons who have left China illegally\u201d and on generalized evidence indicating that torture occurs in Chinese prisons. <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, we find no error in the agency\u2019s denial of Liu\u2019s application for relief insofar as it was based on his purportedly illegal departure from China.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
