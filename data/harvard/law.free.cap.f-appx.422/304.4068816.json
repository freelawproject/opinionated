We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s assessment of facts and circumstances affecting the timeliness of Alvarez-Miranda\u2019s asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Nakimbugwe v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 281, 284 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Alvarez-Miranda argues that the IJ and BIA erred in denying his withholding of removal claim because he had not established that there was a clear probability that he would be persecuted based on his membership in his politically active family. He asserts that the IJ and BIA erred in not finding that his family was a cognizable social group; that he was active in his brother\u2019s political campaign; and that he faces the same risks of future persecution that his brother faces. He also asserts that he was not required to show that he suffered a physical injury to show that he suffered persecution and that the IJ erred in excluding various articles that mentioned his brother\u2019s name. He has not shown that the evidence compels a conclusion contrary to the BIA and IJ\u2019s determination that he failed to show a clear probability that he would suffer future persecution. <em>See Hongyok v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir.2007). He has not shown that the IJ erred in considering that several members of his family, including two siblings, his ex-wife, and his child, still live in Nicaragua and have not suffered specific threats or actual attacks by Sandinista party members. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 193 (5th Cir.2004). He has not shown that the IJ erred in not reaching the issue of whether his family was a particular social group because he failed to show a clear probability of future persecution. <em>See Hongyolc, </em>492 F.3d at 549. He has not shown that the IJ erred in excluding the articles concerning his brother or that this affected his eligibility for withholding of removal; the Department of Homeland Security stipulated that his brother, Bronley, was the mayor of Dario, Nicaragua, that Bronley came to the United States, and that Bronley spoke to United States embassy officials in Nicaragua concerning political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>matters. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
