We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the determination that a complaint lacks arguable substance in law or fact, and review for an abuse of discretion the denial of leave to file a complaint in forma pauperis. <em>Tripati v. First Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust, </em>821 F.2d 1368, 1369 (9th Cir.1987). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Dalton\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis because it appears from the face of the complaint that the action is Uee/c-barred. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (an action for damages is not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 if \u201ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence ... unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated\u201d); <em>see also Tripati, </em>821 F.2d at 1370 (\u201cA district court may deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis at the outset if it appears from the face of the proposed complaint that the action is frivolous or without merit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">Dalton\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>We instruct the clerk to file Dalton\u2019s motion to recuse the district judge, and deny the motion as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
