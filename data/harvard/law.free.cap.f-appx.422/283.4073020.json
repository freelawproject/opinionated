On appeal, Rasnick asserts that her sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to state why a sentence above the three-to-nine-month Guidelines range was appropriate and that her sentence was substantively unreasonable. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-24\">This court reviews a sentence imposed upon revocation of a defendant\u2019s supervised release to determine whether the sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006). In determining whether a revocation sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable,\u201d we must first determine whether the sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 438. Although a sentencing court must consider the Chapter Seven policy statements and the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in fashioning its sentence, the sentencing court retains broad discretion to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum. 461 F.3d at 439. Moreover, \u201ca court\u2019s statement of its reasons for going beyond non-binding <em>policy statements </em>in imposing a sentence after revoking a defendant\u2019s supervised release term need not be as specific as has been required when courts departed from [pre-Booker<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> mandatory] guidelines\u201d at sentencing for criminal offenses. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see United States v. Thompson, </em>595 F.3d 544, 547 (4th Cir.2010) (\u201cA court need not be as detailed or specific when imposing a revocation sentence as it must be when imposing a post-conviction sentence.\u201d). Only if the defendant demonstrates that the sentence is unreasonable will we consider whether the sentence was \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">With these standards in mind, we have reviewed the record on appeal and conclude that the sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable and that the district court adequately explained its reasons for sentencing Rasnick to the statutory maximum sentence of twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\">. Contrary to Rasnick\u2019s argument on appeal, not every \u00a7 3553 factor applies to sentences imposed pursuant to a revocation of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2010); <em>see also Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-23\"><em>.
