The Commissioner has filed a motion to remand, which Marcinek opposes. For the reasons that follow, we will grant the motion to remand, dismiss the appeal, and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we include only those background facts necessary to our decision. Marcinek failed to file federal income tax returns for several years. The IRS sent him notices of deficiency for those years and, when he did not challenge the notices, the IRS assessed his tax liability. Marcinek did not pay the assessed amount and, in March 2007, the IRS issued a notice of intent to file a notice of federal tax liens (\u201cNFTL\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">Marcinek appealed to the IRS Office of Appeals, which upheld the NFTL filing after a Collection Due Process hearing. Marcinek then filed a petition in the Tax Court in February 2008. On the Commissioner\u2019s motion, the matter was remanded to the IRS Office of Appeals for a supplemental decision, but the Tax Court retained jurisdiction. After a second Collection Due Process hearing before the IRS Office of Appeals, the IRS upheld the NFTL filing, and, proceedings in the Tax Court resumed. The Commissioner filed in the Tax Court a motion for summary judgment; the Tax Court granted that motion on March 15, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">Unbeknownst to the Commissioner and the Tax Court, Marcinek filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in January 2010, while the Tax Court proceedings were pending. The Bankruptcy Court issued a discharge order on May 3, 2010. <em>See In re Thomas J. Marcinek, </em>D.N.J. Bankr.No. 10-bk-12088. The IRS learned of Marcinek\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings and, when Marcinek initiated this appeal, the Commissioner filed a motion to remand the matter to the Tax Court, arguing that the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s automatic stay provision, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a), rendered the Tax Court\u2019s decision void, thus depriving this Court of jurisdiction over Marcinek\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">When a petitioner seeks a discharge in bankruptcy, \u00a7 362(a)(8) imposes an automatic stay on \u201cthe commencement or continuation of a proceeding before the United States Tax Court ... concerning the tax liability of a debtor who is an individual for a taxable period ending before the date of the order of relief under [the Bankruptcy Code].\u201d The stay remains in place, absent a Bankruptcy Court order, until the bankruptcy proceedings are terminated. <em>See </em>\u00a7 362(c)(2), (d). A decision rendered in violation of the stay is void <em>ab initio, </em>and we lack jurisdiction to review such decisions. <em>See Mar. Elec. Co., Inc. v. United Jersey Bank, </em>959 F.2d 1194, 1206-OS (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We agree with the Commissioner that Marcinek\u2019s initiation of bankruptcy proceedings had the effect of staying his Tax Court case. Because the Tax Court granted summary judgment for the Commissioner while the bankruptcy proceedings were pending, the Tax Court\u2019s decision was void <em>ab initio, </em>and we lack jurisdiction to entertain Marcinek\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Because Marcinek has since received a discharge in bankruptcy, the automatic stay imposed by \u00a7 362(a)(8) is no longer in effect, and the Tax Court may proceed with his case. Accordingly, we will grant the motion to remand, dismiss the appeal, and remand the matter to the Tax Court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
