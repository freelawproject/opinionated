We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, <em>see Iturribarria v. INS, 321 </em>F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-22\">In her opening brief, Margaryan does not challenge the denial of her asylum claim as untimely, the dispositive adverse credibility determination based on testimonial inconsistencies with her original declaration, or the denial of her CAT claim. Accordingly, Margaryan does not challenge the BIA\u2019s March 22, 2007, order dismissing her underlying appeal. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Margaryan\u2019s motion to reopen because she filed it over eight months after the BIA\u2019s March 22, 2007, dismissal of her underlying appeal, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Margaryan failed to establish grounds for equitable tolling due to her lack of diligence, <em>see Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (noting that equitable tolling is available \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">No. 07-71247: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">No. 08-70665: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
