We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">Muradyan fears persecution from unknown members of the government who sought information regarding the murder of his former employer. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Muradyan did not establish that he was or would be persecuted on account of an actual or imputed political opinion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (to reverse the agency\u2019s finding \u201cwe must find that the evidence not only <em>supports </em>that conclusion, but <em>compels </em>it\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Sangha, </em>103 F.3d at 1489-90. Accordingly, Muradyan\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-20\">Muradyan\u2019s contention that the BIA erred by not addressing his CAT claim is belied by the record. Muradyan does not otherwise challenge the denial of his CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b651-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
