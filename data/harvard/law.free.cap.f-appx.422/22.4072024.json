Videla denying Wan\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Lihua Wan, </em>No. A098 674 756 (B.I.A. May 21, 2010), <em>affg </em>No. A098 674 756 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 3, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">In the circumstances of this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513-14 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that Wan did not establish extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness of her asylum application. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Although we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we do not have jurisdiction to review Wan\u2019s argument that she established such extraordinary circumstances on the theory that she was misled by an immigration attorney, because that assertion \u201cessentially disputes the correctness of the IJ\u2019s fact-finding or the wisdom of his exercise of discretion,\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006). Therefore, so much of Wan\u2019s petition as seeks asylum is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-16\">We turn next to Wan\u2019s claim for withholding of removal. On appeal, Wan challenges the BIA\u2019s finding that Wan did not establish past persecution based upon a forcible abortion on the ground that her testimony was not credible. Upon our review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Here, the agency reasonably found that Wan\u2019s testimony was inconsistent as to why Wan obtained an ultrasound, whether Wan immediately went into hiding following the ultrasound, the timing of her alleged forced abortion, and the circumstances of Wan\u2019s passport application. Wan\u2019s attempt to explain these inconsistencies as a product of her relatives\u2019 confusion is not compelling. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cA petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be <em>compelled </em>to credit his testimony.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-17\">Even assuming that the record does not support the IJ\u2019s finding that Wan inconsistently explained how she learned of the immigration agency that aided her in applying for adjustment of status, it is not necessary to vacate the agency\u2019s credibility determination. The BIA indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>this finding was not central to its decision, and there were \u201cample, error-free grounds that provide substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>Singh v. BIA </em>438 F.3d 145, 149 (2d Cir.2006). Because the IJ reasonably relied upon several inconsistencies in Wan\u2019s testimony and between her testimony and supporting documents, we conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility' determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Thus, \u201c \u2018we can state with confidence that the IJ would adhere to his decision were the petition remanded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Singh, </em>438 F.3d at 149 (quoting <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>434 F.3d at 161); <em>see also Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c[W]e are not required to remand where there is no realistic possibility that, absent the errors, the IJ or BIA would have reached a different conclusion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Once the BIA reasonably found that Wan\u2019s testimony was not credible, it was Wan\u2019s burden to provide corroboration to rehabilitate her testimony. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2007) (observing that once an asylum applicant\u2019s testimony has been called into question, an IJ can \u201c[rel]y on the lack of corroborative evidence\u201d in denying withholding of removal). Here, Wan argues that the BIA erred in discounting her corroborating documents from China. The BIA, however, reasonably concluded that the letters from Wan\u2019s family did not corroborate her testimony because they were inconsistent with her testimony. Even if credited, the abortion certificate that Wan proffered demonstrates only that Wan had an abortion, without providing any corroboration of her testimony that the abortion was involuntary. <em>See </em>CAR at 356 (abortion certificate); <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 342 (stating that the weight afforded to the applicant\u2019s evidence \u201clies largely within the discretion of the IJ\u201d (internal alteration and quotation marks omitted)). Because Wan\u2019s corroborative evidence did not rehabilitate her questionable testimony, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Biao Yang, </em>496 F.3d at 273, the BIA did not err in concluding that Wan had not established past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal based upon future persecution, an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b). Wan argues that the agency erred in finding that she did not establish a likelihood of persecution based upon her desire to have more children in China. Her argument, however, is unavailing because her claimed fear of future persecution is too speculative to compel relief. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam) (holding that, absent sufficient support in the record for petitioner\u2019s assertion that he would be subjected to persecution in China because of his desire to have more children, his fear was \u201cspeculative at best\u201d). Therefore, so much of Wan\u2019s petition as seeks withholding of removal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Finally, because Wan does not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that she did not establish eligibility for CAT relief, we conclude that any such challenge has been waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
