Harrell appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s summary judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that defendants unlawfully accused him of theft. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>363 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir.2004). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record, <em>Thompson v. Paul, </em>547 F.3d 1055, 1058-59 (9th Cir.2008), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims because defendants\u2019 complaint to the police and execution of the sworn criminal complaint, without more, did not convert them into state actors. <em>See Collins v. Womancare, </em>878 F.2d 1145, 1155 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-22\">Summary judgment was properly granted on the malicious prosecution claim because Harrell failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the prosecutors\u2019 decisions were influenced by any information misreported or withheld by defendants. <em>See Richer v. Poisson, </em>137 Or.App. 157, 903 P.2d 932, 935 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Summary judgment was properly granted on the false arrest and false imprisonment claims because Harrell failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was unlawfully confined. <em>See Hiber v. Creditors Collection Serv. of Lincoln Cnty., Inc., </em>154 Or.App. 408, 961 P.2d 898, 901 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on the slander, libel, and defamation claims because Harrell failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants\u2019 statements were not privileged. <em>See DeLong v. Yu Enters., Inc., </em>334 Or. 166, 47 P.3d 8, 10 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because Harrell failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants engaged in outrageous conduct. <em>See House v. Hicks, </em>218 Or.App. 348, 179 P.3d 730, 736-37 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on the negligence claims because Harrell failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants\u2019 conduct \u201cforeseeably pose[d] an unreasonable risk of harm\u201d to him. <em>Cain v. Rijken, </em>300 Or. 706, 717 P.2d 140, 145 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">We are unpersuaded by Harrell\u2019s remaining contentions, including his contention that the district court abused its discretion by denying him further discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Harrell\u2019s \u201cObjection and Motion to Strike\u201d is granted in part as to pages 141-42 of the supplemental excerpts of record and footnotes 4-5 on page 23 of the answering brief.
