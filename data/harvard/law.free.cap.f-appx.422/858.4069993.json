Deoliveira argues on appeal the district court incorrectly calculated his loss amount by including $230,000 in funds based on his statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>to a confidential informant that he had previously laundered that amount. Deoliveira also argues the district court clearly erred in applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1(b)(3)(B) enhancement for using sophisticated means to launder funds, and his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, and having the benefit of oral argument, we affirm Deoliveira\u2019s sentence. The district court did not clearly err in calculating Deoliveira\u2019s loss amount, which was supported by corroborating evidence, nor did it clearly err in applying the sophisticated means enhancement based on Deoliveira\u2019s use of layering. Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Deoliveira to a within-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
