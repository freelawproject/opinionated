R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">California state prisoner Hugh Garcia appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Garcia contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling due to the absence of Spanish language legal materials in the prison law library. This claim fails because, although Garcia has submitted some evidence that he attempted to procure both legal assistance and legal materials in Spanish, he has not shown that, throughout the period for which tolling is sought, he was diligently pursuing \u201ceither legal materials in his own language or translation assistance from an inmate, library personnel, or other source.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. Carey, </em>449 F.3d 1065, 1070 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Garcia also claims that he is entitled to equitable tolling due to his mental incompetence. Garcia has presented considerable evidence that he suffers from a delusional disorder. Moreover, the crux of the claims in his petition is that his constitutional rights were violated when he was permitted to represent himself at trial notwithstanding this disorder. For these reasons, remand is warranted for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Garcia\u2019s delusional disorder is an extraordinary circumstance that prevented a timely federal filing. <em>See Holland v. Florida,</em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2560-62, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010); <em>Laws v. Lamarque, </em>351 F.3d 919 (9th Cir.2003) (remand warranted for good-faith allegation that would, if true, support equitable tolling).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">We construe Garcia\u2019s remaining arguments as a motion to expand the certificate of appealability. So construed, the motion is denied. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22 \u2014 1(e); <em>see also Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b609-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
