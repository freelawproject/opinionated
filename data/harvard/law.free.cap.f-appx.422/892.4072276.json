Ingram filed an action at the Board challenging OPM\u2019s denial of his application for disability retirement. The Board affirmed OPM\u2019s decision, finding that the record did not show that Ingram suffered any medical condition requiring his absence from the workplace or affecting his ability to perform the essential duties of his job. In considering Ingram\u2019s claim, the administrative judge noted, inter alia, that the Social Security Administration (SSA) had denied his claim for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-23\">OPM indicates that on May 2, 2010, after the administrative judge\u2019s decision, the SSA awarded Ingram disability benefits. OPM states that the Board should consider this award of benefits along with the other evidence of disability. We grant the motion so that the Board may consider the award of disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-24\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b916-25\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b916-26\">The motion to remand is granted. The Board\u2019s decision is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
