The district court sentenced Madrigal to seventy months\u2019 imprisonment. Madrigal\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating his opinion that there are no meritorious issue for appeal but questioning whether Madrigal\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and whether Madrigal\u2019s trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective. Madrigal filed a pro se supplemental brief asserting that he was entitled to a substantial assistance departure pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2004), and that the district court erred in failing to apply the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2006) safety valve. The Government has declined to file a responsive brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">First, counsel questions whether Madrigal\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary. Because Madrigal did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525-26 (4th Cir.2002). To establish plain error, Madrigal \u201cmust show: (1) an error was made; (2) the error is plain; and (3) the error affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Massenburg, </em>564 F.3d 337, 342-43 (4th Cir.2009) (reviewing unpreserved Rule 11 error). \u201cThe decision to correct the error lies within [this Court\u2019s] discretion, and [the Court] exercise[s] that discretion only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343 (internal quotation marks omitted). Ater a careful review of the record, we conclude that no error, plain or otherwise, was committed during the district court\u2019s acceptance of Madrigal\u2019s guilty plea, which was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">Next counsel questions whether Madrigal\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. James, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). To allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance generally should be brought in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Because our review of the record reveals that ineffective assistance of counsel is not conclusively established, this claim is not cognizable on direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Next, Madrigal asserts that he was entitled to a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure. District courts can \u201creview a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive.\u201d <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Madrigal\u2019s plea agreement states that the Government \u201cmay\u201d make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, but clearly leaves the decision of whether to move for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure to the sole discretion of the Government. When, as here, the plea agreement imposed no binding obligation, even if the defendant cooperated \u201cfully and truthfully,\u201d the decision whether to make the motion lies with the government. <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>22 F.3d 84, 87 (4th Cir.1994). In this case, the Government made no promises that it would move for a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure, nor does Madrigal allege that the Government\u2019s refusal to make such a motion was based on an unconstitutional motive. Accordingly, Madi'igal failed to demonstrate he was entitled to a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Lastly, Madrigal contends that he should have been eligible for the safety valve reduction. A district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant has satisfied the safety valve criteria is a question of fact reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>114 F.3d 429, 432 (4th Cir.1997). This deferential standard of review permits reversal only if this court is \u201c \u2018left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). To qualify for the safety valve provision, the defendant must establish the existence of five prerequisites. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2006); USSG \u00a7 5C1.2. The burden is on the defendant to prove that all five safety valve requirements have been met. <em>United States v. Beltran-Ortiz, </em>91 F.3d 665, 669 (4th Cir.1996). Because of Madrigal\u2019s passport fraud conviction, he had two criminal history points. Therefore, Madrigal does not satisfy the statutory requirement that the defendant have no more than one criminal history point. Accordingly, the district court did not err, clearly or otherwise, in finding that Madrigal did not qualify for the safety valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform Madrigal, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Madrigal requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Madrigal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
