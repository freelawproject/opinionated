The IJ\u2019s decision denied withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision in this case because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001) (noting that we review the BIA\u2019s decision; but \u201c[ijnsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well\u201d). We review <em>de novo </em>legal determinations of the BIA. <em>Id. </em>And we review fact determinations under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test\u201d whereby we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation and internal quotation omitted). We \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the [BIA\u2019s] decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision\u201d; and we may reverse the BIA\u2019s fact determinations \u201conly when the record compels a reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show \u201cthat [her] life or freedom would be threatened on account of\u2019 a protected ground, including membership in a particular social group. <em>Delgado v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 860-61 (11th Cir.2007). The alien must demonstrate that one of the protected grounds \u201cwas or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">An alien seeking withholding of removal bears the burden of demonstrating that she \u201cmore-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon\u201d return to the country in question. <em>Delgado, </em>487 F.3d at 861. The alien may satisfy this burden by establishing either (1) past persecution on account of a protected ground, or (2) a future threat to her life or freedom on a protected ground if returned. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Petitioner alleged that she suffered persecution at the hands of a gang called Maras. One morning, gang members demanded money from Petitioner as she was walking to work. Petitioner gave the gang members money and, thereafter, she had to give them money every month. One day, Petitioner had no money and the gang members kidnaped her. The gang members then demanded money from Petitioner\u2019s parents, who complied. The gang members released Petitioner and warned her not to report them to the police. Petitioner then moved to her grandmother\u2019s house. But the gang members continued to demand money from her; and she fled to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">The IJ denied relief because, among other reasons, Petitioner\u2019s claims of persecution lacked a nexus to a protected ground. The BIA agreed, noting that Petitioner\u2019s proffered social group \u2014 that of \u201cdecent young women\u201d \u2014 was overly broad and that, even if such a group existed, Petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>er did not show that the gang targeted her because of her membership in that group. On appeal, Petitioner argues that she demonstrated eligibility for relief based on her membership in the social group of \u201cdecent young women.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">After review, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner showed no protected ground; and we are not compelled to reverse the BIA\u2019s decision. Nothing indicates that the extortion and kidnaping Petitioner suffered occurred because of her membership in the \u201cdecent young women\u201d social group. Instead, the evidence indicates that the gang members targeted her, and later, her parents, because they wanted money. Being targeted for extortion does not suffice to show persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Rivera v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 821-23 (11th Cir.2007) (involving a wealthy petitioner\u2019s refusal to pay a guerilla group\u2019s \u201cwar tax\u201d); <em>see also Ruiz v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that \u201cevidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence ... or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground\u201d). Thus, even assuming without deciding that \u201cdecent young women\u201d constitutes a statutorily protected ground, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner simply was a victim of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Because Petitioner has not shown that she suffered persecution because of a protected ground, she has not met her burden of showing eligibility for withholding of removal; and we affirm the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\">. Petitioner raises no challenge to the portion of IJ's decision denying relief under the Convention Against Torture; so that issue is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). To the extent Petitioner challenges the denial of asylum, we lack jurisdiction because the IJ and BIA concluded that the asylum application was time-barred. <em>See Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that we lack jurisdiction, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), to review an IJ\u2019s untimeliness ruling). So, we dismiss the petition for review on asylum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-14\">. Petitioner filed her applications for relief in 2008. Therefore, the provisions of the REAL ID Act of 2005 applied to her applications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b862-6\">. Petitioner also argues that the IJ erred in concluding that she was not credible. But we need not address this argument because we are reviewing only the BIA\u2019s decision; and the BIA did not base its decision on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
