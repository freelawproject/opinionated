Broadway pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and one count of possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense. He was sentenced to serve a 240-month prison term on the drug count as well as a consecutive 60-month prison term on the firearms conviction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">In the sole issue raised on appeal, Broadway argues that the district court erred by sentencing him to a consecutive mandatory five-year minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i) because his drug offense carried a greater minimum sentence. This argument has been rejected by both this court and the United States Supreme Court. <em>Abbott v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 18, 23, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010); <em>United States v.
