Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, the Government filed notice of its intent to establish two prior felony eontrolled-substance convictions, subjecting Eaton to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Subsequently, Eaton and the Government entered a plea agreement. They also entered a plea agreement supplement in which Eaton agreed \u201cto fully cooperate with the United States ... in any investigation related to or arising from these charges,\u201d and the Government agreed that if Eaton\u2019s \u201ccooperation has provided substantial assistance ... in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense,\u201d it would file a motion to depart below the statutory minimum. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> accepted Eaton\u2019s plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-17\">Before sentencing, the Government filed a motion for downward departure based on substantial assistance, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. The Government reported that Eaton had \u201cprovided information regarding the conduct of himself and [his] co-defendant\u201d and had \u201calso provided information on an assault case in Stutsman County and theft of ATMs in Grand Forks County.\u201d However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the Government noted that Eaton\u2019s assistance had not resulted in the filing of any criminal charges. Based on these considerations, the Government recommended a sentence of 344 months\u2019 imprisonment. Eaton filed a response, requesting a greater reduction, since he had done \u201cexactly what the government asked\u201d and his co-defendant had received a greater reduction for less assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">At sentencing, the court calculated an advisory guidelines range of 151 to 181 months\u2019 imprisonment, but it found that Eaton previously had been convicted of two felony controlled-substance offenses, subjecting him to a mandatory life sentence. It then proceeded to consider the Government\u2019s motion for downward departure. The court noted that in determining the amount of the departure it only could consider the factors listed in \u00a7 5Kl.l(a) and found that \u201call five of those factors ... weigh in favor of Mr. Eaton.\u201d Accordingly, the court reduced Eaton\u2019s sentence to 240 months \u2014 over 100 months below the Government\u2019s recommendation \u2014 less 17 months\u2019 credit for time served, yielding a net sentence of 223 months. The court noted that although Eaton\u2019s co-defendant had received a greater reduction, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that you should be treated like [him] because there\u2019s a significant disparity in criminal history categories and a significant difference in the mandatory minimum that was triggered in this case as a result of that criminal history, so there is certainly a legal basis to treat the two of you differently.\u201d Eaton appeals, arguing that by considering his criminal history, the court based the amount of the substantial-assistance reduction on a nonassistance-related consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\u201c[T]o reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) grants a sentencing court \u201c[limited authority to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum ... in accordance with the guidelines.\u201d Section 5K1.1 of the guidelines indicates that the amount of such a reduction should be determined by considering the following assistance-related factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">(1) ... the significance and usefulness of the defendant\u2019s assistance ...; (2) the truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant; (3) the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance; (4) any injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance; [and] (5) the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">\u201cWhere a court has authority to sentence below a statutory minimum only by virtue of a government motion under \u00a7 3553(e), the reduction below the statutory minimum must be based exclusively on assistance-related considerations.\u201d <em>United States v. Burns, </em>577 F.3d 887, 894 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>474 F.3d 1130, 1130-31 (8th Cir.2007)). Moreover, \u201cafter reducing a sentence based on the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), a district court may not reduce the sentence further based on factors, other than assistance, set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Ordinarily, we would review the claim that the district court relied on non-assistance-related considerations in determining the amount of a section 5K1.1 departure <em>de novo. See Williams, </em>474 F.3d at 1131. However, Eaton failed to object to this alleged error before the district court, thereby forfeiting it. <em>See United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 549 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc). Accordingly, we review the claim for plain error and will reverse only if Eaton can show \u201c(1) an error, (2) that was \u2018plain,\u2019 [and] (3) \u2018affects substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>rights,\u2019 and [that] (4) \u2018the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rush-Richardson, </em>574 F.3d 906, 910 (8th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 735-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Regardless of whether the district court committed an error that was plain, we conclude that Eaton has failed to show that the alleged error affected his substantial rights. To satisfy this prong, Eaton must establish \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for [the error claimed], the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 82, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985)). Eaton has made no argument that the alleged error affected the outcome of the proceeding. Likewise, our own review of the record discloses no indication that, absent the alleged error, Eaton would have received a more favorable sentence. The district court specifically found that the sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary. The court mentioned Eaton\u2019s criminal history only after it had correctly identified and discussed the 5K1.1 factors and determined its sentence and only in the context of rebutting Eaton\u2019s disparity argument. Under these circumstances, any suggestion that Eaton was prejudiced by the alleged error would be merely speculative, and \u201c[w]here the effect of the error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate \u2014 where we would have to speculate\u2014 the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error.\u201d <em>United States v. Bain, </em>586 F.3d 634, 641 (8th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Pirani, </em>406 F.3d at 553).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-11\">.
