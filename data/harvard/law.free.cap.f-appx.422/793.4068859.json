In that petition, the Arnolds alleged that: (1) Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d) officers wrongfully accused them of immigration fraud and erroneously found them to be inadmissible into the United States; (2) the officers processed Keith Arnold for expedited removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and temporarily paroled Susan, Kenny, and Jay Arnold into the country so that they could finalize their business affairs; (3) they were seeking habeas review of the terms of their temporary parole; and (4) as citizens of the United Kingdom, they were entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>full hearing before the Executive Office for Immigration Review (\u201cEOIR\u201d). The district court dismissed their petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that they failed to satisfy \u00a7 2241\u2019s \u201cin custody\u201d requirement, and that their claims were otherwise barred by the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">On appeal, the Arnolds argue that the district coux\u2019t erred in dismissing their \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of subject matter jux\u2019isdiction. First, they assert that Susan, Kenny, and Jay Arnold were \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2241 at the time they filed their petition, because their temporary parole imposed a significant restraint on their liberty. Second, the Arnolds contend that the court had jurisdiction, pursuant to \u00a7 2241(c)(3), to consider whether the CBP violated their treaty rights under the Convention to Regulate Commerce by denying them a full EOIR hearing prior to finding them inadmissible. Finally, they suggest that the court also had jurisdiction pursuant to the INA. After careful review, we affix\u2019m.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala., Inc., </em>156 F.3d 1098, 1101-02 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cThe burden for establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction rests with the party bringing the claim.\u201d <em>Sweet Pea Marine, Ltd. v. APJ Marine, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1242, 1247 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">With respect to the district court\u2019s authority to consider the present action, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 confers district court jurisdiction over habeas petitions brought by individuals who are, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cin custody\u201d of the United States, or \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(1), (3). In order to satisfy \u00a7 2241\u2019s \u201ccustody\u201d requirement, petitioners must allege that they are subject to a \u201csignificant restraint\u201d on their liberty at the time of filing. <em>Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259,1263 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">We have previously held that an alien who has already been deported by the time he files his petition does not satisfy the custody requirement because he is \u201c \u2018subject to no greater restraint than any other non-citizen living outside American borders.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Miranda v. Reno, </em>238 F.3d 1156, 1159 (9th Cir.2001)). Moreover, we have suggested that the mere possibility of future deportation is insufficient to establish custody, even when the petitioner is subject to a deportation order. <em>See United States ex rel. Marcello v. Dist. Dir. of INS, </em>634 F.2d 964, 970-71 (5th Cir.1981) (noting that the alien filed his petition \u201cat a time when, arguably, he was merely subject to a deportation order and not \u2018held in custody\u2019 <em>\u201d)</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, we ultimately determined that the petitioner was \u201cin custody\u201d not because he faced deportation, but rather because his liberty was restrained by periodic reporting requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 971 &amp; n. 11. Notably, aliens who are temporarily paroled into the country pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A), are subject only to \u201csuch conditions as [the Attorney General] may prescribe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">In this case, the district court properly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Arnolds\u2019 petition because the Arnolds were not in the \u201ccustody\u201d of immigration officials at the time of the filing. The record indicates that Keith Arnold had already been removed to the United Kingdom at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>time the petition was filed, and that Susan, Kenny, and Jay Arnold failed to show that they were subject to any restraints on their liberty during their period of temporary parole. Further, to the extent the Arnolds ai'gue that the INA provides independent habeas jurisdiction that is not subject to \u00a7 2241\u2019s custody requirement, any such argument lacks merit. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1329 (providing that \u201c[njothing in [the INA] shall be construed as providing jurisdiction for suits against the United States or its agencies or officers\u201d). Accordingly, because the Arnolds failed to establish the existence of habeas jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\">.
