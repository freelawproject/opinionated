We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-20\">Gomez-Regin contends the district court erred by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard rather than a clear and convincing evidence standard in determining whether he had an aggravating role in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). The three-level increase in offense level resulting from the district court\u2019s aggravating role determination is not \u201cextremely disproportionate\u201d and therefore does not warrant application of the clear and convincing evidence standard. <em>See United States v. Johansson, </em>249 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir.2001) (finding a four-level increase to be not extremely disproportionate).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-21\">To the extent that Gomez-Regin contends the district court erred by applying the adjustment for his role as a manager or supervisor, the district court did not clearly err in light of evidence that Gomez-Regin supplied methamphetamine to some of his co-conspirators, determined who performed particular duties, and financed the initial purchase of methamphetamine. <em>See United States v. Egge, </em>223 F.3d 1128, 1132 (9th Cir.2000) (three-level adjustment was proper where defendant used others to help him sell drugs).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b622-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
