He argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Specifically, Lugo-Roman contends that the illegal reentry guideline overemphasized his criminal history and that the guidelines range did not adequately reflect his motive for reentering the country (seeing his mother after she suffered a stroke and was believed to be dying), his cultural assimilation, or that this was his first reentry offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Lugo-Roman\u2019s sentence is within the properly calculated guidelines range and is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.) (rejecting the argument that a guidelines illegal reentry sentence was unreasonable because the guideline is not empirically based and emphasizes a defendant\u2019s criminal history), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). As Lugo-Roman concedes, his argument that the presumption should not apply is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Lugo-Roman has not rebutted the presumption that his within-guidelines sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir. 2008). The district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Lugo-Roman to 60 months of imprisonment. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
