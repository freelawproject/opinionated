May 4, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-22\">Generally, we lack jurisdiction to review the \u201centirely discretionary\u201d decision of the BIA whether to reopen removal proceedings <em>sua sponte. Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam). However, we retain jurisdiction to review such decisions when they are premised on a misperception of the law. <em>See Mahmood v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 466, 469 (2d Cir.2009) (holding that \u201cwhere the Agency may have declined to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority because it misperceived the legal background and thought, incorrectly, that a reopening would necessarily fail, remand to the Agency for reconsideration in view of the correct law is appropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-23\">Tavarez argues that in <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 827, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010), the Supreme Court granted this Court jurisdiction to review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the agency\u2019s failure to reopen <em>sua sponte. </em>This argument is unavailing as the Supreme Court \u201cexpressed] no opinion on whether federal courts may review the Board\u2019s decision not to reopen removal proceedings <em>sua sponte.\u201d Id. </em>at 839 n. 18. After <em>Kucana, </em>this Court has reiterated that it has limited jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decisions not to reopen proceedings <em>sua sponte. See Luna v. Holder, </em>637 F.3d 85, 95-96 (2d Cir.2011); <em>Duarte-Ceri v. Holder, </em>630 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir.2010) (refusal to reopen <em>sua sponte </em>is \u201ca discretionary decision that is normally not reviewable by the Courts of Appeals\u201d). Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary refusal to reopen Tavarez\u2019s proceedings <em>sua sponte. See Mahmood, </em>570 F.3d at 469; <em>Ali, </em>448 F.3d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Even if the Court had jurisdiction, Tavarez cannot demonstrate that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his untimely motion to reopen. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). Tavarez does not challenge the BIA\u2019s findings that he (1) missed numerous deadlines to apply for relief under \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and, in particular, failed to explain in his September 16, 2009 motion to reopen why he missed the deadline for filing a special motion to apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(h) (reopening period ended on April 26, 2005); (2) did not raise a colorable ineffective assistance of counsel claim; and (3) did not provide the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation. Those arguments therefore may be deemed waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Tavarez argues that the BIA erred by ignoring his argument that he should no longer be considered an aggravated felon following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). Tavarez has provided no explanation for the nearly three-year delay in filing his motion to reopen after the <em>Lopez </em>decision issued. Nevertheless, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Tavarez is no longer an aggravated felon, he has not established that reopening was warranted. Notwithstanding the drug conviction underlying his aggravated felon status, Tavarez remains removable on the basis of a firearms conviction, which would require an Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(c) waiver and adjustment of status. <em>See Matter ofAzurin, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 695, 697 (BIA 2005). In his motion to reopen Tavarez did not establish his <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for adjustment of status. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) (providing that a motion to reopen must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation). Tavarez\u2019s argument that reopening is required because his status as an aggravated felon may carry future collateral consequences is unavailing because it is speculative, and he may avoid the longer bar to re-entry that results from his aggravated felon status by applying for a waiver from the Attorney General. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (9) (A) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
