Redding claims the district court erred in: (1) denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on both counts; (2) failing to excuse a juror because that juror was a current corrections officer; (3) allowing testimony of crack cocaine purchases from Redding prior to the two incidents with which Redding was charged without giving a limiting jury instruction; (4) failing to give him a two-level reduction under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3E1.1 (2009) for acceptance of responsibility; and (5) calculating Red-ding\u2019s drug quantity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-19\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of Redding\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal de novo. <em>United States v. Kingrea, </em>573 F.3d 186, 194 (4th Cir.2009). A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). The jury verdict must be sustained \u201cif, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the verdict is supported by \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). Substantial evidence is \u201cevidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>marks and citation omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he jury, not the reviewing court, weighs the credibility of the evidence and resolves any conflicts in the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Beidler, </em>110 F.3d at 1067 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cReversal for insufficient evidence is reserved for the rare case where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude that the evidence was sufficient to sustain Redding\u2019s convictions. <em>See United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 209 (4th Cir.1999) (discussing the elements of distribution).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Next, Redding contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to strike a juror for cause because the juror was employed as a corrections officer at the time of the trial. A trial judge\u2019s decision regarding whether to remove a juror for cause will not be overruled except for a \u201cmanifest abuse of ... discretion.\u201d <em>Poynter v. Ratcliff, </em>874 F.2d 219, 222 (4th Cir.1989). A district court\u2019s determination not to excuse a juror for cause is entitled to \u201cspecial deference.\u201d <em>Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1038, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984). The critical issue in deciding a challenge for cause is whether the juror \u201ccould be fair and impartial and decide the case on the facts and law presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Capers, </em>61 F.3d 1100, 1105 (4th Cir.1995). A challenge to a juror for cause is usually limited to demonstrations of actual bias, with the doctrine of implied bias applying only to \u201cextreme situations\u201d where the circumstances make it highly unlikely that the average person could remain impartial. <em>United States v. Turner, 389 F.3d 111, 117 </em>(4th Cir.2004). Our review of the record reveals no indication of actual bias or of an extreme situation warranting removal. Therefore, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Redding\u2019s motion to excuse the juror for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Redding next contends that the district court erred in allowing testimony, without a limiting jury instruction, of crack cocaine purchases from him prior to the two incidents with which he was charged. Red-ding claims the testimony was prior acts testimony governed by Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), therefore necessitating a limiting instruction. The district court found that the testimony was not Rule 404(b) evidence but was instead intrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The Rule 404(b) inquiry applies only to evidence of other acts that are \u201cextrinsic to the one charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Chin, </em>83 F.3d 83, 87 (4th Cir. 1996). \u201c[A]cts intrinsic to the alleged crime do not fall under Rule 404(b)\u2019s of uncharged conduct is not \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence subject to Rule 404 if the uncharged conduct \u2018arose out of the same series of transactions as the charged offense, or if [evidence of the uncharged conduct] is necessary to complete the story of the crime on tidal.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Siegel, </em>536 F.3d 306, 316 (4th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>32 F.3d 876, 885 (4th Cir.1994)). <em>See also Chin, </em>83 F.3d at 88 (\u201cOther criminal acts are intrinsic when they are inextricably intertwined or both acts are part of a single criminal episode or the other acts were necessary preliminaries to the crime charged.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Evidence is intrinsic if it is necessary to \u201cprovide context relevant to the criminal charges.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>482 F.3d 658, 663 (4th Cir.2007). We conclude that the district court was correct in finding that the testimony was intrinsic evidence and therefore was not Fed. R.Evid. 404(b) evidence. The witness\u2019s prior relationship with Redding provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>relevant context for the two drug transactions charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Next, Redding contends that the district court erred in denying his request for a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision for clear error. <em>United States v. Rise, </em>369 F.3d 766, 771 (4th Cir.2004). Section 3El.l(a) provides that a defendant who \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense\u201d is entitled to a two-level reduction in his offense level. \u201c[I]n order to receive a reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility, the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he has clearly recognized and affirmatively accepted personal responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1005 (4th Cir.1996). \u201cThe sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. For this reason, the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The district court denied this reduction based on USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 application note 2 which states that \u201c[t]his adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\u201d This court has recognized a limited exception to this rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">In rare cases, however, a defendant may exercise his right to trial and yet nevertheless be entitled to the Responsibility Adjustment. Such a situation occurs where a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g., to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-8\"><em>Elliott v. United States, </em>332 F.3d 753, 765 (4th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">This case does not present one of those unique circumstances. Redding did not go to trial simply to preserve legal issues not relating to factual guilt. Because Redding put the government to its burden of proof and went to trial challenging his factual guilt, the district court was correct in finding the two-level reduction was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Lastly, Redding argues for the first time in his reply brief that the district court improperly calculated the drug quantities, and as a result, his sentence is unconstitutional. However, \u201c[i]t is a well settled rule that contentions not raised in the argument section of the opening brief are abandoned.\u201d <em>A Helping Hand v. Balt. County, </em>515 F.3d 356, 369 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also SEC v. Pirate Investor, </em>580 F.3d 233, 255 n. 23 (4th Cir.2009) (stating that \u201c[ojrdinarily we do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief\u2019), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3506, 177 L.Ed.2d 1091 (2010). Therefore, we decline to consider the argument raised in Redding\u2019s reply brief and deny his motion to join an additional issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
