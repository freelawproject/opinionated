We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Vasquez Ruiz contends the district court procedurally erred by: (1) treating the guidelines as presumptively reasonable; (2) failing to adequately explain the sentence or address the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and (3) failing to respond to Vasquez Ruiz\u2019s non-frivolous mitigation arguments. The record reflects that the district court did not treat the Sentencing Guidelines as presumptively appropriate, adequately explained the sentence, sufficiently addressed the section 3553(a) factors, and listened to the parties\u2019 arguments but found the circumstances insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the one imposed. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 994-96 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Vasquez Ruiz also contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable because of the district court\u2019s failure to meaningfully consider the section 3553(a) factors, as well as the staleness and minor nature of two of his prior convictions. In light of the totality of the circumstances and the section 3553(a) factors, Vasquez Ruiz\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 991\u2014 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Finally, we reject Vasquez Ruiz\u2019s invitation to call for an en banc hearing on this case because there is no intra-circuit conflict and he has failed to demonstrate that <em>United States v. Hayden, </em>255 F.3d 768 (9th Cir.2001), was wrongly decided. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 35(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
