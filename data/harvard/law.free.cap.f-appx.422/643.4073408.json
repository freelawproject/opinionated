We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, Wak<em>kary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that petitioners failed to establish past persecution because the harassment and discrimination petitioners experienced as a result of their Christian religion did not rise to the level of persecution, <em>see id. </em>at 1059-60, and Indonesian authorities were able to control the protesters at petitioners\u2019 1999 concert, <em>see Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2005). In addition, we reject petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA erred because it did not expressly state it considered the harm of their past experiences in Indonesia cumulatively. <em>See Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 990 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201c[t]he [BIA] does not have to write an exegesis on every contention.\u201d) (internal quotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that petitioners failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution because they did not show sufficient individualized risk, <em>of. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004), and they failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution by forces the government was unable or unwilling to control, <em>see Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1180 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
