We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-23\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Nichols\u2019s claims for denial of access to the courts, denial of due process, and unlawful search and seizure. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (prisoner must show that he or she suffered actual injury in order to establish a violation of the right of access to the courts); <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (no Fourteenth Amendment due process violation where \u201cpredeprivation process is impracticable,\u201d provided that \u201ca meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is available\u201d); <em>Mitchell v. Dupnik, </em>75 F.3d 517, 522 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cAn inmate ordinarily has no reasonable expectation of privacy as to his jail cell or his possessions within it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-24\">The district court, however, improperly granted summary judgment on Nichols\u2019s retaliation claim because there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether defendants retaliated against Nichols for filing a state habeas petition by taking his property. <em>See Brodheim v. Cry, </em>584 F.3d 1262, 1269-73 (9th Cir.2009) (discussing five basic elements of a First Amendment retaliation claim). According to Nichols\u2019s verified complaint, affidavits, and exhibits, as well as defendants\u2019 own admissions, defendants took Nichols\u2019s property and lost some of it, including legal papers from Nichols\u2019s state habeas petition. Nichols <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>alleges in his verified complaint, which was expressly incorporated into his opposition to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, that when he asked prison officials about his missing items, they responded that \u201cmaybe [he] shouldn\u2019t be filing complaints.\u201d While the prison has a legitimate penological interest in enforcing rules against the possession of contraband, defendants \u201cmay not defeat a retaliation claim on summary judgment simply by articulating a general justification for a neutral process, when there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the action was taken in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Bruce v. Ylst, </em>351 F.3d 1283, 1289 (9th Cir.2003). Therefore, we reverse as to Nichols\u2019s retaliation claim and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b658-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
