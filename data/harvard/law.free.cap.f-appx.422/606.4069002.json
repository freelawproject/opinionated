We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1018-19 (9th Cir. 2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-25\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Min suffered past persecution based on being detained once, hit five times, and told to cease his activities. <em>See id. </em>at 1020-21 (petitioner did not establish past persecution where the petitioner was arrested and detained for three days, interrogated, and struck with a rod ten times). Further, the record does not compel the conclusion that Min demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution in Burma. <em>See id. </em>at 1021-22. Accordingly, Min\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Because Min failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, 453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th </em>Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Min failed to establish it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to Burma. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, 439 </em>F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
