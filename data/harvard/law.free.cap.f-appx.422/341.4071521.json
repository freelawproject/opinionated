The testimony showed that Alonso participated in a plan to transport a group of aliens in Mexico almost to the border with the United States, cross into the United States without the aliens, rejoin the aliens at a gas station just within the United States border, and then assist the aliens travel further within the United States. Alonso argues that the IJ improperly considered evidence outside of the record of his conviction to sustain the \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(E)\u00ae charge. Section 1227(a)(1)(E)\u00ae \u201crequires only a showing of, not a conviction of, unlawful presence in the United States and alien smuggling activities.\u201d <em>Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>322 F.3d 804, 817 n. 15 (5th Cir.2002). Thus, the IJ\u2019s consideration of evidence regarding Alonso\u2019s actual conduct rather than only evidence of the 1997 offense of conviction was proper. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">The IJ and BIA further properly relied upon the evidence of those same activities to conclude that Alonso was inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(E)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae. Under \u00a7 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae, \u201cAny alien who at any time knowingly has encouraged, induced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law is inadmissible.\u201d As with \u00a7 1227(a)(l)(E)(i), the analysis focuses on the actual conduct rather than on a conviction for a criminal offense. <em>See Soriano v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 318, 319-21 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Because Alonso was inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i), he was not eligible for a waiver under INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), which permits the waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (II), (B), (D), and (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
