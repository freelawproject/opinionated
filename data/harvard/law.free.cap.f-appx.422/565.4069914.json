We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Cerezo v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 1163, 1166 (9th Cir.2008), except to the extent that deference is owed to the BIA\u2019s determination of the governing statutes and regulations, <em>Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 535 (9th Cir.2004). We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-22\">Loza-Gonzalez contends he suffered past persecution and that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution by gangs in El Salvador. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Loza-Gonzalez failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740-41 (9th Cir. 2009) (\u201c[t]he Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). Accordingly, Loza-Gonzalez\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-23\">Because Loza-Gonzalez failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, his claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-24\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Loza-Gonzalez is not entitled to CAT relief because he failed to demonstrate it is more likely than not that he will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the El Salvadorean government if he returns to El Salvador. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b589-25\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
