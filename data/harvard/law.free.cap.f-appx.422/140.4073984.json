For the reasons that follow, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">In 2009, Burton filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against several employees of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, alleging that he was retaliated against for filing a successful grievance. In particular, he asserted that, after filing a grievance that resulted in his compensation for the loss of clothing, he was transferred to another prison block, which caused him to lose his job. He also stated that the defendants\u2019 explanation for the move \u2014 that it was based on institutional security and/or operational needs \u2014 was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-18\">The Magistrate Judge screened the complaint sua sponte pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, which requires the court to dismiss a complaint that is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such action. The Magistrate Judge then dismissed, with prejudice, the complaint after determining that Burton could not make out a prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-19\">Burton now appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-21\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant' to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>sua sponte dismissal of a complaint is plenary. <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). To survive dismissal, a complaint need only contain \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Here, the Magistrate Judge explained that a prisoner bringing a retaliation claim must allege that: (1) the plaintiff took some action itself protected by the constitution; (2) the defendant took adverse action sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his constitutional rights; and (3) there was a causal connection between the plaintiffs protected conduct and the adverse action. <em>Mitchell v. Horn, </em>318 F.3d 523, 530 (3d Cir.2003). The Magistrate Judge determined that Burton\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim because \u201ca transfer from one area of a prison to another, which is the only constitutionally significant adverse action alleged by plaintiff, is as a matter of law insufficient to deter any person from pursuing his constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The Magistrate Judge\u2019s decision is problematic. First, the constitutionally protected act at issue is Burton\u2019s filing of the grievance (not the transfer to a different cell block), and a retaliation claim is not foreclosed even though the particular privilege that has been taken away does not implicate a constitutional right. <em>See DeWalt v. Carter, </em>224 F.3d 607, 613 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Allah, </em>229 F.3d at 224-25. Second, although a transfer to a different cell block may not be an adverse action \u201csufficient to deter\u201d an ordinary person from filing a grievance, the Magistrate Judge failed to acknowledge that the transfer resulted in the loss of Burton\u2019s prison job, which may constitute a sufficiently serious adverse action.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Because the Magistrate Judge\u2019s decision misconstrues Burton\u2019s allegations as to the first two prongs of the pleading requirements for a retaliation claim, we will vacate the decision. Moreover, we note that district courts must generally permit amendment of a complaint that is vulnerable to dismissal where a responsive pleading has not yet been filed, even if the plaintiff does not seek leave to amend. <em>See Fletcher-Harlee Coi~p. v. Pote Concrete Contractors, Inc., </em>482 F.3d 247, 252 (3d Cir.2007) (observing that in civil rights cases, \u201cleave to amend must be granted sua sponte before dismissing\u201d the complaint); <em>Alston v. Parker, </em>363 F.3d 229, 235-36 (3d Cir.2004) (stating that dismissal without leave to amend is justified only on grounds of bad faith, undue delay, prejudice, or futility).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Accordingly, we will vacate the February 5, 2010 decision and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-12\">. Because Burton consented to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s adjudication of his complaint, he is entitled to appeal directly to this Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
