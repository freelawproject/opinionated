We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Cerezo v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 1163, 1166 (9th Cir.2008), except to the extent that deference is owed to the BIA\u2019s determination of the governing statutes and regulations, <em>Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 535 (9th Cir.2004). We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Barrios v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 849, 854 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Mendez-Martinez failed to demonstrate that he is eligible for asylum and withholding of removal based on his membership in a particular social group. <em>See id. </em>at 855-56 (petitioner who resisted gang recruitment did not establish persecution on account of a protected ground); <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 745-47 (9th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Mendez-Martinez\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Barrios, </em>581 F.3d at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Mendez-Martinez did not establish a likelihood of being tortured in El Salvador by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. <em>See Santos-Lemus, </em>542 F.3d at 747-48. Mendez-Martinez\u2019s contention that the IJ applied the wrong legal standard concerning his CAT claim is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Finally, Mendez-Martinez\u2019s claim that the BIA erred because it did not comment on the arguments in his brief fails. <em>See Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 990-91 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error and prejudice to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b670-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
