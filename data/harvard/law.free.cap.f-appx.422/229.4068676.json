We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">An alien may file one motion to reopen within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(A), (C) (2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2010). This time limit does not apply if the basis for the motion is to seek asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions, \u201cif such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) (2006); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">This court reviews the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2010); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Mosere v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 397, 400 (4th Cir.2009). The Board\u2019s \u201cdenial of a motion to reopen is reviewed with extreme deference, given that motions to reopen are disfavored because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Sadhvani v. Holder, </em>596 F.3d 180, 182 (4th Cir. 2009) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (2010). It \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">This court has also recognized three independent grounds on which a motion to reopen removal proceedings may be denied: \u201c(1) the alien has not established a <em>prima facie </em>case for the underlying substantive relief sought; (2) the alien has not introduced previously unavailable, material evidence; and (3) where relief is discretionary, the alien would not be entitled to the discretionary grant of relief.\u201d <em>Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 234 (4th Cir.1998) (citing <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)). This court will reverse a denial of a motion to reopen only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Mosere, </em>552 F.3d at 400 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">We have considered Effiom\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. We conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
