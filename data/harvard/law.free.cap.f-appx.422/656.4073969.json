Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Perdomo-Martinez did not establish a clear probability of persecution because the threats he and his family received, and the death of his cousin, do not amount to persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1486 (9th Cir.1997). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination Perdomo-Martinez failed to establish a clear probability of persecution in light of his family\u2019s ability to live unharmed in Guatemala City. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001). Perdomo-Martinez does not otherwise contend he has a future fear of persecution. Accordingly, his claim for withholding of removal fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review PerdomoMartinez\u2019s contention that the IJ did not consider evidence of country conditions because he did not exhaust it before the BIA. <em>See Brezilien v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 403, 412 (9th Cir.2009) (no jurisdiction to review due process claim where petitioner failed to exhaust the claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Perdomo-Martinez\u2019s counsel is cautioned that her opening brief does not meet this court\u2019s standards. <em>See generally </em>Fed.R.App. P.28; 9th Cir. R.28-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b680-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
