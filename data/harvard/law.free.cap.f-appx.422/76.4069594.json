Thereafter, the District Court considered several cross motions, including a motion for remand to the Pennsylvania Special Education Administrative Process for consideration of Deborah A.\u2019s compensatory education claims existing prior to July 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-19\">After hearing the parties on the motions, the District Court concluded that the claims regarding events that occurred before July 27, 2005 were barred by IDEA\u2019S two-year statute of limitations. On appeal, the parties agree that our recent decision in <em>Steven I. v. Central Bucks Sch. Dist. </em>618 F.3d 411 (3d Cir.2010), \u201cdecided] the same legal issue presented here\u201d \u2014 that is, the applicability to Deborah A.\u2019s claims of the shortened statute of limitations established in the IDEA as amended in 2004\u2014 and required the denial of her motion. (App\u2019t Br. 2) In light of this concession, we will affirm the decision of the District Court for substantially the reasons given in that decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
