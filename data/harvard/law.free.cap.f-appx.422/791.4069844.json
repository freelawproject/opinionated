Means argues on appeal that Amendment 591 of the Sentencing Guidelines warrants a reduction in his sentence of life imprisonment to a statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, because: (1) the conspiracy count of the indictment did not specify an amount of crack cocaine, and, thus, his statutory maximum necessarily was determined under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), which did not include a drug quantity amount; and (2) the jury was not required to find the quantity of drugs involved in the offense, and, had Amendment 591 been in effect at the time of his sentencing, the government would have been required to charge a drug quantity in the indictment. After thorough review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009) (quotations omitted). However, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an incarcerated defendant when that defendant has been sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not consistent with applicable policy statements \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Retroactive Amendment 591 clarified that the enhanced penalties in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.2, including an enhancement for distributing drugs near protected locations, can only be applied when the defendant is convicted of an offense referenced to \u00a7 2D1.2. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005); U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 591. Amendment 591 \u201crequires that the initial selection of the offense guideline be based only on the statute or offense of conviction rather than on judicial findings of actual conduct not made by the jury.\u201d <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219. In other words, the amendment \u201cdirects the district court to apply the guideline dictated by the statute of conviction, but does not constrain the use of judicially found facts to select a base offense level within the relevant guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1219-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Here, the district court properly denied Means\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduced sentence. As the record shows, Means was convicted of several drug offenses, including two counts of distribution of crack cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860. As a result, the court calculated Means\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2(a)(l) because it was the highest offense level of all of his counts. Thus, Amendment 591 does not apply in this, case because the application of \u00a7 2D 1.2 was based on conduct found by the jury and not by judicial findings. <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Furthermore, the two counts of distribution of cocaine near a school were subject to a statutory mandatory minimum of life imprisonment based on Means\u2019s enhanced sentence for his prior felony drug offenses, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, which means that any change to the court\u2019s guideline calculation under \u00a7 2D 1.2 would not affect the length of his sentence. Accordingly, because the application of Amendment 591 would not have changed his applicable guideline range, Means was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-15\">. As an initial matter, the government's challenge to Means\u2019s allegedly untimely notice of appeal must fail because Means's notice of appeal, signed September 26, 2010, was filed prior to the October 5, 2010, entry of judgment of the order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Day </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>528 F.3d 1315, 1318 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that under the \"prison mailbox rule,\u201d a <em>pro se </em>prisoner\u2019s pleading is considered filed on the date it is delivered to prison authorities to be mailed, and absent evidence to the contrary, we presume that a prisoner delivered his pleading to prison officials on the day it was signed): Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(2). Thus, Means's notice of appeal was timely filed, and we have jurisdiction to consider his appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
