The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Dillard to 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>months imprisonment and ordered him to pay $52,691.47 in restitution to the RRB under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663A-3664. Dillard appeals the order of restitution, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In February 1999, Dillard suffered injuries while working for Union Pacific Railroad. After determining that Dillard could no longer perform his work as a conductor, the RRB awarded him an occupational disability annuity. As a condition of receiving the annuity, Dillard was required by law to report certain information regarding any employment and income while on disability. See 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231 a(a)(3); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.16. Dillard failed to disclose to the RRB that he owned a business, occasionally undertook additional employment, and received income from these ventures.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Dillard pled guilty to four counts of knowingly providing false statements to the RRB during 2005 and 2006. In addition to other penalties, the district court ordered Dillard to pay restitution of $52,-691.47 \u2014 the aggregate amount of benefits the RRB paid to Dillard during 2005 and 2006. Dillard appeals, arguing that the district court erred in finding that he owed any restitution to the RRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">We review the district court\u2019s finding as to the proper amount of restitution for clear error. <em>United States v. Statman, </em>604 F.3d 529, 535 (8th Cir.2010). The MVRA provides that the \u201ccourt shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the court.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A). A victim is limited to restitution for the \u201cactual losses\u201d suffered. <em>United States v. Petruk, </em>484 F.3d 1035, 1038 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Ordinarily, when the defendant receives benefits from a government agency through fraud, the \u201cactual loss\u201d to the agency \u201cis the amount paid minus the amount that would have been paid in the absence of fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). Dillard argues that the RRB\u2019s actual loss is zero because had he not filed a false statement, the agency would have paid him the same amount. However, when an annuitant fails to comply with RRB regulations \u2014 as Dillard admits he did in 2005 and 2006 \u2014 his entitlement to benefits ceases. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231 a(a)(3). Even if Dillard could have met separate, additional requirements of the RRB and received benefits, when he acted illegally he lost his entitlement to receive an occupational disability annuity under federal law. Accordingly, the district court correctly found that the RRB\u2019s \u201cactual loss\u201d is $52,691.47.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">In addition, we modify the judgment in this case to correct a clerical error; Dillard is guilty of violating 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 2311(a), rather than 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231(l)(a). <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (providing that appellate courts may modify any judgment brought before it for review).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">We affirm the sentence imposed by the district court and modify the judgment to reflect that Dillard is guilty of violating 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>2311 </em>(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-38\">.
