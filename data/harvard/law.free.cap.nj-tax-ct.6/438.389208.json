The City attacks the findings of the Tax Court judge that housing for certain hospital employees was \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for the proper functioning of the hospital. It contends that these findings conflict with the interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.6 given in <em>City of Long Branch v. Monmouth Medical Center, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>524, 532, 351 A.2d 756 (App.Div.1976), aff\u2019d 73 <em>N.J. </em>179, 373 A.2d 651 (1977). The City concedes that it was reasonable to provide housing for certain physician-students but not for those engaged in the study of radiology and x-ray technology, since they are rarely called upon for emergency patient care. Plaintiff concedes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>need to provide housing for registered nurses, but not for licensed practical nurses who occupied a large number of the housing units. The exemption for property housing certain administrative personnel is also challenged. For its part, on its cross-appeal, the Hospital contends that the Tax Court judge erred in concluding that Block D-43, Lot 6, was not exempt for the year 1975. That parcel was used to house a mechanical maintenance man in that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The findings and conclusions of Judge Hopkins in the Tax Court are amply supported by credible evidence. Accordingly, we reject the contentions made on the appeal and cross-appeal and affirm his determination substantially for the reasons given in his written opinion, 4 N.J.Tax 183. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(A); see <em>City of Long Branch v. Monmouth Medical Center, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The City also contends on this appeal that the \u201creasonably necessary\u201d standard for the exemption established by the <em>Monmouth Medical Center </em>case, <em>supra, </em>incorrectly interprets the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-3.6. As to this contention, we respectfully defer to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court adopted this court\u2019s opinion in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
