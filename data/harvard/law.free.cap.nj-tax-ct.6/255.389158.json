Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Hopkins, the judge of the Tax Court who heard the matter on a 1979 remand by this court, found the true value of the subject property \u201cas of March 1, 1973 when it was substantially completed, [to be] $23,490,000.\u201d The finding is supported by ample credible evidence in the record and was made in accord with well established principles of real property valuation. We discern no sound reason or justification for disturbing it. Accordingly, we affirm that finding of true value substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Hopkins in his opinion for the Tax Court of September 11, 1981, reported at 3 <em>N.J.Tax </em>332 (Tax Ct.1981). Having found the true value of the property as of March 1,1973, the judge then proceeded to apply \u201cthe formula for computing the added assessment\u201d specified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-63.3. He properly found that \u201c[a] true value of $23,490,000, as of March 1, 1973, would [, by the application of the formula,] result in an added assessment of $5,234,333.\u201d Instead of directing the entry of an added assessment for the tax year 1973 in that amount, he reasoned, mistakenly relying upon <em>Matawan v. Tree Haven Apartments, Inc., </em>108 <em>N.J.Super. </em>111, 260 A.2d 235 (App.Div. 1969), that \u201c[a]s this figure exceeds the original added assessment of $4,079,167, there can be no increase because the taxing district did not appeal said assessment to the county board [of taxation].\u201d He accordingly directed the entry of \u201ca judgment showing an added assessment as of March 1,1973, in the amount of $4,079,167.\u201d We reverse that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Here, having properly found the true value of the property as of March 1, 1973, the sole remaining function of the Tax Court in the matter (the issue of discrimination relief having been removed from the case by this court\u2019s 1979 remand) was to determine, and direct the entry of a judgment fixing, the amount of the added assessment for the tax year 1973 pursuant to the formula prescribed therefor by the applicable statute, <em>viz., N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-63.3. It was thus error for the court to reduce the full added assessment figure so determined. <em>See Rabstein v. Princeton Tp., </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>18, 24, 453 A.2d 553 (App.Div. 1982). <em>See </em>also, <em>Fort Lee v. Hudson Terrace Apartments, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>221, 417 A.2d 1124 (App.Div.1980), certif. den. 85 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>459, 427 A.2d 559 (1980); <em>N.J.Const. </em>(1947), Art. VIII, \u00a7 I, par. 1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4t-23; <em>Hackensack v. Rubenstein, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>39, 52, 178 A.2d 625 (1962); <em>Samuel Hird &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Garfield, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>65, 75, 208 A.2d 153 (App.Div.1965); <em>Rek Investment Co. v.

We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
