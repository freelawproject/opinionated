He answered that question in the negative and entered judgment in favor of plaintiff. In the course of doing this he distinguished the matter of <em>Fedders Financial Corp. v. Director, </em>3 <em>N.J.Tax </em>576 (Tax Ct.1981), this day affirmed by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">We are satisfied that Judge Crabtree\u2019s findings of fact might reasonably have been reached upon sufficient credible evidence in the whole record whereby we will not disturb them, <em>Mayflower Securities v. Bureau of Securities, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 312 <em>A.2d </em>497 (1973), and that his conclusions <em>of </em>law comport with that which he described as the legislative intendment. We are also satisfied that the matter is distinguishable from <em>Fedders </em>for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>reasons set forth by Judge Crabtree. We affirm substantially for the reasons given in his opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
