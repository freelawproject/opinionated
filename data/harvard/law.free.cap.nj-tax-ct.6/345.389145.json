The essential facts are not in dispute and are set forth in Judge Conley\u2019s detailed opinion. 5 <em>N.J.Tax </em>272 (Tax Ct.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">We concur with Judge Conley\u2019s conclusion that the rule established in <em>Bayonne v. Port Jersey Corp., </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>367, 399 A.2d 649 (1979), requires this property to be taxed as business personal property. Significantly, in this case, in 1978 and 1979, the taxpayer dismantled its \u201cMadsen\u201d asphalt plant and replaced it with components of a \u201cMcCarter\u201d plant. Most of the apparatus which was part of the Madsen plant was transferred to another quarry site in New Jersey. As noted by the trial judge, the parties agreed that the batch house and scale house that remained on the property should be taxed as real property. Appellant does not quarrel with the holding that the retaining walls, composed of large moveable concrete blocks stacked upon one another, should be treated as business personalty as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
