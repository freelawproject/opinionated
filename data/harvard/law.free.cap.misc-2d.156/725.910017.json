Barron, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b749-19\">Defendants move for an order vacating the default judgment entered against them, May 26,1992, on the grounds that the court was without subject matter jurisdiction to enter a judgment in excess of the jurisdictional limit of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>In this action, to recover a $24,000 balance due on a promissory note together with attorney\u2019s fees as provided in said instrument, plaintiff demanded judgment for the sum of $27,600, with interest from September 14, 1990 together with costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The issue presented is whether interest and attorney\u2019s fees are part of the amount sought to be recovered for purposes of determining if the court\u2019s $25,000 jurisdictional limit has been exceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">New York City Civil Court has jurisdiction of actions and proceedings where the amount in controversy does not exceed $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs. (NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 15; CCA 201-203.) Further, where several causes of action are asserted in the complaint, each within the monetary jurisdiction of the court if sued upon separately, the court may render a judgment in excess of $25,000 if such excess is solely the result of such joinder. <em>(See, CCA </em>211.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">While CCA 201 specifically excludes interest and costs from the amount in controversy, the court in <em>Irni v Williams </em>(146 Mise 2d 894 [Civ Ct, Kings County 1990]) found that a claim for $25,000 plus interest exceeded the jurisdictional limit of the court because the interest was part of a debt included in the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Defendants, herein, contend that a single cause of action on a debt consisting of the $24,000 balance on the promissory note, $3,600 attorney\u2019s fees, and $1,773.90 interest from September 14, 1990 (computed through June 10, 1991, the date of the complaint, at the rate of 10% per annum on $24,000 [$6.57 per day] as set forth in the promissory note) rendered the relief requested in excess of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Although it was held in <em>Irni (supra) </em>that interest contracted for in a promissory note is part of the amount sought to be recovered for purposes of determining the $25,000 jurisdictional limit of the New York City Civil Court, <em>Irni </em>is readily distinguishable from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">In <em>Irni (supra), </em>plaintiff sought \"summary judgment on a promissory note in the amount of $25,000 with interest at 16% per annum from August 30, 1988 and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs\u201d. <em>(Supra, </em>at 895.) The court determined that interest demanded, pursuant to the terms of a promissory note, was part of the debt creating but a single cause of action, and was to be included for purposes of determining jurisdiction. The court in <em>Irni </em>found that the CCA merely excluded court-awarded interest and costs <em>(supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Unlike <em>Irni (supra), </em>plaintiff in the instant action specifically demanded \"judgment for the sum of $27,600 with interest from 9/14/90, together with costs and disbursements\u201d. No contractual right to interest at 10% per annum, pursuant to the promissory note, was asserted in the complaint. Interest sought in the instant action is merely court-awarded interest. CCA 201 specifically excludes court-awarded interest for purposes of determining jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\">Defendants\u2019 other contention, that the claim for attorney\u2019s fees of $3,600 brought the amount sued upon over the jurisdictional limit, is equally unavailing. The claim for attorney\u2019s fees is a separate cause of action and may be aggregated with the main claim. Pursuant to CCA 211, the court may render a judgment in excess of $25,000 as a result of such joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Based on the foregoing, the motion is denied in its entirety.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
