Tenant, who suffers from schizophrenia, did not testify. Her psychiatrist described tenant\u2019s course of treatment and medication; while he stated that, in his opinion, tenant was not violent, he did indicate that tenant was prone to \"outbursts\u201d which are characteristic of the illness, and that he \"would expect past behavior to continue in the future\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The determination at nisi prius that tenant\u2019s conduct \"does interfere substantially with the comfort and safety of her neighbors\u201d finds ample support in the record. The numerous complaints of other tenants who have witnessed the disturbances caused by tenant in the building\u2019s public areas, and who have been threatened by her, portray a pattern of objectionable conduct likely to recur <em>(see, Frank v Park Summit Realty Corp., </em>175 AD2d 33, <em>mod </em>79 NY2d 789). The Rent Stabilization Code permits an owner to recover possession of a housing accommodation where, as here, it has been established that the tenant is committing a nuisance in the premises (9 NYCRR 2524.3 [b]). Tenant\u2019s argument that \"unintentional\u201d conduct precipitated by a mental illness cannot, as a matter of law, constitute a nuisance is not persuasive. Even assuming that tenant\u2019s actions were involuntary, the dispositive issue in this proceeding is not tenant\u2019s state of mind, but the nature of tenant\u2019s conduct and its effect upon the comfort and safety of other tenants and building staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Parness, J.
