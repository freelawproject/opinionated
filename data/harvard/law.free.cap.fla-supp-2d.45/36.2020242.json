The issue on appeal is whether the interaction between the police and appellant constituted an illegal detention in violation of the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution, Article 1, \u00a7 12 of the Florida Constitution and \u00a7 901.151, Fla. Stat. (1989), and thus whether the evidence obtained as a result should have been suppressed and the charge dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The facts of the case are as follows: At approximately 8:20 a.m. on July 6, 1989, Officer Perez-Borroto of the City of Miami Police Department was on a routine patrol in his police cruiser. He drove by a young girl sitting on a bus bench who \u201cstared him down\u201d. He turned his police cruiser around and asked the girl what was wrong. The girl replied \u201cThis guy is harassing me and he\u2019s scaring the heck out of me\u201d. The officer then noticing the Defendant\u2019s car parked nearby walked up to the Defendant\u2019s car window and asked him if he had a driver\u2019s license. The Defendant replied yes, then produced a license that was later determined to be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">A law enforcement officer may temporarily detain a person for investigative purposes where circumstances reasonably indicate that such person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime. \u00a7 901.151, Fla. Stat. (1989) The detention must be based on a \u201cfounded\u201d suspicion which is one that has some factual foundation in the circumstances observed by the officer. But mere suspicion is no better than random selection, sheer guesswork or hunch; it has no objective justification. <em>Peabody v State of Florida, </em>556 So.2d 816 (Fla. 2d DCA 1990); <em>Mitchell v State of Florida, </em>558 So.2d 72 (Fla. 2d DCA 1990); <em>G.J.P. v State, </em>469 So.2d 826 (Fla. 2d DCA 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The police officer admitted that the girl did not ask him to stop, that nobody screamed and that he never saw the Defendant do anything unusual or illegal. Indisputably, Officer Perez-Borroto had the right to act upon this complaint and to walk up to the Defendant to question him about the situation. <em>Terry v Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19 n. 16 (1968). However, instead of questioning the Defendant, the officer asked the Defendant for his driver\u2019s license. We hold this to be a seizure of appellant requiring the existence of a prior founded suspicion of criminal activity which was not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">A judgment will not be reversed unless error was prejudicial to a substantial right of the Defendant. 4924.33 Fla. Stat. (1989). Since the seizure took place in violation of appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution, Article 1, \u00a7 12 of the Florida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Constitution and \u00a7 901.151, Fla. Stat. (1989) such prejudice is obvious. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s Motion to Suppress. For these reasons the adjudication of guilt and sentence appealed are reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
