Pursuant to Florida law, a habitual offender cannot get his drivers license restored, on a restricted basis, until a year after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>suspension. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 322.27(5) (1989). Therefore, the police officer had a well founded suspicion that the defendant was committing a crime at the time he stopped him.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">It is well settled that, in order to justify a stop a police officer must have a founded suspicion that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. Fla. Stat. \u00a7901.151 (1981). \u201cCircumstances can \u2018reasonably indicate\u2019 that a person \u2018has committed, is committing, or is about to commit\u2019 a violation of criminal laws or ordinances without necessarily indicating that high probability of guilt which is implied by the term \u2018probable cause\u2019.\u201d <em>State v Stevens, </em>354 So.2d 1244, 1247 (Fla. 4th DCA 1978). The existence of a \u201cfounded suspicion\u201d is determined by an evaluation of the factual circumstances observed by the officer, in hght of the officer\u2019s knowledge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s reasoning that there is a less intrusive way, i.e., running a computer check, of obtaining the information is unsupported by the record. Officer Siegler\u2019s uncontroverted testimony established that he could not run a computer check without the defendant\u2019s birthdate, which he did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The trial court\u2019s reasoning for granting the motion to suppress is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">Having found that the order granting the motion to suppress is in error, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
