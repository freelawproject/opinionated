The case was dismissed for lack of prosecution. On October 3, 1989, the State refiled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>its information, charging the defendant with driving under the influence. At the arraignment on November 14, 1989, the trial judge dismissed the case with prejudice. The State of Florida appealed, alleging that the trial court erred in discharging the defendant without having received a motion for discharge or giving the State the fifteen-day grace period. We agree. As of July 1, 1989, the prosecution became entitled to a fifteen-day grace period following the filing of a motion for discharge.
