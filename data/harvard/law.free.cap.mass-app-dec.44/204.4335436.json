After a trial there was a finding for the defendant on both counts. The plaintiff claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>to be aggrieved by the denial of three of its requests for ruling of law \u2014 that the evidence did not warrant a finding for the defendant on count 1; that it did not warrant a finding for the defendant on Count 2, and request numbered 5 that on the facts, hereinafter recited, the plaintiff had acquired title to a motor vehicle \u201ctraded in\u201d and that title to a new motor vehicle vested in the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\"><em>The reported evidence shows that </em>on January 13, 1968 the plaintiff and defendant executed an agreement whereby the plaintiff agreed to sell and the defendant to purchase a new 1968 Rambler; the defendant would be given a credit of $927.40 on an old car and the balance of $2550.00 to be paid in cash on delivery of the new car. On January 20, 1968 the defendant\u2019s wife left the old car with the plaintiff and picked up the new car at which time the registration plates of the old car were transferred to the new car.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In driving it to Holyoke, a distance of 5 to 50 miles, the new car stalled for the first time about 500 yards from the plaintiff\u2019s place of business and continued to stall. While driving to her home in West Springfield from Holyoke there were four more incidents of stalling. The next day, January 21, 1968 it stalled on the way to and from church.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">On Monday, January 22,1968 when returning it to the plaintiff it stalled on the way and it stalled when it reached the plaintiff\u2019s premises. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The plaintiff installed a new carburetor. The next day January 23, 1968 when backing from her garage the motor \u201cbumped out\u201d. She then drove it to Springfield, a distance of three or four miles and while attempting to park in a parking garage the car would not move in reverse. At this point, pursuant to her husband\u2019s instructions to cancel the agreement, she drove the car to the plaintiff\u2019s garage. On the way it stalled again and a mechanic had to push it into the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">She demanded the old car back, got the keys and took it, and told the plaintiff \u201cin no uncertain terms\u201d that the new car was not hers and she was taking the old car back. Affixed to the old car when she took it were the plaintiff dealer\u2019s registration plates. The next day the plaintiff advised the defendant that a new transmission had been installed in the new car. The defendant told the plaintiff that he would not accept the car \u2014 that it had been a hazard to his family, was defective and unsafe and that he had stopped payment on his $2,550.00 check given to the plaintiff at the time of purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Two days later the plaintiff\u2019s attorney wrote the defendant that the new car could be picked up at plaintiff\u2019s place of business or would be delivered to him \u2014 that the old car belonged to the plaintiff. On the same day the defendant went to the plaintiff\u2019s place of business, re^turned the dealer plates and detached the plates formerly on the old car from the new car and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Both parties agree that the transaction is governed by the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, G-.L. c. 106, but cite no Massachusetts cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">They read:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">G.L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-601. \u201cSubject to the provisions of this Article on breach in installment contracts (section 2-612) and unless otherwise agreed under the sections on contractual limitation of remedy (sections 2-718 and 2-719), if the goods or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to conform to the contract, the buyer may</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">(a) r e j ect the whole; or</p>\n<p id=\"AEx\">.

We reject the argument that the defendant\u2019s remedy is limited by the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cnew car warranty\u201d obligating it only \u201cto repairing or replacing, without charge . . . any part or parts thereof\u201d that are defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The controlling sections of the Uniform Commercial Code, as we interpret them, permit a purchaser of a defective new car as found by the trial judge in this case, to rescind the sale within a reasonable time which was done here.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b215-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Charles M.
