The defendant\u2019s answer is general denial, contributory negligence and violation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\"><em>There was evidence on the part of the plaintiff that </em>plaintiff\u2019s motor vehicle was being operated on a two lane public way at about 5:45 P.M. The plaintiff\u2019s operator first saw the defendant\u2019s horse a few feet ahead on the right, the horse attempted to jump over the motor vehicle but landed on the roof of the vehicle and rolled off into the road. The vehicle was badly damaged, the plaintiff\u2019s operator notified the defendant who lived nearby of the accident, the plaintiff\u2019s operator just prior to the accident had come around a curve in the road travelling at 35 to 40 miles per hour near the right side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\"><em>There was evidence on the part of the defendant that </em>she put a leather halter on the horse on the morning of the accident and tied him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>in a field near the house with a stake and chain, that after the accident the halter was undamaged, the stake was still in the ground with the chain attached and the clip on the chain undamaged and in working order, that she observed the horse from the kitchen window intermittently during the day and last observed the horse in the staked position only about fifteen minutes before the accident, the horse was friendly at all times, she saw no one go near the horse during the day, she had no knowledge of how the horse became loose but supposed someone unknown to her unclipped the horse, there were horse\u2019s hoof imprints on the side of the road where the horse apparently had tried to brake himself before the collision, there were four houses including her own in the immediate vicinity on that side of the road, the course of the' road which the plaintiff vehicle travelled in the vicinity was a curve bearing to the driver\u2019s left and on the right side of the road just before entering the curve was a sign reading speed 25 MPH limit, the horse came out from the side of a neighbor\u2019s house which was next door.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The defendant duly filed seven requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The court found for the plaintiff and found \u201cDefendant\u2019s requests 1, 2 and 3 not applicable to the facts of the case found by the court, Bequests 4,5, 6 and 7 are denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u25a0 Defendant requested the court to rule.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u201c1. A horse on a highway is not a trespasser and if defendant\u2019s horse became loose after being properly enclosed or tethered, the defendant is not thereby negligent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The presence of defendant\u2019s horse on a street is not of itself evidence of negligence of the defendant. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">These requests were ruled inapplicable to the facts of the case as found by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The court made no findings of fact although such a ruling requires the court to make a finding of fact. This was error on the part of the court that would entitle the defendant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">District Courts of Massachusetts, Rule 27;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>306 Mass. 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The plaintiff by bringing this action assumed the burden of proof of negligence on the part of the defendant. The plaintiff did not sustain its burden of proof by leaving the cause of the accident to conjecture or surmise. There is no evidence in the report of negligence on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">Proper application of long settled law to the evidence by the court would have resulted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the allowance of defendant\u2019s requests for rulings number one and two and would have resulted in a finding for the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b202-8\">Richard L.
