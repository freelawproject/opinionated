In addition to the first count in the declaration, there was allowed by amendment November 30, 1967 a second count for labor and materials. At no time did plaintiff file any bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">It is argued that under G.L. c. 246, \u00a7 1 it is necessary to file a bond and therefore that there is a defect in the proceedings, and such defect goes to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">G.L. c. 246, \u00a7 1 provides, so far as pertinent, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201cAll personal actions, except tort for malicious prosecution, for slander or libel, or for assault and battery, and except replevin, may be commenced by trustee process, and any person may be summoned as trustee of the defendant therein; but, except in the case of a writ which contains a statement that the action is upon a judgment or in contract for personal services or for goods sold and delivered or for money due under a contract in writing or in tort to recover damages on account of the operation of a motor vehicle not registered in the commonwealth, no writ the ad damum of which is in excess of \u25a0 one thousand dollars shall be served upon any alleged trustee unless there shall have been filed by the plaintiff, if other than a city or town of the commonwealth named therein, in the court wherein such action is commenced, a bond with a surety coni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>pony . authorized, to do business-in the commonwealth as surety, or with sureties approved by a justice, associate justice of special justice of such court, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">A real question as to the jurisdiction of the trial court is raised by that court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the draft report. However, in view of the substantial amount involved in the action, the time and effort put into the various trials by both sides, also of the fact that the issue of jurisdiction can be raised again if the petition to establish is allowed, we are of the opinion that it be allowed primarily to permit consideration of the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to correct inconsistent findings and for further consideration of the jurisdictional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The time and place to correct inconsistent findings is at the hearing of the motion for a new trial or a motion to correct the findings. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Koslowski, </em>351 Mass. 708. <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>Densmore, </em>323 Mass. 106. <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Caswell, </em>321 Mass. 161. It does not appear what, if any, consideration the trial court gave to the matter of inconsistency. It might well be that failure to give adequate consideration was the basis of the denial for the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The petition to establish is therefore allowed, issues to be limited to the denial of the motions to correct inconsistencies, and to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. This procedure will avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>possible prejudice of defendant\u2019s rights and eliminate, at least for the moment, the spending of many days by a judge of this Division in establishing the report.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b122-5\">Edward J.
