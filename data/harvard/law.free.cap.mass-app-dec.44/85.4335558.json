On April 14, 1969, which was the fifth day after receiving notice of the finding of the court, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney hand delivered to the clerk\u2019s office his claim of report to the Appellate Division, with separate copies addressed to the trial justice and the clerk\u2019s office, and mailed a copy of said claim to counsel for the defendant. On April 18, 1969, plaintiff\u2019s attorney hand delivered to the clerk\u2019s office a copy of his draft report addressed to the trial justice; a copy of said report was mailed that day to counsel for the defendant; no copy of the draft report was filed with the clerk at any time.

I rule that filing of original draft report with me and providing a copy to the other party does not constitute compliance- with said Rule 28.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The plaintiff claiming to be aggrieved by dismissal of his draft report the court reported the same to the Appellate Division for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The report states that it contains all the evidence material to the question reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">There is no error on the part of the court. Rule 28 provides in part that \u201cthe party requesting a report shall file a draft thereof within ten days after notice of the finding or decision.\u201d In the case in question no draft report was filed and failure to do so is fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">It is well settled in this Commonwealth that rules of court governing appellate procedure are mandatory, are strictly construed and cannot be waived by the Court.
