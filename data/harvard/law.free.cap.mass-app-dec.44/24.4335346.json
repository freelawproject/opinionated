One of the boys had a dollar with which to pay for such a ride. The defendant was not receptive to the idea. The boys arrived outside the gate of defendant\u2019s premises where defendant claimed there was a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign. The boys testified that there was no such sign. A picture introduced in evidence of the location likewise showed no such sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">The boys apparently waited until defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>arrived in Ms automobile, opened the gate and drove! into the driveway. He did not close the gate, and the boys walked in about three feet into the driveway to speak with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The driveway leading to defendant\u2019s house was a long one. There was evidence that as defendant and his wife were getting out the car, defendant\u2019s Herman shepherd dog was in the back yard chained to a tree. It was testified by the plaintiff and a companion that when defendant got out of his car he whistled, and the dog came out from behind the house, sat beside his master for a moment, then began to run at the boys who in turn started to run out the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Plaintiff, encumbered by his bicycle, fell behind the other boys. He tried to keep the bicycle between himself and the dog and \u201crammed\u201d the bicycle into the dog. The dog, however, ran around the bicycle and bit plaintiff. Plaintiff at this time was near the gate but still in the driveway when he was bitten. Plaintiff testified that at this point defendant said, \u201cThat will teach you. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Defendant made the following requests for rulings:</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">1. The evidence does not warrant a finding for the plaintiff, William J\". Raboin.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">2. The evidence does not warrant a finding for the plaintiff, William E. Raboin.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">3. The evidence does not warrant a finding that the plaintiff, William J. Raboin was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>not trespassing on the defendant\u2019s premises at the time he was allegedly bitten.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">4. The plaintiff has failed to sustain the burden of proof that he was not committing a trespass at the time of the alleged bitting. See G.L. Chapter 140, \u00a7 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The Court denied defendant\u2019s requests. In denying defendant\u2019s request <em>#3, </em>the Court found the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">\u201cI find that plaintiff was not a trespasser barred from recovery under the dogbite statute (G.L. c. 140, \u00a7 155). The evidence indicates that the 12 year old plaintiff, with two other boys, went to defendant\u2019s house in the hope of riding one of his horses. One of the other boys had a dollar to pay for a ride. The boys stood outside the closed gate which did not contain a no trespassing sign. Eventually defendant came along in his automobile, opened the gate and drove into the driveway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">\u201cThereupon, the boys walked into the driveway and approached the defendant, who whistled and his dog, a large German shepherd, came from the rear of the house to defendant\u2019s side. When the dog saw the boys he started to chase them. The dog caught up with the plaintiff, jumped on him and bit him in the genital area. There was no evidence of any activity by defendant to restrain or recall his dog. Defendant did say to plaintiff, \u2018That will teach you.\u2019\u2019.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">After :trial plaintiffs, filed amotion to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>their declaration and add additional counts alleging knowledge that the dog was a vicious animal. The motion to amend was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Defendant claims to be aggrieved by the denial of the requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The main defense to the plaintiff\u2019s action is first, that plaintiff was a trespasser; second, that he was teasing the dog. The defenses are among those listed in the so-called dogbite statute, Gr.L. c. 140, \u00a7 155, the pertinent parts of which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">\u201cIf any dog shall do any damage to either the body or property of any person, the owner or keeper, or if the owner or keeper be a minor, the parent or guardian of such minor, shall be liable for such damage, unless such damage shall have been occasioned to the body or property of a person who, at the time such damage was sustained, was committing a trespass or other tort, or was teasing, tormenting or abusing such dog...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">First, as to trespass, the issue as properly stated in plaintiff\u2019s brief, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">\u201cWhether a minor child enters three feet upon a driveway of another, which does not contain a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign, who enters only after the property owner enters, who enters only after the property owner opens the gate to the driveway, leaving it open, and who enters to speak with the property owner regarding horseback riding, is a trespasser?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The law seems to recognize a difference between what it calls technical trespass and what is essentially criminal trespass, which implies criminal intent. Trespass may be civil or criminal in its nature. The old common law action of trespass known as <em>quare clausum fregit </em>is now a civil action in tort. Pleadings for this cause of action are found in G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 147, (22) and (45).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Criminal trespass such as entry on another\u2019s property is found in Gf.L. c. 266, \u00a7 120 as amended by St. 1969, c. 463, \u00a7 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">\u201cWhoever, without right, enters or remains in or upon the dwelling house, buildings, boats or improved or enclosed land, wharf or pier of another, after having been forbidden so to do by the person who has the lawful control of said premises, either directly or-by notice posted thereon, shall be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than thirty days, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The dogbite statute is obviously civil in character and the trespass therein described is likewise civil in nature, bearing in mind the language referring to \u201ca trespass or other tort\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">To prove a trespass, it is necessary to prove a prohibition of entry on the premises. While the owner in this case testified that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>was such a sign, the court found otherwise on what appears to be sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Courts seem to have regarded situations of the sort presented in this case as entry by license comparable to social calls. The case of Riley v. Harris, 177 Mass. 163, 164, 165, was a case where, plaintiff was approaching de\u2022fendant `s house to make a call on one of defendant's servants, when defendant's dog rushed out and bit plaintiff. The court said:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">\u201cIt does not seem to us to need argument that the plaintiff was not a traspasser. \u2018There are cases ... where the law will imply a license ... from the usages of the community. Thus it has been held that the entry upon another\u2019s close, or into his house, at usual and reasonable hours, and in a customary manner, for any of the common purposes of life, cannot be regarded as a trespass.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">In <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>DelDuca, </em>344 Mass. 66, 69, a little girl, being chased by a dog, ran on to defendant\u2019s land and was bitten by defendant\u2019s dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">The court said :</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">\u201cWe are of opinion, nevertheless, that the jury could have found that the plaintiff was not a trespasser, as that word is used in the statute.\u201d (G.L.c. 140, \u00a7 155).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">Defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiff was teasing the dog is based-on the boy\u2019s testimony th\u00e1t when he was running away from the dog, he not- only used his bicycle as a shield, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>also as a spear, in \u201cramming\u201d the dog. This strategy under the circumstances seems to us .quite legitimate, even, though unsuccessful. We do not think it can fairly be interpreted as teasing the dog.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b37-7\">Marciello <em>&amp; </em>Marciello of Somerville for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b37-8\">Parker, Coutler, Daley &amp; White for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">We are well aware of the aggravation which the youth of today can be to property holders. We sense that defendant in this instance was for some reason annoyed at the boys\u2019 attempt to hire his horse. However, the record before us fails to disclose adequate justification for his permitting, if not encouraging, his dog to attack the plaintiffs with results quite satisfactory to defendant\u2019s judging by his comment, \u201cThat will teach you.\u201d We find no error in the court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\n<em>The report is to be dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
