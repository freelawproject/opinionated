On the recommendation of Bodie, Nagle, the Supiks settled with all of the defendants in that case. The crux of the legal malpractice case is that, after the settlements, the Supiks came to believe that they had settled the toxic tort case against the pest control companies for less than full value. The Supiks filed a claim against appellees alleging, among other things, professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, and fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Following the completion of discovery, Bodie, Nagle moved for summary judgment on the basis that appellants knew, or reasonably should have known, about the negligent representation prior to March 31, 1997. Therefore, appellees argued that Maryland\u2019s three-year statute of limitations on legal malpractice barred the action. The trial court agreed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Appellants have presented us with one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Did the trial court err in granting the motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the statute of limitations accrued more than three years prior to the filing of appellants\u2019 complaint?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">We answer \u201cYes,\u201d because a legal cause of action did not arise until the Supiks settled the underlying tort case, as that event fixed the date of their injury. Moreover, to the extent that a cause of action might have arisen prior to the date of settlement, the question of limitations in this case is one of fact; thus, it was error for the court to grant summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">FACTUAL and PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Jeffrey and Shirley Supik, appellants, own property at 3523 and 3525 North Rolling Road in Baltimore. On March 17, 1993, the Supiks retained Bodie, Nagle to represent them in toxic tort litigation stemming from their alleged exposure to chlordane<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that was applied on their property in 1980 and 1981. The toxic tort litigation, filed August 5, 1994, involved claims against two companies, B &amp; B Exterminators, Inc. and its successor in interest, Home Paramount Pest Control Company. The Supiks also sued their homeowners\u2019 insurer, American Insurance Company (a subsidiary of Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company), as a result of a dispute about the extent of coverage provided by their policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Most of Bodie, Nagle\u2019s representation of the Supiks occurred in 1995, 1996, and early 1997. Throughout the representation, the Supiks relied on the advice of Bodie, Nagle pursuant to the fiduciary attorney-client relationship. There is no dispute that the Supiks often questioned certain advice given by Bodie, Nagle, but they nonetheless agreed to follow the advice, because they presumed that the lawyers knew best, as discussed <em>infra. </em>Among the more significant contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>versies between the Supiks and Bodie, Nagle were (1) the attorneys\u2019 several attempts to settle the ease without informing the Supiks, misinforming the Supiks regarding settlement, and/or botched settlement efforts, and (2) Bodie, Nagle\u2019s waiver of the Supiks\u2019 right to trial by jury over their objection and without their consent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">An array of events occurred which the parties have addressed in their briefs, highlighting the imperfect attorney-client relationship. The Supiks assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">(a) that the Appellees requested that Appellants keep a journal describing what had happened to them during the time they were exposed to Chlordane and that, despite representations by the Appellees that the journal would be kept confidential, the journal was turned over to defense ' counsel [and ultimately used to cross-examine appellants during depositions];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">(b) [in regard to appellants\u2019 likelihood of prevailing against their homeowner insurer] a dispute between the Appellees and the Appellants arose in connection with the extent of coverage for property loss under their homeowners\u2019 policy for compensation related to Chlordane exposure. Appellants believed they had full replacement value whereas Appellees believed the policy provided for fair market compensation for property loss. [Appellants were never able to convince appellees, and they felt as though they should have been able to settle for more than $22,000.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">(c) that one of the Appellees, Kelly Koermer, represented to Appellants that a demand could be made upon the homeowner[s\u2019] insurer in the amount of $450,000.00 [in 1995], when later [in 1996] it was learned by Appellants that the settlement demand had actually been made as to all the defendants in the Toxic Tort Case, and not just simply the homeowner[s\u2019] insurer defendant, American Insurance Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>(d) that in the latter part of 1996, Appellee, Thomas Dolina, advised Appellants that he did not believe they would prevail on the multiple chemical sensitivity claims they were asserting. Although Appellants did not agree with Mr. Dolina\u2019s assessment, they agreed to drop their multiple chemical sensitivity claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">(e) that Mr. Dolina advised Appellants he was concerned they would lose their psychological claim for damages in the case if it were to proceed to trial. This upset Mr. Supik who was concerned that the Appellants were adopting the defense spin that the Appellants suffered pre-existing psychological conditions. [Appellants felt that Dolina was not giving accurate information in this regard.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">(f) that Mr. Dolina made a demand on behalf of the Appellants in the amount of $550,000.00 [in December 1996] which they had not authorized and which upset them when they learned about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">(g) that Mr. Dolina advised Appellants that, in his opinion, Appellants\u2019 case had an approximate settlement value of $300,000.00 Mr. Supik disagreed with that assessment but did not discuss the issue with any of the Appellees. [Although, appellee Kelly Koermer had \u201coften said don\u2019t worry about it, that\u2019s Tom, he always deals with the case as a devil\u2019s advocate.\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">(h) that as of January 2, 1997, Appellants did not believe they had sufficient information to consider the possibility of any settlement discussions, despite Mr. Dolina\u2019s desire to discuss settlement with the homeowners\u2019 insurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">(i) that on January 6, 1997, Mr. Dolina wrote to Appellants advising that he was considering converting the case from a jury trial to a bench trial. Appellants were unhappy with Mr. Dolina\u2019s recommendation to convert their case [as] is reflected in a letter dated January 14,1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">(j) that Appellants later learned that Mr. Dolina had, despite their objection, converted the case to non-jury. This angered Appellants, who demanded that Mr. Dolina reverse his actions and change the case back to a jury trial because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>they believed they had a better chance of success if the case were heard by a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">(k) that Appellees represented to Appellants that they had received an estimate from someone willing to demolish or dispose of one of the two contaminated properties for $9,500.00. The Appellees, however, did not provide Appellants with copies of that estimate despite repeated written and oral requests for same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">(l) that on March 7,1997, the Appellants reluctantly agreed to settle their claim with the homeowner[s\u2019] insurer for $22,000.00 despite their strong desire not to settle the claim. Appellants depict their decision to settle the Homeowners\u2019 Case as being made under duress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">(m) that following their settlement of the Homeowners\u2019 Case, Appellants and the Appellees continued their efforts to prepare for the Toxic Tort Case against B <em>&amp; </em>B and Home Paramount [scheduled for April 1, 1997]. The Appellants expressed concerns as to the method by which they were being prepared [in a March 19, 1997, letter to Mr. Dolina].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">(n) that throughout the years 1996 and 1997, Appellants made numerous requests for copies of the reports and depositions generated in their case so they would be able to evaluate any settlement offers conveyed and have a better understanding as to the extent of their health conditions and the extent of any contamination to their persons and property. Such requests were made verbally and in writing, although Appellants did not receive all the requested documents until sometime after December of 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">The essence of the Supik\u2019s malpractice action is that they settled the toxic tort case against the pest control companies for less than full value.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Unknown to the Supiks, the attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>neys had relied on remediation estimates from the pest control companies without seeking an independent estimate from an expert of their own choosing. The settlement with B &amp; B Exterminators, Inc. and Home Paramount Pest Control Company occurred on April 1, 1997, and was placed on the record in open court on April 3, 1997.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In early May 1997, the Supiks spoke with one of the experts who had planned to testify on their behalf had their case gone to trial. They learned from him that they had made a \u201cmajor mistake\u201d by settling the toxic tort case for $175,000 because, in the expert\u2019s view, the claim had a much higher value.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result of this information, the Supiks sent a letter to Bodie, Nagle on May 6, 1997, seeking to repudiate the agreement. Bodie, Nagle informed the Supiks that they could not repudiate the settlement agreement, but the Supiks insisted otherwise. Bodie, Nagle then moved to strike their appearance as counsel for the Supiks, which the court granted on July 8, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The Supiks persisted in their efforts to repudiate the settlement agreement by filing, <em>pro se, </em>motions in the circuit court. They were unsuccessful and appealed the circuit court\u2019s denial of their motion to vacate the judgment to this Court in 1998. In an unreported opinion, we held that the trial court had properly enforced the settlement agreement. <em>Supik v. B &amp; B Exterminators, Inc., </em>No. 72, Sept. Term, 1988 (Md.Ct. Spec.App., Oct. 22, 1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 Md. 619, 724 A.2d 21 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">On March 31, 2000, the Supiks, again acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a sixteen-count legal malpractice complaint against Bodie, Na-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>gle, which answered on May 2, 2001, raising an affirmative defense of statute of limitations, in addition to other defenses, and a general denial of the facts alleged. A trial date was set for September 9, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">After the conclusion of discovery, Bodie, Nagle moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the Supiks knew, or reasonably should have known, about their negligent representation prior to March 31, 1997. The trial court, although expressing some reluctance, granted summary judgment, ruling that the Supiks were legally put on inquiry notice prior to March 31, 1997 (the day prior to the effect of the settlement agreement with the tort defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In finding that the Supiks had been put on notice (or that a reasonable person in their position would have been put on notice), the circuit court relied primarily on the fact that they felt under \u201cduress\u201d to settle the claim against their homeowners\u2019 insurer for $22,000, as of March 7, 1997; in essence missing the three-year statute of limitations deadline by twenty-four days. The court opined that it was that event, not the later settlement with the tort defendants, that put the Supiks on notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The Supiks subsequently retained counsel and have noted a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">STANDARD of REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">At the summary judgment stage, a trial court\u2019s function \u201cis to determine whether there is a [genuine] dispute as to any material fact sufficient to require an issue to be tried.\u201d <em>Frederick Rd. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Brown &amp; Sturm, </em>360 Md. 76, 93, 756 A.2d 963 (2000) (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-501 (e) (2003); <em>Murphy v. Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. 525, 697 A.2d 861 (1997). Accordingly, our review on appeal requires us to determine whether a genuine dispute of material fact existed, and if the trial court was legally correct. <em>Frederick Rd., supra, </em>360 Md. at 93, 756 A.2d 963. Summary judgment is not a substitute for trial; rather it is applied to dispose of cases when no genuine dispute of material fact exists. <em>Okwa </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 178, 757 A.2d 118 (2000). A trial court, in granting a motion for summary judgment, is limited to ruling on matters of law, and may not resolve factual disputes. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). As such, all facts, and reasonable inferences therefrom, must be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, here the Supiks. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Yet, at the same time, Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have repeatedly stated that the determination of when a cause of action \u201caccrues\u201d under \u00a7 5-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article is one left to the court for judicial determination. <em>Frederick Rd., supra, </em>360 Md. at 95, 756 A.2d 963. \u201cThis determination may be based solely on law, solely on fact, or on a combination of law and fact, and is reached after careful consideration of the purpose of the statute and the facts to which it is applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 756 A.2d 963 (citing <em>Poffenberger v. Risser, </em>290 Md. 631, 634, 431 A.2d 677 (1981)). Indeed, several cases seem to suggest that the factual determination may be made by the court. Judge Rodowsky, however, speaking for the Court of Appeals in <em>O\u2019Hara v. Kovens, </em>305 Md. 280, 295-97, 503 A.2d 1313 (1986), put to rest any contemplation that a judge determines issues of fact at the summary judgment stage. In dispelling that concept, he wrote, \u201c[t]he notion that all aspects of a limitations defense, including the resolution of conflicting facts and inferences, is a function of the court alone can be traced to misinterpretations in certain opinions by the Court of Special Appeals of decisions by this Court concerning the discovery rule in the era prior to <em>Poffenberger, </em>290 Md. 631, 431 A.2d 677.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297, 431 A.2d 677. In so doing, the <em>O\u2019Hara </em>court confirmed that \u201cordinary principles governing summary judgment ... continue to apply when the issue on summary judgment is limitations____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 503 A.2d 1313 (citations omitted). We read <em>O\u2019Hara </em>and <em>Frederick Road </em>directing that only when there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to when the action accrued, should a trial court grant summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>on the basis of limitations; otherwise, the question is one of fact for the trier of fact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the question of accrual also focuses on whether appellants were put on inquiry notice at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>some time before March 31, 1997 (assuming the prior existence of a cause of action as we will discuss, infra). In other words, Bodie, Nagle argued that their representation was so careless that an objective person would have been put on notice about their negligent actions at a much earlier time, certainly earlier than May, 1997, when the Supiks basically conceded that they knew they were harmed. In this regard, a determination must be made as to whether a reasonable person would have been put on notice, which necessarily involves the \u201cassessment of the credibility or believability of the evidence!)]\u201d <em>Frederick Rd., supra, </em>360 Md. at 96, 756 A.2d 963. To this, the Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">\u201cwhether or not the plaintiffs failure to discover his cause of action was due to failure on his part to use due diligence, or to the fact that defendant so concealed the wrong that plaintiff was unable to discover it by the exercise of due diligence, is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ave\"><em>Id. </em>at 96, 756 A.2d 963 (quoting <em>O\u2019Hara, supra, </em>305 Md. at 294-95, 503 A.2d 1313 (citations and internal quotations omitted)); <em>see also Doe v. Archdiocese of Wash., </em>114 Md.App. 169, 176, 689 A.2d 634 (1997) (\u201cWhen the viability of a statute of limitations defense hinges on a question of fact ... the factual question is ordinarily resolved by the jury, rather than by the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AOR\">Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">In Maryland, a three-year statute of limitations applies to legal malpractice actions pursuant to \u00a7 5-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. (\u201cC.J.\u201d) <em>Fairfax Savings, F.S.B. v. Weinberg &amp; Green, </em>112 Md.App. 587, 612, 685 A.2d 1189 (1996). Section 5-101 states that \u201cA civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues....\u201d Md.Code Ann., C.J. \u00a75-101 (Repl.Vol.2002). Statutes of limitations serve to \u201c \u2018provide adequate time for a diligent plaintiff to bring suit as well as to ensure fairness to defendants by encouraging prompt filing of claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fairfax </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>Savings, supra, </em>112 Md.App. at 612, 685 A.2d 1189 (quoting <em>Hecht v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>333 Md. 324, 338, 635 A.2d 394 (1994)). Such statutes are, in short, a reflection of public policy established by the General Assembly regarding a reasonable time in which to file suit. <em>Murphy, supra, </em>346 Md. at 531, 697 A.2d 861; <em>Doe, supra, </em>114 Md.App. at 176, 689 A.2d 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Historically, a cause of action accrued on the date the wrong occurred. <em>Doe, supra, </em>114 Md.App. at 176, 689 A.2d 634. Over time, however, Maryland courts and the Legislature recognized the harshness of the rule, and both have tempered the \u201cdate of the wrong\u201d rule for accrual purposes in situations where it was impossible or unreasonable for a plaintiff to have sufficient notice of the nature and cause of the injury. <em>Id. </em>at 177, 689 A.2d 634. Such cases involve factual scenarios where the plaintiff had not learned about the injury because of fraud, stealth, subterfuge, or other difficulties (such as latent injuries), or when the plaintiff had relied upon a continuing relationship with another party, or when the plaintiff was under a disability at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Presently, there are at least four situations in which the accrual date is not the \u201cdate of the wrong,\u201d but some point later in time after the injury has already occurred, three of which were recently discussed in some detail by the Court of Appeals in <em>Frederick Rd., </em>360 Md. at 95-99, 756 A.2d 963, in the context of legal malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">\n<em>Discovery Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">First, and perhaps most often discussed, is the \u201cdiscovery rule.\u201d Under the discovery rule an \u201caction is deemed to accrue on the date when the plaintiff knew or, with due diligence, reasonably should have known of the wrong.\u201d <em>Doe, supra, </em>114 Md.App. at 177, 689 A.2d 634. The discovery rule \u201cis not so much an exception to the statute of limitations, as it is a recognition that the Legislature, in employing the word \u2018accrues\u2019 in \u00a7 5-101, never intended to close our courts to plaintiffs inculpably unaware of their injuries.\u201d <em>Murphy, supra, </em>346 Md. at 532, 697 A.2d 861 (citations omitted). As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>noted previously, the date when a particular plaintiff knows or, with due diligence, objectively should have known of the wrong, is generally a factual determination for a jury, and not the court. <em>Frederick Rd., supra, </em>360 Md. at 96, 756 A.2d 963; <em>Doe, supra, </em>114 Md.App. at 178, 689 A.2d 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\n<em>Continuation of Events Theory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">A corollary accrual doctrine recognized by Maryland courts is the \u201ccontinuation of events\u201d theory. <em>Frederick Rd., supra, </em>360 Md. at 97, 756 A.2d 963.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">\u201c[I]n cases where there is an undertaking which requires a <em>continuation of services, </em>or the party\u2019s right depends upon the happening of an event in the future, the statute begins to run only from the time the services can be completed or from the time the event happens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 97, 756 A.2d 963 (quoting <em>W., B. &amp; A. Elec. R.R. Co. v. Moss, </em>130 Md. 198, 204-05, 100 A. 86 (1917)). The continuation of events theory is based on the equitable principle of detrimental reliance. When a relationship develops between two parties, built on trust and confidence, the confiding party may rely upon the \u201cgood faith of the other party so long as the relationship continues to exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 756 A.2d 963. This is especially true in fiduciary relationships such as the attorney-client relationship where \u201ca client has the right to rely on his or her lawyers\u2019 loyalty and to believe the accuracy and candor of the advice they give.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 756 A.2d 963.</p>\n<p id=\"AaP\">[A] client\u2019s right to rely upon his or her attorney\u2019s advice is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\">\u201cfounded upon public policy, because the <em>confidential and fiduciary relationship enables an attorney to exercise a very strong influence over his client </em>and often affords him opportunities to obtain undue advantage by availing himself of the client\u2019s necessities, credulity and liberality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3Ly\"><em>Id. </em>at 102, 756 A.2d 963 (quoting <em>Hughes v. McDaniel, </em>202 Md. 626, 633, 98 A.2d 1 (1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">Notwithstanding the confidential relationship, if the confiding party knows, or reasonably should know, about a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>past injury, accrual for statute of limitations purposes will begin on the date of inquiry notice, and not the completion of services. \u201cThe confiding party, in other words, is under no duty to make inquiries about the quality or bona fides of the services received, unless and until something occurs to make him or her suspicious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 756 A.2d 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\n<em>Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">A third category that will postpone an accrual date is fraud, as governed by \u00a7 5-203 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The fraud exception is essentially a tangent of the discovery rule. If an adverse party fraudulently conceals knowledge of a cause of action, \u201cthe cause of action shall be deemed to accrue at the time when the party discovered, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered the fraud.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 5-203 (Repl.Vol.2002). Much like the discovery rule, a person is said to be on inquiry notice when a reasonable person would have used due diligence to investigate the fraud or the underlying injury. <em>See Frederick Rd., supra, </em>360 Md. at 98-99, 756 A.2d 963. Of course, this scenario often begs the question: if a party is perpetrating fraud in such a manner as to obfuscate the confiding party, would a reasonable person be otherwise attuned to the fraud? Additionally, a plaintiff wishing to invoke C.J. \u00a7 5-203 must plead fraud with particularity. <em>Doe, supra, </em>114 Md.App. at 187, 689 A.2d 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">\n<em>Plaintiff Under a Disability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">A fourth situation that may postpone the date for accrual occurs when a plaintiff is under a \u201cdisability\u201d at the time of the injury.

The concept of \u201charm\u201d for negligence actions in Maryland case law generally refers to \u201c \u2018the existence of loss or detriment in fact of any kind to a person resulting from a cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Owens-Illinois v.

Cytology Serv. of Maryland, Inc., </em>111 Md.App. 233, 681 A.2d 546 (1996), <em>aff'd, sub nom., Rivera v. Edmonds, </em>347 Md. 208, 699 A.2d 1194 (1997), helpful in our analysis. In <em>Edmonds, </em>we were faced with determining what constitutes an \u201cinjury\u201d in a medical malpractice action, for purposes of the statute of limitations under \u00a7 5-109 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. We concluded that a patient sustains an injury when \u201che or she first sustains compensable damages that can be proven with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 681 A.2d 546 (citations omitted). Among other supporting reasons, we came to this conclusion by application of the standard definition of negligence which requires <em>\u201ca,dual injury or loss </em>[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 681 A.2d 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Also discussed in <em>Edmonds, </em>relevant to our analysis, is the concept that a negligent act may not result in an injury, or if it does, the injury does not always occur simultaneously with the negligent act. <em>Id. </em>at 257, 681 A.2d 546. \u201cThe real cause of action in a negligence action is not the negligent act but the injury resulting therefrom, since to support the action there must be not only the negligent act, but a consequential injury, and the injury is the gravamen of the charge.\u201d 65 C.J.S. <em>Negligence </em>\u00a7 56, at 352 (2000) (footnotes omitted). Moreover, we emphasize that the mere possibility of an injury in a negligence action does not give rise to a cause of action. <em>See Morris v. Osmose Wood Preserving, </em>340 Md. 519, 536, 667 A.2d 624 (1995).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Appellants argue that they incurred no injury until the day of settlement with B &amp; B Exterminators, April 1, 1997. Alternatively, they argue that even if injury did occur prior to that day, the discovery rule or continuation of services theory should toll the accrual date to a point later than March 31, 1997. Bodie, Nagle takes the position that a legal cause of action accrued well before April 1, 1997, even as early as 1995. By citing the litany of events to which we have earlier referred, they argue that the Supiks were harmed by the deficiencies at the very latest by March 19, 1997, the day the Supiks sent a letter to the law firm expressing concerns about the course that trial preparation was taking.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Bodie, Nagle cites <em>Edwards v. Demedis, </em>118 Md.App. 541, 553, 703 A.2d 240 (1997), for the proposition that Maryland does not follow the \u201cmaturation of harm\u201d rule and that, therefore, a cause of action arises before actual injury occurs as long as there is a probability that an injury will occur. While we agree that Maryland has not adopted the maturation of harm rule, we do not interpret the rule in the same light as does Bodie, Nagle. As the Court of Appeals noted in <em>Harig v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>Johns-Manville Products, </em>284 Md. 70, 394 A.2d 299 (1978), the maturation of harm rule pertains more to the extent of (an already present) injury than to the presence of an injury. <em>Id. </em>at 74 n. 1, 394 A.2d 299. Indeed, in <em>Edwards, </em>immediately following our announcement that Maryland does not follow the maturation of harm rule, we clarified that \u201c[a] legal wrong must be sustained, but a precise amount of damages need not be known.\u201d <em>Edwards, supra, </em>118 Md.App. at 553, 703 A.2d 240 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">A trier of fact could find that no legally cognizable injury existed sooner than April 1, 1997 when the toxic tort case was settled and, hence, that a cause of action did not exist against Bodie, Nagle until that time. Before that time their claim remained viable, their entitlement was not fixed, and damages remained unliquidated. Further negotiation was possible. They continued to possess the right to present their case and their claim for damages to the court. With the execution of the settlement agreement their potential dissolved into a certainty\u2014there could be no greater recovery than that agreed to. Because it appears that there were a number of allegedly negligent acts prior to that date, a jury could find no injury to the Supiks caused by those acts until the settlement actually occurred on April 1, 1997, and that there was no loss or detriment to them, as they could have at any point prior to the settlement decided not to settle.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Bodie, Nagle relies on <em>Fairfax Savings, supra, </em>and <em>Bennett v. Baskin &amp; Sears, </em>77 Md.App. 56, 549 A.2d 393 (1988). We find those cases to be distinguishable, because in both, not only had the plaintiffs (or a reasonable person in their position) been put on notice three years prior to filing suit, but the cause of action became legally compensable three years prior, given the existence of actual injury. In <em>Fairfax Savings, </em>for example, the harm occurred in 1987 when the plaintiffs incurred legal fees to defend the cross-claims. 112 Md.App. at 617, 685 A.2d 1189. In <em>Bennett, </em>the legal injury occurred at the very latest in 1980 when the law firm executed a promissory note in favor of the consulting firm. 77 Md.App. at 60 &amp; 75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>n. 4, 549 A.2d 393. We also find <em>Edwards, supra, </em>factually distinguishable because the plaintiffs in that case were aware (or should have been aware) of the legal harm in 1990, three years prior to filing suit, but they were not aware of the \u201camount of harm sustained\u201d until the formal notice of deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service. 118 Md.App. at 557, 703 A.2d 240. Here, in contrast, while there was obvious dissatisfaction with many things that were said and done by Bodie, Nagle, and questions raised by the Supiks, there was no legal harm prior to the date of settlement. It would be detrimental to the traditional attorney-client relationship to suggest that a client, each time a disagreement arose, should expect to be damaged and be required to consult yet other counsel to review the actions of the attorney earlier retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Because the ordinary principles governing summary judgment continue to apply when the issue is summary judgment on grounds of limitations, and because there does exist, in this case, a genuine dispute of material fact, we hold that the trial court erred as a matter of law in granting Bodie, Nagle\u2019s' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Supiks sustained an injury prior to April 1, 1997, we think there is an equally compelling reason to reverse. At the summary judgment stage, all facts, and reasonable inferences therefrom, must be construed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. Assuming an injury to the Supiks prior to April 1, the question remains whether the \u201ccontinuation of events\u201d theory would have tolled the accrual of the cause of action. That is an issue for a jury to resolve. <em>Frederick Rd., supra, </em>360 Md. at 104, 756 A.2d 963. We reach that conclusion because the Supiks repeatedly noted that they were relying on their attorneys\u2019 advice throughout the representation. Whether it was reasonable for them to continue doing so is a question of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 96, 756 A.2d 963 (citing <em>O\u2019Hara, supra, </em>305 Md. at 294-95, 503 A.2d 1313).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Even though the Supiks expressed concerns about the quality of their legal representation as early as 1995, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>alleged that Bodie, Nagle repeatedly eased their concerns and reassured them in several contexts. For example, the Supiks expressed concerns about the settlement with the homeowners\u2019 insurer in early March. During a deposition of Jeffrey Supik, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">Q. [APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: So you obviously didn\u2019t believe what Mr. Dolina was telling you, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">A. [MR. SUPIK] Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">Q. My question is, why didn\u2019t you go seek a second opinion from somebody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">A. Because the real people that were responsible was Home Paramount and B &amp; B, and the only way we could get to them was to go through Fireman\u2019s Fund. Mr. Dolina said let\u2019s get rid of the Fireman\u2019s Fund let\u2019s get rid of the Fireman\u2019s Fund so we don\u2019t have to battle with them and get right to the deep pockets. He was telling us that a week or two before we went to Judge Bollinger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">Q. But I\u2019m just talking about Fireman\u2019s Fund right now. You thought that you could get more than the 22,000 from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">A. If my understanding of the policy was accurate, yes, we should have gotten much more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">Q. And you knew that on March 6, and yet you agreed to settle anyway?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">A. I believed that on March 6, but I was trusting my attorney who said you don\u2019t know what your policy provides.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">Similar reassurances were also set out in a letter sent from Bodie, Nagle to the Supiks on January 2, 1997, in which appellee Dolina wrote, \u201cAs I indicated over the telephone, it is my opinion that there was little possibility for success against the homeowners insurance, given the language of the policy as well as the general nature of insurance law.... I, therefore, strongly recommend acceptance of those [settlement] funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">Appellee Koermer gave reassurances to the Supiks on numerous occasions regarding the quality of representation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>When Jeffrey Supik was asked by Bodie, Nagle\u2019s counsel in a deposition on February 8, 2002, if it was a mistake for appellee Dolina to abandon the psychological injury claims, he responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">A. Kelly had a habit of saying, Tom likes to play devil\u2019s advocate, that\u2019s how the defense is going to treat you, get ready for that. She liked saying that. So whenever Dolina doesn\u2019t make too much sense to me at that time, I say, okay, the jury will see it different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">During a deposition on February 15, 2002, the following discussion occurred between Bodie, Nagle\u2019s counsel and Jeffrey Supik regarding a December 16, 1996, letter from Dolina to the Supiks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">Q. [APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: In the second to last sentence of this letter, Mr. Dolina tells us that he believes that the case has a combined relative worth for the bodily injury and property damage portion of the claim in a range somewhere around $800,000, do you see that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">A. [MR. SUPIK]: Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">Q. When you read that, what was your reaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">A. Yet to be seen. We\u2019ll find out in trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">Q. Did you disagree with Mr. Dolina\u2019s assessment of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-12\">A. Oh, sure. And the reason I disagreed was because when he presented these defense strategies or angles, Kelly often said don\u2019t worry about it, that\u2019s Tom, he always deals with the case as a devil\u2019s advocate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">Shirley Supik also noted that Bodie, Nagle had reassured them about their doubts. When asked in a deposition on February 27, 2002, if she \u201cever [had] an opportunity to say to [Dolina] you thought he had harmed your case [by changing the case from a jury trial to a bench trial]\u201d Shirley Supik responded, \u201cNo, because he told us he thought he was doing it for our case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">As the Court of Appeals recently noted in <em>Frederick Road, </em>\u201cA client is entitled to believe a lawyer who says T am your lawyer, why not trust me, I am a lawyer, I would not do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>anything that is wrong.\u2019 \u201d 360 Md. at 101, 756 A.2d 963 (citation omitted). While the Bodie, Nagle attorneys in the present case did not articulate their advice with that degree of specificity (nor did the attorneys in <em>Frederick </em>Road), for the same reason that the summary judgment motion was reversed in <em>Frederick Road, </em>we must also do the same here; that is, because whether a reasonable person would have been put on notice, notwithstanding the confidential attorney-client relationship, is a question of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 103-04, 756 A.2d 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">On the record in this case, a fact finder could conclude that it was reasonable for the Supiks, untrained in the law, and relying on the fiduciary relationship with their attorneys, to have failed to discover their cause of action at an earlier date.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\">.

We note the dilemma before the trial court as to whether the court was faced with a question of law, fact, or both, and whether the court could, as a matter of law, determine the factual date of inquiry notice.

As we will discuss <em>infra, </em>a cause of action \"arises\" when all elements of a legal claim are present. The \"accrual\u201d date, and when the statue of limitation begins to run, is the date when a plaintiff knows, or with due care should have known, that the cause of action has arisen. See <em>Young v. Medlantic Lab. P\u2019ship, </em>125 Md.App. 299, 306, 725 A.2d 572, <em>cert. denied, </em>354 Md. 572, 731 A.2d 970 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">.

A lawyer may be held liable lor malpractiee in cases that have previously settled. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>351 Md. at 521-24, 718 A.2d 1187. Such liability stems from two different grounds. Liability can attach when a lawyer's general deficiencies have compromised the opportunity to receive more at trial (or a favorable outcome for that matter), such that the client is essentially forced to settle. <em>Id. </em>at. 522, 718 A.2d 1187. Additionally, a lawyer may be held liable if he or she fails to know \u201crelevant facts or law or to appreciate the real value of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522, 718 A.2d 1187. In the latter situation, the client is not knowingly forced to settle, but rather the lawyer misinformed his or her client about what the case was worth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b740-6\">. While the Court of Appeals was interpreting when a cause of action arises in the context of then \u00a7 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which placed a cap on non-economic damages after July 1, 1986, we note its reliance in this regard on <em>Harig v. Johns-Manville Products, </em>284 Md. 70, 394 A.2d 299 (1978), a case dealing with accrual of a cause of action in a statute of limitations action for an asbestos-related injury. <em>Owens-Illinois, supra, </em>326 Md. at 121, 604 A.2d 47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">. In its summary judgment motion, as reiterated in its reply brief, Bodie, Nagle took the position that if the case went to trial, it would have been able to prove that the undisputed facts cited in its summary judgment motion were actually not true.

It differs from the word \"harm\u201d in this: \"harm\u201d implies the existence of loss or detriment in fact, which may not necessarily be the invasion of a legally protected interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\">. In <em>Morris, </em>the Court of Appeals was faced with, among other issues, determining whether the plaintiffs could recover for \"economic loss\u201d caused without actual injury. The Court ruled lhat absent actual injury, only the allegation of \u201cclear danger of death or <em>serious </em>personal injury\u201d was sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss in an economic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>loss case. 340 Md. at 536, 667 A.2d 624. In so concluding, the Court also affirmed the dismissal of all tort causes of action because the plaintiffs had only alleged possibilities of injury. <em>Id. </em>at 535-36, 667 A.2d 624. Accordingly, we read from Morris that a possibility of injury is not sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. <em>See also </em>65 C.J.S. <em>Negligence </em>\u00a7 56, at 353 (2000) (\"The possibility of injury is not injury itself and, while the possibility that injury may result from an act or omission is sufficient to give the quality of negligence thereto, possibility is insufficient to impose any liability or give rise to a cause of action.\u201d (citing <em>Resavage v.

Jeffrey Supik\u2019s letter to Dolina is not nearly as consequential as Bodie, Nagle make it to be. Jeffrey Supik wrote to Dolina because of concerns that the attorneys were preparing Jeffrey and Shirley differently for trial. Supik also pursued an earlier request for reports of their expert witnesses. Reading the letter as a whole, we view it as no more than an expression of unease by a client faced with the uncertainties of trial. Bodie, Nagle also argues that because the Supiks felt they had been harmed by certain events that the element of \"harm\u201d had been established. Whether a legal cause of action exists turns on the objective presence of all elements, not the subjective perception of an individual.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
