On appeal, Candeloro asks two questions, which we have reworded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">I. Did the circuit court err by dismissing several counts of Candeloro\u2019s complaint for failing to comply with the Maryland Tort Claims Act (\u201cMTCA\u201d), Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">II. Did the circuit court err by granting summary judgment on the malicious prosecution count?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">We answer \u201cno\u201d to both questions and affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">On December 7, 1997, at the intersection of Route 30 and Dover Road in Baltimore County, an altercation occurred between Candeloro and Christopher Cole, a trooper with the Maryland State Police. As a result, Candeloro was arrested and charged with second degree assault, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, wearing and carrying mace, and disobeying the lawful order of a police officer. At a court trial on May 7, 1998, the State <em>nolle prossed </em>all of the charges except disobeying the lawful order of a police officer, for which Candeloro was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">Because of injuries allegedly sustained during that altercation and because Trooper Cole was an employee of the State of Maryland, Candeloro submitted a written claim to the State Treasurer, as required by SG \u00a7 12-106(b)(l) of the MTCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The claim was sent by certified mail on December 7, 1998, and received by the Treasurer on December 9, 1998.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In December 2000, Candeloro filed a nine-count complaint against ap-pellees in the circuit court, seeking damages for assault (\u201ccount I\u201d), battery (\u201ccount II\u201d), false arrest (\u201ccount III\u201d), false imprisonment (\u201ccount IV\u201d), intentional infliction of emotional distress (\u201ccount V\u201d), malicious prosecution (\u201ccount VI\u201d), invasion of privacy (\u201ccount VII\u201d), violation of due process (\u201ccount VIII\u201d), and loss of consortium (\u201ccount IX\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing, in part, that Candeloro could not institute the action because she had not complied with SG \u00a7 12\u2014106(b)(1), requiring that a written claim be submitted to the Treasurer within one year \u201cafter the injury.\u201d Specifically, they contended that the claim had not been received by the Treasurer until December 9, 1998, more than one year after the injury. The circuit court agreed, dismissing counts I through IV and VII through VIII.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Appellees then filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that count V should be dismissed also because it was undisputed that Candeloro had not complied with the notice requirement of SG \u00a7 12-106(b)(l). They also contended that because Candeloro\u2019s \u201carrest and [the] criminal proceeding\u201d were based upon probable cause, there was no basis for count VI, i.e., malicious prosecution. The circuit court granted the motion as to both counts of the complaint. Concerning count V, the circuit court held that \u201cthe time limits as required by Maryland law have not been complied with.\u201d As to count VI, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">I don\u2019t think you can have a malicious prosecution when, in fact, there is a conviction. And, in fact, Candeloro was prosecuted for the event that occurred on December 7,1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>She was charged with various offenses. She was convicted of failing to obey an order of an officer. And I don\u2019t believe you can have malicious prosecution when, in fact, a person is prosecuted for an event and is convicted for some event, some crime arising out of that event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The State of Maryland\u2019s sovereign immunity was substantially waived by the enactment of the MTCA, affording a \u201cremedy for individuals injured by tortious conduct attributable to the State.\u201d <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 492, 632 A.2d 753 (1993). The MTCA requires that an individual submit a claim to the State Treasurer before instituting an action against the State. The Treasurer is responsible for considering, settling, or denying those claims, SG \u00a7 12-107, and \u201cshall adopt necessary regulations: to (1) set policies and procedures for payment on losses, including adjustment and approval; ... and (3) otherwise to carry out the duties of the Treasurer under this title,\u201d Md.Code (1985, 2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-104(b) of the State Finance and Procurement Article (\u201cSF &amp; P\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Under the MTCA, a claimant must comply with certain threshold requirements, one of which is the submission of a \u25a0written claim to the Treasurer \u201cwithin 1 year after the injury.\u201d SG \u00a7 12-106(b)(l). Regulations adopted by the Treasurer provide that a claim \u201cshall be deemed to have been submitted as of the date it is actually <em>received </em>by the State Treasurer\u2019s office,\u201d COMAR 25.02.03.01(B) (\u201cthe Regulation\u201d) (emphasis added), and \u201can otherwise proper claim shall be received by the State Treasurer\u2019s Office within 1 year after the injury that is the basis for the claim,\u201d COMAR 25.02.03.03(B). The word \u201csubmit\u201d is defined as \u201cactual receipt by the Treasurer.\u201d COMAR 25.02.01.02(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Since the MTCA was enacted in 1981, the amount of time in which a claimant must file a claim with the Treasurer has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>changed. Initially, a claimant had to \u201cpresent\u201d a written claim to the Treasurer \u201cwithin the applicable period of limitations.\u201d <em>Condon, </em>332 Md. at 493, 632 A.2d 753. By Chapter 538 of the Acts of 1985, the legislature amended the MTCA, narrowing \u201cthe time in which claimants could file claims\u201d from \u201cthree years to 180 days after the date of the injury.\u201d <em>Condon, </em>332 Md. at 494, 632 A.2d 753. In 1995, the legislature again amended the MTCA, expanding the time in which claimants could file claims from 180 days to \u201c1 year after the date of injury.\u201d SG \u00a7 12\u2014106(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Candeloro argues that the Regulation\u2019s requirement that a claim is \u201cdeemed submitted\u201d when it is received by the Treasurer is \u201cinconsistent with the legislative intent\u201d of SG \u00a7 12\u2014106(b)(1). According to Candeloro, the word \u201csubmit\u201d requires only that a claimant transmit a claim, i.e., by mail, within \u201c1 year after the injury\u201d and not that it be \u201creceived\u201d by the Treasurer. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">When the legislature delegates authority to a state agency to promulgate regulations, \u201cthe agency\u2019s regulations are valid under the statute if they do not contradict the statutory language or purpose.\u201d <em>Lussier v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>343 Md. 681, 688, 684 A.2d 804 (1996). Although the MTCA is to be \u201cconstrued broadly, to ensure that injured parties have a remedy,\u201d SG \u00a7 12-102, we do not believe that the Regulation contradicts the statutory language or purpose of SG \u00a7 12-106(b)(1). Under the MTCA, the Treasurer may review, settle, or deny a written claim. In so doing, the Treasurer shall adopt necessary regulations to \u201cset policies and procedures for payment on losses, including adjustment and approval\u201d and \u201cotherwise carry out\u201d those duties. <em>See </em>SF &amp; P \u00a7 9-104(b). The broad authority granted by the legislature to the Treasurer would encompass a regulation providing that a claim \u201cshall be deemed to have been submitted as of the date it is actually received.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The Regulation also reflects the statutory purpose of SG \u00a7 12-106(b)(l), which is to \u201cgive the State early notice of claims against it.\u201d <em>Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 470, 667 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>179 (1995). Notice provides the State with an opportunity to \u201cinvestigate the claims while the facts are fresh and memories vivid, and, where appropriate, settle them at the earliest possible time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Only the receipt of a claim ensures that the State is provided with notice. The mere mailing of a claim does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Moreover, the Regulation was enacted in 1990. Since then, the legislature has amended SG \u00a7 12-106 twice. On neither occasion did it alter or change the language of \u00a7 12-106(b)(l) to clarify that the word \u201csubmit\u201d did not mean \u201creceive.\u201d Because the legislature is \u201cpresumed to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the policy of the prior law,\u201d <em>Messitte v. Colonial Mortg. Service Co. Associates, Inc., </em>287 Md. 289, 294, 411 A.2d 1051 (1980), the implication is that the Regulation does not contradict the statutory language or purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Candeloro also argues that the mailing of her claim on December 7, 1998, \u201camounted to substantial compliance,\u201d and, therefore, satisfied the notice requirement of SG \u00a7 12-106(b)(1). Again, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The Court of Appeals has recognized the existence of a substantial compliance argument under the MTCA. In <em>Condon, </em>332 Md. at 496, 632 A.2d 753 (quoting <em>Conaway v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 234, 246, 600 A.2d 1133 (1992)), the Court accepted our definition of substantial compliance as a \u201ccommunication that provides the State <em>1requisite and timely </em>notice of facts and circumstances giving rise to the claim.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.) \u201cThe doctrine of substantial compliance, however, is not license to ignore the clear mandate of the MTCA,\u201d <em>Chinwuba v. Larsen, </em>142 Md.App. 327, 355, 790 A.2d 83 (2002), and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">cannot serve as a springboard for judicial legislation. Provisions such as this, and the canon of construction favoring a liberal interpretation of remedial legislation, are helpful in resolving ambiguities in statutes, but do not permit us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>expand the statute to afford relief where the words of the statute bar that relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\"><em>Simpson v. Moore, </em>323 Md. 215, 227, 592 A.2d 1090 (1991). Those principles are illustrated in two cases, <em>Simpson, supra, </em>and <em>Conaway, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In <em>Simpson, </em>the case was dismissed because the claimant failed to file a written claim within 180 days after the accident. The claimant argued that the legislature intended the notice requirement in SG \u00a7 12-106(b)(l) to contain the same provision as that contained in Md.Code (1974, 1984 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-306 \u25a0 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), permitting waiver of the notice requirement, under certain circumstances, in a case filed under the Local Government Tort Claims Act. The Court of Appeals declined to incorporate that waiver provision into SG \u00a7 12-106, stating that the legislature could have done so, if it wanted, by amendment. Thus, because there was an \u201coutright failure\u201d by the claimant to file a written claim, and compliance was \u201ca condition precedent to the maintenance of a claim against the State,\u201d the doctrine of substantial compliance was not applicable. <em>Simpson, </em>323 Md. at 228-29, 592 A.2d 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In <em>Conaway, </em>a prisoner filed a timely claim with the Treasurer, but did not demand specific damages as required by SG \u00a7 12-107(a). Applying the doctrine of substantial compliance, we held that while the claim \u201cdid not literally comply with all of the requirements of [SG] \u00a7 12-107(a),\u201d it provided the State with \u201csufficient written notice of the circumstances\u201d of the accident to allow it to \u201cinvestigate the claim and respond either by settlement or defense.\u201d <em>Conaway, </em>90 Md.App. at 250, 600 A.2d 1133 (quoting <em>Adams v. United States, </em>615 F.2d 284, 289 (5th Cir.1980)). In so holding, we distinguished <em>Simpson, </em>stating that the claimant in that case had \u201cprovided no notice to the State.\u201d <em>Conaway, </em>90 Md.App. at 241, 600 A.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">As in <em>Simpson, </em>the doctrine of substantial compliance is not applicable in this case. The notice requirement contained in SG \u00a7 12-106(b)(.l) is a \u201ccondition precedent to filing suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>against the State.\u201d <em>Conaway, </em>90 Md.App. at 240, 600 A.2d 1133. The primary purpose of that requirement is to permit the State to timely investigate the incident and to respond to the claim. The legislature has set the notice period at one year. Because the Treasurer received Candeloro\u2019s written claim more than one year after the date of injury, the claim was not timely submitted. Although the claimant in <em>Simpson </em>failed to file <em>any </em>claim, we see little difference between that scenario and this case. If the purpose of the required notice is to permit a timely investigation and the legislature has determined that a timely claim is a claim submitted within one year, a claim that is not received within that time frame is untimely and, in effect, \u201can outright failure to comply.\u201d The circuit court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Candeloro argues that the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment on the malicious prosecution claim because there was no probable cause supporting the criminal charges. She contends that \u201cutilizing a traffic violation as subterfuge to enable [appellees] maliciously to bring unwarranted charges, unsupported by any probable cause, against an innocent victim is a practice neither the law nor our society can tolerate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, \u201cwe are \u2018most often concerned with whether a dispute of material fact exists.\u2019 \u201d <em>Muthukumarana v. Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 447, 473, 805 A.2d 372 (2002) (quoting <em>Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 227, 783 A.2d 206 (2001)). If there is none, then we determine if the motions court was legally correct. <em>Schmerling v. Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>368 Md. 434, 443, 795 A.2d 715 (2002). We review the legal conclusions <em>de novo. Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 473, 805 A.2d 372. When an appeal concerns the grant of summary judgment, we will consider only the grounds upon which the lower court relied in granting summary judgment. <em>PaineWebber Inc. v. Bast, </em>363 Md. 408, 422, 768 A.2d 1029, 1036 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>In the complaint, the count for malicious prosecution provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">63. [Candeloro] alleges, herein, as if fully set forth, all factual allegations of the previously numbered paragraphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">64. The false arrest and imprisonment of ... Candeloro, by ... [Trooper] Cole, resulted in the prosecution of [Candeloro] in the District Court and Circuit Court for Baltimore County as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">65. In addition thereto, [Trooper] Cole, drafted and filled out a narrative statement of probable cause as a \u201cbasis\u201d for the false charges he lodged against ... Cande-loro. The allegations that ... [Trooper] Cole made in the statement of probable cause were completely false despite the fact that they were made under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">66. [Trooper] Cole acted with malice and without probable cause in causing the charges against ... Candeloro to be lodged and in prosecution of the case. Malice was the primary purpose of [Trooper] Cole in instituting the proceedings against Candeloro.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">67. The proceedings were terminated in [Candeloro\u2019s] favor, and there was an absence of probable cause for that in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">68. As a result of [Trooper] Cole\u2019s conduct and actions, Candeloro has suffered, and will continue to suffer, severe mental anguish, loss of reputation, medical and other related expenses, and loss of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">In establishing a claim for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must prove the following four elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">1) a criminal proceeding instituted or continued by the defendant against the plaintiff; 2) without probable cause; 3) with malice, or with a motive other than to bring the offender to justice; and 4) termination of the proceeding in favor of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-12\"><em>Heron v. Strader, </em>361 Md. 258, 264, 761 A.2d 56 (2000). Concerning the fourth element, a criminal proceeding is terminated when any of the following occur: a judge discharges the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>accused at a preliminary hearing, \u201crefusal of a grand jury to indict, \u2018the formal abandonment of the proceedings by the public prosecutor,\u2019 quashing of an indictment or information, acquittal, or a final order in favor of the accused by a trial or appellate court.\u201d <em>State v. Meade, </em>101 Md.App. 512, 530, 647 A.2d 830 (1994) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 659). If the facts are undisputed about the termination of a proceeding, then a \u201ccourt has no need for a finding of the jury.\u201d <em>Palmer Ford, Inc. v. Wood, </em>298 Md. 484, 498-99, 471 A.2d 297 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The malicious prosecution claim adopted \u201call factual allegations of the previously numbered paragraphs\u201d and referred to the \u201ccharges [Trooper Cole] lodged against ... Candeloro,\u201d but did not identify the charges resulting from the incident. The charges included assault, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, wearing and carrying mace, and disobeying the lawful order of a police officer. At trial, the State <em>nolle prossed </em>all of the charges except disobeying the lawful order of a police officer, for which Candeloro was convicted. Because the outcome of the proceeding was not favorable to Candeloro, the malicious prosecution claim failed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-12\">.
