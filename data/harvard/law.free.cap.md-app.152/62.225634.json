The court sentenced appellant to three years in the Prince George\u2019s County Detention Center with all but 18 months suspended in favor of three years probation. Appellant was given 165 days\u2019 credit against the unsuspended portion of his sentence for pre-trial incarceration at the county detention center.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Appellant applied for leave to appeal to this Court, and the case was transferred to the appeal docket. Appellant argues that the trial court erred by refusing to give him credit for time spent in privately-monitored home detention prior to trial. We find merit in this argument. Therefore, we shall vacate the appellant\u2019s sentence and shall remand the case to the trial court for re-sentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Appellant\u2019s conviction stems from a traffic accident that occurred on July 4, 2000. Appellant reportedly ran a red light and struck an on-coming car. A passenger in that car, 73-year old Leola Battle, was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Appellant remained at the scene until a police officer arrived and spoke briefly with the officer. He thereafter fled the scene on foot, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Appellant was arrest\u00e9d on July 10, 2000, and was incarcerated at the Prince George\u2019s County Detention Center until September 13, 2000, when he was released pending a more complete investigation by the State. Appellant was rearrested and reincarcerated on November 6, 2000. At that time, bail was set at $25,000.00. The court subsequently reduced appellant\u2019s bail to $10,000.00 on the condition that appellant arrange for home detention with a private monitoring agency. On February 14, 2001, bail was met and appellant was released to home detention under the supervision of Monitoring Services, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Appellant remained in privately-monitored home detention through the date of his <em>Alford </em>plea on August 29, 2001, and until the date of his sentencing on October 12, 2001. He thus spent a total of 240 days in home detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The home monitoring contract was not offered into evidence at the sentence hearing. Appellant\u2019s counsel asserted, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">Appellant was confined in his home with electronic monitoring. Under the terms of his release he was unable to leave his home at any time without obtaining permission from an official obligated to report to the Court anything that he does.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Counsel indicated that appellant worked outside the home while in home detention and thus was able to support his family. The State did not dispute any of defense counsel\u2019s assertions regarding the conditions of appellant\u2019s home detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">In accordance with \u00a7 6\u2014218(b)(1) of the Criminal Procedure Article,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">A defendant who is convicted and sentenced shall receive credit against a reduction of the term of a definite or life sentence, or the minimum and maximum terms of an indeterminate sentence, for all time spent in the custody of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>correctional facility, hospital, facility for persons with mental disorders, or other unit because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">(i) the charge for which the sentence is imposed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">(ii) the conduct on which the charge is based.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Md.Code (2001, 2002 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 6\u2014218(b)(1) of the Crim. Pro. Art.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">At the sentencing hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel requested that, in addition to the 165 days for time spent in pre-trial detention at the Prince George\u2019s County Detention Center, appellant be given credit against his sentence for the 240 days he served in home detention. The trial court refused to give the additional credit, explaining that it did not believe that private \u201chome confinement for which someone else pays and someone has an economic relationship with the person who monitors them is the same as our jail and our county correctional center.\u201d The court added that, unlike when a suspect is placed in home detention under the supervision of the county detention center, appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">could not have been prosecuted for escape. What would have happened is ... Monitoring Services, Inc. would have written a letter to [the court] saying he is no longer in compliance. [The court] would have issued a bench warrant, revoked the bond and he would have been brought back. He could not have been charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Appellant now contends that the trial court erred in concluding, in effect, that although a person in home detention that is monitored by the county is \u201cin custody\u201d and can thus receive credit for time served, a person in home detention that is monitored by a private agency is not. Appellant asserts that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s understanding, a person can indeed be prosecuted for escaping from home detention that is privately monitored.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The State responds that \u201cwhether one can be charged with escape lies at the heart of any determination about the award for credit for time served.\u201d The State \u201cacknowledges that Maryland\u2019s statutory escape provisions do not expressly distinguish between home detention that is monitored by a private entity and home detention monitored by a government entity.\u201d It suggests, however, that the parties agreed below that appellant could not have been prosecuted for escape. The State adds that appellant failed to offer into evidence his home detention agreement with Home Monitoring Services, Inc. From this, the State concludes that even if an escape charge could lie when home detention is monitored by a private agency, there was insufficient evidence to support a determination that appellant could have been charged with escape in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Preliminarily, appellant did <em>not </em>concede below that he could not be prosecuted for escape. Defense counsel specifically argued that appellant <em>could </em>have been charged with escape had he left his home without permission. When the trial court expressed disagreement, defense counsel merely presented the following alternative argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">[B]e it ... home detention ... through the court or through private home detention, it\u2019s still considered to be time you\u2019re serving. Whether you can be charged with escape or not escape, I don\u2019t think escape is the criteria. I think it\u2019s home confinement is the criteria.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Moreover, while appellant did not offer into evidence his home detention agreement, the terms of the agreement were not in dispute. As we have indicated, counsel proffered that appellant\u2019s activities were electronically monitored, that he was confined to his home unless he had specific permission to leave, that he was granted permission to leave his home in order to work, and that his activities were reported by the monitoring agency to the court. That proffer was not called into question by the State or the court. <em>Compare Dedo v. State, </em>343 Md. 2, 12-13, 680 A.2d 464, 469-70 (1996) (where the Court of Appeals found that \u201cthe restraints placed upon [the defendant] while in [pre-trial] home detention clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>were sufficiently incarcerative to satisfy f lie custody requirement of r\u00a7 6\u2014218(b)(1) of the Criminal Procedure Article],\u201d where the evidence showed, <em>inter alia, </em>that (i) the defendant\u2019s \u201cmovements and activities were electronically monitored through telecommunications video surveillance equipment,\u201d (ii) the defendant was \u201cactually committed to the custody of the Warden\u201d of the Wicomico County Detention Center, (iii) \u201cany violation of the home detention would have resulted in [the defendant\u2019s] immediate imprisonment,\u201d and (iv) the defendant could have been prosecuted for escape for \u201cany unexcused or unexplained absence from his home during curfew hours\u201d); <em>Toney v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 690, 695, 782 A.2d 383, 387 (2001) (where this Court determined that a defendant was entitled to credit against his sentence for time served in pre-trial home detention during which he was monitored by a unit of the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Corrections, and pointed out that although the defendant was not committed to the custody of the warden of the local detention center, (i) the defendant was \u201cconfined to his home with electronic monitoring,\u201d (ii) the defendant was \u201cunable to leave his home at any time without obtaining permission of an official obligated to report to the court,\u201d and (iii) if the defendant \u201cviolated his home detention without permission, he could have been prosecuted for escape\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The Court of Appeals has explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">[a] defendant is not in custody for purposes of [\u00a7 6-218 of the Criminal Procedure Article, formerly \u00a7 638C of Article 27] if the conditions of the defendant\u2019s confinement do not impose substantial restrictions on the defendant\u2019s freedom of association, activity and movement <em>such tha,t unauthorized absence from the place of confinement would be chargeable as the criminal offense of escape </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\"><em>Dedo, </em>343 Md. at 11, 680 A.2d at 469 (emphasis added). We are satisfied that, had appellant left his home without permission during the period of home confinement, he could have been prosecuted for escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Section 5-201 (b) of the Criminal Procedure Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">In accordance with eligibility criteria, conditions, and procedures required under the Maryland Rules, the court may require, as a condition of a defendant\u2019s pretrial release, that the defendant be monitored by a private home detention monitoring agency licensed under Title 20 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Code (2001), \u00a7 5-201(b) of the Crim. Pro. Art.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel asserted at the sentencing hearing that Home Monitoring Services, Inc. was \u201clicensed by the State of Maryland,\u201d and that the State has never disputed this assertion. Under \u00a7 20-101(e) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, a \u201c[IJicensed private home detention monitoring agency\u201d is licensed by the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services \u201cto conduct a business that provides monitoring services for a fee to individuals who are- under a court order that requires monitoring by a private-home detention monitoring agency.\u201d Code (1989, 2000 Repl.Vol.),' \u00a7 20-101(e) of the Bus. Occ. <em>&amp; </em>Prof. Art.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">A person is guilty of escape in the first degree if he or she \u201cknowingly escape[s] from a place of confinement.\u201d Code (2002), \u00a7 9-404(a) of the Crim. Law Art.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 9-401(f)(2) of the Criminal Law Article, \u201c[pjlace of confinement\u201d means, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca place identified in a home detention order or agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, \u00a7 9-404(c)(l)(ii) specifically provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u201cThis subsection applies to a person who is ... committed to home detention under the terms of pretrial release.... \u201d Section 9\u2014404(c)(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">A person may not knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">(i) violate any restriction on movement imposed under the terms of a ... home detention order or agreement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">(ii) fail to return to a place of confinement under the terms of ... a home detention order or agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The statutory scheme could not be more clear. A court may order home detention, monitored by a licensed private home detention monitoring agency, as a condition of pre-trial release. A place identified in such an order is a place of confinement, and a defendant who violates a restriction on movement or fails to return under a home detention order or agreement may be found guilty of first degree escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The trial court erred in refusing to give appellant credit against his sentence for the 240 days he served in home detention prior to trial. We therefore vacate appellant\u2019s sentence and remand the case to the trial court for re-sentencing. The 240 days should be applied to the unsuspended portion of appellant\u2019s sentence; application of the credits to the suspended portion would appear to amount to an unjustified increase of the original sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-702(b) of the Cts. &amp; Jud.
