In this episode, the Maryland Parole Commission revoked appellee Andre Staton\u2019s mandatory supervision because he committed a violent crime, and Staton returned to prison to serve the remainder of his original sentences, along with a sentence for the new crime. The question we must answer is: what effect did revocation have on the good conduct credits that Staton accrued before he was released on mandatory supervision?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We know what the answer would be if Staton\u2019s mandatory supervision had been revoked after June 1, 2002, because the legislature recently enacted new provisions in the mandatory supervision subtitle of the Correctional Services Article (\u201cCS\u201d). As of June 1, 2002, such inmates may not use these \u201cpast\u201d good conduct credits <em>(i.e., </em>credits that they accrued before being released on mandatory supervision) to reduce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>sentence they were serving on mandatory supervision. <em>See </em>CS \u00a7 7-502(c); \u00a7 7-504(c); 2002 Md. Laws, chs. 485, 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">But the answer is not so clear in Staton\u2019s case, because his mandatory supervision was revoked in 1996. We shall hold that the statutory scheme in effect when Staton\u2019s mandatory supervision was revoked created ambiguities that must be resolved in Staton\u2019s favor under the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">While serving sentences imposed in 1993 for non-violent crimes that accrued good conduct credits at the rate of ten per month, Staton earned 333 good conduct credits. The Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d) credited Staton -with those and other diminution credits. Staton was released on mandatory supervision on April 22, 1995.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His maximum expiration date for these sentences at the time of his release was August 16, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">While on mandatory supervision, Staton committed a violent crime\u2014assault with intent to disable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 29, 1996, Staton was sentenced to ten years for that new crime, with all but live years suspended. The new sentence was to be served concurrently with Staton\u2019s outstanding and unserved sentences, beginning on January 15, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">As a result of Staton\u2019s new conviction, the Maryland Parole Commission revoked his mandatory supervision on June 11, 1996, and ordered Staton to serve the remainder of his original sentences. The parole commissioner allowed Staton 180 days of street time credit for the period he was on mandatory supervision and announced that he would \u201ctake 100\u201d of Staton\u2019s past good conduct credits that he had accrued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>on the original sentences. The Parole Commission\u2019s order did not indicate the number of good conduct credits from which the 100 credits would be subtracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">On June 19, 1996, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City found that Staton had violated his probation in the cases for which he was originally sentenced. The court executed the previously suspended portion of those sentences, ordering Staton to serve four years and eight months, \u201cconsecutive to the last sentence to expire of all outstanding and unserved Maryland sentences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The DOC recalculated Staton\u2019s maximum expiration date as November 4, 2005. From that date, the DOC applied Staton\u2019s good conduct credits, including his past credits. The DOC, however, recalculated and reduced Staton\u2019s past credits because his new term of confinement included a crime of violence. It halved the credits that. Staton had accrued on the T993 sentences, then subtracted the 100 days that the parole commissioner revoked. This reduction extended Staton\u2019s incarceration by six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Staton challenged the DOC\u2019s rationale for recalculating his credits as precisely the type of \u201cblind aggregation\u201d of sentences that the Court of Appeals has disapproved in a series of decisions. He filed a petition for <em>habeas corpus </em>against Warden J. Michael Stouffer, appellant, alleging that the reduction of his past good conduct credits violated his federal and Maryland constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted Staton\u2019s petition, and ordered Staton\u2019s immediate release from incarceration. Staton was released on the same day the order was entered. When the briefs in this appeal were filed, he remained conditionally free under the supervision of the Division of Parole and Probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Through Warden Stouffer,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the DOC asks us to reverse the <em>habeas </em>court. Renewing its single term of confinement ratio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>nale, the DOC argues that the court erred in holding that Staton was entitled to past good conduct credits that he accrued at the higher rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">To resolve this appeal, we must examine the interplay between two subtitles in the Correctional Services Article\u2014 section 3-700 <em>et seq., </em>governing diminution credits, and section 7-500 <em>et seq., </em>governing mandatory supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Under the diminution credits subtitle, each inmate \u201cis entitled to a diminution of the inmate\u2019s term of confinement as provided under [the diminution credits] subtitle,\u201d subject, however, \u201cto \u00a7 3-711 ... and Title 7, Subtitle 5\u201d of the Coirectional Services Article. CS \u00a7 3-702. Once an inmate has accumulated enough good conduct and other diminution credits to earn entitlement to release, \u201cthe inmate is deemed released under \u2018mandatory supervision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 128, 647 A.2d 106 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Section 3-711 in the diminution credits subtitle specifically addresses what happens to an inmate\u2019s past good conduct credits when he or she commits a new crime while on parole:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5P\">If an inmate is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a crime committed while on parole and the parole is revoked, diminution credits that were awarded before the inmate\u2019s release on parole may not be applied toward the inmate\u2019s term of confinement on return to the [DOC].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">In contrast, the mandatory supervision provisions now codified in Title 7, Subtitle 5 did not explicitly address the topic of past credits until very recently. Inmates sentenced to serve more than 12 months are \u201cgrant[ed] a conditional release from confinement\u201d once they have \u201cserved the term or terms, less diminution credit[s][.]\u201d CS \u00a7 7-501. When released on mandatory supervision, they \u201cremain[ ] in legal custody\u201d until their \u201cfull term\u201d expires. CS \u00a7 7-502(a). In addition, they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u201csubject to ... all laws, rules, regulations, and conditions that apply to parolees[.]\u201d CS \u00a7 7-502(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The good conduct diminution credits with which we are concerned in this case accrue as a matter of law, rather than at the discretion of correctional authorities. <em>See </em>CS \u00a7 3-702, \u00a7 3-704. Good conduct credits are a behavioral incentive and a means of reducing prison overcrowding. <em>See Md. House of Corr. v. Fields, </em>348 Md. 245, 264, 703 A.2d 167 (1997); <em>Frost, </em>336 Md. at 139, 647 A.2d 106. For those reasons, good conduct credits are applied as \u201ca deduction in advance from the inmate\u2019s term of confinement.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> CS \u00a7 3-704(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">From 1989 until 1999, revocation of mandatory supervision was governed by former Article 41 section 4-612 of the Maryland Code. In 1996, subsection (e) provided that \u201c[t]he Parole Commissioner presiding may rescind all diminution credits previously earned on the sentence or any portion thereof in the revocation proceedings.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1996 Cum.Supp.), Art. 41 \u00a7 4-612(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>During that same time period, in 1991, the General Assembly adopted the \u201cterm of confinement\u201d concept as part of the diminution credits provisions, which at that time were in Article 27 section 700 of the Code. <em>See </em>1991 Md. Laws, ch. 354. <em>See, e.g., Sec\u2019y of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Hutchinson, </em>359 Md. 320, 329, 753 A.2d 1024 (2000) (reviewing legislative history of provisions relating to revocation of credits in conjunction with revocation of mandatory supervision); <em>Frost, </em>336 Md. at 141-42, 647 A.2d 106 (same). An inmate\u2019s term of confinement is \u201cthe period from the first day of the sentence that begins first through the last day of the sentence that ends last[.]\u201d CS \u00a7 3-701(2). The reason for the change from calculating diminution credits against a sentence to calculating them against a term of confinement was \u201c \u2018to ensure that inmates serving more than one sentence at a time [would] not receive good-conduct credits for more than one sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fields, </em>348 Md. at 264-65, 703 A.2d 167. The next year, in 1992, the legislature created the rate differential for good conduct credits by amending Article 27. <em>See Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Henderson, </em>351 Md. 438, 451-52, 442, 718 A.2d 1150 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">But no related changes were made to the language of Article 41 section 4-612(e) until 1999, when the new Correctional Services Article was enacted, and section 4-612(e) was recodified as CS section 7-504(a). <em>See </em>1999 Md. Laws, ch. 54, \u00a7 1 (effective Oct. 1, 1999). The new mandatory supervision subtitle used the \u201cterm of confinement\u201d concept for the first time, providing that \u201c[t]he commissioner presiding at an individual\u2019s mandatory supervision revocation hearing may revoke any or all of the diminution credits previously earned by the individual on the individual\u2019s term of confinement.\u201d <em>See </em>former Md.Code (1999), \u00a7 79-504(a) of the Correctional Services Article. The Revisor\u2019s Note stated that \u201c[t]his section is new language derived without substantive change from former Art. 41, \u00a7 4-612(e)[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In 2002, the General Assembly substantively amended both section 7-504 and section 7-502 to extend the same prohibition against the use of past credits after revocation of parole under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>section 3-711 to revocation of mandatory supervision. <em>See </em>2002 Md. Laws, chs. 485, 486. We set forth current sections 7-502 and 7-504, with the provisions added by the 2002 amendment in boldface type:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\u00a7 7-502. Legal custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014An individual on mandatory supervision remains in legal custody until the expiration of the individual\u2019s full term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">(b) <em>Applicability of laws, rules, regulations, and conditions relating to </em>parolees.\u2014Am individual on mandatory supervision is subject to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">(1) all laws, rules, regulations, and conditions that apply to parolees ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">(c) <em>Application for diminution </em>credits.\u2014If an inmate is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a violent crime committed while on mandatory supervision and the mandatory supervision is revoked, diminution credits that were awarded before the inmate\u2019s release on mandatory supervision may not be applied toward the inmate\u2019s term of confinement on return to the Division. \u00a7 7-504.

But these new additions to sections 7-502 and 7-504 were not a part of the statutory scheme in 1996, when the Parole Commission revoked Staton\u2019s mandatory supervision. And the DOC tacitly concedes that, under those prior provisions, Staton is entitled to at least half of the good conduct credits that he accrued before being released on mandatory supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In the absence of explicit language authorizing the DOC to recalculate and reduce Staton\u2019s past credits, the DOC relies on a strict application of the concept and definition of \u201cterm of confinement[.]\u201d The DOC used the following formula to halve Staton\u2019s past credits, on the theory that, under section 3-704, once Staton\u2019s term of confinement included a violent crime sentence, his original sentences were no longer eligible for the higher ten credit per month rate:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">333 GCC (credits Staton accrued before MSR)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">4- 2 (divided by two, to adjust rate from 10 GCC/mo. to 5 GCC/mo.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">= 167 (equals remaining credits)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">- 100 (minus credits revoked by MPC)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">= 67 (equals surviving credits)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">Staton believes that revocation had no effect on the past good conduct credits he accrued before mandatory release. His formula for calculating his surviving credits is therefore simple:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">333 GCC (credits Staton accrued before MSR)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">- 100 GCC (minus credits revoked by MPC)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-17\">= 233 GCC (equals surviving credits)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-18\">In Staton\u2019s view, the <em>habeas </em>court correctly determined that he was entitled to these credits because (1) the DOC had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>authority to alter the results of the Parole Commission\u2019s decision regarding how many of his past credits to revoke, (2) the DOC cannot aggregate the original sentences with the new sentence due to the break in DOC custody while Staton was released on mandatory supervision, (3) the DOC\u2019s new administrative interpretation of these statutory provisions violates the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the Constitution, and (4) the DOC\u2019s interpretation of the diminution credits and mandatory supervision subtitles violates the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We found no reported decision addressing the past credits issue presented here\u2014the effect of revoking mandatory supervision on credits that an inmate accrued before release under the statutory scheme that was in effect in 1996. But the Court of Appeals has considered the \u201csingle term of confinement\u201d concept in several diminution credits disputes, and its resolution of those conflicts is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In <em>Md. House of Corr. v. Fields, </em>348 Md. 245, 703 A.2d 167 (1997), the Court resolved complaints by inmates whose terms of confinement included sentences imposed both before and after the legislature raised the monthly rate for good conduct credits from five to ten for certain crimes. The Court concluded that \u201cit would be impossible to say that a single \u2018term of confinement\u2019 was imposed either before or after [the date of the rate change] because, in fact, \u2018the term of confinement was imposed both before <em>and </em>after that date.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henderson, </em>351 Md. at 444, 718 A.2d 1150 (quoting <em>Fields, </em>348 Md. at 266, 703 A.2d 167). As a result of the ambiguity in how to treat the inmates\u2019 terms of confinement, the Court \u201cinvoke[d] the rule of lenity, requiring that the ambiguity be construed \u2018against the state and in favor of the [inmate].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Fields, </em>348 Md. at 267, 703 A.2d 167).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In <em>Beshears v. Wickes, </em>349 Md. 1, 706 A.2d 608 (1998), the Parole Commission revoked mandatory supervision after Wickes committed a new crime. Wickes complained that the DOC refused to recognize good conduct credits that he accrued at the higher rate because his term of confinement included a sentence that was not eligible for that higher rate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>As in <em>Fields, </em>the Court of Appeals relied on the rule of lenity in rejecting the DOC\u2019s single term of confinement rationale for using the lower rate. <em>See Henderson, </em>351 Md. at 451-52, 718 A.2d 1150.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court emphasized the ambiguity arising from the statutory provisions creating a single term of confinement and those creating the differentiated rate for good conduct credits. \u201c[T]o the extent that the device of a single term of confinement would frustrate [the General Assembly\u2019s] direction\u201d that inmates accrue ten days per month for nonviolent, non-drug sentences imposed on or after October 1, 1992, \u201can ambiguity was created\u2014an ambiguity that the rule of lenity required be resolved in favor of the inmate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In <em>Henderson, </em>the Court rejected the converse formula for calculating good conduct credits\u2014that <em>all </em>sentences must be treated separately for purposes of accruing such credits. <em>See id. </em>at 452, 718 A.2d 1150. The DOC had interpreted the <em>Fields </em>and <em>Wiekes </em>decisions as a mandate to calculate good conduct credits separately against each sentence. In Henderson\u2019s case, the DOC\u2019s recalculation resulted in the DOC reincarcerating him after he had been released on mandatory supervision. The Court of Appeals held that the DOC should not have done so, because aggregation of Henderson\u2019s sentences, both of which accrued good conduct credits at the lower rate, was consistent with the legislative mandate. <em>See id. </em>at 452-53, 718 A.2d 1150. Thus, \u201cHenderson\u2019s reincarceration was unlawful because it was not authorized by statute, and he was entitled to be released for that reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452, 718 A.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In reaching that conclusion, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed the appellate mantra that governs every decision regarding whether the single term of confinement concept requires aggregation of sentences for purposes of calculating diminution credits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>[A]ll sentences that overlap or run consecutively do not need to aggregate <em>\u201cfor all purposes </em>to a single term of confinement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><em>Henderson, </em>351 Md. at 452, 718 A.2d 1150 (quoting <em>Fields </em>Xitalics in <em>Henderson; </em>bold added).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In <em>Sec\u2019y of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Hutchinson, </em>359 Md. 320, 753 A.2d 1024 (2000), the Court of Appeals resolved another single term of confinement argument in a case involving mandatory supervision. Hutchinson committed a drug offense while he was released on mandatory supervision. In 1996, the Parole Commission revoked his mandatory supervision and all of his past good conduct credits. Hutchinson was returned to the DOC to serve the remainder of the sentence for which he had been released on mandatory supervision, as well as a new sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 323, 753 A.2d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">At that time, section 4\u2014612(f) stated simply that inmates on mandatory supervision \u201cmay not earn any new diminution credits once the mandatory supervision has been revoked.\u201d <em>See </em>former Md.Code (1957, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1996 Cum.Supp.), Art. 41 \u00a7 4-612(f); <em>Hutchinson, </em>359 Md. at 322, 753 A.2d 1024. All agreed that this provision, and its successor at current CS \u00a7 7-504(c), \u201cpreclude[d] the award of any future diminution credits against the sentence(s) the inmate was serving when placed on mandatory supervision.\u201d <em>Hutchinson, </em>359 Md. at 327, 753 A.2d 1024. \u201cThe question [was] whether it also preclude[d] the award of [future] credits against any new sentence imposed\u201d before the inmate completed the remainder of his original sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Hutchinson complained that the DOC was not crediting him with any new good conduct credits on his new sentence until he served his original sentence in full, thereby preventing him from accruing all of the credits to which he was entitled. <em>See id. </em>He \u201curge[d] that credits may be awarded against the new sentence from the time of its imposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying the statutory definition of \u201cterm of confinement\u201d to current section 7-504(c), Hutchinson argued that his sentences were aggregated into a single term of confinement and he therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>should be permitted to apply credits that were accruing against the new sentence to his term of confinement, \u201cwhich would have the effect of applying them to the \u2018old\u2019 sentence as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 753 A.2d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">This time the DOC opposed aggregating Hutchinson\u2019s sentences into a single term of confinement for the purpose of calculating credits. It argued that Hutchinson\u2019s strict application of the term of confinement concept to current section 7-504(c) \u201cwould lead to the absurd result of an inmate who .commits a new crime and receives a new sentence while on mandatory supervision serving less time upon revocation of the mandatory supervision than an inmate who does not commit a new crime and receives no new sentence but whose mandatory supervision is revoked for other reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The DOC posited that \u201cdiminition credits <em>may </em>be awarded against a new sentence, but not until the \u2018old\u2019 sentence has been fully served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 753 A.2d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The Court of Appeals rejected both approaches, in favor of an interpretation that was consistent with what it viewed as the legislature\u2019s \u201cabundantly clear\u201d intent to prevent inmates from accruing any new diminution credits against the sentences they were serving when placed on mandatory supervision. <em>See id. </em>at 328-31, 753 A.2d 1024. The Court found a \u201ccommon sense way\u201d to read section 7-504(c) to carry out \u201cthe legislative intent without presenting the anomaly posited by the [DOC].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Writing for the Court, Judge Wilner began by \u201cnoting the obvious\u201d lack of any solution in the language of the Correctional Services Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">Neither \u00a7 7-504[e] nor any other statute that can be read in context with it clearly states, one way or the other, whether the prohibition applies to new sentences after an inmate is released on mandatory supervision. The statute itself is silent in that regard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 328, 753 A.2d 1024. Legislative history was similarly unenlightening. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The Court turned instead to the contextual history of section 7-504 for clues to whether the legislature intended the interplay that Hutchinson envisioned between the term of confinement, diminution credit, and mandatory supervision provisions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">If there is an inference to be drawn, it would arise from reading former \u00a7\u00a7 4-612(e) and (f)\u2014current \u00a7 7-504[b] and [c] ... together, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of their enactment. Section 4-612(e)\u2014current \u00a7 7-504[b}\u2014permits the Parole Commission, upon revocation of mandatory supervision, to rescind all diminution credits previously earned, which can apply only to the sentence(s) being served when the inmate was placed on mandatory supervision. Section 4\u2014612(f)\u2014current \u00a7 7-504[c]\u2014can then be read as complementing that provision by making clear that no new credits may be applied against <em>that sentence. </em>It is not always the case that there will be a new sentence, and it is reasonable to infer that the Legislature\u2019s focus was only on the sentence still being served by the inmate while on mandatory supervision. The penalty for violating a condition of mandatory supervision was service in full of the existing sentence. That approach is fully consistent with the fact that, when the provision was first enacted in 1989, the law did not aggregate multiple sentences into a single term of confinement but regarded them as separate and independent. The aggregation of multiple sentences into a single term of confinement was not authorized until 1991. If the Legislature, in 1989, had intended that the prohibition against future diminution credits apply to any sentence other than the one the inmate was serving when placed on mandatory supervision, it likely would have said so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 328-29, 753 A.2d 1024 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The Court then observed that this statutory interpretation was one that had been tentatively proposed by those charged with recodifying the correctional services laws. Uncertainty as to whether that interpretation was consistent with legislative intent, however, had prompted the Correctional Services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Article Review Committee to recommend that the General Assembly amend the statute \u201c \u2018to state expressly that an inmate may not be awarded any diminution credits on the sentence or sentences for which the individual was awarded diminution credits prior to release on mandatory supervision.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>at 329-30, 753 A.2d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">As the <em>Hutchinson </em>Court noted, \u201c[unfortunately, the General Assembly chose not to address the matter, perhaps in the belief that the interpretation suggested by the Correctional Services Article Review Committee was correct and that no clarification was necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 753 A.2d 1024. The Court emphasized that \u201c[clarification <em>is </em>necessary, however, and it falls to us to provide it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The lesson that the Court of Appeals drew from <em>Fields, Wickes, </em>and <em>Henderson </em>was that \u201c[a] result that appears quite reasonable in one circumstance may appear to be unreasonable in another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For that reason, \u201c[t]he issue, ultimately, is one of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The <em>Hutchinson </em>Court found that there was a clear legislative intent with respect to accruing new good conduct credits against a releasee\u2019s original sentence. \u201cOne thing that seems abundantly clear is that the General Assembly did not intend for there to be any future diminution credits applied against the sentence(s) the inmate was serving when placed on mandatory supervision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The clear legislative intent regarding future credits allowed the Court to interpret the statute in a way that fairly implemented the General Assembly\u2019s policy mandate. <em>See id. </em>at 331, 753 A.2d 1024. The Court rejected Hutchinson\u2019s single term of confinement rationale because it would permit him to apply future diminution credits accruing on his new sentence to reduce the remainder of his original sentence that he had been returned to serve in confinement\u2014a result that was inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>See id. </em>at 330, 753 A.2d 1024. The Court again acknowledged that it was \u201csubor-dinat[ing] the general direction to aggregate multiple sentences into a single term of confinement [because] to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>otherwise\u201d would have conferred a benefit that the General Assembly prohibited. <em>See id. </em>It held that, \u201c[f]or purposes of applying \u00a7 7-504[c], the existing sentence(s), on the one hand, and any new sentences(s), on the other, must be considered separately.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330-31, 753 A.2d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The consequence of treating the two sentences separately required the Court also to reject the DOC\u2019s contention that section 7-504(e) prevented Hutchinson from accruing any good conduct credits against his new sentence until he had completed his old sentence. That \u201cposition also fails to carry out the legislative intent, for it would deny prisoners the full benefit of the laws ... allowing diminution credits against the new sentence(s).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The Court\u2019s \u201cmiddle ground\u201d solution permitted Hutchinson to accrue and apply credits against the eligible portion of his term of confinement, without using them to reduce the ineligible portion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">Prisoners who receive a new sentence(s) for conduct committed while on mandatory supervision should receive, and must be given, good conduct credits on that sentence(s) as though there were no existing sentence(s).... The prisoner gets no benefit from them with respect to the existing sentence, which he or she must serve in full, subject only to whatever preexisting credits are appropriately allowed against that sentence(s).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>8</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Staton cites <em>Hutchinson, </em>as well <em>as Fields, Wickes, </em>and <em>Henderson, </em>in support of the proposition that the DOC must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>treat his sentences separately for purposes of calculating his good conduct credits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not think that any of these cases mandates that result. To the contrary, as the <em>Hutchinson </em>Court emphasized, a \u201cone rule fits all\u201d solution regarding sentence aggregation is neither wise nor possible given the myriad permutations and unique consequences presented by each case. <em>See id. </em>at 330, 753 A.2d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Here, the question and circumstances we address materially differ from <em>Hutchinson. </em>There, the Court of Appeals re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>solved how to treat future diminution credits against a new sentence that undisputedly accrued good conduct credits at the lower rate of five per month. Here, we must resolve how to treat past diminution credits against the original sentences, which arguably accrued good conduct credits at the higher rate of ten per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Thus, <em>Hutchinson </em>does not dictate that Staton\u2019s sentences be considered separately for purposes of calculating his good conduct credits. What <em>Hutchinson </em>does require, however, is that (1) the mandatory supervision and diminution credits provisions be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with legislative language and intent, and (2) the single term of confinement concept may not be used to thwart that legislative intent. We proceed to analyze the DOC\u2019s statutory interpretation in light of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">As in <em>Hutchinson, </em>the statutory language here yields no definitive answer. At the time Staton\u2019s mandatory supervision was revoked, the diminution credits and mandatory supervision provisions were silent regarding how to treat releasees\u2019 past good conduct credits in these circumstances. By its terms, section 4\u2014612(f), and its successor section 7-504(c), address only \u201cnew diminution credits after the inmate\u2019s mandatory supervision has been revoked.\u201d Section 4-612(e), and its successor section 7\u2014504(b), state that the commissioner presiding at an individual\u2019s mandatory supervision revocation hearing may revoke any or all of the diminution credits previously earned on the original sentence, but do not specify whether past credits also may be reduced \u201cautomatically\u201d by the DOC as a secondary but unstated consequence of the parole commissioner\u2019s decision to revoke mandatory supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\"><em>Hutchinson </em>teaches that, despite this silence, we must examine these statutory provisions in historical context to determine whether there is otherwise a clear legislative intent on the question before us. The <em>Hutchinson </em>Court was able to discern from the provenance of section 7-504(c) that the legislature intended to prohibit new diminution credits against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>the original sentence after revocation of mandatory supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">What distinguishes this case from <em>Hutchinson </em>is that, unlike the legislature\u2019s policy regarding future credits in these circumstances, its policy regarding past credits is not \u201cabundantly clear[.]\u201d <em>See Hutchinson, </em>359 Md. at 330, 753 A.2d 1024. For the reasons set forth below, we cannot discern a clear legislative intent to use the term of confinement concept in the diminution credits subtitle as a means of restricting the revocation provisions in the mandatory supervision subtitle.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Preliminarily, we note that we cannot divine a legislative position on this \u201cautomatic reduction\u201d question from past or present provisions. In every instance that the legislature has specified a consequence for committing a crime while on parole or mandatory supervision, it explicitly has prohibited the use of any and all diminution credits. Section 3-711 prevents inmates whose parole is revoked because they committed crimes while on parole from using any past credits. Current section 7-504(c) and former section 4\u2014612(f) prohibit inmates whose mandatory supervision has been revoked from accruing any new diminution credits. Recently enacted sections 7-502(c) and 7-504(b) also prohibit these inmates from using any past credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Undaunted by the lack of explicit statutory language or precedent, the DOC believes that the legislature implicitly intended to penalize any \u201cinmate who, like Staton, has received a sentence for a crime of violence after October 1, 1992,\u201d by explicitly requiring in CS section 3-704(b)(2) \u201cthat an inmate whose term of confinement \u2018includes a consecutive or concurrent sentence for a crime of violence\u2019 shall be awarded good conduct credits at the rate of five days per month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">There is logic in the DOC\u2019s interpretation of the diminution credits subtitle. The General Assembly created the good conduct credit rate differential in 1992, only one year after it adopted and defined the \u201cterm of confinement\u201d concept. <em>See Henderson, </em>351 Md. at 441, 718 A.2d 1150. When it did so, the General Assembly understood that sentences aggregated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>as a result of the term of confinement concept would cause some inmates to accrue credits at the lower rate even though they would have accrued credits at the higher rate on a particular sentence within their terms of confinement. Indeed, section 3-704(b)(2) mandates a rate reduction in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The legislature also contemplated that an inmate\u2019s misbehavior could prevent him from using good conduct credits. It authorized the DOC to revoke \u201ca portion or all\u201d of an inmate\u2019s good conduct credits for disciplinary violations. <em>See </em>CS \u00a7 3-709(a). It also prohibited parolees from using past credits once they have been convicted and sentenced for a crime committed while on parole and parole was revoked. <em>See </em>CS \u00a7 3-711. Because \u201can individual on mandatory supervision is subject to ... all laws ... that apply to parolees[,]\u201d <em>see </em>CS \u00a7 7-502(b)(l), it is not unreasonable to conclude from these statutory provisions that the legislature intended the forfeiture provision in section 3-711 to apply also to releasees who commit crimes while on mandatory supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Nevertheless, there also is logic in Staton\u2019s conflicting interpretation of the mandatory supervision subtitle. In his view, section 4-612(e) and current section 7-504(b) prohibit the DOC from recalculating his credits because the automatic reduction that the DOC took as a result of the parole commissioner\u2019s decision to revoke Staton\u2019s mandatory supervision thwarts the statutory scheme in which the parole commissioner has discretionary power to \u201crevoke any or all of the diminution credits previously eamed[.]\u201d Staton reads sections 4-612(e) and 7-504(b) as evidence that the legislature intended that decisions regarding releasees\u2019 past diminution credits would be made by independent parole commissioners who have discretionary authority to revoke none, some, or all past credits on a case by case basis, but only after a formal hearing on the record, at which inmates have been afforded substantive and procedural rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>CS \u00a7 7-504(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>We agree with Staton that sections 4-612(e) and 7-504(b) clearly reflect such an intent. But we see nothing explicitly stating that the General Assembly intended this to be the only way a releasee\u2019s past credits can be reduced as a result of revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">That inference might be drawn, however, from other statutory provisions concerning the relationship between diminution credits and mandatory supervision. In section 3-702, the General Assembly explicitly directs that an inmate\u2019s entitlement to diminution credits is \u201c[sjubject to ... Title 7, Subtitle 5\u201d governing mandatory supervision. Section 7\u2014502(b)(1) also affords inmates facing revocation of mandatory supervision the same due process rights that parolees have, including rights under section 7-401 to an on-the-record hearing and decision, which are subject to judicial review. <em>See, e.g., </em>CO-MAR 12.08.01.22 (regulations governing proceedings to revoke either parole or mandatory supervision). These provisions, and the lack of any explicit language restricting the number of past credits that the parole commissioner may revoke, suggest that, to the extent that the term of confinement concept conflicts with the grant of authority and procedural due process rights conferred in the mandatory supervision provisions, the General Assembly intended to \u201csubordinate [its] general direction to aggregate multiple sentences into a single term of confinement,\u201d to ensure that inmates receive the benefit of an individualized decision regarding revocation of past credits. <em>Cf. Hutchinson, </em>359 Md. at 330, 753 A.2d 1024 (concluding that subordinating term of confinement concept to provisions of current section 7-504(c) was necessary to enforce legislative intent); <em>Frost, </em>336 Md. at 142-43, 647 A.2d 106 (legislature\u2019s provision that accrual of diminution credits provision is \u201csubservient\u201d to mandatory release provision made it \u201cunreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>able to conclude\u201d that DOC could limit Parole Commission\u2019s authority to revoke \u201call\u201d credits in revocation hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Staton\u2019s fourth and \u201cfallback\u201d reason for affirming the <em>habeas </em>court is that the rule of lenity requires us to resolve any statutory ambiguities in his favor. That is the winning argument here. We conclude that the statutory scheme as it existed when Staton\u2019s mandatory supervision was revoked created an ambiguity that we cannot resolve by the same \u201clegislative intent\u201d yardstick that the <em>Hutchinson </em>Court used to resolve the section 7-504(c) ambiguity regarding future credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Nothing in the language or contextual history of the diminution credits and mandatory supervision provisions explicitly permits or prohibits strict adherence to the term of confinement concept in these circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">\u2022 On the one hand, the mandatory supervision subtitle makes inmates on mandatory release subject to \u201call laws ... that apply to parolees,\u201d including presumably provisions that inmates who are convicted of committing a crime while on parole may not use any of their past diminution credits. <em>See </em>CS \u00a7 3-711; \u00a7 7-502(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">\u2022 On the other hand, mandatory supervision provisions also afford inmates facing revocation of mandatory supervision the procedural rights that parolees enjoy, including the right to have a parole commissioner determine how many, if any, past credits to revoke after an on-the-record hearing at which the inmate has the right to counsel, to call witnesses, and to judicial review. The diminution credits provision establishing an inmate\u2019s entitlement to diminution credits is \u201c[s]ubject to\u201d the provisions of the mandatory supervision subtitle, including presumably these provisions governing revocation proceedings at which a parole commissioner has discretionary authority to revoke what- ' ever number of past credits he or she finds appropriate. <em>See </em>CS \u00a7 3-702; \u00a7 7-401; \u00a7 7-502(b); \u00a7 7-504(b); CO-MAR 12.08.01.22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>We simply do not know which of these two alternatives the General Assembly intended in Staton\u2019s situation. Both statutory interpretations are possible and plausible. Under the rule of lenity, which \u201cforbids the extension of punishment \u2018to cases not plainly within the language\u2019 of the statute,\u201d the uncertainty created by this statutory ambiguity must be resolved in Staton\u2019s favor. <em>See Henderson, </em>351 Md. at 448, 451-52, 718 A.2d 1150. Following the lessons of <em>Fields, Wickes, </em>and <em>Henderson, </em>all we need say is that, to the extent that the device of a single term of confinement would thwart revocation rights that the General Assembly conferred in the mandatory supervision subtitle, an ambiguity exists that requires us to affirm the <em>habeas </em>relief granted by the circuit court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Filbert, </em>144 Md.App. 95, 796 A.2d 834 (2002), we applied these lessons to an inmate who committed a new crime while on parole. Geddings theorized that, since he was on parole for an earlier crime at the time he committed a new crime, his new sentence would aggregate with his old sentences, creating a single 42 year term of confinement against which he could use his past credits. We held that Geddings could not use credits that he accrued against his earlier sentences to reduce his term of confinement on his new sentence because the Parole Commission never revoked his parole. <em>See id. </em>at 103-06, 796 A.2d 834. Geddings two sentences did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>create a single term of confinement; \"[a]ny sentence being served on parole or mandatory supervision ... is not aggregated into a term of confinement because it is not being served in 'confinement.' \" <em>Id. </em>at 105, 796 A.2d 834. In contrast, Staton\u2019s mandatory supervision was revoked, so that he was serving his original sentences \"in confinement\u201d when he returned to the DOC to complete the remainder of his original sentences, creating a single term of confinement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">. Staton also cites our discussion of these Court of Appeals cases in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>140 Md.App. 445, 460-61, 780 A.2d 1199 (2001). In that case, we held that Smith was entitled to accrue special project credits against an eligible sentence in his term of confinement once he finished serving his ineligible sentence. In doing so, we observed that these four \"cases demonstrate that the Court of Appeals already has considered and rejected attempts to narrow eligibility for diminution credits by using the \u2018term of confinement' concept to deny an inmate credits against a sentence that is eligible for them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 780 A.2d 1199. In our view, \u201cthe broader lesson of these \u2018good conduct' cases [was] that diminution credits, once they are created, should be earned and calculated against the eligible sentence of an inmate rather than against his or her entire term of confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 780 A.2d 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">These observations should not be read as a blanket rejection of the \u201cterm of confinement\u201d rationale for aggregating eligible and ineligible sentences in every instance, without regard to the specific language of ihe provision creating such credits. Our comments reflected that the DOC regulations creating the double celling credits in question specifically stated that inmates would be ineligible for such credits if they were not \" \u2018serving a ... [s]entence for murder[.]\u2019 \" <em>Id. </em>at 451, 461, 780 A.2d 1199 (emphasis added). Smith was serving a murder sentence and a consecutive robbery sentence. We held that if Smith was no longer serving his murder sentence, he was entitled, under the terms of the DOC regulation, to accrue special project credits against his robbery \"sentence.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 461-63, 780 A.2d 1199. We remanded to the circuit court for a determination of whether Smith had completed his murder sentence, and \"whether he earned and retained special project credits for the time he doubled celled thereafter[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 780 A.2d 1199.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">.
