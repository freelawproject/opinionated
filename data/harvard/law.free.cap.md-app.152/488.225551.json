Hudson appeals from the judgments of conviction by a Baltimore City jury on two counts charging second degree murder, and two counts of conspiracy to commit first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">By separate indictments filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Hudson was charged with two counts each of first degree murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, carrying a handgun, and conspiracy to commit first degree murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After his convictions, he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment on the murder convictions and a consecutive life sentence for one conspiracy; the additional conspiracy was merged for purposes of sentencing. In his appeal, Hudson presents the following issues, which we have recast:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">1. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in admitting hearsay evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">2. Must the convictions for conspiracy to commit murder be reversed in view of the jury\u2019s inconsistent finding of guilt for second degree murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-13\">3. Did the trial court\u2019s denial of the defense motion for a mistrial constitute an abuse of discretion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>4. Was the evidence sufficient to support the convictions for second degree murder and conspiracy?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We shall affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Pacts</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The appellant\u2019s prosecution emanated from the murders of A1 Duante \u201cDante\u201d Brown and Clarence \u201cPops\u201d Miller on December 30, 1999, in Baltimore City. The two victims were dropped near the comer of North Avenue and Ashburton Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\n<em>The Murders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Catherine Lee was an eyewitness. She was Miller\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, and was also acquainted -with Dante Brown, who hung out for a while at Miller\u2019s house in Baltimore. Around 9:00 p.m. on December 30, Miller accompanied Lee to the \u201cCut Rate,\u201d a liquor store/bar, on Braddish at North Avenue. On the way they encountered Brown near North and Ashburton. When Lee entered the \u201cCut Rate,\u201d Miller remained outside with a friend; Brown stayed farther down the block.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">After Lee left the \u201cCut Rate,\u201d she and Miller crossed over to North Avenue, met Brown, and the trio proceeded to walk down North Avenue back toward Ashburton. As they turned onto Ashburton, Lee happened to turn around to see an individual approaching from behind. This person, who obscured his face with a bandanna, overtook Miller and Lee and headed straight for Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">The stranger briefly addressed Brown, got no reply, and reached for \u201csomething\u201d from his pants. Lee could not identify the object, but she anticipated trouble. Perhaps presaging a robbery about to occur, she began \u201ceasing back.\u201d As she started to cross Ashburton, a gunshot rang out, and she ducked behind a parked van. She claimed to be scared, because \u201cthey\u201d were shooting. Lee saw that Miller was struggling with Brown\u2019s assailant, and heard two separate, additional volleys of gunfire.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>After the shooting ended, Lee remained behind the van for a brief period. She saw a person, resembling the assailant from the back, running away from the scene. She did not recall seeing anyone else, but, she remained safely behind the van and thus did not watch all of the action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After this, Lee went to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\n<em>Admissions of Guilt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">On December 31, 1999, at about 11:00 a.m., appellant arrived at the apartment of Rene Knight to visit with Knight\u2019s son. Knight, who was 43 years old at the time of her testimony, had known both appellant and his friend Pierre<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for about five years. She had been a former neighbor of appellant\u2019s on Braddish Avenue. At the time of these events, Knight lived with her daughter in a second-floor apartment located over a flat that was occupied by appellant\u2019s sister, Tamika Hudson, on Barnes Street in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Appellant, wearing a black bandana, approached Knight and asked whether she knew about the events of the previous evening. When Knight professed ignorance, appellant told her that he had shot someone on North and Ashburton, claiming as a reason that \u201chis mother had been disrespected.\u201d Appellant said that he had waited until dark before shooting his victim. He also claimed that he had been accompanied by his friend \u201cPierre,\u201d who in turn \u201cdealt\u201d with the other person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>because that individual had \u201cdisrespected his grandmother.\u201d Knight unsuccessfully attempted to encourage appellant to go \u201ctalk to somebody\u201d or turn himself in. During this conversation, Pierre Easter, who was present, maintained his silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">After this episode, appellant went to another room to play a video game with Knight\u2019s son and son-in-law. Although appellant appeared to be upset that his mother had been insulted, he showed to Knight \u201cno conviction, no remorse, no nothing\u201d about the previous night\u2019s events.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Knight recalled seeing a handgun that morning in the hands of appellant\u2019s cousin, Bianca Young. She had heard what appeared to be \u201cgunshots,\u201d and went to investigate. Appellant seemed amused when Knight inquired about them. Knight thought this weapon was a .38 caliber pistol with a brown handle and a quarter-inch barrel, and ordered that it be taken from the apartment away from \u201cunreliable teenagers.\u201d At trial, Knight identified a .32 caliber handgun as the weapon she had seen on the 31st. This was the handgun removed from appellant\u2019s home by Detective Williams.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Knight admitted that she had not contacted the authorities about appellant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Bianca Young, appellant\u2019s cousin, was fourteen years old at the time of her testimony. Bianca testified that appellant had admitted to her that he had gotten into an argument with a man the previous day because the latter had \u201cdisrespected [appellant\u2019s] mom,\u201d calling her a \u201cbitch.\u201d Appellant said that he shot this person once, and that his Mend Pierre Easter had shot the victim\u2019s companion, because that man was \u201crunning his mouth.\u201d Pierre Easter was present, and, according to Bianca, had blood on his coat and a cut on his head. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>contrast, appellant had no blood on his clothes and no apparent injuries. The pair displayed a black handgun. Bianca identified this handgun as the same weapon recovered from appellant\u2019s home and also identified by Knight. Bianca noticed that both appellant and Pierre had bandannas.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Eva Coleman is Dante Brown\u2019s mother. She admitted that her son was a cocaine addict, and that he would often entrust her with money from his paycheck so that he would not spend all of his earnings on drugs. On December 30, Coleman accompanied Brown to pick up his paycheck, and then took him to the bank to deposit all but $40. Concerning the money, she said that Brown paid money to \u201ca guy named Little Glenn[,]\u201d a member of the extended family, and guessed that the debt was \u201cfor drugs.\u201d She then took Brown to the vicinity of Coppin State College. She did not see him again until he returned home at 4:30 that afternoon. Coleman recalled that Brown was in a rush, and was not wearing his coat. She became concerned for his welfare; he obtained more money. She did not know what would happen to her son \u201cout on the streets.\u201d Coleman explained that \u201che might get killed, stabbed. Anything could have happened to him because I knew he had a problem ... a drug problem.\u201d Other than this, she could not recall anything in particular that prompted her concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">On cross-examination, Coleman responded in the affirmative when questioned whether she had a \u201clot of concerns about [Brown\u2019s] safety generally ... because he was a drug user and he was out running the streets[.]\u201d She then agreed with trial counsel\u2019s question that, \u201c... because he was a drug user, he would have debts to drug dealers____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\n<em>The Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Police investigations brought them to appellant\u2019s home on January 5, 2000. Appellant, 16 years old at the time of the homicides, lived with his mother, Mattie Hudson, at 1906 Braddish Avenue. On that date, a number of plainclothes officers, including Detective Antoine Williams, were cruising in an unmarked sedan near appellant\u2019s home. They encountered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>appellant on the street, and one of the officers conducted what Detective Williams described as a \u201cfield interview.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a result of this, the officers proceeded to appellant\u2019s house, where they were met by his mother, from whom they obtained permission to search appellant\u2019s bedroom. Detective Williams located a loaded Burgo .32 caliber revolver from under a mattress in what was thought to be Gerard Hudson\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Appellant was interviewed by police on March 10, 2000, and provided a recorded statement that was played at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He told officers that on the night of the 30th, he was sitting in his brother\u2019s bedroom when Pierre Easter \u201ccame in there and he asked me let him hold the gun.\u201d He had told Easter where it was kept. Easter explained to appellant that someone had insulted his grandmother. According to appellant, Easter \u201cgrabbed the gun from under the mattress and he put this black scarf on his face and went downstairs and came outside.\u201d Appellant said that he then went outside, walked to the corner, saw that Easter was down at Ashburton, \u201cand [saw that] he [Easter] raised the gun up to the man ... and he fired one shot.\u201d Appellant went home, then returned to the street, heard three more shots, then went toward Ashburton \u201cto see who\u2014Pierre before he fired the three, the other three shots the man was tussling.\u201d Appellant said that as the last three shots were fired he \u201cgot to the comer[.]\u201d Both Easter and appellant then ran back to appellant\u2019s home. Appellant admitted that the weapon found in his brother\u2019s room, the one recovered by Detective Williams, had been used in the shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Dr. Wayne Fowler, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner, performed the autopsies <em>on </em>both Miller and Brown. From the former post mortem examination, Dr. Fowler recovered three bullets, two from a large caliber weapon and the third from a \u201cmuch smaller\u201d caliber. In addition to his other wounds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Miller had been shot in the back four times with the larger caliber weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Detective Jones conducted part of the interview, and asked appellant about the gun. Appellant replied that the weapon had been placed under a mattress in his brother\u2019s room. When asked to explain how the police had obtained the weapon, appellant replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">They ... when I was ... arrested for a CDS<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> charge and ... the police asked me where I lived at and I told him and I showed him where I lived at. And he asked my mother could he check[ ] the house and ... she replied yes[.] ... And he went in there and checked the house and he found the ... gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">When asked to describe the victims, appellant said he couldn\u2019t see them, but recalled, \u201cI think one of them had on a red jacket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Additional facts as necessary will be presented in our discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AHp\">I. Victim\u2019s Hearsay Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Appellant attacks the trial court\u2019s admission, through the testimony of an investigating detective, of certain statements the decedent Dante Brown purportedly made to his mother, Ms. Coleman. Citing this as \u201cdouble hearsay,\u201d and exhorting prejudice, appellant insists that the statements made by Dante to his mother \u201cprovided the jury with a much more compelling motive for murder than the \u2018disrespecting\u2019 of relatives[.]\u201d That motive, appellant observes, was a supposed drug debt. The State counters initially that the defense failed to preserve its objection to the admission of the specific statement at issue, and secondly that the action taken by the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>was well within his discretion, and finally that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">We find that any error in the admission of the contested statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. To place this issue into its appropriate perspective, we must rehearse the course of the trial that led to the admission of Dante Brown\u2019s hurried words.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">During the State\u2019s examination of Detective Wayne Jones, who interviewed Eva Coleman, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right. And directing your attention to State\u2019s Exhibit 10 for identification purposes only, would you take a moment to review that, please, and tell us if that is your summary of what she told you and if it\u2019s accurate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: The questions I\u2019m about to ask you, you cannot answer with telling us what Dante said, okay? [WITNESS]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m going to ask you what if any reason did she give for Dante coming into the house without his coat on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">[DEFENSE]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">THE COURT: Basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">[DEFENSE]: Leading and it\u2019s asking for hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">THE COURT: Well, the witness is available. I suspect this witness will be back here to be cross-examin[ed]\u2014 [PROSECUTOR]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">THE COURT:\u2014for cross-examination? I\u2019ll overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: You can answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-16\">[WITNESS]: Okay. Can you repeat the question again, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-17\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes. What if any reason did Ms. Coleman give for why Dante came back into the house at 4 to 5:00 in the afternoon without his red coat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>[WITNESS]: The reason was he was being pursued by someone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did she tell you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right. And how\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">THE COURT: Excuse me, counsel. Now let\u2019s base this on the understanding that Ms. Coleman will be brought back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASJ\">[PROSECUTOR]: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">THE COURT: And, therefore, Ms. Flynn will have an opportunity to cross-examine\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">THE COURT: Ms. Coleman. Let\u2019s go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjR\">[PROSECUTOR]: And how, if at all, did she say he was behaving at 5:00 when he came back into the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiy\">[WITNESS]: He was very, very erratic. He had changed his clothing. He was very nervous. She tried to get him to stay inside the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: And why did she tell you she wanted him to stay inside the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">[WITNESS]: For fear of his safety. She had concerns that something was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: What, in particular, was she\u2014did she tell you she was concerned\u2014-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-15\">[WITNESS]: She was concerned, that after he rushed in excited, she tried to encourage him to, to avoid going back out for fear of being harmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-16\">[PROSECUTOR]: And did she tell you what, in particular, she was worried would harm him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-17\">[WITNESS]: Persons whom he owed money to for drug debts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-18\">[PROSECUTOR]: And what, if anything, did she believe had just happened right before he came into the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4z\">[DEFENSE]: Objection. Leading, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ado\">[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019ll rephrase it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>THE COURT: Also requiring the witness to speculate about another- person\u2019s state of mind, so I\u2019ll sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: What, if any, understanding did she\u2014 THE COURT: Excuse me. Counsel, come up. Let\u2019s come up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">THE COURT: This has become\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, I can do it that way. That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnD\">THE COURT:\u2014having him speculate\u2014speaks for itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay, I\u2019ll do it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">[DEFENSE]: Then I\u2019ll put my objection on the record for that. He indicated that he spoke to her shortly after the murder for identification purposes, which would have been December 31st. This is dated January 3rd. But on the bottom, on the printout, it\u2019s dated January 5th, so these are not notes that were made simultaneously with the interview based on what I\u2019ve been given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">THE COURT:\u2014lay a foundation for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: He can explain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">THE COURT: He can explain\u2014dates and\u2014I\u2019ll sustain that objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">Anything else, Ms. Flynn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">[DEFENSE]: No. Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">[PROSECUTOR]: Detective Jones\u2014...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\">\u2014 can you, by reviewing your case folder, tell us precisely when you had the conversation with Ms. Coleman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-18\">Detective, did you find\u2014did you determine from your notes the precise date that you took the statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>[WITNESS]: The date would be the 3rd, January the 3rd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">Of 2000, the date of the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Now directing your attention to the particular area of the report I\u2019m going to show you, I\u2019d ask you to read\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">Detective, the document which is marked for identification purposes only as State\u2019s Exhibit 10, this is a\u2014you\u2019ve testified this is a summary of the statement she gave on or about January 3rd of 2000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">[WITNESS]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: And are documents such as this one made in the ordinary course of business by you as a homicide detective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">[WITNESS]: Yes, they are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Are documents such as this one kept in the ordinary course of business by you as a homicide detective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">[WITNESS]: Yes, they are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Was this particular document made and kept in the ordinary course of your business, the investigation of this particular pair of murders?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">[WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: Thank you. And directing your attention specifically to the sentence that begins \u201cAt\u201d and ends with the following sentence, \u201cexcited,\u201d can you please read that out loud?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-15\">THE COURT: Well, before it gets read to the jury, can you move to put it in evidence\u2014Ms. Flynn make her objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeE\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, Your Honor, we\u2019ve agreed to do [it] this way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-16\">[DEFENSE]: I\u2019m sorry, can we approach one more time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ape\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u2756 \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">[DEFENSE]: Your Honor, what the State is attempting to get in is a sentence\u2014a statement made by the decedent to his mother. I think under any circumstance that\u2019s hearsay. The fact\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">THE COURT: What\u2019s he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">[DEFENSE]: \u201cI just ran into somebody I don\u2019t need to see.\u201d That\u2019s hearsay. Whether or not it comes in through the officer or through the mother, it\u2019s still hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">THE COURT: And you don\u2019t think the business record exception\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">[DEFENSE]: It\u2019s double hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exception to the hearsay rule since it\u2019s a business record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">[DEFENSE]: Well, it wasn\u2019t the decedent giving the statement, it\u2019s the mother giving a hearsay statement to the police officer. So I don\u2019t think just because she gives it to a police officer it cures the original hearsay that the statement was made by the decedent. And the mother couldn\u2019t testify to it simply on the grounds of hearsay. So I\u2019m not sure when\u2014the recollection of it wasn\u2019t complete. She can\u2019t get on the stand and say my son said this to me. And simply because she told the police officer that and it\u2019s recorded at the time doesn\u2019t cure the hearsay nature of his statement to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">THE COURT: I just ran into somebody I don\u2019t need to see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-13\">[DEFENSE]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-14\">THE COURT: One more try.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-15\">[DEFENSE]: Despite the fact that she read the statement out in the hall, she can\u2019t remember it. Like, it\u2014simply because she told the police officer what he said does not cure the nature of the hearsay. She can testify that he was upset, which she wasn\u2019t able to do. She can testify that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>was in and out in a rush. She couldn\u2019t testify that he changed his clothes, which she didn\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t remember. But she cannot testify as to what he said to her, which is being offered for the truth of the matter, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYb\">THE COURT: I will deny the objection\u2014overrule the objection. The case may come down to\u2014hearsay rules and\u2014and the whole circumstances here.

The State discounts the defense, specifically objecting to the testimony considered to be the more damaging to its case, <em>viz. </em>Dante\u2019s statements to Ms. Coleman.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We disagree with the State. Counsel, as shown by the above-quoted testimony, vigorously contested those aspects of the detective\u2019s testimony that rested upon statements collected from Ms. Coleman. Further, defense counsel voiced a \u201ccontinuing objection\u201d after the State offered into evidence Detective Jones\u2019s record of the interview of Ms. Coleman, and, while losing that skirmish, saw to it that the State would introduce only a redacted version of the detective\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The defense appropriately objected to the evidence at issue in this appeal. The overall hearsay issue has been adequately preserved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Borchardt v. State, </em>367 Md. 91, 131, 786 A.2d 631 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1104, 122 S.Ct. 2309, 152 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2002); <em>Graves v.

There are two approaches to the problem of hearsay.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> One focuses on the purpose for which the evidence is offered: hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. This is a traditional definition of hearsay as articulated in Md. Rule 5-801(e). The other focuses on the origin of the evidence: hearsay is evidence the probative force of which depends on the competency and credibility of a person other than the testifying witness. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-804(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u201cGenerally, statements made out of court that are offered for their truth are inadmissible as hearsay, absent circumstances bringing the statements within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Su v. Weaver, </em>313 Md. 370, 376, 545 A.2d 692 (1988) (citing <em>Kapiloff v. Locke, </em>276 Md. 466, 471, 348 A.2d 697 (1975)). The Hearsay Rule is a rule of exclusion, and thus the proponent of the disputed evidence bears the burden of showing that the Rule does not apply. <em>See Cassidy v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 1, 7-8, 536 A.2d 666, <em>cert. denied, </em>312 Md. 602, 541 A.2d 965 (1988). No statement at issue here would offend the hearsay rule if the evidence was \u201coffered for some purpose other than to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein[.]\u201d <em>See Ashford v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 1, 75, 807 A.2d 732 (quoting <em>Ali v. State </em>314 Md. 295, 304, 550 A.2d 925 (1988)), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 Md. 430, 813 A.2d 257 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">At first blush, it may appear that Dante Brown\u2019s statement to his mother, who in turn relayed it to Detective Jones, presents a prototypal \u201chearsay within hearsay\u201d para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>digm. <em>See Ashford, </em>147 Md.App. at 73-74, 807 A.2d 732. But this problem is easily unscrambled.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We begin by accepting the trial court\u2019s ruling that Dante\u2019s statement constituted an excited utterance embraced by Rule 5\u2014803(b)(2). But its admissibility lies not with the secondary hearsay (Dante\u2019s exclamation to Eva Coleman) but with the primary hearsay that came after Detective Jones\u2019s recitation of Ms. Coleman\u2019s assertion of her deceased son\u2019s words: \u201cI just ran into someone I don\u2019t need to see.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Statements made to an investigating officer are not hearsay unless and until they are offered into evidence for their truth. <em>Daniel v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 576, 589, 753 A.2d 545, <em>cert. denied, </em>361 Md. 232, 760 A.2d 1106 (2000).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The State begrudgingly concedes that Detective Jones\u2019s \u201ctestimony does appear to have been [hearsay].\u201d The testimony is glaringly hearsay. Ms. Coleman\u2019s remarks were offered, through Detective Jones, pellucidly for their substance and effect: to show that Dante was being \u201cpursued by someone.\u201d Indeed, appellant\u2019s objection to the introduction of the hearsay is framed as a challenge to what it implies\u2014Dante Brown did not take care of his drug debt\u2014and not what it portrays\u2014 Dante was scared. Thus, this out-of-court assertion was hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">This, however, is not dispositive of the issue. We must now determine whether any prejudice requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">\n<em>Harmless Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Appellant correctly asserts that the introduction of Ms. Coleman\u2019s statement through Detective Jones\u2019s testimony was error. We are nevertheless satisfied that the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>this hearsay was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Given the extant record, we conclude on a number of grounds that the trial court\u2019s lapse in giving such free rein to Detective Jones on the stand \u201ccould not possibly have influenced the verdicts.\u201d <em>See Borchardt, </em>367 Md. at 131, 786 A.2d 631 (citing <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976)). <em>See also Farewell v. State, </em>150 Md.App. 540, 579 n. 17, 822 A.2d 513 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">First, the disputed statement, that Dante had just run into someone he wanted to avoid, is fairly innocuous by itself. We do not see this statement, taken alone, as necessarily indicating a more \u201ccompelling motive\u201d for the murders than the fact that Dante may have insulted appellant\u2019s mother\u2014the reason he gave to Rene Knight and Bianca Young\u2014a fact which, on the streets, may be a compelling reason for exacting revenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In addition, appellant must hurdle the prospect of waiver by failing to object to appellant\u2019s two separate admissions, in his statement that was read into evidence, that he had been arrested on a CDS charge. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>131 Md.App. 1, 26-27, 748 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 335, 753 A.2d 1032 (2000).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although appellant complains of the \u201cdouble hearsay\u201d in the form of Detective Jones\u2019s testimony, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>does not contest on appeal the admission of Eva Coleman\u2019s testimony, which highlighted her concerns that Dante had a drug problem, that he had paid one person, \u201cLittle Glenn,\u201d money for drugs, and that he left the house with more money. On cross-examination of Ms. Coleman, defense counsel specifically raised the issue of drug debts by suggesting that because Dante was a drug user, \u201che would have debts to drug dealers[.]\u201d Ms. Coleman\u2019s testimony, both on direct and on cross-examination, effectively conveys the same message as her hearsay statement, admitted through Detective Jones, to the effect that she was afraid that Dante would be harmed by \u201ctpjersons to whom he had owed money to for drug debts.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Alternatively, we conclude that, without Brown\u2019s statement, the State presented a compelling case. The admissions by appellant to Rene Knight and Bianca Young provide sufficient evidence of guilt that would have permitted the jury to convict. Their statements are in turn underpinned by the fact that police recovered one of the murder weapons from a room to which appellant had access in his house. Appellant\u2019s statement, read into the transcript at trial, reveals that he was able to tell Pierre Easter the location of this handgun, and allowed his friend to take it in order to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">We conclude that, based on our independent review of the record as a whole and convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, \u201cthere is no reasonable possibility that the [hearsay evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>admitted in error] may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">II. Instructions and Inconsistent Verdicts</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Citing instructional error, appellant contests his conviction for conspiracy to commit murder. The trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">The Defendant has also been charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime. In order to convict this Defendant of conspiracy, the State must prove that the Defendant entered into an agreement with at least one other person to commit the crime of murder and that the Defendant entered into the agreement with the intent that the murder be committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">This instruction roughly tracks the language of the <em>Maryland Criminal Jury Instructions.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Appellant\u2019s attack is two-pronged. In his first prong, he deprecates the trial court\u2019s instruction because it does not set forth the \u201crequired elements of premeditation, deliberation, and a specific intent to kill[.]\u201d In his second prong, he argues that the prejudice from this incorrect charge is clear because in its confusion the jury rendered inconsistent verdicts\u2014 acquitting him of first degree murder of both victims and clearing him of using a handgun in the commission of a felony. Appellant then concludes that, because the trial judge failed to instruct on the requisite mental state for first degree murder, \u201cthe jury may well have believed that it could convict [him] of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>conspiring to commit an unplanned and unpremeditated murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The State urges that we affirm. The State first interposes a preservation argument, pointing out that the defense failed to challenge the jury instructions at trial. The government then proclaims that the guilty verdicts on conspiracy to commit first degree murder and murder in the second degree are not necessarily inconsistent with acquittals on the first degree murder and handgun counts. Finally, the State, humoring appellant\u2019s assignment of error, avers in any event that we should not disturb the verdicts rendered on the basis of their inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>Preservation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We can speedily dispose of the State\u2019s non-preservation argument. As Judge Davis has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">The State suggests that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the court\u2019s instructions or to request an instruction on consistent verdicts precludes Beharry from complaining on appeal about the inconsistent verdicts. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-325(e). We do not agree. As we explained in <em>Jenkins v. State, </em>59 Md.App. 612, 620-21, 477 A.2d 791 (1984), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>307 Md. 501, 515 A.2d 465 (1986) (regarding whether guilty verdicts of assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to maim were inconsistent):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">Ordinarily, a defendant\u2019s failure to make a timely objection to the court\u2019s instructions, or to its omission to give an instruction, precludes appellate review of any error relating to the instructions.... Where the error arises from the rendition of inconsistent verdicts, however, although it could have been avoided by appropriate instruction, it extends beyond the matter of instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">* \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">We further explained in <em>Jenkins </em>that, <em>when real prejudice is shown, we will review on appeal an argument that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>verdicts were fatally inconsistent even if the defendant failed to make the argument below.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><em>Stuckey v. State, </em>141 Md.App. 143, 157 n. 3, 784 A.2d 652 (2001) (quoting <em>Bates and Beharry v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 678, 699-700, 736 A.2d 407 (1999)) (emphasis in original), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 Md. 241, 792 A.2d 1178 (2002). Because appellant embroils the conspiracy instruction in the rendering of the inconsistent verdicts, each of the prongs of his argument merits further probing.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\n<em>First Prong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">\n<em>Inconsistent Verdicts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">At common law, jurors took an oath to well and truly try the case, and their verdict was considered sacrosanct. Since trial by jury developed as an alternative to the ancient methods of compurgation and ordeal, the jury was to be considered no more \u201crational\u201d than the ordeals the jury had replaced. Just as one did not question the judgments of God in the ordeal, one did not challenge the jury\u2019s verdict. Consistency has never been a requisite attribute of a jury verdict. Continuing the common law tradition, \u201c[ijnconsistent verdicts in a jury trial [ ] are generally tolerated under Maryland law.\u201d <em>Stuckey, </em>141 Md.App. at 157, 784 A.2d 652 (footnote omitted). Much like Macbeth confronted with the witches\u2019 prediction that no man of woman born would ever be a threat for him, to reverse an inconsistent conviction would not only require guesswork about what produced the inconsistency, but would also be unfair to the State, which cannot appeal an inconsistent acquittal. At the trial level, if a jury returns a verdict that is inconsistent on its face, the trial judge might respond by refusing to accept the verdict, pointing out to the jury how the verdict cannot be reconciled with the jury instructions, and sending the jury back for further deliberations to resolve the inconsistency. The judge might also instruct the jurors that, to the extent that their verdict reflects a compromise reached by abandoning the reasonable doubt standard, such a compromise is impermissible. Deliberations would then continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>until jurors either returned a consistent verdict or indicated to the court\u2019s satisfaction that they were hopelessly deadlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">At the appellate level, the court will review such verdicts where real prejudice is shown and the verdicts may be attributable to errors in the jury charge. <em>See id. </em>at 157 n. 3, 784 A.2d 652 (quoting <em>Bates v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 678, 699-700, 736 A.2d 407 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Although the Supreme Court concedes that inconsistent verdicts reveal jury error, nevertheless in <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 67, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984), speaking for an unanimous Court on inconsistent jury verdicts, Chief Justice Rehnquist, with an apparent shrug of the shoulders, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">Finally, we note that a criminal defendant already is afford-. ed protection against jury irrationality or error by the <em>independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence undertaken by the trial and appellate courts. </em>This review should not be confused with the problems caused by inconsistent verdicts. Sufficiency-of-the-evidence review involves assessment by the courts of whether the evidence adduced at trial could support any rational determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt____This review should be independent of the jury\u2019s determination that evidence on another count was insufficient. The Government must convince the jury with its proof, and must also satisfy the courts that given this proof the jury could rationally have reached a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not believe that further safeguards against jury irrationality are necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABP\">(Citations omitted; emphasis supplied.) <em>See also Galloway v. State, </em>371 Md. 379, 809 A.2d 653 (2002) (Jury acquitted defendant of the charge that defendant had possessed and used a handgun. The jury\u2019s verdict notwithstanding, the trial court convicted defendant on both counts of possession of a firearm after having been previously convicted of a crime.

The <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Shell </em>cases distinguish between inconsistent verdicts in a jury trial and such verdicts in a non-jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Appellant confuses a curious verdict with an inconsistent verdict. As indicated in <em>Powell, supra, </em>a truly inconsistent verdict reveals a definite error but conceals the error\u2019s victim. Whose ox has been gored? The defendant\u2019s? The government\u2019s?</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">First, there is no inconsistency either between the acquittal on the first degree premeditated murder count and the conviction for conspiring to commit first degree murder or, obversely, an acquittal on a conspiracy charge and the conviction of first degree murder. These offenses are separate and distinct. The crime of conspiracy is proven by \u201ca meeting of the minds reflecting a unity of purpose and design[.]\u201d <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 221, 582 A.2d 525 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">It is not necessary that the target offense be made out at all. An inchoate crime, such as that expansive definition of solicitation conspiracy, requires that the defendant must have the purpose to engage in future forbidden conduct, that is, contemplate a crime that has not yet occurred. Similar to other inchoate crimes, conspiracy punishes preparatory conduct before it develops into a substantive offense. A conspiracy is distinct from the substantive crime contemplated by the conspiracy and is charged as a separate offense. The <em>actus reus </em>of conspiracy is an agreement to commit a crime. \u201cThe crime is complete without any overt act.\u201d <em>Gardner v. State, </em>286 Md. 520, 524, 408 A.2d 1317 (1979). The jury was free to convict appellant on the premeditated murder count, acquit him altogether, or find, as it apparently did, that, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the time came to execute the plan, appellant\u2019s conduct may not have satisfied the requirements for first degree, premeditated murder, because the evidence only convinced them, beyond a reasonable doubt, of a lesser degree of homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We find no inconsistency in the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\n<em>Second Prong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4F\">\n<em>Conspiracy Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Were we, however, to find such an inconsistency, we nonetheless disagree with appellant\u2019s contention that the instruction was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">We realize that the Pattern Jury Instructions do not necessarily cover every conceivable situation, and they cannot be followed without consideration of the particular circumstances of each case. Nevertheless, we noted in <em>Green v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 547, 562, 705 A.2d 133 (1998), that \u201c... appellate courts have chastised trial judges for deviating from the model burden of proof instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Although the better course was for the trial court to instruct the jury using more explicit elements of the offense, <em>see Mitchell v. State, </em>363 Md. 130, 146, 767 A.2d 844 (2001), we nonetheless see no reason to upset the conspiracy verdict on the basis of the jury charge actually given. This is so because, following Judge McAuliffe\u2019s admonition \"... that any departure from that language will be \u201csubjected to careful scrutiny^]\u201d <em>Wills v. State, </em>329 Md. 370, 392, 620 A.2d 295 (1993), we have viewed the instructions in their entirety, <em>see Fleming v. State, </em>373 Md. 426, 433, 818 A.2d 1117 (2003), and \u201cit is [not] apparent from the record that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instructions. Any inconsistent verdicts clearly are not a product of lenity, mistake, or compromise on the part of the jury[.]\u201d <em>Bates, </em>127 Md.App. at 694, 736 A.2d 407. The trial court instructed the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>that it had to find that appellant \u201centered into the agreement with the intent that the murder be committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>We examine the appellant\u2019s inchoate criminality through the prism of pmpose. When a defendant engages in proscribed conduct or in conduct that brings about a prohibited result, our interest focuses on his state of mind at the time he engages in the proscribed conduct or the conduct that causes the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Despite the conditionality of a defendant\u2019s criminal purpose, when a defendant commits an inchoate crime, such as conspiracy, the defendant usually has shown himself or herself to have a less than totally praiseworthy character and to hold out some threat to the rights of others protected by the criminal law. Ordinarily, however, neither a reprobate character nor the hazard it represents suffices for criminal liability. What differentiates the inchoate criminal from others who are reprobate and hazardous is that the former has formed a criminal intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Generally, all crimes contain a <em>mens rea </em>or mental state element. In all of the traditional crimes, there must exist a prohibited action or result <em>(\u201cactus reus </em>\u201d) and a certain mental state <em>(\u201cmens rea </em>\u201d). For example, crimes require that there be awareness that the prohibited action will occur <em>(mens rea) </em>at the time of the commission of the prohibited action. Thus, in the present case for there to be first degree murder it is not enough that appellant killed another human. The killing must have been willful, deliberate, and premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Appellant argues that, because the trial court previously instructed on both first and second degree murder, it failed to advise the jury in its conspiracy instruction that there can be no conspiracy to commit second-degree murder, and to convict the appellant of conspiracy to murder the jury must find an agreement to commit willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder. <em>Mitchell, </em>363 Md. at 149, 767 A.2d 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Conspiracy has two mental states: one for the underlying crime itself, and one for any result or action that is necessary to accomplish that goal. As was recently observed by the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>When the object of the conspiracy is the commission of another crime, as in conspiracy to commit murder, the specific intent required for the conspiracy is not only the intent required for the agreement but also, pursuant to that agreement, the intent to assist in some way in causing that crime to be committed.... Thus, if the conspiracy is to commit murder, the intent must be to commit (or have someone commit) those acts that would constitute murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acg-dedup-0\"><em>In re Heather B., </em>369 Md. 257, 271, 799 A.2d 397 (2002) (quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>363 Md. at 146, 767 A.2d 844).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Given the symmetry between the <em>mens rea </em>required for premeditated first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, we are satisfied that the trial court adequately instructed the jury, and that appellant\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to commit first degree murder was not the product of an instruction that would allow the jury to convict on the basis of a lesser degree of intent. <em>See Mitchell, </em>363 Md. at 149, 767 A.2d 844 (\u201c... the kind of awareness and reflection necessary to achieve the unity of purpose and design for a conspiracy is essentially the same as that required for deliberation and premeditation.\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">III. Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">We turn to appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defense motion for a mistrial because of inadvertent admission of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. The defense sought this remedy, asserting that it was aggrieved by testimony of an acquaintance of appellant, Shawn .Horton, whose statements on two occasions during his examination suggested appellant\u2019s involvement in the narcotics trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Appellant insists that, despite curative instructions from the trial judge, \u201ctwo [separate] references to [him] as being in the business of selling drugs\u201d could only have alerted the jury to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>propensity for criminal activity and violence. We disagree, and see no abuse of discretion in the trial judge\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Shawn Horton testified for the State. Both appellant and Easter were his friends. The testimony proceeded as follows after the prosecution inquired whether Horton knew someone going by the name of \u201cClarence,\u201d one of the victims in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: And who was Clarence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">[WITNESS]: A regular customer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The defense counsel immediately objected. The trial court then directed that Horton\u2019s response would be stricken, and instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Horton stated in his law [sic] few words a response to the last question. In his answer, he referred to Clarence as a \u201cregular customer.\u201d Please disregard that, strike it from your memory. Don\u2019t consider it in your deliberations or in your consideration of the verdict sheet in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">Is that satisfactory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\">[DEFENSE]: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Later, Horton testified that appellant and Easter had been robbed. The prosecutor had asked Horton about some of the events that occurred the day of the shooting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: What happened during the day, can you tell us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-14\">[WITNESS]: We got robbed during that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKv\">[PROSECUTOR]: Who got robbed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-15\">[WITNESS]: Pierre, Gerard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-16\">[PROSECUTOR]: With regard to Gerard, what, if anything, did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-17\">[WITNESS]: What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-18\">[PROSECUTOR]: Um-hum, to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>[WITNESS]: He just got robbed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: And what did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afk-dedup-0\">[WITNESS]: Fuck it. We chalk it up as a loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af3\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right, and then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1c\">[DEFENSE]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">THE COURT: Excuse me. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acj-dedup-0\">[PROSECUTOR]: And then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">[DEFENSE]: Your Honor, may we be heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADP\">THE COURT: Come on back up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">THE COURT: I know it looks like somebody\u2019s in business but go ahead, why don\u2019t you put your objection\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGe\">[DEFENSE]: Your Honor, my objection is that the witness said we chalk it up as a loss which it clearly implies that they\u2019re in business together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">Your Honor, I have to ask for a mistrial at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">Because we\u2019ve agreed\u2014and it\u2019s not the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s fault, I understand that. But this certainly implies drug dealing, which would be a prior bad act that is not admissible in this case. It is going to be impossible for the jury to disregard that statement in conjunction with the other statement, and the implications for them being out on the corner all day long. For them to disregard that and not to consider my client a drug dealer, which is not the issue in this case. I don\u2019t think, as a result of that, he can get a fair trial from this jury. And for that reason, I\u2019d ask for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">That\u2019s in conjunction with the prior testimony that Mr. Miller was a customer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>THE COURT: Customer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">[DEFENSE]: And the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s correct, I didn\u2019t make a motion, because we did have an agreement. And I\u2019m not accusing her of violating the agreement, but if the Court wants I\u2019ll make a motion and we can have a hearing on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">THE COURT: I want to protect your-deny the motion for a mistrial. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite there but it\u2019s awfully close.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, let me grant the objection\u2014sustain the objection and let the\u2014ask you to put out of your mind the answer to the last question, which was just chalk it up as a loss. Please don\u2019t consider this in your deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Horton later testified on cross-examination that he did not know Dante Brown or Ms. Lee.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">In <em>Carter v. State, </em>366 Md. 574, 785 A.2d 348 (2001), the Court of Appeals articulated the standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ4\">It is well-settled that a decision to grant a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge and that the trial judge\u2019s determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is abuse of discretion. <em>See Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 555, 735 A.2d 1061, 1075 (1999); <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 277, 604 A.2d 489, 493 (1992); <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 422, 583 A.2d 218, 235 (1990). We have held consistently to the principle that \u201c[t]he grant of a mistrial is considered an extraordinary remedy and should be granted only \u2018if necessary to serve the ends of justice.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Klauenberg, </em>355 Md. at 555, 735 A.2d at 1075 (citations omitted). The question, as we have often said, is one of prejudice to the defendant. <em>See, e.g., Rainville v. State, </em>328 Md. 398, 408, 614 A.2d 949, 953 (1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 589, 785 A.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Certainly, the trial judge is in the best position to gauge whether the circumstances dictate that a motion for a mistrial should be granted. <em>Miles v. State, </em>365 Md. 488, 570, 781 A.2d 787 (2001). \u201c[W]hen the court finds that inadmissible evidence has been presented to the jury, it is within the discretion of the trial court to decide whether a cautionary or limiting instruction should be given.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>366 Md. at 588, 785 A.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">We conclude that the trial judge acted within his discretion in instructing the jury following the unsolicited comments from Shawn Horton, and that the instructions were sufficient to mitigate the effect of any inference that would be drawn from Horton\u2019s oblique references to the drug trade. Accordingly, we uphold the trial court\u2019s denials of appellant\u2019s requests for a mistrial, because we are satisfied that the curative instructions provided here mitigated any prejudice that would have accrued to appellant because of Horton\u2019s inadvertent remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Finally, appellant\u2019s appeal on this issue faces additional, and now familiar, hurdles: the introduction, not contested on appeal, of Ms. Coleman\u2019s testimony about Dante\u2019s drug problems, and her concern because he was going back to the streets that day with more money, her affirmative response to questioning on cross-examination that Dante \u201cwould have debts to drug dealers,\u201d and appellant\u2019s admissions to a CDS arrest. <em>See Williams v. State, supra. </em>At the end of the day, whether one considers appellant\u2019s argument to have been foreclosed, or any prejudice rendered harmless, <em>see id., </em>appellant has failed to justify a reversal on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">IV. Sufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Appellant maintains that the evidence of record is insufficient to support his convictions for conspiracy and second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>degree murder. We differ with appellant in our view of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Our review of the sufficiency of the evidence is plenary. In reviewing for sufficiency, we must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>accord State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533, 823 A.2d 664 (2003); <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>324 Md. 551, 567, 597 A.2d 1359, <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 1007, 112 S.Ct. 1765, 118 L.Ed.2d 427 (1992); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 172, 193, 788 A.2d 678, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 180, 798 A.2d 552 (2002); <em>Jones v. State, </em>138 Md.App. 12, 17, 769 A.2d 1015, <em>cert. denied, </em>364 Md. 535, 774 A.2d 409 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In conducting this review, our role is not to retry this case, because \u201c \u2018[j judging the weight of evidence and the credibility of witnesses and resolving conflicts in the evidence are matters entrusted to the sound discretion of the trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Heather B., </em>369 Md. 257, 270, 799 A.2d 397 (2002) (quoting <em>In re Timothy F., </em>343 Md. 371, 379-80, 681 A.2d 501 (1996)), because it is the exclusive function of the jury to draw reasonable inferences from proven facts. <em>Diaz v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 51, 70, 740 A.2d 81 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>357 Md. 482, 745 A.2d 436 (2000). Rather, we \u201cdetermine whether the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence, direct or circumstantial, which could convince a rational trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged[.]\u201d <em>White v. State, </em>363 Md. 150, 162, 767 A.2d 855 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\n<em>Conspiracy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Appellant, contesting his convictions for common law conspiracy and second degree murder, denigrates the evidence as insufficient to support a finding of guilt on either count. He maintains that the State failed to show any agreement between himself and Pierre Easter to accomplish the homicides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>and avers that the evidence, circumstantial at best, \u201csupports a reasonable hypothesis of innocence of conspiracy (an impulsive act)[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">As we have previously discussed, the State need only prove \u201ca meeting of the minds reflecting a unity of purpose and design[.]\u201d <em>Monoker, supra, </em>321 Md. at 221, 582 A.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">There is considerable evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of conspiracy. Appellant told Rene Knight that two people were shot at Ashburton and North, that he had shot one and Pierre the other. Knight recounted that appellant had asserted that the victims had \u201cdisrespected\u201d his mother, and Pierre\u2019s grandmother, \u201cso [appellant] dealt with the person who ... disrespected his mother and Pierre dealt with the person who disrespected his grandmother.\u201d On further examination, Knight testified that appellant said that \u201c[t]hey would deal with it themselves.\u201d Appellant told Knight that \u201che waited till it got dark and he lay for the person who disrespected his mother and he shot him on North and Ashburton.\u201d Ms. Knight further recounted that appellant then said that \u201cPierre was with him.\u201d Appellant admitted in his March 10, 2000, statement that he showed Pierre where one of the murder weapons was located, and Pierre took it, after telling appellant why he wanted the weapon. Judged in the light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude that the \u201cthe circumstances, taken together, are inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence\u201d as to conspiracy. <em>See Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 537, 573 A.2d 831 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The evidence for second degree murder is even more compelling. The cornerstone of the State\u2019s case is appellant\u2019s admissions to Rene Knight and Bianca Young that he shot a man. Ms. Knight\u2019s testimony was particularly unassailable. She had no motive to implicate appellant, and, indeed, had been a neighbor and was friendly with appellant\u2019s sister. On cross-examination, she was direct and forthright:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">[DEFENSE]: So you\u2019re saying he just walked straight up into the apartment and then went into\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>[WITNESS]: He came to ask me if I heard about what happened on the night\u2014on December 30th. I, in turn, told him no. He, in turn, asked me if I had told anybody anything, and I, in turn, told him no. And the conversation went from there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">One of the murder weapons, the .32 caliber revolver, found its way back to appellant\u2019s house. Bianca Young, who was appellant\u2019s third cousin and, on this record, was likewise not shown to have a motive to lie, also testified to appellant\u2019s admission. Both Rene Knight and Bianca Young saw the weapon, proven to be the .32 caliber revolver used in the killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In the final analysis, this testimony transcends mere sufficiency, and offers compelling proof that permitted the jury to return verdicts of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-14\">.

By overruling the objection, the judge demonstrated that he was permitting the prosecutor to continue along the same line. It was apparent that his ruling on further objection would be unfavorable to the defense. Persistent objections would only spotlight for the jury the remarks of the prosecutor.

Some would posit that every statement about the real world is bottomed on hearsay. It can be argued that one directly perceives nothing but mental imprints. Thus, all knowledge about an empirical fact is simply an opinion. As is manifest., any rule creating a normative straitjacket by treating all hearsay as presumptively inadmissible would be epistemological hara-kiri.
