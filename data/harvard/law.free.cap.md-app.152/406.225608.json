Andrew filed suit in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against Sass and his company, \u201cAtlantis Painting &amp; Decorating, Inc.\u201d (\u201cAtlantis\u201d), as well as Stan Mell and his company, Innerstate Design Builders, Inc. (\u201cInnerstate\u201d), complaining about a home improvement construction project. As to Atlantis, Andrew alleged breach of contract, negligence, and fraud. But, Andrew sued Sass only for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">By the time of trial in April 2002, Andrew had obtained default judgments against Mell and Innerstate in the amount of $21,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the case proceeded to trial as to Atlantis and Sass. During the trial, the court dismissed all claims against Atlantis, because Andrew had erroneously sued Atlantis as a corporate entity. As a result, the fraud claim against Sass was the only claim submitted to the jury. It found Sass liable for fraud, and awarded damages to Andrew in the amount of $28,797.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">This appeal followed, in which Sass presents one question for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">Did appellee Andrew present evidence legally sufficient to support her claim of fraud in the inducement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">On December o, 2000, appellee filed a nine-count complaint against Atlantis, Sass, Innerstate, and Mell in connection with a contract to construct a two-story addition to the home of her daughter and son-in-law. Andrew sued Atlantis for breach of contract (Count I); fraud (Count II); and negligence (Count III). In Count VIII, captioned \u201cFraud,\u201d Andrew sued Sass individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">In her complaint, Andrew alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that at a meeting with Mell in August 1999, Mell introduced Sass as his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u201cbusiness partner.\u201d Further, appellee alleged that on August 31, 1999, in the presence of Mell and appellant, Andrew entered into a \u201cContractor Agreement\u201d (the \u201cContract\u201d), \u201cbased upon the representation that both Mr. Sass and Mr. Mell would be building the addition on her home.\u201d In addition, Andrew averred that Sass \u201cfalsely represented to [appel-lee] that all work he contracted to perform would be completed by October, 1999 and that the work would conform to industry standards.\u201d Appellee further alleged that, by mid December 1999, the defendants had abandoned the project. According to Andrew, appellant\u2019s \u201cmisrepresentation intentionally defrauded [appellee,] who relied on the misrepresentation when it [sic] entered into the contract with Mr. Sass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">At trial, prior to opening statements, the court informed the jury as to the burden of proof required in both the breach of contract and fraud claims. As to fraud, the judge stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">In this case, the Plaintiff has made an allegation of fraud against [Atlantis] and [appellant]. A party who contends fraud on the part of another has the burden of proving the claim by clear and convincing evidence. This is a higher standard than preponderance of evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Andrew was the only witness for her case. She related that in 1999, when she was sixty-four years old, she experienced financial and medical problems. As a result, she decided that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford to keep [her] home anymore.\u201d Instead, appellee planned to sell her house and build an- addition to the home of her daughter and son-in-law in Pasadena, where she would also live. She intended to use her life savings of $50,000 to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">At about the time that appellee sought estimates for construction of the addition, she received a flyer in the mail from Innerstate. Thereafter, she met with Mell, President of In-nerstate. According to appellee, on two occasions in August 1999, when she met with Mell, he was accompanied by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Appellee understood that if she signed a contract with Mell by August 31, 1999, she would receive a fifteen percent discount. Accordingly, appellee paid a good faith deposit of $100 to Mell on August 4, 1999, and agreed to pay one-third of the Contract price upon execution of the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The following testimony is pertinent with regard to appel-lee\u2019s initial contact with Sass:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Ms. Andrew did there come a time where you met [appellant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">[APPELLEE]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And when was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADb\">[APPELLEE]: The first time was at my home on 170 West \u2022 Meadow Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And can you tell the Court what happened during that meeting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">[APPELLEE]: Mr. Stanley Mell and [appellant], they came to my home. And I had talked to Mr. Mell about, you know, the\u2014what I had basically wanted in my addition. And, [appellant] was there and it was <em>basically\u2014I had no conversation with Mr. Sass.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">Further, Andrew testified that on August 31, 1999, she again met with both Mell and appellant at her home. Although the parties dispute what occurred during that meeting, it is clear that on that date appellee executed the Contract, which is on a form bearing the name \u201cAtlantis Painting and Decorating Company.\u201d The Contract, admitted as an exhibit, purportedly bears three signatures: that of Andrew as \u201cOwner\u201d; \u201cCarroll Sass MHIC 15381\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as \u201cContractor\u201d; and \u201cStan Mell\u201d as \u201cWitness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">According to Andrew, both Mell and Sass were present when she signed the Contract. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Can you tell the Court what happened during that meeting [on August 31, 1999]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">[APPELLEE]: Basically, Mr. Mell and [appellant] came in and said hello. And then Mr. Stanley Mell put his briefcase on the dining room table. And pulled out the contract. And we sat at the dining room table. And he moved the contract over towards me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">And I said that I had to go get the cashier\u2019s check. And I got up from the table and I walked into the other room to get the check. And when I come back, he pushed the contract towards me and he said that it had already been signed. That all I needed to do was sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And where was [appellant] during this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">[APPELLEE]: He was sitting to the side of Mr. Stanley Mell, on my left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Were you all in the same room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">[APPELLEE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">In conjunction with signing the Contract, appellee tendered a cashier\u2019s check in the amount of $15,386.67 to Mell. Although Andrew believed she was entering into a Contract with In-nerstate, \u201c[represented by Stan Mell,\u201d it was also her \u201cunderstanding\u201d that Mell and Sass \u201cwere partners.\u201d Moreover, appellee stated that she was aware that Mell did not have a MHIC license, but that appellant had the requisite license.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">Appellee acknowledged that she did not read the Contract prior to signing it. Moreover, it was not until Mell and appellant left appellee\u2019s home that she noticed for the \u201cfirst time\u201d that the \u201ctop of the contract\u201d said Atlantis Painting and Decorating Company, not Innerstate, and that appellant had signed the Contract as the Contractor. With regard to Atlantis, Andrew testified that she had \u201cno idea who that was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">Under the terms of the Contract, appellee agreed to pay a total of $46,200 for the construction of the addition. Andrew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>was to pay the remaining balance as various stages of the construction were completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The Contract does not contain specifics as to what work was to be performed. Although the Contract refers to drawings, they were not produced at trial, because appellee claimed she did not have any copies. The Contract provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As3\">ARTICLE 1. SCOPE OF WORK</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">The contractor shall furnish all of the materials and perform all of the work shown on the drawings and/or described in the specifications ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">ARTICLE 2. TIME OF COMPLETION (\u201cContingent upon Permit Approval\u201d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">The work to be performed under this Contract shall be commenced on or before September] 10th, 1999 and shall be substantially completed on or before October 9, 1999. Time is of the essence....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">ARTICLE 3.

Contractor shall not be liable for any delay due to circumstances beyond its control....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">13. Contractor warrants all work for a period of [blank] months following completion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Because permits were required for construction, the project did not get under way until early November 1999. In the meantime, after appellee signed the Contract, a representative of Innerstate took her to several places to select various materials for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">With regard to the project, it is undisputed that the cement foundation was laid and framing for the structure began. According to appellee, Sass worked on the framing. Appellee acknowledged that the project was \u201cgoing along pretty good.\u201d Therefore, on December 11,1999, she tendered a second check to Mell, in the amount of $7,693. Appellee claimed that, just a few days later, \u201cthey stopped coming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">When the work stopped, Andrew called Mell; he said \u201cthey would be back.\u201d But, she said that \u201c[n]o one else came back.\u201d Appellee then contacted appellant, expressing concern about protecting the project from inclement weather. She wanted \u201ca roof on the addition,\u201d because \u201cthe snow was getting in.\u201d Appellant told Andrew that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have the money,\u201d but that he could \u201cprobably come up and put a tarp on it.\u201d Sass never returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">Without the benefit of any protective covering, snow fell on the structure. According to appellee, \u201call of the wood\u201d got \u201cwet.\u201d Appellee claimed that water was \u201claying on the ce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ment floor\u201d and \u201cthe wood [was] laying around.\u201d When further attempts to contact Mell proved fruitless, appellee hired other contractors, including Razorback Builders, to do roofing work, for which she paid $3,625 in February 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In total, appellee expended $28,878.94 in payments to other contractors for roofing work, electrical wiring, the installation of shingles, windows, the addition of doors, a garage door, and siding work. Eventually, appellee exhausted her financial resources and was not able to complete the addition.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">On cross-examination, appellee acknowledged that, before executing the Contract, her contacts were with Mell, not Sass. The following colloquy is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And for whatever reason, you did, in fact, decide to go with Innerstate Design Builders, Inc. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">[APPELLEE]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Atlantis Painting and Decorating, Inc., one of the Defendants in this case, they never gave you an estimate to do the job, did they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALW\">[APPELLEE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Carroll Sass, the Defendant to my right, he never gave you an estimate to do the job, did he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">[APPELLEE]: No, he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Atlantis Painting and Decorating, Inc. never did any architectural drawings for the project, did they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-13\">[APPELLEE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Carroll Sass never presented you with any architectural drawings to do the project. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-15\">[APPELLEE]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-16\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And, during that period of time when you were still considering as to whether or not to go forth with the contract, Mr. Stan Mell approached you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>and stated that if, in fact, you entered into a contract by August 31st, there would be a certain discount. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuZ\">[APPELLEE]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Moreover, appellee conceded that she had no relationship with Sass when she paid her initial deposit of $100 to Mell. The following testimony during cross-examination is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And, upon that conversation, you gave him [i.e., Mell] $100.00 in cash earnest money to say that you were going forth with the contract. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">[APPELLEE]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And certainly at that time, you had absolutely no idea of a company named Atlantis Painting and Decorating Company, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ags-dedup-0\">[APPELLEE]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And in fact, at that time you didn\u2019t know Mr. Sass either. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">[APPELLEE]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And after giving Mr. Mell that $100, there were a couple of other meetings and then eventually, Mr. Mell met with you and in addition, Mr. Carroll Sass was there on August 31st at the house at 4008 Mountain Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-12\">[APPELLEE]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And at that time you certainly felt that you were entering into a contract with Innerstate Design Builders, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-14\">[APPELLEE]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-15\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Represented by Stan Mell. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-16\">[APPELLEE]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">The colloquy set forth below is also illuminating as to Andrew\u2019s interaction with Sass:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-18\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The first time you ever heard of Atlantis Painting and Decorating Company was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>when you glanced over the contract that you had signed and that was after Mr. Mell and Mr. Sass had already left your house. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">[APPELLEE]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And on top of the contract you saw Atlantis Painting and Decorating Company and, again, you had no idea who that was. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq7\">[APPELLEE]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Significantly, appellee never paid any money to Sass; she issued all of her checks to Mell. The following exchange is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Do you have any canceled checks that you paid Atlantis Painting and Decorating, Inc. for this project?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">[APPELLEE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: You paid them no money. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">[APPELLEE]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Do you have any cancelled checks that you paid Carroll Sass for this project?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKm\">[APPELLEE]: No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: You paid Mr. Carroll Sass no money for this project. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-13\">[APPELLEE]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">At the close of appellee\u2019s case, appellant moved for a \u201cdirected verdict.\u201d The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">Appellant was the only witness for the defense. His testimony differed markedly from appellee\u2019s in several important respects. Most notably, appellant testified that he did not enter into the Contract with appellee, and he denied that his signature appeared on the document. Moreover, Sass claimed that the actual Contract form was not one that Atlantis \u201cnormally uses\u201d for its contracts. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-16\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Now, on the bottom [of the Contract] is a signature that the [appellee] claims is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>your signature. Is that your signature there where it says contractor signature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir. I did not sign that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Okay. With regard to the form of that contract. Is that the form that Atlantis Painting and Decorating Company normally uses with regard to entering into a contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">[APPELLANT]: No, it isn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Appellant testified that for almost 25 years he has owned and operated Atlantis, an unincorporated \u201csole proprietorship.\u201d Claiming that he met Mell at a bar, Sass asserted that, in connection with Andrew\u2019s project, he was merely hired by Mell as a subcontractor to do the framing. Appellant maintained that he entered into an oral agreement with Mell to frame appellee\u2019s addition for \u201croughly\u201d $3,000. Moreover, Mell provided the materials. Although Mell paid appellant $2000, Sass explained that he ceased working on the job in December 1999, when Mell stopped paying him and \u201cthe materials stopped showing up on the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Appellant acknowledged that he had never done commercial framing work prior to Andrew\u2019s addition, although he had done framing work for himself. At one point, Sass said that, prior to his work on appellee\u2019s project, he had done work for Mell at Mell\u2019s office. Later, appellant said he had never done any work for Mell before the work in issue. The testimony below is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE]: [H]ow is it that you came to learn about this project?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">[APPELLANT]: He was going to go out and find some work. And he wanted me to give him a price on what I thought it would cost to do the framing work on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_c\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE]: Did he tell you that he had a prospect in Ms. Andrew and that he was trying to get her to sign a contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">[APPELLANT]: Well, he just, you know said, he was trying to get work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE]: Did he tell you how much he was charging Ms. Andrew for the work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">[APPELLANT]: I wasn\u2019t really paying attention to exactly what the numbers were. I was just\u2014he just showed me what the layout was and I tried to give him an estimate on what it would cost to frame it. And paint it and all. Put drywall in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE]: Now, you had never done framing before. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">[APPELLANT]: Well, I\u2019ve done some framing, ye[a]h,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Sass acknowledged that at one time he had a general contractor\u2019s license. Although Sass had a MHIC license at the relevant time, he said he did not know whether Mell had such a license. He insisted that he did not allow Mell to use his MHIC license number, but noted that his MHIC number \u201cwas on the side of [appellant\u2019s] truck.\u201d Sass also conceded that it would be a violation of the law to do home improvement work without a MHIC license.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Appellant admitted that he joined Mell \u201conce or twice\u201d in meeting appellee before the construction project began. He could not recall the exact dates, however. In addition, he conceded that he rode in Mell\u2019s truck when they went to appellee\u2019s house. But, Sass denied that he and Mell were partners. He also insisted: \u201cI didn\u2019t see the contract [when it was] signed [by appellee].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Further, appellant maintained that he often meets with owners and general contractors in order to \u201cgive them prices.\u201d The following colloquy during cross-examination is relevant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Were you at Ms. Andrew\u2019s house on August 31,1999?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-12\">[APPELLANT]: I couldn\u2019t tell you what day I was there. I can\u2019t remember that far back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-13\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Do you typically accompany a general contract [sic] to an owner\u2019s facility before actually doing work on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>[APPELLANT]: I do it all the time. I got other general contractors. I go give them prices all the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGqT\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: What other subcontractors on this particular project, Ms. Andrew\u2019s project, accompanied you to the project?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">[APPELLANT]: I didn\u2019t meet any of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Do you have any recollection at all about the meetings with Ms. Andrew?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">[APPELLANT]: Just vaguely what [Mell] told her how he was going to build it. Just basic stuff. Not no details.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMU\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: You heard Ms. Andrew\u2019s testimony that you were at the table at the time the contract was signed. Do you dispute that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">[APPELLANT]: I wasn\u2019t there when it was signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfK\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: You never recall seeing a contract on a table? Seeing her sign it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">[APPELLANT]: I seen some papers there. I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I didn\u2019t sit there and read them. Read over them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: While you were there, reading them did Ms.\u2014or not reading them, but not paying attention to them, did Ms. Andrew sign anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXU\">[APPELLANT]: I don\u2019t recall watch\u2014seeing nobody sign anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Mr. Sass, this is your company, is it not, Atlantis Painting and Decorating Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnK\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: All right. And, this is your MHIC license number is it not? 15381?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-13\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">Sass reiterated that the Contract does not contain his signature. When appellee\u2019s counsel asked, \u201cDo you know who signed this?\u201d, Sass responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I know I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Appellant did, however, testify as to the genuineness of his signature on his 1996 income tax return, his Answers to Interrogatories, and his Response to Request for Production of Documents. Those documents were then introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, defense counsel again moved for a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d as to both Atlantis and appellant. In regard to Atlantis, counsel argued: \u201cThere is absolutely no testimony whatsoever before this Court that any such corporation exists. And, in fact, the testimony from [appellant] is there was no such corporation. He has never been incorporated.\u201d As to Sass, appellant\u2019s attorney observed that Andrew \u201cfelt that she was entering into a contract with Innerstate ... [and] with Mr. Stan Mell.... That is who she paid... . \u201d Defense counsel also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">[T]here is absolutely no testimony from the Plaintiff that she had any contractual relationship with Carroll Sass. Her testimony is that she again entered into a contract with either Innerstate ... and/or Stan Mell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Appellee responded that Sass \u201cfalsely misrepresented to [her] that all work he contracted to perform would be completed by October, 1999 and that the work would conform to industry standards.\u201d Moreover, she claimed that appellant\u2019s \u201cmisrepresentation intentionally defrauded [appellee,] who relied on the misrepresentation when it [sic] entered into the contract with [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The trial court denied the motion for judgment as to appellant, but granted Atlantis\u2019s motion for judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">Atlantis having been sued as a corporation and defense being that there is no proof or evidence to support a judgment against Atlantis Painting and Decorating, Inc., a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>corporation. The Court is persuaded to grant that motion given the evidence before me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">After the court dismissed the claims against Atlantis, the fraud claim against Sass was the only remaining count. Andrew asked the court to instruct the jury as to negligent misrepresentation, but the court declined to do so, stating: \u201cI think that it is inappropriate to give the instruction on negligent misrepresentation. That is a separate tort. It hasn\u2019t been alleged. The focus of this case is whether [Sass] committed a fraud.\u201d Sass asked the court to instruct the jury as to fraud in the inducement, which the court agreed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In its instructions to the jury with respect to fraud, the court relied on Section 9:14 of the Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instructions (3d. ed. 1993) (\u201cMPJI\u201d), at 236, which defines \u201cFraud in the Inducement.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxC\">Now, fraud or fraudulent inducement means that a party has been led to enter into an agreement to his or her disadvantage as a result of deceit. Deceit means that the person entered the agreement based on the other party\u2019s willful non-disclosure or false representation of a material fact, which the other party had a duty to disclose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">A fact is material if under all the circumstances a reasonable person would attach importance to that fact in deciding whether to enter into the agreement or the person willfully not disclosing or making the material misrepresentation knows the other party with whom he or she is dealing probably will regard it as important in determining whether to enter into the agreement^ e]ven though a reasonable p\u00e9rson would not attach importance to it in determining whether to enter into the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Neither party noted any exceptions to the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">In closing, appellee\u2019s counsel suggested that appellant schemed with Mell to induce Andrew to sign the Contract. In furtherance of the scheme, according to appellee, Sass allowed Mell to use Sass\u2019s MHIC license number. We quote at length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>from the closing summations of counsel, because they help to elucidate the parties\u2019 respective theories of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Appellee\u2019s lawyer argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">Essentially, [appellant] will have you believe that he was duped just like Ms. Andrew was duped by Mr. Mell. But, you have to ask yourself what is wrong with this picture in light of all the evidence that you have heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">There are certain things that just don\u2019t add up. They don\u2019t make sense. They are not logical. And you need to look hard at the evidence and consider the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">Mr. Sass testified that he met Mr. Mell in a bar. He never met him before. Never did work for him before. He never did framing before. Nevertheless, he agreed to enter into a contract, a verbal contract, with Mr. Mell to do the framing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">He had no written contract with Mr. Mell or Innerstate. He didn\u2019t check into the background of Innerstate. He never tried to determine whether or not Innerstate had an MHIC license in order to do this work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">So, either Mr. Sass is an incredibly poor businessman. Or, as we submit, he was partners with Mr. Mell. Mr. Mell was going to do the design work because that was what he was, Innerstate Design.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">But he didn\u2019t have an MHIC license number. Maryland Home Improvement Commission, which you must have under the law in order to perform home improvements. So, they got together and they used Atlantis\u2019 MHIC license number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-12\">Now, Mr. Sass acknowledges that he went with Stan Mell to meet Ms. Andrew at her house. If not once, then twice.... He was there at the time the contract was signed. Certainly, that is the testimony of Ms. Andrew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-13\">He says he didn\u2019t see the contract signed. There were a lot of papers spread out on the table. He says he doesn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>remember there being anything signed. And he says he didn\u2019t sign the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">One thing you have to ask yourself is what was he doing there that early in the contract stage. Why was a subcontractor, who is only going to be doing the framing, there at Ms. Andrew\u2019s house, not once, but twice, before the contract was signed? And why weren\u2019t all the other subs there? Why not bring the roofer, or the plumber, or the electrician, or the concrete pourer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">He only had the framing, and, the painting, I guess, as well. So, I submit to you that this is further proof that they had an arrangement, again, where Mr. Mell would do the design and they would sign the contract under Atlantis, use their MHIC license, and do the construction, so that they would be operating within the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">Now, you have heard Ms. Andrew\u2019s testimony. Ms. Andrew says she met with Stan Mell a few times. She met Innerstate. She was candid about the fact that she didn\u2019t know really who Carroll Sass was. He just showed up a couple of times with Mr. Mell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">&gt;;: &gt;\u00a1\u00ed *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">Carroll Sass admits that he signed the answers to interrogatories. He admits that he signed the request for production of documents. He admits that he signed the income tax form as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">Compare that against the signature here on the contract. Obviously, you are the jury and you have to make that determination as to whether or not you think it is the same signature or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">But, one thing you have to ask yourself is if this is the first time he has met Mr. Mell, where did he get the ability\u2014where did he get a signature of Mr. Sass to copy? And how, did he do such a pretty good forgery, if, in fact, Mr. Mell was the one who signed it? I mean, these are questions that you have to take back there and make the determinations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>In summary, we believe that Mr. Sass induced Ms. Andrew into entering into this contract to build an addition on her house. Maybe, just maybe in the end, Mr. Sass\u2014or Mr. Sass was duped by Mr. Mell, as well. I have no idea whether or not he collected that money or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">Maybe he didn\u2019t get paid all he was supposed to get paid under the contract. But, clearly the evidence is clear and convincing that Mr. Sass induced Ms. Andrew to enter into this contract. And then ultimately, that contract was not fulfilled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">It is a tragic story. But you are here to decide the evidence today. And I think when you look at all the evidence and think about the stories that you have heard today, everyone\u2019s testimony, you will have no problem finding by a clear and convincing evidence, that Mr. Sass fraudulently induced Ms. Andrew to enter into this contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">In his closing argument, Sass\u2019s attorney focused on fraudulent inducement. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">The fact of the matter is, Ms. Andrew said that she had no intention, did not know that she was entering into a contract with Carroll Sass. That her dealing was, in fact, with Mr. Stan Mell and Innerstate Design and Builders, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">That, in fact, when she went down to pick out the various materials for the job, after signing the contract, that she went with the project manager from Innerstate Design and Builders, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">She testified that the foundation was done. The testimony is that the foundation was done by some contractor, but that contractor was not hired by Carroll Sass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">They would have you believe that my client is basically the general contractor on this job and that he was out hiring other people to complete the job. The electrician. My client didn\u2019t hire an electrician. The roofer. My client didn\u2019t hire a roofer. The masonry man, concrete man, the plumber. My client hired none of those people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>He did go to work on the project. His testimony is that he was a subcontractor for Stan Mell. That he met him in a bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">I don\u2019t have any doubt whatsoever that the contracts or estimates that the Plaintiff has introduced and the monies that she said she paid these various people was paid by the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">I have no doubt whatsoever. But there is a giant leap to say that that was necessitated because something had not been completed on the original contract. Because you don\u2019t have any testimony and/or evidence as to what was supposed to be completed in that original contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">There is no fraudulent inducement. There is absolutely nothing that Ms. Andrew stated saying to you that I entered into this contract because Mr. Sass told me this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">Mr. Sass told me that I am the best builder in Anne Arundel County. Mr. Sass told me that I was the best framer in Anne Arundel County. Mr. Sass told me I was the best drywall hanger, finisher or best painter in Anne Arundel County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">There is nothing. The dealing, again, from the Plaintiff, she stated, was with Mr. Stan Mell and Innerstate Designers and Builders, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">... But, she did testify that [she] sued Stan Mell. [She] sued Innerstate. And [she] got judgments against them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\"><em>* </em>:5\u00ab :\u00a1s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">The person who the Plaintiff should have gone after, she did. The person who should have been punished in this case, was punished. Was found guilty of a criminal act. In fact, of two criminal acts. And was incarcerated, sent to jail for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The person who caused the financial damage to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff got a judgment against. My client, again, did not enter into a contract with Ms. Andrew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">But the culprit, the person who caused that, was not Carroll Sass. The one remaining count for you to make a determination on as to whether [or] not there was sufficient clear and convincing evidence, unambiguous evidence that my client fraudulently induced Ms. Andrew to enter into a contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">Her testimony is that she didn\u2019t even know she was entering into a contract with anyone other than Stan Mell. I don\u2019t know how you can reach the conclusion that that was any type of fraudulent inducement from my client, Carroll Sass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">I believe the decision, if you set aside the sympathy for Ms. Andrew, clearly should be for the Defendant, Carroll Sass. Carroll Sass was taken by Mr. Stan Mell, the same as Ms. Andrew was. Carroll Sass was not a general contractor on this job. Carroll Sass hired no other subcontractors on this job. He was simply a subcontractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">In his rebuttal argument, appellee\u2019s counsel responded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">It is true, [appellee] didn\u2019t intend to enter into a contract with Atlantis. She was dealing with Stan Mell. And, although [appellant] came several times before the contract was signed, she admits that she thought that she was dealing with Innerstate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">But the fact is she entered into a contract with Atlantis. And we think we know the reasons why. She didn\u2019t know the reason at the time. And that is the nature of a fraud. You don\u2019t know what is going on at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">It is only later that it all becomes clear. And what was clear and what makes the most sense here is that Innerstate didn\u2019t have a MHIC license, couldn\u2019t do the construction themselves. They could go out and sale [sic] it. They could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>go out and design it. But they couldn\u2019t construct it or else they were going to run afoul of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">So they hook up with Atlantis, who has an MHIC license and they get to sign it on the Atlantis contract. It is the only thing that makes sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">[Appellee] testified that she thought they were partners. Why else was [appellant] there two or three times. Two times, one time, whatever it was before the contract was signed. She clearly was led to believe that they were partners. And that, you know, they were going to get this job done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">[S]he had a contract with Atlantis. And she believes that she was fraudulently induced into signing that contract by Mr. Sass. And that he should be as responsible as Mr. Mell is for the damages that she has incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The verdict sheet included the following question: \u201cDo you find by clear and convincing evidence that Defendant Carroll Sass defrauded Plaintiff Madonna Andrew?\u201d The jury found that appellant had defrauded appellee, and it awarded Andrew damages of $28,797.00. Thereafter, the court denied appellant\u2019s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, Motion for New Trial, and request for Remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">This case is rooted in appellant\u2019s failure to satisfy his contractual obligations. Distilled to its essence, we must determine whether appellee proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that appellant committed fraud in connection with the Contract. <em>See Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 353, 749 A.2d 174, <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 669, 755 A.2d 1140 (2000). In our analysis, we assume \u201cthe truth of all credible evidence and all inferences of fact reasonably deducible from the evidence .... \u201d <em>Huppman v. Tighe, </em>100 Md.App. 655, 663, 642 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>A.2d 309 (1994); <em>see Houston v.

Given that appellee\u2019s only claim against appellant sounded in common law fraud, the elements of a claim of fraud frame our analysis. In <em>Nails v. S &amp; R, Inc., </em>334 Md. 398, 415, 639 A.2d 660 (1994), the Court of Appeals summarized the elements of a cause of action for fraud or deceit. In order to prevail, a plaintiff must prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">1) that the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">2) that its falsity was either known to the defendant or that the representation was made with reckless indifference as to its truth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">3) that the misrepresentation was made for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">4) that the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation and had the right to rely on it; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">5) that the plaintiff suffered compensable injury resulting from the misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-11\"><em>See Maryland Environmental Trust v.

Therefore, concealment of a material fact constitutes fraud only if there is a duty of disclosure. <em>Impala Platinum, Ltd. v.

In his brief, Sass argues that Andrew did not present legally sufficient evidence at trial to establish her claim of \u201cfraudulent inducement.\u201d Appellee counters that she proved \u201cfraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">To be sure, appellee attempted to sue Sass for \u201cfraud,\u201d as that is the caption of the one count in the Complaint applicable to Sass. And, it is clear that the court below recognized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>fraud claim because, in its preliminary instructions to the jury, the court told the jury that Andrew \u201cmade an allegation of fraud____\u201d On the other hand, in its final jury instructions, the court never advised that jury as to the traditional elements of fraud; it referred briefly to \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201cfraudulent inducement,\u201d and \u201cdeceit.\u201d As noted, neither side objected to the jury instructions. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-520(e).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The crux of appellant\u2019s position is that there is a critical distinction between fraud and fraud in the inducement. He contends that only the claim of fraudulent inducement is at issue here, and argues that appellee never proved her claim of fraud in the inducement. To support his position that the jury was asked only to decide a fraudulent inducement claim, Sass seems to rely on the content of the court\u2019s jury instructions. Sass asserts: \u201cIn the absence of any objection to the failure to give a fraud instruction and the absence of any cross appeal, any claim that Count VIII was a claim for fraud, rather than fraudulent inducement, has been waived by Appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">As we see it, appellant\u2019s position ignores that the parties and the court used the terms \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cfraudulent inducement\u201d interchangeably. Moreover, appellant seems to overlook that Count VIII was captioned \u201cFraud\u201d; the court advised the jury about \u201cfraud\u201d in both its opening and closing instructions; and, without objection, the jury was asked on the verdict sheet to decide whether Sass \u201cdefrauded\u201d Andrew.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Moreover, fraud in the inducement is a subspecies of fraud. Therefore, appellant\u2019s effort to distinguish the two does not advance his contention that he is not liable based on the theory of fraudulent inducement. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u201cFraud encompasses, among other things, theories of fraudulent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, and fraudulent inducement.\u201d <em>Iverson v.

It is the tortious conduct which conversely induces the innocent party to enter into the contractual relationship.\u201d). <em>Councill v. Sun Ins. Office, </em>146 Md. 137, 126 A. 229 (1924), is instructive in demonstrating that fraudulent inducement is simply a means of committing fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In <em>Councill, </em>the Court of Appeals recognized that there are instances when the evidence in a particular case may give rise to an inference of fraudulent conduct; a promise made to induce another to execute a contract, which the promisor never intended to perform, may create liability for fraud. The <em>Councill </em>Court said: \u201c[A] false promise, not intended to be performed, but made to trick and deceive another into the execution of a written instrument, is a fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 126 A. 229. Further, the Court said, at <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">It is true that in a sense a promise to do some act or refrain from some act in the future may establish a merely contractual relation, but where it is made with a fraudulent design to induce the promisee to do something he would not otherwise have done, it is more than that, it is a misrepresentation of the promisor\u2019s state of mind, which may be, and in a case such as that before us is, a very material thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Accordingly, we are satisfied that appellee alleged fraud, sought to prove fraud, and the jury was asked to decide if appellant committed fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The question remains as to whether appellee produced evidence that was legally sufficient to support a finding that appellant committed fraud, whether by way of fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>inducement or some other fraudulent conduct. In this regard, <em>Wrexham Aviation, </em>350 Md. 693, 715 A.2d 188, is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In <em>Wrexham, </em>the appellants challenged, <em>inter alia, </em>the award of compensatory damages for fraud, claiming that \u201cthere was insufficient evidence for submission of the tort count to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702, 715 A.2d 188. According to the Court of Appeals, the \u201cdispositive issue\u201d on appeal was the ' question of \u201cwhether there was sufficient evidence of fraud for the case to have been submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695, 715 A.2d 188. The Court determined that the evidence as to fraud was legally insufficient to justify submission of that claim to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 703, 715 A.2d 188. In reaching its conclusion, the Court was mindful of the clear and convincing standard of proof applicable to fraud claims. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">Our review of the record convinces us, particularly in light of the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard of proof, that there was insufficient evidence of either the knowledge element or the intent to deceive element for the tort count to have been submitted to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 706, 715 A.2d 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Although a fraud claim must be proved by clear and convincing evidence, <em>Wrexham Aviation, </em>350 Md. at 704, 715 A.2d 188; <em>McGraw, </em>124 Md.App. at 585, 723 A.2d 502, a recent opinion of this Court pointed out that the clear and convincing standard of proof pertains only to the burden of persuasion, not the burden of production. <em>See Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Borzym, </em>150 Md.App. 18, 53, 818 A.2d 1159, <em>cert. granted, </em>376 Md. 49, 827 A.2d 112 (2003). Writing for the Court in <em>Darcars, </em>Judge Moylan explained that \u201c[tjhere is no correlation between the burden of persuasion and the burden of production.\u201d Further, he wrote: \u201cPersuasion involves convincing a jury, as a matter of fact, to varying levels of certainty.\u201d Put another way, the burden of persuasion \u201cis simply a verbal formula by which the law attempts to communicate to lay jurors some sense as to the degree of certainty they should feel before returning various types of verdicts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, 818 A.2d 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The <em>Darcars </em>Court observed that the burden of production, which is central to the analysis of legal sufficiency, \u201cdoes not fluctuate with fluctuations in the burden of persuasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Court explained, the burden of production \u201chas nothing to do with whether evidence should be believed. Its concern is with the logical pertinence of evidence, if believed, validly to establish a required conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis in <em>Dar-cars ). </em>The <em>Darcars </em>Court added: \u201cThe <em>prima facie </em>or legally sufficient case requires some competent evidence, which, if believed and given maximum weight, would establish all of the required legal elements of the tort----\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis in Darcars).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">We recognize that the Court of Appeals recently granted <em>certiorari </em>in <em>Darcars </em>to consider the following issue: \u201cDoes the clear and convincing burden of proof applicable to punitive damages claims bear on the trial court\u2019s legal determination of the sufficiency of the evidence to support those claims?\u201d Nevertheless, based on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Darcars, </em>which says that the clear and convincing standard is <em>not </em>applicable to a review of legal sufficiency in a fraud case, we shall assume that Andrew merely had to satisfy the threshold burden of production in order for her fraud case to proceed to the jury. Certainly, an analysis under the lesser standard inures to appellee\u2019s benefit. But, if appellee cannot satisfy a minimum burden of production, she obviously cannot meet the higher burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">When we analyze the evidence under the burden of production standard, we conclude that Andrew failed to satisfy that burden. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">To support appellant\u2019s contention that Andrew failed to prove fraudulent inducement, appellant points to Andrew\u2019s own testimony, in which she admitted that she never relied on any representations made by Sass. Further, Sass maintains that \u201ca promise to complete construction by a certain date cannot support an action for fraud, because it is a promise of a future event,\u201d and \u201c[f]raud cannot be predicated on statements which are merely promissory in nature.... \u201d In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>appellant states that, prior to Andrew\u2019s execution of the Contract, there was no evidence that he made any statements regarding \u201cthe quality of work.\u201d According to appellant, the Contract itself includes terms about completion and the quality of work, and appellee should have sought to remedy any unfulfilled promises by a breach of contract action, not a claim for fraudulent inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">As we see it, appellee\u2019s argument as to fraud divides along two paths: 1) Andrew claims that, when appellant executed the Contract, he had no intention of performing the underlying contractual obligations; and 2) appellant misrepresented his own identity, in that he knew Andrew thought she was contracting with Mell, yet Sass was the actual contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Thus, a central premise of appellee\u2019s fraud claim is her contention that appellant executed the Contract without the present intention to perform. Appellee states: \u201cAppellant admitted that he never intended to fulfill the terms set forth in the Contractor Agreement.\u201d Asserting that \u201cpromises made with a present intention not to perform them\u201d amount to fraud, appellee contends that \u201c[a]ppellant\u2019s willful non-disclosure of the fact that he was executing a Contractor Agreement as the Contractor which he had no intentions of performing, is actionable fraud under Maryland law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In addition, appellee maintains that Sass knew \u201cshe believed that she was doing business with Mell and his company, Innerstate,\u201d yet he \u201cnever disclosed\u201d that he was the actual contractor. She asserts: \u201c[Sass] further testified that he was not, and never intended to be, the Contractor on the project, although Mell was not a licensed contractor.\u201d Appellee theorizes that because Mell did not have an MHIC license, Sass made his own license available to Mell. In appellee\u2019s view, she was induced by appellant\u2019s conduct to enter the Contract, because Sass \u201callow[ed] her to negotiate strictly, with Mell and to execute the contract with the belief that she was entering into an agreement with Mell and Innerstate, when Mell ... was unable legally to enter into a Contractor Agreement with the Appellee or the Contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>We first address appellee\u2019s contention that appellant never intended to perform the Contract. We agree with Andrew that Maryland law recognizes \u201ca cause of action for fraud predicated upon a promise made with a present intention not to perform it.\u201d <em>Finch, </em>57 Md.App. at 232, 469 A.2d 867; <em>see Sims v. Ryland Group, Inc., </em>37 Md.App. 470, 472, 378 A.2d 1 (1977); MPJI \u00a7 11:3, at 319 (\u201cA defendant\u2019s promise to do something may be a false representation if the defendant did not intend to do the promised act when the promise was made.\u201d). Indeed, the Court of Appeals has held that a \u201cdefendant\u2019s deliberate misrepresentation of his existing intentions, where the misrepresentation was material to the transaction giving rise to the alleged fraud, may form the basis for an action in fraud or deceit.\u201d <em>Alleco, </em>340 Md. at 197, 665 A.2d 1038; <em>see Gross, </em>332 Md. at 258, 630 A.2d 1156 (\u201cmaking a promise as to a matter material to the bargain with no intention to fulfill it is an actionable fraud\u201d); <em>Tufts v. Poore, </em>219 Md. 1, 12, 147 A.2d 717 (1959)(\u201cThe gist of the fraud in such cases is ... the fraudulent intent of the promisor, the false representation of an existing intention to perform where such intent is in fact non-existent.... \u201d); <em>Councill, </em>146 Md. at 150, 126 A. 229 (recognizing that a promise made without the intention to perform, but with intent to induce the promisee to act, may constitute fraud); <em>Bocchini v. Gorn Management Co., </em>69 Md.App. 1, 19, 515 A.2d 1179 (1986) (recognizing that a \u201c \u2018promissory representation made with an existing intention not to perform is actionable for fraud,\u2019 i.e., that such a representation is regarded as one of present fact father than of future possibility.\u201d) (citation omitted). .</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Although Sass insisted that he never executed the Contract, that assertion carries no weight on appeal. It was the jury\u2019s responsibility to assess Sass\u2019s credibility and resolve the factual dispute as to whether appellant signed the Contract. <em>See Gerald v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 295, 302, 768 A.2d 140, <em>cert. denied, </em>364 Md. 462, 773 A.2d 514 (2001). In this endeavor, the trier of fact may determine the genuineness of a writing without the aid of an expert. <em>Parker v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 611, 616-17, 280 A.2d 29 (1971); <em>see also DiPietro v. State, </em>31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Md.App. 392, 397, 356 A.2d 599 (1976)(noting that an authentic writing need not already be in evidence). Maryland Code (1998 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-906 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d) provides: \u201cEvidence of a disputed writing is admissible and may be submitted to the trier of the facts for its determination as to genuineness.\u201d The jury had several documents containing appellant\u2019s known signatures, which were available for its use to compare with appellant\u2019s purported signature on the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s vigorous protestations, it is apparent that, in reaching its verdict, the jury rejected Sass\u2019s claim that he did not execute the Contract. That finding is not clearly erroneous. Therefore, our consideration of the issues raised in this appeal must take into account the jury\u2019s implicit finding that appellant, not Mell, executed the Contract as the Contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Even if Sass signed the Contract, however, we fail to grasp from that finding how Sass\u2019s conduct evidenced that he never intended to perform the Contract when he executed it. Indeed, we have searched the citations in the record extract identified by appellee in support of her repeated assertions that appellant admitted he never intended to perform the Contract when he signed it; we have found no such admissions by Sass.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Nor do we believe that appellant\u2019s conduct gave rise to a reasonable inference that he never intended to perform the Contract when he signed it. Proof by clear and convincing evidence requires more than the kind of surmise and conjecture on which Andrew relies. <em>See First Nat\u2019l Bank v. U.S.F. &amp; G. Co., </em>275 Md. 400, 411, 340 A.2d 275 (1975) (\u201cWhen fraud ... is imputed, something more than a mere preponderance of evidence must be produced.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Sass\u2019s failure to fully perform the Contract may well have amounted to a breach of the Contract. But, Andrew\u2019s position that Sass never intended to perform the Contract is belied by her undisputed testimony as to appellant\u2019s conduct; appellant took substantial action in furtherance of the Contract. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>cording to Andrew, the project was \u201cgoing along pretty good\u201d and, as appellee acknowledged, Sass personally completed some of the framing at the job site. Indeed, so much work had been done that Andrew tendered a second payment to Mell. Sass\u2019s part performance was inconsistent with Andrew\u2019s contention that, when Sass executed the Contract, he never intended to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">As asserted in appellee\u2019s Complaint, Andrew also claimed that appellant \u201cfalsely misrepresented\u201d that \u201call work he contracted to perform would be completed by October, 1999 and that the work would conform to industry standards.\u201d Further, she claimed that appellant\u2019s \u201cfraudulent failure to perform under the terms of the contract\u201d caused her to incur damages. Both parties agree, however, that \u201cfraud cannot be predicated on statements which are merely promissory in nature, or upon expressions as to what will happen in the future.\u201d <em>Levin v. Singer, </em>227 Md. 47, 63, 175 A.2d 423 (1961); <em>see Miller v. Fairchild Industries, Inc., </em>97 Md.App. 324, 342, 629 A.2d 1293, <em>cert. denied, </em>333 Md. 172, 634 A.2d 46 (1993); <em>Travel Committee v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 123, 179, 603 A.2d 1301, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 525, 610 A.2d 797 (1992). In <em>Appel v. Hupfield, </em>198 Md. 374, 379, 84 A.2d 94 (1951), the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">Ordinarily fraud cannot be predicated on statements which are promissory in their nature, and therefore an action for deceit will not lie for the unfulfillment of promises or the failure of future events to materialize as predicted. Failure to fulfill a promise is merely a breach of contract, which must be enforced, if at all, by an action <em>ex contractu.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">As noted, appellee also bases her fraud claim on appellant\u2019s failure to disclose that he, not Mell, was the contracting party. Appellee alleges that \u201cshe believed that she was doing business with Mell and his company, Innerstate,\u201d and appellant \u201cnever disclosed\u201d that he was really the contractor. Therefore, appellee maintains that appellant defrauded her \u201cby allowing her to negotiate strictly with Mell and to execute the contract with the belief that she was entering into an agreement with Mell and Innerstate, when Mell ... was unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>legally to enter into a Contractor Agreement with the Appel-lee or the Contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The evidence before the jury may well have supported an inference that appellant allowed Mell to use Sass\u2019s name and MHIC license number, because Mell did not have one. But, there was no evidence that Sass made any express assertions to appellee that it was Mell who was the contracting party or that he (Sass) was not the contracting party. Indeed, appellee admitted that, at the time of Contract formation, she never spoke with appellant. Clearly, then, Sass made no affirmative misrepresentations by Andrew on which Andrew relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Instead, appellee apparently proceeded on the theory that Sass had a duty to disclose his identity or role in regard to the Contract. In effect, she suggests that appellant had a duty to <em>correct </em>appellee\u2019s misunderstanding as to the identity of the contractor, because the identity was a material fact. Andrew had to show that Sass intentionally concealed his role in order to induce Andrew to act, and that, because of the concealment, Andrew acted in a manner \u201cdifferent from how ... she would have acted\u201d had she known the truth. <em>See </em>MPJI \u00a7 11:2, at 317 (discussing elements of non-disclosure or concealment); <em>see also Lubore v. RPM Associates, Inc., </em>109 Md.App. 312, 329, 674 A.2d 547, <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 565, 683 A.2d 177 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">In assessing appellant\u2019s failure to disclose that he was the actual contractor, we focus on what the jury could reasonably conclude about appellant\u2019s culpability in regard to appellee\u2019s mistaken belief that she was contracting with Mell. As we indicated, \u201cMaryland recognizes no general duty upon a party to a transaction to disclose facts to the other party.\u201d <em>Gaynor, </em>370 Md. at 97, 803 A.2d 512; <em>see Fegeas v. Sherrill, </em>218 Md. 472, 476, 147 A.2d 223 (1958). The Court of Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANN\">While it is not necessary to produce proof of wrongful conduct in order to succeed in establishing constructive fraud that justifies the rescission of a contract, a plaintiff still must show the \u201cbreach of a legal or equitable duty which, irrespective of the moral guilt of the fraud feasor, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>law declares fraudulent because of its tendency to deceive others, to violate public or private confidence, or to injure public interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><em>Gaynor, </em>370 Md. at 97, 803 A.2d 512 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Appellee testified that she had no conversations with Sass before she signed the Contract, nor did she have any idea that she was contracting with him. Rather, she testified that she believed she was contracting with Mell and Innerstate. It was only <em>after </em>appellee signed the Contract, and after Sass and Mell left her home, that appellee realized that appellant, not Mell, had signed the document, and that it was on an Atlantis form. Clearly, then, appellant\u2019s execution of the Contract could not have been an inducement for Andrew to sign the Contract because, according to appellee, the Contract had already been signed when she signed it, and Andrew only discovered that Sass was the one who signed it as the contractor <em>after </em>he and Mell left her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">It is also significant that appellee would have discovered appellant\u2019s role had she timely read the Contract. Because Andrew never read the Contract before signing it, however, she was unaware that it had been signed by Sass on an Atlantis form.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">A misrepresentation is generally immaterial if the party to whom it is made reasonably could have ascertained the true facts. <em>See Carozza v. Peacock Land Corp., </em>231 Md. 112, 121, 188 A.2d 917 (1963). And, ordinarily, \u201ca person who executes a document is legally obligated to read it before executing it.\u201d <em>Benjamin v. Erk, </em>138 Md.App. 459, 481, 771 A.2d 1106, <em>cert. denied, </em>364 Md. 461, 773 A.2d 513 (2001). As we recognized in <em>Holzman v. Fiola Blum, Inc., </em>125 Md.App. 602, 629, 726 A.2d 818 (1999), \u201c \u2018[o]ne is under a duty to learn the contents of a contract before signing it; if, in the absence of fraud, duress, undue influence, and the like he fails to do so, he is presumed to know the contents....\u2019\u201d (Citation omitted). <em>See Kolker v. Gorn, </em>202 Md. 322, 331, 96 A.2d 475 (1953) (recognizing that fraud may excuse a failure to uncover the true facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The fourth element of a fraud claim requires proof that \u201cthe plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation and had the right to rely on it.\u201d <em>Nails, </em>334 Md. at 415, 639 A.2d 660. In determining if reliance is reasonable, a court is required to \u201c View the act in its setting, which will include the implications and promptings of usage and fair dealing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Giant Food v. Ice King, </em>74 Md.App. 183, 192, 536 A2d 1182, <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 7, 542 A.2d 844 (1988) (citation omitted). A strict \u201cbut for\u201d analysis is not the exclusive test for the \u201creliance element\u201d in a fraud claim, however. <em>Nails, </em>334 Md. at 416, 639 A.2d 660. As the Court recognized in <em>Nails, </em>\u201cthe misrepresentation need not have been the only motivation for the plaintiffs actions; it is sufficient that the misrepresentation substantially induced the plaintiff to act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416-17, 639 A.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Under the facts attendant here, we conclude that it was unreasonable for the jury to determine that appellee relied on Sass\u2019s express or implied representations as to the identity of the contractor. In this regard, it is undisputed that Sass made no affirmative misrepresentations to Andrew; appellant\u2019s name was clearly disclosed on the Contract when appel-lee signed it; appellee conceded that she never looked at the Contract until <em>after </em>Sass and Mell left her home; appellee would have seen the names of Sass and Atlantis if she had looked at the Contract; and appellee made no claim that she was coerced into signing the Contract without reading it. Appellant\u2019s actions simply do not amount to clear and convincing evidence of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In sum, from the evidence before the jury, it could have reasonably concluded that appellant entered into the Contract with Andrew and that he breached it. But, there was insufficient evidence to establish that Sass never intended to perform or that appellee relied on appellant\u2019s representations as to the identity of the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-13\">.
