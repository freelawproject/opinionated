Workers\u2019 Compensation Board, Respondent.</parties>\n<citation data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"A6K\">[737 NYS2d 161]</citation>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"parties\" id=\"A3Ko\">Appeal from a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board, filed November 3, 2000, which ruled that claimant\u2019s lung disease was not causally related to his employment and denied his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AJFg\">Mercure, J.P.</author>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Claimant, who worked as a porter-cleaner at a public school for 18 years, underwent a pneumonectomy for lung cancer in 1989 and has been disabled ever since. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board concluded that his disabling lung condition was not causally related to his employment and he appeals from the Board\u2019s decision, claiming that the evidence demonstrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>the necessary link between his disease and his employment. We affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\">In addition to the lung cancer, the diagnosis by claimant\u2019s treating physician included asbestosis, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, all of which he opined were causally related to claimant\u2019s exposure to asbestos, coal dust and soot during his employment. The employer\u2019s expert, in contrast, concluded that the only conditions suffered by claimant were the lung cancer and emphysema, both of which were caused by claimant\u2019s heavy cigarette smoking and not by his employment. The impartial specialist\u2019s report essentially agreed with the conclusion reached by the carrier\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Although the impartial specialist testified that it was theoretically possible for exposure to asbestos, coal dust and soot to cause or contribute to lung cancer, he also testified that the likelihood that claimant\u2019s condition was caused by anything other than cigarette smoking was minimal. Read as a whole, it is reasonably apparent that the impartial specialist\u2019s testimony was meant to signify a probability as to the cause, which is all the certainty that is required of an expert\u2019s opinion in workers\u2019 compensation cases, provided that the opinion is supported by a rational basis <em>(see, Matter of Van Patten v Quandt\u2019s Wholesale Distribs., </em>198 AD2d 539), as it is here. The opinions of the impartial specialist and the carrier\u2019s expert provide substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision, despite the contrary opinion expressed by claimant\u2019s treating physician, for \u201cthis case involves the very type of conflict in medical opinion that is within the province of the Board to resolve, particularly where, as here, the Board has to determine whether the medical evidence establishes causality\u201d <em>(Matter of Altes v Petrocelli Elec. Co., </em>283 AD2d 829, 830). Accordingly, the Board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Crew III, Spain, Carpinello and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the decision is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
