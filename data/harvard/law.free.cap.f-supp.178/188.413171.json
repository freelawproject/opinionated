Three of the leading cases are: Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971; Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101, 65 S.Ct. 152, 89 L.Ed. 101; and Albertson v. Millard, 345 U.S. 242, 73 S.Ct. 600, 97 L.Ed. 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin, the Supreme Court said (at page 105 of 323 U.S., at page 154 of 65 S.Ct.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201cIf there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality\u2014 here the distribution of the taxing power as between the State and the Nation \u2014 unless such adjudication is unavoidable. And so, as questions of federal constitutional power have become more and more intertwined with preliminary doubts about local law, we have insisted that federal courts do not decide questions of constitutionality on the basis of preliminary guesses regarding local law. Railroad Commission [of Texas] v. Pullman Co., supra [312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971]; City of Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, 316 U.S. 168, 62 S.Ct. 986, 86 L.Ed. 1355; In re Central R. Co. of New Jersey, 3 Cir., 136 F.2d 633. See also Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424; Meredith v. [City of] Winter Haven, 320 U.S. 228, 235, 64 S.Ct. 7, 11 [88 L.Ed. 9]; Green v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 8 Cir., 119 F.2d 466; Findley v. Odland, 6 Cir., 127 F.2d 948; United States v. 150.29 Acres of Land, 7 Cir., 135 F.2d 878. Avoidance of such guesswork, by holding the litigation in the federal courts until definite determinations on local law are made by the state courts, merely heeds this time-honored canon of constitutional adjudication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">In Albertson v. Millard, which involved the Michigan Communist Control Bill, requiring a registration of Communists, the Communist Party, and Communist front organizations, a three-judge District Court ruled upon the constitutionality of the Act. The Supreme Court said (at pages 244-245 of 345 U.S., at page 602 of 73 S.Ct.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-12\">\u201cInterpretation of state legislation is primarily the function of state authorities, judicial and administrative. The construction given to a state statute by the state courts is binding upon federal courts. There has been no interpretation of this statute by the state courts. The absence of such construction stems from the fact this action in federal court was commenced only five days after the statute became law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-13\">\u201cThere is pending in the Circuit Court for Wayne County, Michigan, a bill seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act is unconstitutional, both on federal and state grounds. That action is being held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>in abeyance pending our mandate and decision in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">\u201cWe deem it appropriate in this case that the state courts construe this statute before the District Court further considers the action. See Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 1947, 331 U.S. 549, 67 S.Ct. 1409, 91 L.Ed. 1666; American Federation of Labor v. Watson, 1946, 327 U.S. 582, 66 S.Ct. 761, 90 L.Ed. 873; and Spector Motor Service v. McLaughlin, 1944, 323 U.S. 101, 65 S.Ct. 152, 89 L.Ed. 101.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\u201cThe judgment is vacated and the cause remanded to the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan with directions to vacate the restraining order it issued and to hold the proceedings in abeyance a reasonable time pending construction of the statute by the state courts either in pending litigation or other litigation which may be instituted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The most recent case in the Supreme \u25a0 Court appears to be Government and Civic Employees Organizing Committee, C.I.O. v. Windsor, 353 U.S. 364, 77 S.Ct. 838, 1 L.Ed.2d 894. The Supreme Court said on page 366 of 353 U.S., on page 839 of 77 S.Ct.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">\u201cWe do not reach the constitutional issues. In an action brought to restrain the enforcement of a state statute on constitutional grounds, the federal court should retain jurisdiction until a definitive determination of local law questions is obtained from the local courts. One policy served by that practice is that of not passing on constitutional questions in situations where an authoritative interpretation of state law may avoid the constitutional issues. Spector Motor [Service] v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101, 105, 65 S.Ct. 152, 154, 89 L.Ed. 101.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The plaintiff does not question the existence of the general doctrine, but contends that the instant case does. not come within it, because the statutes involved are unambiguous and unquestionably unconstitutional as violative of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. There is respectable authority for the proposition that where the unconstitutionality of a statute is clear, it is unnecessary for the court to await state court adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">In National Association For Advancement of Colored People v. Patty, D.C. E.D.Va., 159 F.Supp. 503, on page 523, Circuit Judge Soper, speaking for the majority of a three-judge court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-13\">\u201c * * As heretofore noted, the problem for determination is essentially a federal question with no peculiarities of local law. Where the statute is free from ambiguity and there remains no reasonable interpretation which will render it constitutional, there are compelling reasons to bring about an expeditious and final ascertainment of the constitutionality of these statutes to the end that a multiplicity of similar actions may, if possible, be avoided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">Assuming, without deciding, that the unconstitutionality of the Arkansas statutes in suit is obvious, as the plaintiff claims, it reasonably can be believed that it would be more wholesome and more logical to permit the courts of Arkansas to rule upon their validity in the first instance than to have this court do so, and that it would be more in harmony with the philosophy underlying the doctrine established by the Supreme Court relative to the federal courts affording the state courts an opportunity to pass upon the construction and effect of local statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-16\">We think that under circumstances such as this court is confronted with, it has discretion as to whether it will proceed to an adjudication or whether it will require the plaintiff to seek its remedy in the courts of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-17\">We, therefore, grant the defendants\u2019 motions, and will \u201cretain jurisdiction until\u2019 efforts to obtain an appropriate adjudication in the state courts have been exhausted\u201d.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
