Goldberg argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level sentence enhancement for unduly influencing a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-23\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Bane, </em>720 F.3d 818, 824 (11th Cir.2013). For a finding to be clearly erroneous, we \u201cmust be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-24\">United States Sentencing Guideline 2G1.3(b)(2)(B) requires a two-level enhancement if the district court finds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>the defendant \u201cunduly influenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d In determining whether to apply the enhancement, the district court \u201cshould closely consider the facts of the case to determine whether [the defendant\u2019s] influence over the minor compromised the vol-untariness of the minor\u2019s behavior.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3, comment, n. 3(B). To assess whether the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes undue influence, \u201cthe district court may look to a variety of factors, including whether the defendant displays an abuse of superior knowledge, influence and resources.\u201d <em>United States v. Panfil, </em>338 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A rebuttable presumption of undue influence applies where, as here, the defendant is at least ten years older than the minor victim. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3, comment, n. 3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Goldberg pleaded guilty to enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b). According to the unchallenged factual basis of his plea, Goldberg sent a text message to MW, aged fifteen, saying \u201cLet\u2019s play,\u201d with a smiley face; he also sent a photo of fanned-out United States currency to MW, accompanied by a message asking \u201cCan you and me hang out?\u201d The same day, he picked up MW and her friend JS, aged seventeen, and drove them to his office, where he gave them alcohol and one hundred dollars each to allow him to take sexually explicit pictures of them. He then drove them to a nearby gas station, where he performed oral sex on MW in the gas-station bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">According to the Presentence Investigation Report, Goldberg also communicated via text message with JS. JS asked him for money and cigarettes, and in response he asked for pictures of her, which she sent. JS reported that on other occasions, Goldberg drove her places and gave her money. On one such occasion, while she was in the front seat of his car, Goldberg asked her to pull down her pants so he could take a picture of her genital area. On this evidence, the probation officer determined that the undue-influence enhancement applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Goldberg objected. Though he \u201cacknowledge[d] some degree of influence based on the age difference between him and M.W. and J.S.,\u201d and admitted to paying them money, he maintained that the \u201cdegree of [his] influence was countered by the voluntary and assertive participation of M.W. and J.S.\u201d He contended that because MW and JS \u201cwere already immersed in a lifestyle of drugs, parties, and sex[ ]\u201d before meeting him, as evidenced by their text message conversations, they \u201cwere voluntary participants motivated by money, drugs, and parties.\u201d He insisted that \u25a0he did not coerce, threaten, force, or persuade them to participate. He explained that the first contact between himself and the minors was when he gave MW his business card at a gas station, and that it was MW and JS who later contacted him asking to arrange a meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>The government responded that the en-. hancement was justified because Goldberg \u201ctook advantage of minors who ... had a drug problem,\u201d and who \u201cwanted money.\u201d Goldberg, the government explained, \u201chad money, and he used money to entice them,\u201d as evidenced by the picture of fanned-out currency he sent to MW. The government introduced a text-message conversation between MW and JS on the day Goldberg took them to his office, gave them money and alcohol, and had sexual contact with MW at the gas station, in which MW wrote that she \u201chope[d] he doesn\u2019t expect sex.\u201d On that same day, MW also wrote: \u201cI know it\u2019s like he\u2019s creepy, but not. I\u2019m confused.\u201d The district court overruled Goldberg\u2019s objection and applied the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The district court did not clearly err by enhancing Goldberg\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B). Undisputed evidence in the record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Goldberg unduly influenced his minor victims to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. As the district court explained, Goldberg, a \u201cvery mature adult male[,] reach[ed] out to a 15-year-old in the first instance\u201d; \u201cmade the first contact\u201d; \u201cus[ed] money to entice her into a relationship which she says at one point she\u2019s confused about,\u201d after she had \u201cindicated] she\u2019s not really interested in having sex.\u201d Goldberg thus displayed \u201can abuse of superior ... influence and resources,\u201d <em>Panfil, </em>338 F.3d at 1303 (citation omitted), that supports application of the undue-influence enhancement. For these reasons, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\">. In <em>Panfil </em>we discussed the factors a district court may evaluate when considering whether to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B)(ii). <em>See Panfil, </em>338 F.3d at 1303. That section, which is not the one at issue here, applies to a different sex crime against minors, but it has an identical threshold requirement: the defendant must have \u201cunduly influenced the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B)(ii); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.3(b)(2)(B) (requiring that the defendant \"unduly influenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct\u201d). Therefore, we have \"previously held that our interpretation of the undue influence enhancement under [the former section] applie[s] to [the latter].\u201d <em>United States v. Jerchower, </em>631 F.3d 1181, 1186 n. 2 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
