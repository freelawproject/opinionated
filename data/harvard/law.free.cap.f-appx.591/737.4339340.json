Holmes, a white male Probation and Parole Officer, appeals the grant of summary judgment to his employer, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles (\u201cBoard\u201d), in his suit alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2, when the Board failed to promote him to Senior Officer based on his race and gender or to District Manager based on his race. On appeal, Holmes argues that the district court erred by: (1) granting summary judgment on his Senior Officer claims; and (2) finding that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his District Manager claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">A. Promotion of Probation and Parole Officers</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">Because Holmes\u2019s claims involve the Board\u2019s failure to promote him to Senior Officer or District Manager positions, we first review the Board\u2019s promotion process.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">Under Alabama\u2019s merit system, an entry-level Probation and Parole Officer (or PO I) with two years of service is eligible for promotion to Senior Officer (or PO III) or District Manager (or PO IV).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To be promoted, the officer must apply with the State Personnel Department, which administers tests to all eligible applicants. The State Personnel Board then places the applicants on a promotional register, or \u201ccertificate of eligibles,\u201d and groups the applicants in \u201cbands\u201d based on their test scores. Applicants within a band have statistically similar test scores and are considered equally ranked within the applicant pool. This promotional register lists the top ten \u201celigibles\u201d and all applicants who tied the tenth highest eligible. Applicants are ranked both statewide and by preferred county. An applicant may share his statewide or county rank with other applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">Because the register for Senior Officer promotions is \u201ccontinuous,\u201d officers wishing to be considered for those promotions must retake the Senior Officer test periodically to avoid falling off the register. Consequently, names and rankings on the Senior Officer register frequently change as old names receive promotions or fall off and new names are added.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">The District Manager classification has a separate test and promotional register. Unlike the Senior Officer register, the District Manager register is \u201cclosed,\u201d meaning the State Personnel Department opens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>the register for only a short period to accept applications for a vacancy and then closes the register again until there is another vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The Board had a promotion protocol, effective August 15, 2009, for promoting officers to supervisor or manager positions within the agency. The 2009 protocol contains a list of objective criteria that must be considered in making promotional decisions, including the candidate\u2019s: (1) band number; (2) advanced degrees; (3) years in law enforcement, social services, or rehabilitation services; (4) unique objectively-based qualifications; (5) supervisory experience; and (6) past three years of performance appraisals, disciplinary actions, reprimands, and written warnings. The 2009 protocol also contains a list of subjective criteria, including: (1) the candidate\u2019s audits and statistical reports; (2) the last three years of supervisors\u2019 evaluations; (3) additional written input from the current supervisor; (4) the candidate\u2019s writing sample and resume; and (5) the interview. The evaluating committee or person has direct access to each candidate\u2019s personnel file and may be provided \u201ccandidate packets\u201d of information \u201cto use in deliberating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Under the 2009 protocol, once the Board identifies a Senior Officer or District Manager vacancy, the Board requests a certified promotional register from the State Personnel Department, which the Board uses to fill the vacancy. A person or committee interviews applicants from the register and then completes two worksheets of notes evaluating the candidates based on the objective and subjective criteria. The criteria are not weighted. Each evaluator has discretion in assigning weight to the criteria, and the worksheets are merely tools used to evaluate each interviewed candidate. After evaluating the candidates and deliberating, the person or committee recommends a candidate for promotion up the chain of command. Ultimately, the Board votes on the recommendation and has discretion in making the final promotion decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">B. Holmes\u2019s Employment</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">In February 2001, Holmes began working as a Probation and Parole Officer, most of that time in the field office in Montgomery, Alabama, where he lives. In March 2009, Holmes moved to the Montgomery field office\u2019s Pardon Unit, where he primarily processed pardon applications. In this assignment, Holmes did not ordinarily perform routine probation and parole officer field work, such as supervising offenders, maintaining field notes, participating in arrests, attending revocation hearings, preparing PSI reports or parole plans, collecting fees and arrearages, collecting DNA samples, and performing drug tests. On June 16, 2013, Holmes was promoted to Senior Officer in the Montgomery Central Office\u2019s Pardon Unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Throughout his employment, Holmes received generally positive evaluations, although a few evaluations noted issues with timeliness and attention to detail. Additionally, Holmes\u2019s personnel file contains some disciplinary actions during the years before he moved to the Pardon Unit, including: (1) a 2003 reprimand for failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>to accurately report an offender\u2019s sentence end date, which led to three months of wrongful incarceration; (2) notes in his 2003 evaluation about the failure to comply with arrest procedures; (3) a 2004 written reprimand for improper use of an assigned cell phone, making an insubordinate statement, and conducting field activities without the presence of another officer, in violation of office policy; and (4) a 2006 written warning for making an unauthorized request for the criminal history of a supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">C. Senior Officer Promotions</p>\n<p id=\"AP3\">In either 2004 or 2005, Holmes first took the Senior Officer test and began applying for promotion. Thereafter, Holmes periodically re-took the Senior Officer test when he receiv\u00e9d notice that he had dropped off the register. At one point, Holmes was on the register statewide, but later (Holmes does not know when), he changed his desired locations to counties around Montgomery.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Holmes claims that he was consistently passed over for Senior Officer promotions in favor of officers who were African-American or female. Holmes\u2019s peers frequently commented to him that Holmes was \u201cnot the right color\u201d for promotion, but Holmes did not hear this comment from supervisors in his chain of command. Holmes believed he was denied promotions based on his race and gender because he \u201ccontinually\u201d saw less experienced and less educated African-American and female officers get promoted rather than him. Holmes also believed there was a conspiracy within upper management to ensure African-American and women officers were promoted to Senior Officer positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">State Personnel Department records indicate that, between January 2005 and April 2013, a total of 95 Probation and Parole Officers were promoted to Senior Officer throughout the state. Of those 95 promotions, 58 officers were white, and 62 officers were male. In other words, during the time Holmes was applying for Senior Officer promotions, white and male officers received more Senior Officer promotions than anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">It is undisputed that Holmes did not receive a promotion until June 2013. Before 2009, however, it is unclear how often Holmes\u2019s name appeared on the Senior Officer register, whether and when he was available for promotion statewide, and how often he was considered or interviewed for promotion. According to State Personnel Department records, between January 2009 and August 2011, 36 Senior Officer promotions occurred. During that time, Holmes\u2019s name appeared on only six Sen-, ior Officer promotional registers. In other words, during the period for which there are records, Holmes was eligible for less than twenty percent of the Senior Officer promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Holmes\u2019s appeal involves only three Senior Officer promotions in the Montgomery field office, all of which occurred in 2011.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Holmes appeared on the register, and was considered and interviewed, for each of these three promotions, but ultimately was not selected. Instead, the Board promot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>ed Elizabeth Planer, a white woman, and Reginald Carter, an African-American man, on April 27, 2011, and Christopher Causey, an African-American man, on June 30, 2011.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">State Personnel Department records reflect that Planer, Carter, Causey, and Holmes all fell within the same \u201cband\u201d on the promotional registers and thus were equally ranked. While Holmes had-a masters degree, Carter had a law degree, and Causey and Planer had bachelors degrees. Holmes had more years of experience at the agency than Carter, Causey, or Planer.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">D.District Manager Promotions</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">At some point (Holmes does not remember when), Holmes took the District Manager test and began to apply for District Manager promotions. Although it was theoretically possible to be promoted directly to District Manager without first being promoted to Senior Officer, Holmes was unaware of any such promotions. Between January 2005 and April 2013, 19 officers were promoted to District Manager, 12 of whom were white and 13 of whom were male.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">In October 2008, Holmes\u2019s name appeared on a newly created promotional register for a District Manager position, along with 67 other candidates. Ten candidates were listed in band 01. Holmes and 42 other candidates were listed in band 02, and the remaining 15 candidates were listed in band 03. Thus, at that time, Holmes was \u201cranked\u201d eleventh in the state, but he was tied for that position with 41 other band 02 applicants. On November 26, 2008, Stephanie Woodruff, a black woman who also was on band 02, received the promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">According to a printout from the State Personnel Board\u2019s website, in August 2010, Holmes\u2019s name appeared on a \u201ccurrent\u201d promotional register for a District Manager position. The printout listed Holmes\u2019s statewide rank as tenth, but did not indicate how many other candidates were on the register. State Personnel Department records indicate, however, that no District Manager promotions occurred in 2010. In July and August 2011, three white males were promoted to District Manager positions. Holmes appeared on those promotional registers, and was considered for the three promotions, but was not selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">E. EEOC Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">Shortly thereafter, in late July and early August 2011, Holmes wrote two letters to the EEOC claiming race and gender discrimination in the Board\u2019s failure to promote him to a Senior Officer position and age discrimination in failing to promote him to any of the three 2011 District Manager positions. On August 9, 2011, Holmes filed a formal charge of discrimination based on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">F. Post-Charge District Manager Promotion</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">On September 13, 2011, after Holmes filed his EEOC charge, a third District Manager promotion occurred. Specifically, Roderick Chambers, a black male Senior Officer was promoted to District Man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>ager in the Montgomery field office. The record does not reflect whether Holmes appeared on the register for this District Manager position. In a subsequent letter to the EEOC, Holmes cited the Board\u2019s failure to promote him to Chambers\u2019s District Manager position as another example of his employer promoting a \u201cyounger, less educated, and less experienced\u201d candidate than Holmes.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">After the EEOC issued a right to sue letter, Holmes filed this action in the district court. The district court granted the Board\u2019s summary judgment motion with respect to both the Senior Officer and District Manager failure-to-promote claims. As to the Senior Officer claims, the district court concluded that Holmes failed to present evidence establishing his prima facie case. As to the District Manager claims, the district court found that Holmes claimed only age discrimination in the EEOC, and that his race and gender discrimination claims were \u201cbeyond the scope of the EEOC charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">II. THREE SENIOR OFFICER PROMOTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">A. <em>McDonnell-Douglas </em>Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Where, as here, a Title VII plaintiff uses circumstantial evidence to prove discrimination, we apply the burden-shifting approach articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Brown v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>597 F.3d 1160, 1181 (11th Cir.2010). Under this approach, the plaintiff must first make a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>Alvarez v. Royal Atlantic Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1264 (11th Cir.2010). If the plaintiff does so, a presumption of discrimination arises, and the burden of production, but not persuasion, shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the promotion decision. <em>Kidd v. Mando Am. Corp., </em>731 F.3d 1196, 1205 (11th Cir.2013). If the employer meets its burden, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to produce evidence that the proffered reason was a pretext for discrimination. <em>Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Group, Inc., </em>509 F.3d 1344, 1347 (11th Cir.2007). While the intermediate burdens of production shift back -and forth, \u201c[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">B. Prima Facie Case</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">To state a prima facie case, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified and applied for the promotion; (3) he was rejected despite his qualifications; and (4) the position was filled with an individual outside the protected class. <em>Walker v. Mortham, </em>158 F.3d 1177, 1186, 1193 (11th Cir.1998). In <em>Walker, </em>this Court concluded that the plaintiff need not establish as part of the prima facie case that the promoted employee was equally or less qualified than the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 1193. Since <em>Walker, </em>some of this Court\u2019s decisions state that the fourth element does require the plaintiff to show that the promoted employee was equally or less qualified. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>597 F.3d 1160, 1174 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1089 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Lee v. GTE Florida, Inc., </em>226 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2000). We need not resolve this conflict because, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Holmes satisfied his prima facie case, Holmes failed to rebut the Board\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for not promoting him. <em>See Cuddeback v. Fla. Bd. of Educ., </em>381 F.3d 1230, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that we may affirm the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on any legal ground supported by the record, regardless of whether the district court relied on that ground).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">B. Pretext</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">To show pretext, the plaintiff cannot recast the employer\u2019s proffered reason, but must meet the reason \u201chead on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1080 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). The plaintiff must show both that the reason was false and that discrimination was the real reason. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006). At this stage, a \u201cnew level of specificity\u201d applies, and the plaintiff must demonstrate \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoheren-cies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Rioux v. City of Atlanta, </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also Earley v. Champion Int\u2019l Corp., </em>907 F.2d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir.1990) (explaining that the plaintiff must \u201cpresent concrete evidence in the form of specific facts which show that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason is mere pretext. Mere conclusory allegations and assertions will not suffice\u201d). If the employer proffers more than one reason, the plaintiff must rebut each of them to survive summary judgment. <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1037.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The Board proffered two reasons for its decisions not to promote Holmes to the three Senior Officer positions\u2014 Holmes\u2019s disciplinary record and his specialization in pardon work in the Montgomery field office. Specifically, although Holmes\u2019s disciplinary matters were not a bar to his promotion, they influenced his supervisors\u2019 recommendations regarding whether to promote him. The Board further explained that while Holmes\u2019s specialization in pardon work was a negative factor for promotion to a field office supervisor, it was a positive factor in 2013, when Holmes was promoted to Senior Officer within the Montgomery Central Office Pardon Unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Holmes \u00e1ttempted to rebut the Board\u2019s reasons by showing that he was more qualified than the promoted employees because he had a masters degree and had more years of experience as a parole and probation officer. Holmes pointed to the Board\u2019s 2009 promotion protocol, which listed among its objective criteria the candidate\u2019s advanced degrees and years in law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Holmes also relied upon his own declaration, in which he provided generalized information about Senior Officer promotions by race and gender between 2007 and 2011. Although Holmes\u2019s declaration claimed that he \u201clearned\u201d this information from \u201cexamination of the discovery\u201d materials the Board had produced, he did not submit any of those discovery materials to the district court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Board did submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>some of those discovery materials, including State Personnel Department\u2019s records of Senior Officer and District Manager promotions, which demonstrated that Holmes\u2019s data was in fact inaccurate. Holmes further stated his own conclusory opinion that he was more qualified than all the individuals promoted because he was \u201cmore highly ranked and had superior education and experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Holmes\u2019s declaration did not specifically address the qualifications of Causey, Carter, and Planer. Holmes claimed that \u201cCarter was promoted with disciplinary warnings and reprimands in his file,\u201d but did not provide any details or attach any supporting documents. Holmes made no claims about Causey\u2019s and Planer\u2019s disciplinary record and did not provide information about the three promoted officers\u2019, work experience or areas of specialization. Further, Holmes did not dispute his own disciplinary record or that, as a pardons specialist, he ordinarily did not perform field duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">By focusing on his years of experience and advanced degree, Holmes merely quarreled with the wisdom of the Board\u2019s reasons for not promoting him in 2011 and did not address those reasons \u201chead on.\u201d <em>See Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030. Additionally, Etolmes\u2019s declaration made only con-clusory assertions that the officers receiving promotions were less qualified, which is not sufficient to show pretext. Instead, Holmes needed to present \u201cconcrete evidence in the form of specific facts\u201d rebutting the Board\u2019s reasons. <em>See Earley, </em>907 F.2d at 1081; <em>see also Leigh v. Warner Bros., Inc., </em>212 F.3d 1210, 1217 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that \u201cconclusory allegations without specific supporting facts have no probative value\u201d in opposing summary judgment). For example, Holmes did not present evidence that Causey, Carter, and Planer had similar disciplinary records or that they also specialized in pardon work. Indeed, Holmes failed to present almost any evidence at all of the three promoted employees\u2019 qualifications, whether linked to the Board\u2019s proffered reasons or not. Thus, Holmes failed to show that Causey, Carter, and Planer were less qualified than him, much less that there was a disparity in qualifications \u201cof such weight and significance\u201d that a reasonable person could not have chosen Causey, Carter, and Planer over Holmes. <em>See Kidd, </em>731 F.3d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">Holmes\u2019s declaration also identified three officers (other than Causey, Carter, or Planer) who were promoted to Senior Officer positions even though they either had a disciplinary record or performed pardon work. Holmes argues that the fact that these other officers were promoted shows the Board\u2019s reasons lack credibility. The Board, however, did not claim that a disciplinary record or pardon work is a bar to promotion, just that they influenced his supervisors\u2019 recommendations of him for the three relevant Senior Officer promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">Furthermore, evidence of comparators who are treated more favorably cannot show pretext unless those comparators are \u201csimilarly situated to the plaintiff in all relevant respects.\u201d <em>See Rioux, </em>520 F.3d at 1280 (quotation marks and alterations omitted). Holmes offered no other information about his proffered comparators except that they had a disciplinary record or performed pardon work and thus did not show they were \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to him in all relevant respects. Accordingly, Holmes did not present evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>that the Board\u2019s two proffered reasons were false and a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Finally, Holmes\u2019s argument that the district court improperly shifted the burden of proof to him at summary judgment lacks merit. Consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(1), the Board both cited to record evidence showing the presence of some undisputed facts and also pointed out that Holmes\u2019s own evidence was insufficient to carry his ultimate burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the failure to promote him to the three Senior Officer positions was discriminatory. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(1)(A)-(B) <em>&amp; </em>advisory committee\u2019s notes (2010 Amendments, Subdivision (c)); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (explaining that the moving party need not affirmatively negate the opponent\u2019s claim with affidavits or other materials, but instead may meet its summary judgment burden by showing there is a lack of evidence to support the essential elements the non-moving party must prove at trial); <em>Clark v. Coats &amp; Clark, Inc., </em>929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir.1991) (explaining that, per <em>Celotex, </em>\u201cunder certain circumstances the movant may meet its Rule 56 burden without negating an element of the non-moving party\u2019s claim and that under such circumstances it is sufficient to point to materials on file that demonstrate that the party bearing the burden of proof at trial will not be able to meet that burden\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">III. DISTRICT MANAGER PROMOTION</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">A. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Holmes claimed that the Board' denied him the September 2011 District Manager promotion \u2014 the one awarded to Chambers \u2014 based on race. The district court concluded that Holmes had failed to exhaust this race-based failure-to-promote claim in the EEOC. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Before a plaintiff may file a Title VII action, he must first exhaust his administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. <em>Gregory v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>355 F.3d 1277, 1279 (11th Cir.2004). While we must liberally construe an EEOC charge that was prepared without assistance of counsel, a plaintiffs civil complaint remains \u201climited by the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280 (quotation marks omitted). We have cautioned \u201cthat allegations of new acts of discrimination are inappropriate\u201d for a post-charge judicial complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 1279-80.,</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">Here, Holmes\u2019s raced-based District Manager claim did not fall within the scope of his EEOC charge for two reasons. First, this claim alleged a discrete act of discrimination \u2014 a promotion \u2014 that occurred after Holmes filed his EEOC charge. <em>See Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 114, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 2073, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (\u201cEach incident of discrimination ... constitutes a separate actionable \u2018unlawful employment practice.\u2019\u201d); <em>Gregory, </em>355 F.3d at 1279 (stating that it is inappropriate to allege new acts of discrimination). . Specifically, Holmes filed his charge on August 9, 2011, but Chambers\u2019 promotion did not occur until one month later, on September 13, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Second, Holmes\u2019s communications with the EEOC emphasized only age discrimination with regard to District Manager promotions, and not race discrimination. For example, in the two pre-charge letters Holmes sent to the EEOC, he advised, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had recently interviewed for two District Manager positions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>but that two white males who were younger and had less experience had been selected for these positions. Holmes stated that \u201ctherefore, I am making another claim of age discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">In his formal EEOC charge, Holmes checked the boxes for discrimination based on race, color, sex, and age, but he claimed African-American candidates were selected over him only with respect to the Senior Officer position. As to the District Manager position, Holmes\u2019s charge stated, \u201cI was also denied a promotion to the position of district manager and a less experienced, less educated, younger officer was promoted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Later, in a September 8, 2011 post-charge letter, Holmes again discussed the District Manager promotions, stating that since July 2011, he was passed over four times, and that \u201c[a]t least two of these recent promotions to District Manager were to less educated, less experienced, and younger candidates than me.\u201d With respect to Roderick Chambers\u2019s promotion in particular, Holmes stated that Chambers \u201chappens to be black,\u201d but also claimed Chambers was \u201cless educated, less experienced, and younger than me.\u201d Holmes asserted that \u201cin the absence of clear definitive promotional policy, my employer promotes those younger, less educated, and less experienced than myself.\u201d Holmes further pointed out that Chambers\u2019s promotion to District Manager discriminated against both him and an African-American female officer in her fifties, signifying that age, not race, was the alleged discriminatory motive in the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Given that Holmes\u2019s own communications with the EEOC stressed age, not race, discrimination in the District Manager promotions, we cannot say a race discrimination claim could reasonably be expected to arise from his complaints about the District Manager promotions. Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that any race discrimination claim as to the District Manager position was outside the scope of Holmes\u2019s EEOC charge and properly declined to consider such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">B. Prima Facie Case</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">However, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Holmes\u2019s passing reference to Chambers\u2019s race in his September 8, 2011 letter exhausted Holmes\u2019s race discrimination claim, the district court still properly granted summary judgment on this claim because Holmes did not present evidence that he was \u201cqualified for\u201d the District Manager position Chambers received. To establish a prima facie claim of failure to promote, the plaintiff must present evidence that he \u201capplied for and was qualified for\u201d the promotion. <em>Brown, </em>597 F.3d at 1174. An employee is \u201cqualified for\u201d a promotion if the employee \u201coffers evidence that [he] satisfied an employer\u2019s objective qualifications.\u201d <em>Kidd, </em>731 F.3d at 1204 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">In Holmes\u2019s case, it is undisputed that to be eligible for promotion to an open District Manager position, a probation and parole officer must take the District Manager test and appear on the State Personnel Board\u2019s promotional register, or \u201ccertificate of eligibles.\u201d In his deposition, Holmes admitted he took the District Manager test only once, but he could not remember when he did so. Holmes submitted a printout from the State Personnel Board\u2019s website indicating that he was on a \u201ccurrent\u201d District Manager promotional register on August 18, 2010. The decision to promote Chambers, however, did not occur until September 2011, one year later. And, District Manager promotional registers are closed rather than continuous, meaning they do not remain open to fill later vacancies. Therefore, Holmes did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>not present evidence that he was listed on the particular promotional register used to fill, and thus was eligible for, the District Manager position that Chambers received.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">For all these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the Board on Holmes\u2019s failure to promote claims. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-12\">. On appeal, Holmes does not challenge the district court's order dismissing: (1) all of his claims against the individual defendants; (2) his claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983, and state law; and (3) his Title VII hostile work environment claim. Accordingly, Holmes has abandoned any issues with respect to these claims. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-17\">. In late 2011, the Board changed the promotion protocol to require two years of service in the Senior Officer classification to be eligible for promotion to District Manager. At the time of the events giving rise to Holmes\u2019s claims, however, an entry-level officer with two years of service could apply for promotion to District Manager.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\">. The record also contains a different, 2010 promotion protocol, effective December 6, 2010, applicable to all classifications of Board employment. Under the 2009 protocol, all candidates on the register were interviewed and under the 2010 protocol, all candidates on the register were \"considered,\u201d but only some were interviewed. The 2010 protocol does not contain lists of objective and subjective criteria that must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">For summary judgment purposes, we assume that the 2009 protocol, which was specific to probation and parole officers, still applied.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-6\">. The district court concluded that these three Senior Officer promotions were the only promotions that occurred within 180 days of Holmes\u2019s filing of his charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\u201d) and thus were the only failure-to-promote claims that were not time-barred. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l) (requiring an employee in a non-deferral state such as Alabama to exhaust administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice). On appeal, Holmes does not challenge this ruling, and we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\">. Holmes heard rumors within the agency that some African-American and female officers received help preparing their answers to the take-home Senior Officer test and complained to upper management, the State Personnel Department, and the Alabama Attorney General\u2019s Office. After a 2010 internal affairs investigation, a new Senior Officer test was introduced in March 2011. Holmes did not present any evidence that the three successful promotees for Holmes's claims (Carter, Causey, or Planer) received help with respect to their 2011 promotions and admitted in his deposition that he did not know whether any of them had cheated on the Senior Officer test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of summary judgment, construing the facts and drawing all reasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Moton v. Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b767-11\">. Specifically, Holmes\u2019s declaration stated that, based on his \"examination of the discovery in this case,\u201d he had \"learned that 23 officers were awarded promotions\u201d to Senior Officer between January 2007 and August 2011, and that \"22 of these 23 promotions were awarded to officers who were nonwhite and/or female.\u201d Holmes further stated that he learned \"[fjrom [his] examination of the applications of these officers,\u201d that \"none of the 23 officers selected for promotion has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>more experience that [sic][he] did, and 12 had less than three years\u2019 experience\u201d and that \"18 of the 23 officers selected for promotion ... did not possess a graduate degree.\u201d But, Holmes did not submit any of the discovery he claimed to have reviewed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
