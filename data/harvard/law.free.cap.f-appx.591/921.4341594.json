The district court concluded the first motion was untimely and procedurally barred because it presented substantive arguments that Mr. Andrews should have made on appeal from the dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition. In his second motion, Mr. Andrews contended that, under <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), his sentences were unconstitutional because the indictment did not charge him with a particular drug quantity. The district court denied this motion as well, concluding <em>Alleyne </em>was inapplicable because it was not retroactive in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. This is Mr. Andrews\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jackson v. Crosby, </em>437 F.3d 1290, 1295 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A Rule 60(b) motion may be granted for any of the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence that could not have been discovered within 28 days of the entry of judgment; (3) fraud or misconduct by an opposing party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, is based on a previous vacated judgment, or is no longer equitable; or (6) any other reason that justifies relief. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1)-(6). A \u201cmovant seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(6), [the last of these,] must show extraordinary circumstances justifying the reopening of a final judgment.\u201d <em>Lugo v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>750 F.3d 1198, 1210 (11th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). A motion under Rule 60(b) may not be used as a substitute for a timely appeal. <em>See Jackson, </em>437 F.3d at 1296. And it may not be used to assert, or reassert, claims of error in the movant\u2019s conviction. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 538, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>Mr. Andrews contends the district court erred by not addressing the merits of his first motion and by overlooking arguments in his second motion and failing to make a determination as to <em>Alleyne\u2019s </em>retroactivity. We disagree. First, we agree with the district court that the arguments Mr. Andrews presented in his first motion \u2014 that he was not required to satisfy the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 as a prerequisite to relief under \u00a7 2241, that \u00a7 2241 itself lacks a savings clause or bar to relief, and that a number of this Court\u2019s cases affirming the denial or dismissal of \u00a7 2241 petitions are contrary to Supreme Court precedent \u2014 did not fall into one of the six bases for a Rule 60(b) motion and, instead, could be raised only in an appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1)-(6); <em>Jackson, </em>437 F.3d at 1296. Second, Mr. Andrews\u2019s contention that the district court failed to address the retroactivity of <em>Alleyne </em>in his second motion is belied by the record. Further, to the extent Mr. Andrews challenges the district court\u2019s retroactivity determination, his challenge is without merit. <em>See Jeanty v. Warden, </em>757 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2014) (holding <em>Alleyne </em>is not retroactive upon a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition). In sum, Mr. Andrews\u2019s motions did not present the district court with valid reasons to revisit its dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition, and he gives us no cause to reverse here.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-9\">. Mr. Andrews's motion for leave to file his reply brief out of time is GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b946-10\">. In his appellate brief, Mr. Andrews also contends the district court erred in dismissing his petition for writ of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2241. But, as a part of our prior review of Mr. Andrews\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in fonna pauperis, </em>we concluded that his notice of appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition was untimely and that our jurisdiction in this appeal therefore was limited to a review of the district court's disposition of Mr. Andrews's post-judgment motions under Rule 60(b). Mr. Andrews did not timely seek review of that determination and we do not disturb it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b946-15\">.We also liberally construe Mr. Andrews's pleadings because he is proceeding without counsel. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874(11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
