The district court dismissed Snider\u2019s complaint about a violation of the Amendm\u00e9nts Act on the ground that it did \u201cnot establish a cause of action separate from the [Disabilities Act]\u201d and his complaint of retaliation for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies. Later, the district court entered summary judgment against Snider\u2019s complaint of discrimination on the ground that he failed to establish a prima facie case and, in the alternative, that he failed to prove that the legitimate, non-discrimination reason proffered for placing him on medical leave was a pretext for discrimination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Snider argues that he established a pri-ma facie case that he was discriminated against based on a perceived mental disability, but we need not address this argument because we can affirm the summary judgment in favor of U.S. Steel on the alternative ground stated by the district court. Before we will reverse a \u201cjudgment that is based on multiple, independent grounds, an appellant must convince us that every stated ground for the judgment against him is incorrect.\u201d <em>Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680 (11th Cir.2014). If the \u201cappellant fails to challenge properly on appeal one of the grounds on which the district court based its judgment, he is deemed to have abandoned any challenge of that ground....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Snider does not challenge the ruling that he failed to prove that the reason proffered for placing him on medical leave was a pretext for discrimination, \u201cit follows that the judgment [in favor of U.S. Steel]' is due to be affirmed,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">Snider also has abandoned any challenge that he might have made to the dismissal of his complaint of retaliation. \u201c[T]he law is by now well settled in this Circuit that a legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed.\u201d <em>Holland v. Gee, </em>677 F.3d 1047, 1066 (11th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004)). Snider argues that he submitted sufficient evidence of retaliation to survive summary judgment, but the district court dismissed Snider\u2019s complaint of retaliation on the ground that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. We deem abandoned any argument that Snider could have made against the dismissal of his complaint of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of U.S. Steel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
