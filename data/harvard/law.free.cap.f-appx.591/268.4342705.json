The district court considered the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the advisory guidelines range of 15 to 21 months of imprisonment, decided not to sentence White under the Sentencing Guidelines, and sentenced her to 40 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-21\">White argues that the district court procedurally erred by not applying the Guidelines to determine whether to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines and by not applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s., to determine the extent of its upward departure. As she concedes, because she did not raise this argument in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (iterating the four-part plain error test).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-22\">The district court is not required to apply \u00a7 4A1.3 before imposing a non-Guidelines sentence, as here. <em>United States v. Gutierrez, </em>635 F.3d 148, 151-53 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 723 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the district court did not err by failing to apply \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-23\">White contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court gave significant weight to irrelevant uncharged conduct. \u201cA non-Guideline sentence unreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors where it ... gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor....\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). White has not shown that the conduct relied upon by the district court was an irrelevant or improper sentencing factor. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3661. Moreover, the district court could adopt the facts contained in the presentence report (PSR) because they bore \u201ca sufficient indicia of reliability\u201d and White did \u201cnot present rebuttal evidence or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>demonstrate that the information in the PSR is unreliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 173-74 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined' that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
