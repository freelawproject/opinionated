He contends that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(G) and (I) by failing to properly advise him of the mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-23\">Rodriguez raised no Rule 11 error in the district court. Accordingly, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). The district court is required to ensure the defendant understands the nature of the charge to which he is pleading and any mandatory minimum penalty. Fed. R.Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(G), (I). Rodriguez was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The district court correctly and consistently advised Rodriguez that he faced a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence. The record does not support Rodriguez\u2019s arguments that he was misled by the alternative minimum sentences set forth in the enhancement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>information and plea agreement or the Government\u2019s promise to pursue only one prior felony drug conviction for statutory enhancement purposes. Even if Rodriguez could demonstrate plain error, he cannot show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004); <em>see also United States v.
