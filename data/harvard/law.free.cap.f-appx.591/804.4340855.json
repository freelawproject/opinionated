The agency concluded ' that Mohamed failed to establish that his political opinion and membership in the Garre clan were \u201cat least one central reason\u201d, for Al-Sha-baab\u2019s efforts to recruit him. On appeal, he argues that: (1) the BIA applied the wrong legal standard in denying his application for asylum; (2) the record compels a finding that he suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution; and (3) the agency failed to give reasoned consideration to Professor Tim Carmichael\u2019s affidavit and testimony. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-17\">We review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, because the BIA agreed with some of the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review both the decision of the BIA and the IJ on those points. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-18\">We review factual findings under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>2005). To reverse a factual finding under this test, we must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one. <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). Further, under this test, we must affirm the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Moreover, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Id. </em>We review legal issues <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also Perez-Guerrero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>717 F.3d 1224, 1231 (11th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1000, 187 L.Ed.2d 850 (2014) (reviewing as a question of law whether the BIA gave reasoned consideration to an issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). Asylum applications filed after May 11, 2005, are governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005. <em>Shkambi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>584 F.3d 1041, 1049 n. 7 (11th Cir.2009). A refugee is defined as a person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable .or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). We\u2019ve held that \u201c[a] particular social group refers to persons who share a common, immutable characteristic that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1302, 1310 (11th Cir.2013) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">To prove asylum eligibility, an applicant must show: (1) past persecution on account of one of five statutorily protected grounds, or (2) a well-founded fear that a protected ground will cause future persecution. <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). The applicant bears the burden of proving that one of the enumerated grounds \u201cwas or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). The applicant can do so by \u201cpresenting specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of such [a protected ground].\u201d <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation and emphasis omitted). Further, applicants must provide some evidence, direct or circumstantial, of their persecutors\u2019 motives. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The persecution need not come only from government forces, but can be by non-government groups the government cannot control. <em>See Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir. 2010). However, \u201c[e]vidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>tion based on a' statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>735. F.3d at 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Persecution based on political opinion is based on the victim\u2019s political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s political opinion. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004). However, the relevant question is whether the persecutor is acting because of the victim\u2019s political opinion, not whether the victim has a political opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 438. \u2019In <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>the Supreme Court held that a guerilla organization\u2019s attempt to recruit an individual into its ranks did not necessarily constitute persecution on account of political opinion. 502 U.S. at 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812. The Supreme Court explained that, even if the guerilla organization recruited in order to carry out its political goals, that did not mean that the forced recruitment was persecution on account of political opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 482, 112 S.Ct. 812. The Supreme Court concluded that Elias-Zacarias, who said he resisted the guerillas\u2019 recruitment efforts because he was afraid the government would retaliate against him, had not established that he resisted recruitment based on his political opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812. Even if the record showed that he had a political opinion, the record did not compel a finding that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution by the guerillas because of that political opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812. Instead, the record showed that he would be persecuted for his refusal to fight with the guerillas. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Likewise, in <em>Sanchez, </em>we said that an alien could not qualify for withholding of removal relief simply by showing that she would be persecuted for her refusal to join the guerillas. 392 F.3d at 438. We held that the record did not establish Sanchez\u2019s actual or imputed political opinion, or compel a finding of any nexus between Sanchez\u2019s political opinion and the guerillas\u2019 alleged persecution. <em>Id. </em>To the contrary, we determined that the evidence showed the guerillas persecuted her because of her refusal to cooperate with them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">In <em>Ayala, </em>an alien appealed a BIA decision denying his 2006 applications for asylum and withholding of removal, and challenged the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. 605 F.3d at 943, 948. In describing the nexus requirement, we did not cite to the INA, but explained instead that an asylum applicant \u201cneed only show that the persecution is, at least in part, motivated by a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 949 (quotation omitted). We ultimately vacated and remanded the BIA\u2019s decision denying asylum and withholding of removal, concluding that the BIA and IJ did not give reasoned consideration to Ayala\u2019s claim of past persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">For starters, we reject Mohamed\u2019s claim that the BIA applied an incorrect legal standard in establishing the nexus requirement. Mohammed\u2019s asylum application, which was filed on August 5, 2010, is governed by the REAL ID Act. The asylum statute, as amended by the REAL ID Act, provides that in order to meet the nexus requirement, the asylum applicant must show that one of the five protected grounds \u201cwas or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). The agency applied this legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Mohamed\u2019s reliance on our statement in <em>Ayala </em>is misplaced. Our statement that an applicant need only show \u201cthat the persecution is, at least in part, motivated by a protected ground\u201d to establish the nexus requirement was <em>dicta, </em>as the ultimate holding was that the agency failed to give reasoned consideration to the alien\u2019s past persecution claim. <em>See Ayala, </em>605 F.3d at 948-49. In any event, Ayala\u2019s comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>that the persecution must be \u201cat least in part\u201d motivated by one of the enumerated grounds did not purport to interpret the \u201cone central reason\u201d standard of the new \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) \u2014 and did not even mention it in discussing the nexus requirement \u2014 but simply said that the protected ground need not be the sole reason for the persecution. <em>See id. </em>This is not necessarily in conflict with the clear statutory language providing that the protected ground be \u201cat least one central reason\u201d for the persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Next, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Mohamed has not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion. To begin with, Mohamed has not shown that Al-Shabaab\u2019s recruitment efforts were because of his political opinion. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812. Even if Mohamed\u2019s refusal to join A1 Shabaab was due to his own political beliefs, he has not presented any \u201cdirect or circumstantial evidence\u201d that Al-Shabaab was aware of his political views and sought to recruit him or harm him because of it. <em>See id. </em>at 488, 112 S.Ct. 812. To the contrary, the background evidence and Mohamed\u2019s own testimony establishes that Al-Shabaab sought to recruit anyone to fill its ranks, including children and the disabled. Thus, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Al-Sha-baab\u2019s actions were not because of any political opinion that Mohamed had expressed, but were due to Mohamed\u2019s refusal to join their ranks. This Court and the Supreme Court have concluded that such refusal does not compel a finding that an alien was persecuted on account of his political opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Nor does the record compel a finding that Mohamed suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his membership in the Garre clan. The IJ and BIA determined that, even if Mohamed had identified a cognizable social group, he failed to establish that Al-Shabaab sought to recruit him because he was a member of the minority Garre clan. Moreover, as noted above, substantial evidence supported the agency\u2019s determination that A1 Shabaab sought to recruit anyone to join their ranks.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Mohamed\u2019s argument that Professor Carmichael\u2019s affidavit and testimony supports his claim is unavailing. While Professor Carmichael said that those most vulnerable to Al-Shabaab\u2019s recruitment efforts were the \u201csocially weak,\u201d he described this group as including those from minority clans and the physically and mentally disabled. Professor Carmichael\u2019s affidavit was consistent with the other background material, which showed that Al-Shabaab targeted a wide range of individuals for recruitment, including children, students, teachers, and the disabled. Thus, the fact that members of the Garre clan (and other socially weak groups) were most vulnerable to Al-Shabaab\u2019s recruitment did not compel a finding that a central reason for Al-Shabaab\u2019s recruiting and targeting of Mohamed was his membership in such group.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">We are also not persuaded by Mohamed\u2019s claim that the agency failed to give reasoned consideration to Professor Carmichael\u2019s affidavit and testimony. Indeed, the BIA or the IJ is not required to discuss in its opinion every claim raised by a petitioner. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006). Where the BIA has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, we will not require that it address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented. <em>See id. </em>Rather, the BIA must \u201cconsider the issues raised and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Here, the record belies Mohamed\u2019s assertion that the BIA and IJ did not consider Professor Carmichael\u2019s affidavit and testimony. The IJ explicitly said that Professor Carmichael\u2019s testimony was consistent with the Country Reports, and that Professor Carmichael added some additional information related to Al Shabaab\u2019s involvement in politics and the bombings in Somalia. The IJ, however, noted that it was not necessary to qualify Professor Carmichael as an expert because his expertise in the Somali zone of Ethiopia was not relevant to the issue of whether Al-Shabaab persecuted Mohamed on account of his membership in the Garre clan and his political opinion. In fact, Professor Carmichael admitted that although he had been qualified as an expert 25 times, he had never been qualified as an expert on Somalia. Moreover, the BIA noted that Mohamed had not established that further treatment of Professor Carmichael\u2019s affidavit and testimony would alter the outcome. Based on the treatment of Professor Carmichael\u2019s affidavit and testimony in the IJ and BIA\u2019s respective orders, the record shows that the agency considered the \u201cissues raised and announc[ed] its decision in terms sufficient to enable [us] to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>See Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\">. We also note that Mohamed has abandoned any challenge he may have had to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. Although he makes passing references in his brief to how the evidence he presented with his motion to reopen supports his argument that the agency erred in concluding that he failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, he does not offer any argument as to why the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen. <em>See Wu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>745 F.3d 1140, 1152 n. 12 (11th Cir.2014). He does not mention or take issue at all with the BIA\u2019s decision that his new evidence was not sufficiently material to justify reopening. Thus, Mohamed abandoned this issue. Moreover, Mohamed's attempt to use new evidence submitted with his motion to reopen to argue that substantial evidence did not support the agency\u2019s denial of his asylum application is unavailing, since that evidence was not before the agency when it denied his asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (noting that this Court shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the removal order is based).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
