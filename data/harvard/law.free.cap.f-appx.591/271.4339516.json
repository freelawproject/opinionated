The district court treated Lavergne\u2019s complaint as arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and dismissed his claims for failure to state a claim. The court explained that the District Attorney\u2019s Office was not an entity capable of being sued under \u00a7 1988 and that adding the District Attorney as a defendant would be futile because the District Attorney was immune from suit for monetary damages for filing charges against Lavergne. To the extent Lavergne raised claims under Louisiana state law, those claims were dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">We GRANT Lavergne\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief. On appeal, he contends that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint before allowing him the opportunity to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">This court reviews a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo, applying the same standard that is used to review a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998) (per cu-riam). Questions of whether a defendant is entitled to immunity are likewise reviewed de novo. <em>Hale v. King, </em>642 F.3d 492, 497 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Lavergne has not challenged the district court\u2019s determination that the District Attorney\u2019s Office is not an entity capable of being sued under \u00a7 1983, that if the District Attorney was added as a defendant, he would be entitled to absolute immunity, or that it should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims. Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Additionally, Lavergne has failed to identify defendants or material facts he would have included in an amended complaint that would have cured the deficiencies in his complaint. <em>See Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 768 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam); <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 326-27 (5th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Lavergne has therefore failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying Lavergne\u2019s motions to amend his complaint. <em>Leal v. McHugh, </em>731 F.3d 405, 417 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>592 F.3d 675, 681 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam). To the extent Lavergne raises new claims on appeal, we do not address them. <em>See Williams v. Ballard, </em>466 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Lavergne\u2019s motion to appoint counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
