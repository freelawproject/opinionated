On appeal, Mustafic argues: (1) the agency applied the wrong legal standard in denying his applications for adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility; (2) the agency erred in finding that he was a \u201cviolent or dangerous individual\u201d due to his conviction for vehicular homicide; and (3) the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">We consider questions concerning our jurisdiction de novo. <em>Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Our jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions is also statutorily limited. <em>Jimenez-Galicia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>690 F.3d 1207, 1209 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2824, 186 L.Ed.2d 883 (2013). Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) of Title 8 divests courts of jurisdiction to consider \u201cany other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security,\u201d other than the granting of asylum relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. 233, 252-53, 130 S.Ct. 827, 839-40, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010) (concluding that the discretionary decision bar did not apply to decisions made discretionary by regulation). We have further held that we lack jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s purely discretionary determination that an alien has failed to satisfy the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d requirement for cancellation of removal. <em>Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1221-22 (11th Cir.2006) (construing \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, which precludes review of \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under\u201d the cancellation of removal statute) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">However, notwithstanding these statutory provisions, we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Alvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>524 F.3d 1191, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>1195-96 (11th Cir.2008). We review questions of law de novo. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). Whether the agency applied an incorrect legal standard presents a question of law over which we retain jurisdiction. <em>Freeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>491. F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.2007). However, a \u201cgarden-variety abuse of discretion argument\u201d that the agency failed to properly weigh the facts does not amount to a question of law under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). <em>See Alvarez Acosta, </em>524 F.3d at 1196-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">An alien who has been convicted of a CIMT is not admissible to the United States and is ineligible for adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182 (a)(2) (A) (i) (I). However, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security have permissive discretion to waive a refugee\u2019s inadmissibility \u201cfor humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1159(c). A waiver permits an inadmissible refugee to obtain lawful permanent residency, provided that the refugee also meets the other specified requirements. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1159(a)-(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">As a preliminary matter, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction over Mustafic\u2019s petition for review. Mus-tafic conceded removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), as an alien inadmissible for having been convicted of a CIMT. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Thus, Mustafic is only eligible to adjust status if he can obtain a \u00a7 1159(c) waiver. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1159(c). The IJ and BIA\u2019s decision to deny Mustafic\u2019s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1159(c) is a discretionary determination that falls within the jurisdiction-stripping provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) (2)(B) (ii). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>see also Makir-Marwil v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>681 F.3d 1227, 1234 n. 4 (11th Cir.2012) (stating that we lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary denial of a waiver of inadmissibility). Our jurisdiction is also limited by the criminal alien jurisdiction-stripping bar under. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), as Mustafic is inadmissible due to his CIMT conviction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Thus, we retain jurisdiction over the petition for review only to the extent that Mustafic raises questions of law or constitutional claims. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Because Mustafic\u2019s argument that the agency applied the wrong legal standard to determine that he was subject to the heightened \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard raises a question of law, we retain jurisdiction to review this argument. <em>See Freeh, </em>491 F.3d at 1281; <em>see also Makir-Marwil, </em>681 F.3d at 1234 n. 4' (noting that a challenge to the legal standard used by the IJ and BIA relating to a waiver under \u00a7 1159(c) was a question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">In. <em>In re Jean, </em>the Attorney General overturned a BIA decision that had granted an inadmissibility waiver to a Haitian refugee convicted of second-degree manslaughter for beating and shaking a baby to death. 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 373, 374-75 (A.G.2002). The Attorney General articulated a heightened standard for waiving the inadmissibility of refugees who are found to be \u201cviolent or dangerous individuals,\u201d requiring those individuals to prove the existence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances, such as those involving national security or foreign policy considerations, or cases in which an alien clearly demonstrates that the denial of status adjustment would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383. However, even if the alien shows \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d that may not be enough to warrant relief depending on the gravity of the alien\u2019s underlying criminal conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>After <em>In re Jean, </em>in \u00a7 1159(c) waiver cases, we have stated that the first determination is whether the refugee is a \u201cviolent or dangerous individual.\u201d <em>Makir-Marwil, </em>681 F.3d at 1229. If the refugee is not violent or dangerous, the general statutory standard for a \u00a7 1159(c) waiver applies, and the refugee must show only that the waiver would serve humanitarian purposes, assure family unity, or otherwise be in the public interest. <em>Id.; see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159(c). However, a refugee found to be \u201cviolent or dangerous\u201d must satisfy both the statutory standard in \u00a7 1159(c) and the heightened, \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d outlined in <em>In re Jean. Makir-Marwil, </em>681 F.3d at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In <em>Maldr-MaruAl, </em>we addressed whether <em>Matter of Jean </em>required a \u201cfact-based\u201d or categorical analysis of Makir-Marwil\u2019s prior convictions to determine whether he was a \u201cviolent or dangerous individual.\u201d 681 F.3d at 1233-35. We noted that we had jurisdiction to decide the legal issue of which standard applied. <em>Id. </em>at 1234 n. 4. Makir-Marwil had argued that <em>In re Jean </em>required the IJ to conduct a \u201cfact-based\u201d approach and look to the underlying circumstances of each prior crime to determine whether he was a \u201cviolent or dangerous individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1234. We rejected -Makir-Marwil\u2019s argument, and held that, in determining whether a refugee\u2019s conviction renders him a \u201cviolent or dangerous individual,\u201d <em>In re Jean </em>requires neither a fact-based nor categorical approach, but rather requires only an \u201cadequate consideration of the nature of the refugee\u2019s crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1235. The IJ must \u201conly make an appropriate determination under the circumstances as to whether the alien is violent or dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We noted that for \u201cserious and depraved\u201d crimes, \u201cthe IJ need only consider the elements of the offense,\u201d but \u201c[sjometimes the IJ may delve into the facts and circumstances of the prior -offenses to determine whether the alien is violent or dangerous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Mustaf\u00edc argues that the BIA erred by focusing on language from the headnote in <em>In re Jean, </em>whether he committed a \u201cviolent or dangerous crime,\u201d rather than the language of the decision itself, which focuses on whether the alien is a \u201cviolent or dangerous individual.\u201d However, Mus-tafic\u2019s argument is misplaced because we have explained that in making the determination of whether an alien is a violent or dangerous individual, all <em>In re Jean </em>\u201crequires is an adequate consideration of'the nature of the refugee\u2019s crime.\u201d <em>Makir-Marwil, </em>681 F.3d at 1235. Here, the IJ and BIA adequately considered the nature of Mustaf\u00edc\u2019s conviction for vehicular homicide by examining the elements of the crime before determining that he committed a violent or dangerous crime. <em>See id. </em>Because the IJ and BIA determined that Mustaf\u00edc was a \u201cviolent or dangerous individual,\u201d the IJ and BIA correctly applied the heightened \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard. <em>See Makir-Marwil, </em>681 F.3d at 1235; <em>see also In re Jean, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 383. Thus, we deny this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">To the extent Mustaf\u00edc argues that the IJ and BIA erred in finding that he was a \u201cviolent or dangerous individual,\u201d this is a factual or discretionary determination that we do not have jurisdiction to review. In <em>Bedoya-Melendez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>680 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir.2012), we held that the battered-spouse determination under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2) was a discretionary decision, which we did not have jurisdiction to review. 680 F.3d at 1323, 1325. First, we noted that \u201c[a] question of law involves the application of an undisputed fact pattern to a legal standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1324 (internal quotation marks omitted). On the other hand, a discretionary determination \u201crequires an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>adjudicator to make a judgment call.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further stated that the definitions of \u201cbattered\u201d and \u201csubjected to extreme cruelty\u201d did not establish objective legal standards. <em>Id. </em>at 1325-26. Specifically, those phrases were \u201cnot self-explanatory and reasonable minds could differ as to their meaning\u201d in \u00a7 1229b(b)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Because there are no objective legal standards for evaluating the terms \u201cviolent or dangerous individual\u201d and because reasonable minds could differ as to the meaning of those terms, this finding is a discretionary determination. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>Bedoya-Melendez, </em>680 F.3d at 1324, 1325-26. Thus, we dismiss this portion of the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Similarly, although Mustafic\u2019s argument \u2014 that the IJ was not permitted to consider his entire criminal history in determining whether he warranted a waiver as a matter of discretion \u2014 is couched in legal terms, it amounts to a \u201cgarden-variety\u201d abuse of discretion argument because in essence it takes issue with the determination that he was not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion under the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Alvarez Acosta, </em>524 F.3d at 1196-97. Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), (a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Finally, we must address whether we have the authority to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Mustafic\u2019s motion to remand. Although Mustafic\u2019s argument \u2014 that he was entitled to remand because the IJ failed to advise him of his right to apply for asylum \u2014 invokes our jurisdiction because it presents a question of law, it is not justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">As noted earlier, we review questions concerning our jurisdiction de novo. <em>Jag-gernauth, </em>432 F.3d at 1350. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), for having been convicted of a CIMT. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). We also lack jurisdiction to review determinations made discretionary by statute, other than those related to asylum relief. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>see also Kucana, </em>558 U.S at 252-53,130 S.Ct. at 840 (concluding that the discretionary decision bar did not\u2019 apply to decisions made discretionary by regulation). In addition, we have held that the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) and (C) apply not only to appellate-court review of final orders of removal, but also to review of subsequent orders, such as motions to reopen. <em>See Guzman-Munoz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>733 F.3d 1311, 1313-14 (11th Cir.2013) (per curiam); <em>see also Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir.2003). Indeed, we have stated that motions to remand are generally treated as motions to reopen. <em>See Chacku v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Notwithstanding these statutory provisions, we retain the authority to review constitutional claims and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">On the contrary, we have explained that we do not have jurisdiction to review a question of law, where doing so would result in an advisory opinion. <em>See Malu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>11th Cir.2014, 764 F.3d 1282, 1290-91 (2014) (noting that, although the determination of whether Congolese wives were a particular social group raised a question of law, it was not justiciable because, even if we determined that they were a particular social group, the BIA concluded that the alien had not shown that she would be persecuted in the future on account of her membership in that group in any event).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Here, the regulations provide that the BIA has discretion to determine whether reopening is warranted, but must deny reopening if the right to apply for discretionary relief was \u201cfully explained\u201d to the alien. <em>See 8 C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(a), (c)(1). In denying Mustafic\u2019s motion to remand, the BIA concluded that under the circumstances of Mustafic\u2019s case, the IJ did not need to explain the right to apply for asylum relief, but in any event, Mustafic\u2019s failure to raise the issue until his applications were denied on the merits did not warrant granting the motion to reopen in the exercise of discretion. Therefore, if we reviewed whether the IJ was required to advise Mustafic of his right to apply for asylum, we would be rendering an advisory opinion because the BIA denied the motion to remand in the exercise of discretion. <em>See Main, </em>11th Cir.2014, 764 F.3d at 1290-92. Consequently, Mustafic\u2019s petition is dismissed in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
