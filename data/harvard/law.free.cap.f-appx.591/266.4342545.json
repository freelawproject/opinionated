He challenges the 16-level enhancement imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) for having been deported after being convicted of a drug trafficking offense. Gaspar argues that his Texas conviction for delivery of cocaine did not qualify as a drug trafficking offense because Texas\u2019s definition of delivery is broader than the definition of a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. He asserts that the Texas offense of delivery may be committed by \u201cadministering\u201d a controlled substance. He further contends that, for the same reasons, the Texas offense does not qualify as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Because Gaspar failed to object to the enhancement in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). To establish plain error, he must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute, and the clear or obvious error must have affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">Gaspar has failed to show that it is a realistic possibility that a person either would be prosecuted for \u201cadministering\u201d cocaine as that term is defined under the Texas statute or could \u201cadminister\u201d cocaine in a manner that did not also constitute \u201cdispensing\u201d or \u201cdistributing\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460-62 (5th Cir.2014), ce<em>rt. filed, </em>No. 14-7593 (Dec. 15, 2014). Moreover, he has identified no pri- or Texas case applying the statute in an \u201cadministering\u201d situation. <em>See id. </em>at 460-61. A theoretical possibility that a statute might encompass types of conduct that would not qualify as a drug trafficking offense is insufficient. <em>See United States v. Carrasco-Tercero, </em>745 F.3d 192, 197-98 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">Gaspar fails to show that the district court plainly erred.. <em>See Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d at 461-62 &amp; n. 5. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
