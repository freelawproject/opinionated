Trowbridge has not contested the validity of the tax liabilities or his ownership of the real property at issue. He has therefore waived those issues. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Instead, Trowbridge argues that Harris County is not in the United States and that he is not a citizen of the United States. He contends that this means the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over tax actions against residents of states and that he is not subject to federal income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">This court has already rejected as frivolous the argument that district courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over tax actions against residents of states. <em>United States v. Masat, </em>948 F.2d 928, 934 (5th Cir.1991). This court has also stated that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7602(a) and 7604, which authorize the issuance and enforcement of IRS summonses, \u201care federal laws that the district court has jurisdiction to consider under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.\u201d <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>209 Fed.Appx. 401, 402 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1340 explicitly grants district courts jurisdiction in internal revenue cases and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345 explicitly grants jurisdiction for civil suits commenced by the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Trowbridge\u2019s argument that he is not a citizen of the United States is equally frivolous. He presents \u201cshopworn arguments characteristic of tax-protestor rhetoric that has been universally rejected by this and other courts.\u201d <em>Stearman v. Commissioner, </em>436 F.3d 533, 537 (5th Cir.2006). This court has already held that the \u201ccitizens of Texas are subject to the Federal Tax Code.\u201d <em>United States v. Price, </em>798 F.2d 111, 113 (5th Cir.1986). We do not address his arguments further as there is \u201cno need to refute these arguments with somber reasoning and copious citation of precedent; to do so might suggest these arguments have some colorable merit.\u201d <em>Crain v. Commissioner, </em>737 F.2d 1417 (5th Cir.1984). They have no merit at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">This is not the first time Trowbridge has had these frivolous arguments rejected. In <em>Trowbridge et al. v. Commissioner, </em>T.C. Memo.2003-164, 2003 WL 21278475, Trow-bridge made similar arguments in contesting his 1991-1995 tax liabilities. The tax court imposed a $25,000 sanction. In contesting his 1996-1997 tax liabilities, Trow-bridge again used similar arguments in the tax court; he was sanctioned a second time. <em>Trowbridge et al. v. Commissioner, </em>T.C. Memo.2003-165, 2003 WL 21278414, at *10. Trowbridge appealed to this court and once again resorted to frivolous arguments. This court upheld the tax court\u2019s sanctions and imposed additional sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">Given Trowbridge\u2019s history of frivolous appeals, we GRANT Appellee\u2019s motion for sanctions pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 38 in the amount of $8,000. We also order that Trowbridge be barred from filing any fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ther appeals in this court until (1) the sanctions awarded by this court are fully paid; and (2) a district court certifies his appeal as having some arguable merit. <em>See Smith v. McCleod, </em>946 F.2d 417, 418 (5th Cir.1991). Trowbridge\u2019s motions are DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
