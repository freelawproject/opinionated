Based on his post-arrest statements, the revised presentence report (PSR) calculated a total drug quantity of 423.7 ounces, or 12.01 kilograms, of heroin. Using the 2013 Guidelines Manual, the revised PSR assigned him a total offense level of 39 and a Criminal History Category of III, which yielded a guidelines range of imprisonment of 324 months to 405 months. However, because the statutory maximum sentence of 20 years, <em>see </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), was less than the minimum of the guidelines range, the guidelines sentence was 240 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). Crowder now appeals his sentence. He contends that the district court failed to exclude from its calculation of total drug quantity those drugs that were intended for personal use. He also asserts that the district court overstated the total drug quantity because, in the Fort Worth area, an \u201counce\u201d of heroin is actually 25 grams, as opposed to the proper metric measure, 28.35 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-24\">' At sentencing, Crowder presented no evidence related to his purported personal use of heroin to refute the PSR\u2019s statement that the total quantity of heroin involved was 12.01 kilograms. Likewise, he provided no estimate at sentencing as to the amount of heroin intended for personal use. The PSR\u2019s estimate of total drug quantity intended for distribution was based on Crowder\u2019s own post-arrest statements. Where, as here, the defendant presents no evidence to refute the facts to which he objects, the facts contained in the PSR may be adopted by the district court without further inquiry, as long as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>have an adequate evidentiary basis. <em>United States v. Alford,, </em>142 F.3d 825, 831-32 (5th Cir.1998). Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the district court did not err, much less clearly err, in adopting the PSR\u2019s position that the total drug quantity attributable to Crowder involved an estimated 12.01 kilograms of heroin. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">As to Crowder\u2019s next argument, we note that, by his own estimates, even if his drug quantity total is calculated such that an \u201counce\u201d of heroin is only 25 grams, it would reduce the amount involved in the offense conduct to only 10.59 kilograms. This results in a base offense level of 36, which is no different than the base offense level for 12.01 kilograms of heroin. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Accordingly, we need not reach the merits of Crowder\u2019s argument. Assuming, arguendo, that the district court erred, any error was harmless, or did not affect his substantial rights, because the record demonstrates that the district court would have imposed the same sentence in the absence of any error due to the operation of the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); \u00a7 5G1.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
