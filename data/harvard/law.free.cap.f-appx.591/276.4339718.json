He argues that the district court erred in not reducing his sentence for the two months he served in immigration custody following his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-18\">Lopez-Trevino has completed his term of imprisonment, has been released from custody, and has been removed to Mexico. The appeal of his sentence is therefore moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal as moot is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-23\">MOTION GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
