Billard, </em>852 So.2d 1069, 1070-71 (La.Ct.App. 2003); <em>Billard v. Kling, </em>2011 WL 497175,1 (La.Ct.App. Feb. 11, 2011). The state filed a multiple bill charge as to the first count. Billard pleaded guilty, after which the trial judge vacated Billard\u2019s previous armed robbery sentence on that count and resen-tenced him as a multiple offender to 50 years at hard labor, without benefit of probation, suspension of sentence, or good time, to run concurrently with any other sentence that Billard was serving. <em>Id. </em>Bil-lard\u2019s sentence on the second count was unchanged. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-21\">In the instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, Billard challenged, among other things, his 50-year sentence following his guilty plea to the multiple offender bill, arguing that his guilty plea to the multiple offender bill was rendered involuntary and not knowing when the sentencing court advised him, incorrectly, that he would be eligible for parole. This court granted Billard a certificate of appealability to appeal this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-22\">To obtain habeas relief, Billard must show \u201cactual prejudice\u201d as a result of the alleged constitutional infringement, <em>ie., </em>that it had \u201csubstantial and injurious effect.\u201d <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993); <em>Hogue v. Johnson, </em>131 F.3d 466, 499 (5th Cir.1997). Given that Billard remains incarcerated on the concurrent 50-year sentence he received on the second armed robbery count and that, under Louisiana Revised Statute \u00a7 14:64, his sentence must be served without parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, he cannot make the required showing. <em>See Williams v. Maggio, </em>714 F.2d 554, 556 (5th Cir.1983). We pretermit deciding the respondent\u2019s procedural defenses. <em>See Busby v. Dretke, </em>359 F.3d 708, 720 (5th Cir.2004). Billard\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
