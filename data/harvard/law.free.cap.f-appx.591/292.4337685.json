We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-25\">Our consideration of the district court\u2019s April 7, 2014 Order Granting Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment, in support of its Final Judgment of April 8, 2014, as well as the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal, convinces us that the district court made no reversible error in reaching its decision to grant Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. More specifically, Harmon\u2019s speech was not \u201cpublic speech\u201d protected by the First Amendment; the conduct of Defendants Bounds and Hardeman that Harmon alleged was retaliation did not rise to the level of severity sufficient to chill the speech of a person of \u201cordinary firmness\u201d; the court\u2019s denial of Harmon\u2019s tardy Motion for Leave to File Pleadings and Additional Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>was not an abuse of discretion; there is no evidence that Harmon\u2019s alleged prot\u00e9cted speech motivated Bounds\u2019s alleged staring at her or Hardeman\u2019s telephoning Harmon\u2019s employer about her disruptive behavior in the pick-up line at the subject school; Bounds and Hardeman were entitled to qualified immunity; and neither Bounds\u2019s staring nor Hardeman\u2019s phone call reflected the official policy or custom of the school board for purposes of Section 1983. Thus, for essentially the same reasons set forth in detail by the district court in its abovesaid order, the Judgment of that court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
