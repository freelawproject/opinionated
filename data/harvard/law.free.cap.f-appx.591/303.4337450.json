California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Sykes has filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief, the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, and Sykes\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The written judgment contains a clerical error. The district court found that Sykes had violated a special condition that he \u201cparticipate in a program of testing and/or treatment for drug abuse.\u201d The written judgment incorrectly identifies that condition as Special Condition No. 2 rather than No. 1. Accordingly, we REMAND for correction of the error in accordance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. <em>See United States v. Higgins, </em>739 F.3d 733, 739 n. 16 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2319, 189 L.Ed.2d 196 (2014); <em>United States v. Pouncy, </em>539 Fed.Appx. 437, 438 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Rosales, </em>448 Fed.Appx. 466, 466-67 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
