Because this court recently answered this question in the negative, we reverse and remand the district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-18\">Scott Barr, DDS, filed a putative class action against The Harvard Drug Company, LLC (HDC) for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227. Before Barr moved for class certification, HDC made an offer of judgment, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 68, for the maximum monetary damages for Barr\u2019s individual cause of action, an injunction to prevent future violations of the Act, and an entry of a judgment. Barr did not accept the offer and instead moved for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-19\">Thereafter, HDC moved to dismiss the complaint as moot. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). The district court found Barr\u2019s claims moot and dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-20\">When reviewing a court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as moot, we review factual findings for clear error and the legal issue <em>de novo. Stein v. Buccaneers Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>772 F.3d 698, 701 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-21\">Our recent decision in <em>Jeffrey Stein, D.D.S., M.S.D., P.A. v. Buccaneers Limited Partnership, </em>controls this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 772 F.3d at 704, 709. In <em>Buccaneers Limited, </em>the named plaintiff received an offer of judgment under Rule 68 before the plaintiff moved for class certification. The plaintiff then rejected the offer. <em>Id. </em>at 700-01. We held that the unaccepted offer of judgment under Rule 68 did not render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>the named plaintiffs complaint moot. <em>Id. </em>at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The facts in the instant case are the same in all relevant respects. Accordingly, based on <em>Buccaneers Limited, </em>HDC\u2019s offer of judgment did not render Barr\u2019s complaint moot. We therefore REVERSE the order of dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-16\">. HDC argues that Barr waived any argument concerning mootness by not raising it in his opposition to the motion to dismiss. We disagree because \"we have an independent obligation to assure ourselves of the justiciability of a controversy under Article III.\u201d <em>Doe v. Wooten, </em>747 F.3d 1317, 1322 n. 3 (11th Cir.2014) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
