In his petition, he argues that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum because it includes a term of supervised release on top of his statutory-maximum term of imprisonment. The district court' dismissed Simmons\u2019s petition because it was second or successive and he failed to satisfy the savings clause. Simmons argues this was error. He contends that he satisfies the savings clause because circuit precedent at one time foreclosed his claim but has since been overruled by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number><em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) is a jurisdictional question that we review <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). To satisfy the savings clause, a petitioner must prove that \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). As we have long explained, to prove that \u00a7 2255 was inade-. quate. or ineffective, a petitioner must, among other things, make two showings: (1) that circuit precedent squarely foreclosed his claim at the time of his first \u00a7 2255 motion; and (2) that a retroactive Supreme Court decision later overturned that precedent. <em>See id. </em>at 1274 (\u201cTo show his prior \u00a7 2255 motion was \u2018inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u2019 Bryant must establish that ... subsequent to his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision ... overturned our Circuit precedent that had squarely foreclosed [his] ... claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">The purpose of the savings clause is to create a narrow portal for petitioners to bring, via \u00a7 2241, habeas claims that they had no opportunity to raise earlier via \u00a7 2255. <em>Cf. Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1319 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc) (\u201cThe actual holding of the <em>Wofford </em>decision, which is undoubtedly correct, is simply that the savings clause does not cover sentence claims that could have been raised in earlier proceedings.\u201d). If the Supreme Court overturned the foreclosing circuit precedent <em>before </em>a petitioner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, he necessarily had an opportunity to raise that claim \u2014 via \u00a7 2255. A petitioner with such an opportunity cannot show that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">Simmons is this sort of petitioner. He rests his savings-clause argument on <em>Johnson. </em>But <em>Johnson </em>was decided in May 2000, before he filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion in March 2001. Even if we were to assume that <em>Johnson </em>overturns relevant circuit precedent, and that Simmons meets the other savings-clause requirements, <em>see Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274, he cannot make the dual showings discussed above: that circuit precedent foreclosed his claim during his \u00a7 2255 proceeding, and that the Supreme Court later overturned that precedent. He could have, but did not, raise this <em>Johnson </em>claim in his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding. That proceeding therefore gave him an opportunity to raise his claim, so it was not \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>court properly dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-6\">. Simmons also argues that the district court erred by construing his petition as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. He says his petition is neither second nor successive because his previous motions to vacate (there have been at least five) were not decided on the merits. This is, as the district court noted, clearly contradicted by the record. A \u00a7 2255 motion is \"second or successive\u201d if \u201ca petitioner could have raised his or her claim for relief in an earlier filed motion, but without a legitimate excuse, failed to do so.\u201d <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>754 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.2014). Simmons's <em>Johnson </em>claim was available and ripe as soon as <em>Johnson </em>was decided, in 2000, but he did not raise it in his first \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, which he filed in 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-10\">. Simmons argues for the first time in his reply brief that his petition challenges the execution of his sentence, so he need not satisfy the savings clause. We generally do not consider arguments raised for the first time in an appellant's reply brief and decline to do so here. <em>See Herring v. Sec'y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>397 F.3d 1338, 1342 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
