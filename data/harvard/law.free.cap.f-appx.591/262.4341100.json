Perez argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>that the district court plainly erred in assessing four criminal history points for two 2003 convictions when the original sentences for those convictions were imposed more than 10 years prior to the commencement of his illegal reentry offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Perez has completed his term of imprisonment, has been released from custody, and has been removed to Mexico. Therefore, the appeal of his sentence is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
