Mr. Bain appeals six of the district court\u2019s evidentia-ry rulings at trial. Mr. Eady does not appeal his conviction. Instead, he challenges the district court\u2019s sentencing determination that he was an armed career criminal. He argues that his prior conviction of felony battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041(1) should not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">On June 30, 2013, Detective Derek Rodriguez of the City of Miami Gardens Police Department saw a man holding a long rifle standing next to a car parked on the side of the road. Detective Rodriguez thought he recognized the man as Henry Carter, a person of interest in a criminal investigation. In fact, the man was later identified as Lloyd Hulse. Detective Rodriguez activated his police vehicle lights and ordered Mr. Hulse to drop his weapon. Mr. Hulse threw the rifle into the car\u2019s back seat through an open rear door and raised his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">Two other detectives and FBI Special Agent Brett McDaniel accompanied Detective Rodriguez to the car. Three men were seated inside: Andre Beach in the front driver\u2019s seat, Mr. Eady in the front passenger\u2019s seat, and Mr. Bain in the back seat. The officers found three firearms inside the car: a Glock Model 27 .40 caliber handgun lying on the floor of the front passenger seat next to Mr. Eady, a Glock Model 22 .40 caliber handgun under the front passenger seat and partially sticking out the back of the seat next to Mr. Bain; and the AR-15 rifle Mr. Hulse threw in the back seat next to Mr. Bain.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">A federal grand jury indicted Mr. Hulse, Mr. Bain, and Mr. Eady each on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Mr. Hulse pled guilty, while Mr. Bain and Mr. Eady proceeded to trial. The government presented testimony from the arresting officers, DNA evidence from the firearms, recordings of Mr. Bain\u2019s phone calls from jail, and evidence that Mr. Bain and Mr. Eady each had a prior felony conviction involving a firearm. Mr. Bain called one witness, Travonna Shantavia Gosier, who testified that she spent several hours alone with Mr. Bain until moments before the officers found him in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">The jury found Mr. Bain guilty, and the district court sentenced him to 111 months in prison. The jury also found Mr. Eady guilty. At sentencing, the district court determined that Mr. Eady was an armed career criminal under the ACCA. The court found Mr. Eady had three prior violent felony convictions: (1) aggravated assault with a firearm; (2) strong arm robbqry; and (3) felony battery. Mr. Eady objected to his felony battery conviction being considered a violent felony under the ACCA. After concluding that felony battery was a violent felony, the district court sentenced Mr. Eady to 188 months, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the low end of the guideline range for his criminal history category and total offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Both Mr. Bain and Mr. Eady timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">To prove a defendant is guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt \u201c(1) that the defendant was a convicted felon; (2) that the defendant was in knowing possession of a firearm; and (3) that the firearm was in or affecting interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1279 (11th Cir.2003). Mr. Bain does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Mr. Bain argues instead that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court erred in six of its evidentiary rulings. Specifically, he asserts that the district court wrongfully (1) admitted evidence that he was previously convicted of a felony involving a firearm; (2) prevented him from asking a detective a question on cross examination under the rule of completeness; (3) allowed the government to ask a burden-shifting question on cross-examination; (4) excluded evidence that Mr. Beach had a prior felony conviction; (5) excluded evidence of Mr. Hulse\u2019s guilty plea; and (6) violated his Confrontation Clause rights by admitting DNA evidence without testimony from the crime scene investigator who collected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">We start with Mr. Bain\u2019s arguments regarding the district court\u2019s nonconstitu-tional evidentiary rulings before discussing his argument regarding the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Malol, </em>476 F.3d 1283, 1291 (11th Cir.2007). But \u201c[e]ven if an abuse of discretion is shown, nonconstitu-tional evidentiary errors are not grounds for reversal absent a reasonable likelihood that the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were affected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A defendant\u2019s substantial rights are not affected \u201c[w]here there is overwhelming evidence of guilt\u201d or where the error had only \u201ca very slight effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>See also United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1266 n. 20 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(explaining that erroneous evidentiary rulings are not reversible if they do not have a \u201csubstantial influence ... or leave grave doubt as to whether they affected the outcome of a case\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">First, Mr. Bain challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion in limine to exclude a prior felony conviction of his that involved a firearm. In September of 2010, Mr. Bain was convicted in state court of attempted second-degree murder involving the discharge of a firearm. The government filed a notice of intent to offer evidence of the conviction under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) to show that Mr. Bain\u2019s possession was knowing and intentional. Mr. Bain moved to exclude the evidence, arguing that his prior crime was not closely related enough to his pending charges to be admissible. The district court denied Mr. Bain\u2019s motion. It allowed the government to admit into evidence the fact that Mr. Bain was previously convicted of a felony involving the knowing and intentional possession of a firearm. The jury was not informed, however, that Mr. Bain\u2019s conviction was for attempted second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">We use a three-part test to determine whether a district court abused its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>tion by admitting evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior bad acts under Rule 404(b): (1) \u201cthe evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character\u201d; (2) \u201cthere must be sufficient proof so that a jury could find that the defendant committed the extrinsic act\u201d; and (3) the evidence must have probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice and meet other Rule 403 requirements. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>959 F.2d 1535, 1538 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc). A logical connection exists between a convicted felon\u2019s knowing possession of a firearm at one time and the felon\u2019s knowledge that a firearm was present at a later time or that the subsequent possession was not accidental. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1281 (11th Cir.2003). And the government is permitted to use qualifying Rule 404(b) evidence to show intent when a defendant pleads not guilty and fail to remove intent as an issue. <em>See United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1345 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Here, Mr. Bain put both his intent and knowledge at issue by pleading not guilty and arguing that he did not know that firearms were present in the car. The district court excluded the prejudicial nature of Mr. Bain\u2019s attempted second-degree murder conviction and limited the evidence to the fact that Mr. Bain had a prior felony conviction involving the knowing possession of a firearm. And the district court appropriately instructed the jury that it could not consider Mr. Bain\u2019s prior conviction to prove that he was guilty of the current crime but only to prove Mr. Bain\u2019s state of mind. In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Next, Mr. Bain argues that the district court abused its discretion by sustaining the government\u2019s objection when he asked Special Agent McDaniel a question on cross examination. While Mr. Bain was in custody, he made more than one hundred phone calls that were recorded. Portions of Mr. Bain\u2019s recorded calls were played for the jury and admitted into evidence. Mr. Bain made statements that he needed to \u201cget another hammer,\u201d that he needed to get back his \u201cwalk around,\u201d and that the police took his \u201cbaby, with that green beam on it.\u201d Special Agent McDaniel testified at trial that a \u201chammer\u201d and a \u201cwalk around\u201d are slang terms for guns and that one of the guns seized from the car had a laser that shot a green beam.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">During cross examination, Mr. Bain asked Special Agent McDaniel whether \u201cin listening to those hundreds of recordings at no point in time did you ever hear Mr. Bain ever make a statement stating that he knew that guns were in the car, correct?\u201d The government objected on the basis of hearsay. Mr. Bain argued that he should be allowed to ask the question under the rule of completeness. The district court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Mr. Bain does not argue that the government\u2019s hearsay objection was improper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues only that he should have been able to ask his question under the rule of completeness. The rule of completeness, as codified in the Federal Rules of Evidence, states that \u201c[i]f a party introduces all or part of a ... recorded statement, an adverse party may require the introduction, at that time, of any other part \u2014 or any other writing or recorded statement \u2014 that in fairness ought to be considered at the same time.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 106. The rule \u201cpermits introduction only of additional material that is relevant and is necessary to qualify, explain, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>place into context the portion already introduced.\u201d <em>United States v. Simms, </em>385 F.3d 1347, 1359 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Mr. Bain did not ask to admit into evidence any additional portions of his recorded phone calls and does not argue on appeal that any other part of the recordings was \u201cnecessary to qualify, explain, or place into context\u201d what he meant when he spoke about a needing to get a \u201chammer\u201d or a \u201cwalk around\u201d or losing his \u201cbaby, with that green beam on it.\u201d Instead, he wanted the jury to know that he did not admit to knowing that guns were in the car. Although the lack of a statement acknowledging the presence of guns might be relevant to Mr. Bain\u2019s guilt, it was not necessary to explain the portions of the phone calls admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Further, even if the district court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion, it did not affect Mr. Bain\u2019s substantial rights. Because he never made the statement during a recorded phone call, Mr. Bain was free to argue to the jury that the 'government offered no evidence that he ever admitted to knowing the guns were in the car. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Next, Mr. Bain appeals the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Eady\u2019s request to admit evidence that Mr. Beach had a prior felony conviction involving the knowing and intentional possession of a firearm. Mr. Bain also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Eady\u2019s request to admit evidence that Mr. Hulse pled guilty to being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. Mr. Bain adopted Mr. Eady\u2019s arguments and objections on these two issues during the trial. We review these issues for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Mr. Bain\u2019s arguments on these two issues lack merit. Mr. Beach was not a witness for either the government or the defense, and was not charged in the indictment. Moreover, there was no testimony or evidence that Mr. Beach possessed the firearms in the car. Nonetheless, Mr. Eady sought to introduce irrelevant evidence about Mr. Beach\u2019s prior firearms-related felony conviction. Given the circumstances, the district court properly ruled the evidence was prohibited character evidence under Rule 404(b) and misleading and confusing to the jury under Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Similarly, Mr. Eady wanted to ask Special Agent McDaniel whether Mr. Hulse \u2014 a codefendant \u2014 had pled guilty. The district court properly ruled Mr. Eady was soliciting inadmissible hearsay testimony. Additionally, there was a substantial likelihood that knowledge of Mr. Hulse\u2019s guilty plea would confuse and mislead the jury. <em>See United States v. Griffin, </em>778 F.2d 707, 710 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cDue to the extreme and unfair prejudice suffered by defendants ... courts and prosecutors generally are forbidden from mentioning that a codefendant has either pled guilty or been convicted.\u201d). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence of Mr. Beach\u2019s prior conviction or Mr. Hulse\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Next, Mr. Bain argues that the government impermissibly shifted the burden of proof when it asked a defense witness whether anyone could corroborate her testimony. Ms. Gosier was a former girlfriend of Mr. Bain\u2019s. She testified that she spent several hours with Mr. Bain at her house prior to his arrest. She then drove him home. She also testified that she lived with her parents. On cross examination, the government asked whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>\u201canyone [existed] who can say whether or not [Mr.] Bain was at your'house besides you?\u201d Mr. Bain objected. The district court overruled his objection. Ms. Gosier then testified that no one else could confirm that Mr. Bain was at her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Where a defendant objects to the government\u2019s cross examination questions on the basis of improper burden shifting, we review the claim <em>de novo. See United, States v. Schmitz, </em>634 F.3d 1247, 1266-67 (11th Cir.2011). Prosecutorial misconduct occurs when the government\u2019s remarks are improper, and those remarks prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>149 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Under the first prong, \u201ca prosecutor may not comment about the absence of witnesses or otherwise attempt to shift the burden of proof....\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1439 (11th Cir.1998). Under the second prong, prejudice exists when there is a reasonable probability that but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would be different. <em>See Wilson, </em>149 F.3d at 1301. Importantly, \u201cclear and repeated instructions on the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof\u2019 will \u201ccure[] any possibility of prejudice.\u201d <em>Schmitz, </em>634 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\"> We doubt that' the government\u2019s question about whether anyone could corroborate that Mr. Bain spent time at Ms. Gosier\u2019s house constituted a. comment on the absence of witnesses sufficient to improperly shift the burden of proof. But even if it did, it is not reasonable to conclude, based on the evidence admitted, that the outcome of Mr. Bain\u2019s trial would be different had the question not been asked. Additionally, the district court properly instructed the jury that Mr. Bain was not required to present any evidence during trial and that the government had the burden of proof. Thus, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">Finally, Mr.' Bain appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his objection regarding testimony about DNA results. The facts relevant to this claim are as follows. Special Agent McDaniel testified that he was present when another FBI agent took DNA samples from Mr. Bain and Mr. Eady. He saw the other agent place the samples in a secure evidence envelope. Detective Rodriguez' testified that he directed a crime scene investigator to take DNA samples of the Glock Model 22 .40 caliber handgun and Glock Model 27 .40 caliber handgun found in the car when Mr. Bain and Mr. Eady were arrested. The crime scene investigator apparently prepared property receipts for the DNA evidence. But the crime scene investigator was not called to testify, and the property receipts were not admitted into evidence. Later the government called Toby Wolson, a criminalist supervisor in the Miami Dade Police Department Crime Laboratory. Mr. Wolson was qualified without objection as an expert in DNA analysis and comparison. He testified that the DNA samples arrived with property receipts that identified the origin of the sample and the people who handled the items from their creation to their delivery to him. The property receipts indicated that two of the swabs were from the Glock Model- 22 .40 caliber handgun and Glock Model 27 .40 caliber handgun found in the car. Other swabs were from Mr. Eady and Mr. Bain.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Mr. Bain objected several times that Mr. Wolson\u2019s testimony regarding the DNA swabs from the two guns was hearsay and based on a lack of a proper chain of custody. Mr. Bain never mentioned the Confrontation Clause. The government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>argued that any defects in the chain of custody went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The district court overruled Mr. Bain\u2019s objections and allowed Mr. Wolson\u2019s testimony. Mr. Wolson testified that Mr. Bain\u2019s DNA could not be excluded as having contributed to the samples from the two guns, there was a 25% probability that Mr. Bain contributed to the DNA on the Glock Model 27 .40 caliber handgun, and there was a 20% probability that Mr. Bain contributed to the DNA sample from the Glock Model 22 .40 caliber handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Mr. Bain argues that the district court erred when it allowed Mr. Wolson to testify without calling the crime scene investigator who collected the DNA samples, and without admitting into evidence the written property receipts. He argues that Mr. Wolson\u2019s testimony regarding the property receipts was hearsay and was not supported by a proper predicate or a chain of custody. As support, Mr. Bain cites cases involving the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">We review preserved Confrontation Clause errors <em>de novo. See United States v. Curbelo, </em>726 F.3d 1260, 1271-72 (11th Cir.2013). If, however, defense counsel made only a hearsay objection and failed to make a timely Confrontation Clause objection, we review for only plain error. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1207 &amp; n. 12 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cUnder plain error review, we cannot correct an error that was not raised at trial unless: (1) there was error; (2) that was plain; (3) that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) we determine that it that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Charles, </em>722 F.3d 1319, 1322 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">To the extent Mr. Bain asserts a violation of the Confrontation Clause because the crime scene investigator did not testify, the government is not required to produce every witness \u201cwho laid hands on the evidence.\u201d <em>See Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 311 n. 1, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009) (\u201c[W]e do not hold, and it is not the ease, that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing device, must appear in person as part of the prosecution\u2019s case....\u201d). Unlike the cases Mr. Bain cites, the government here made the person who tested the DNA available for cross examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Insofar as Mr. Bain argues that the Confrontation Clause required the government to admit into evidence written property receipts establishing the chain of custody, he is wrong. The Confrontation Clause assures defendants the right to test evidence through cross examination. <em>See Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 61, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) (requiring that reliability be \u201ctested in the crucible of cross-examination\u201d). The Confrontation Clause does not require the government to introduce documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">Finally, even if the admission of Mr. Wolson\u2019s testimony was a constitutional error, it did not affect Mr. Bain\u2019s substantial rights. The testimony revealed a 20-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>25% probability that Mr. Bain contributed to the DNA found on the two Glock handguns. This evidence had a minor effect, if any, given that the jury heard recorded phone calls in which Mr. Bain talked about needing more guns and that the police took his \u201cbaby\u201d away. Thus, Mr. Bain is not entitled to reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Mr. Eady appeals the district court\u2019s determination that he was an armed career criminal under the ACCA. Specifically, he objects to the district court\u2019s ruling that his conviction for felony battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041(1) is a qualifying felony under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1254 (11th Cir.2009). The ACCA provides that a defendant convicted of being-a felon in possession of a firearm, and who has three prior convictions \u201cfor a violent felony,\u201d is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of at least 15 years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\u201d which also (1) \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d; or (2) \u201cis burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). These two prongs are known as the elements and residual clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The United States Supreme Court has defined \u201cphysical force\u201d under the elements clause as <em>\u201cviolent </em>force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court held that simple felony battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03 is not a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1271-72. Because a violation of \u00a7 784.03 can be proven in multiple ways, and the lessor of the violations involves \u201conly the slightest unwanted physical touch,\u201d simple battery is not a violent felony under the ACCA, provided the government cannot show through S/iepard-approved documents that the defendant\u2019s conviction was based on more violent acts. <em>Id. </em>at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">Mr. Eady asks us to rule the same for felony battery under \u00a7 784.041(1). We decline to do so. Although simple felony battery does not require actual harm to the victim, felony battery under \u00a7 784.041 does. The latter statute requires that the offender (1) \u201c[ajctually and intentionally touch[ ] or strike[ ] another person\u201d; <em>and </em>(2) \u201ccause[ ] great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041(1) (emphasis added). Thus, unlike convictions for simple felony battery where no injury is required, convictions under \u00a7 784.041 require significant bodily harm, disability, or disfigurement. It is incorrect to say that a person can \u201cactually and intentionally\u201d hit another person <em>and </em>cause \u201cgreat bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement\u201d' without using \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">Even if \u00a7 784.041(1) does not meet the requirements of the elements clause, it certainly meets the requirements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>residual clause. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (requiring \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d). <em>See also Begay v. United States, </em>558 U.S. 137, 144-45, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (holding that crimes must include \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct\u201d to constitute violent felonies under the ACCA). Felony battery under \u00a7 784.041(1) requires not just a \u201cpotential risk\u201d of physical injury, but also that the physical injury actually occur. And an intentional battery that causes \u201cgreat bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement\u201d will ordinarily be committed by conduct that is purposeful, violent, and aggressive. <em>See United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1254 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that under the residual clause, we evaluate how the crime is \u201cordinarily committed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Mr. Eady, however, asks us to consider that, although he pled guilty to felony battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041(1), he was initially charged with a lewd and lascivious offense against a minor under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(4), an offense that is not a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>608 F.3d 1222, 1233 (11th Cir.2010). Unfortunately for Mr. Eady, we cannot do so. First, we do not look at the crime for which a defendant was initially charged. Second, nor do we look at any other <em>Shepard- </em>approved documents. \u201c[Sentencing courts may not apply the modified categorical approach when the crime of which the defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of elements.\u201d <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2282, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). Because felony battery under \u00a7 784.041 has a single, indivisible set of elements, we apply only the categorical approach discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">For the above reasons, felony battery under Florida Statutes \u00a7 784.041(1) is a qualifying violent felony under the ACCA. We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">The conviction of Mr. Bain and the sentence of Mr. Eady are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">. We therefore do not address whether a district court should sustain a hearsay objection to a question asking whether a declarant never made a certain statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\">. It is not entirely clear whether Mr. Bain is asserting a Confrontation Clause violation on appeal or simply citing cases involving the Confrontation Clause to make his argument about hearsay and a lack of a chain of custody. But Mr. Bain does not make any substantial argument on hearsay grounds, so we consider it abandoned. To the extent Mr. Bain raises an objection regarding the chain of custody, \"gaps in the chain of custody affect only the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility.\" <em>United States v. Roberson, </em>897 F.2d 1092, 1096 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\">. Mr. Eady's argument that \u00a7 784.041(1)\u2014 unlike aggravated felony battery under \u00a7 784.075 \u2014 lacks an intent to cause great bodily harm is unavailing. The elements clause requires only that the physical force be \u201ccapable of causing physical pain or injury to another person,\u201d not that the use of such force be coupled with an intention to injure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
