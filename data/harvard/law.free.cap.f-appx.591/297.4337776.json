They do not challenge dismissal of the asylum or withholding-of-removal claims; therefore, these claims are waived. <em>E.g., Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"A8-r\">Review of factual findings underlying the conclusion that an alien is not eligible for relief under CAT is conducted pursuant to the substantial-evidence standard. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). Under that standard, we may not reverse unless \u201cthe evidence supports a contrary conclusion ... [and] <em>compels </em>it\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ASK\">Petitioners assert: they are likely to be tortured if they return to Mexico; and the Mexican government will disregard such torture. The evidence, however, shows: criminals extorted Vasquez once; and, although these criminals do not possess the deed they demanded from Vasquez, they control the land to which the deed applies. The conclusory assertion that Vasquez or his family will be tortured if they return to Mexico and that such torture will be with the consent or acquiescence of the Mexican government is insufficient to compel a conclusion different from that reached by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"AUy\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AlK\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
