On appeal, she contends that the district court erred by refusing to grant an offense-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We will affirm the sentencing court\u2019s decision not to give credit for acceptance of responsibility \u201cunless it is without foundation, a standard of review more deferential than the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>518 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The record shows that Pore violated a condition of pretrial release by possessing a computer. More significantly, the presentence report recounted ample, reliable, and unrebutted evidence to show, for present purposes, that Pore embarked on a new fraud scheme after her arrest for the instant fraud offense. These are grounds for denying credit for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Rickett, </em>89 F.3d 224, 227 (5th Cir.1996). The decision to deny credit for acceptance was not without a foundation. <em>See Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d at 211. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
