(\u201cTCI\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-19\">TCI is the obligor on a promissory note secured by a mortgage on a 200-unit apartment complex in Holland, Ohio. The note and mortgage are held in trust by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-20\">After TCI filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition, Wells Fargo asserted a proof of claim in the amount of $15,064,672.83, which included $4,905,246.82 in compound interest. TCI argued that the promissory note only permits the accrual of simple interest, but the bankruptcy court found Wells Fargo\u2019s calculations of its claim to be credible and rejected TCI\u2019s simple-interest argument as untimely. After the bankruptcy court accepted Wells Fargo\u2019s claim, TCI\u2019s plan of reorganization was no longer adequate; the bankruptcy court thus dismissed it with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-21\">TCI appealed to the district court. The district court affirmed because it interpreted the promissory note to compel the imposition of compound interest. It was therefore unnecessary for the district court to address whether the bankruptcy court erred when it found TCI\u2019s argument to be untimely. TCI now appeals to this court. Because we agree with the district court\u2019s interpretation of the promissory note, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-22\">In bankruptcy proceedings, we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Matters of contract interpretation are questions of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-23\">The promissory note, by its terms, is governed by Illinois law. Under Illinois law compound interest is disfavored: \u201cOnly when no statutory bar is present and <em>the parties specifically agree </em>to compound interest may such interest be ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>plied.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because there is no relevant statutory bar under Illinois law, we must determine whether the parties specifically agreed to the accrual of compound interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Compound interest is \u201c[ijnterest paid on both the principal and the previously accumulated interest.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The relevant portion of the promissory note, \u00a7 4.2, reads: \u201cSo long as an Event of Default remains outstanding: (a) interest shall accrue at the Default Rate and, to the extent not paid when due, shall be added to the Principal Amount....\u201d The note also sets forth an interest rate of twelve percent in the event of TCI\u2019s default. The promissory note thus describes compound interest because it stipulates that after a default by TCI, the unpaid accrued interest would be added to the \u201cPrincipal Amount,\u201d and therefore, the subsequently accruing interest at twelve percent would accrue on a principal including previously accumulated interest. Therefore, the parties explicitly agreed, without using the term \u201ccompound interest,\u201d to the accrual of compound interest by describing how such interest would be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">TCI, however, interprets the language of the promissory note differently. It asserts that \u00a7 4.2 \u201cmerely indicates that any unpaid interest will be added to the principal amount as the total debt due,\u201d and that agreements to compound interest must explicitly state that interest added to principal becomes interest bearing. But, TCI\u2019s interpretation would render \u00a7 4.2 superfluous. Before it defaulted, TCI owed Wells Fargo both the principal and unpaid accrued interest. If we accepted TCI\u2019s interpretation, \u00a7 4.2 would have no actual effect because it would operate only to label the accrued interest as money owed by TCI to Wells Fargo, and the interest was already owed. Additionally, even without the words \u201cbecomes interest bearing\u201d in the contract, there is no further significance to adding interest to principal other than to render that interest interest-bearing. Under Illinois law, and general rules of contract interpretation, courts should avoid interpreting contract terms as redundant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u00a7 4.2\u2019s remedy of adding accrued interest to the principal amount must be read as a description of compounding interest, rather than a reaffirmation of TCI\u2019s obligation to pay accrued interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
