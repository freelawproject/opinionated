The district court, in a single order, denied both motions as untimely, and alternatively, on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-18\">On appeal, Ms. Lattimore does not con- / test the district court\u2019s finding that her post-judgment motions were untimely, nor does she dispute the district court\u2019s conclusion that her motions for reconsideration failed on the merits. While we construe \u201cbriefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (citations omitted). By failing to address the district court\u2019s rulings in her initial brief, Ms. Lattimore has abandoned any challenge to them on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-20\">Rather than address the district court\u2019s bases for denying her motions, Ms. Lati-more makes numerous arguments regarding the merits of her underlying case and raises new claims against Bank of America. We have held that \u201cexcept when we invoke the \u2018plain error doctrine,\u2019 which rarely applies in civil cases, we do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Ledford v. Peeples, </em>657 F.3d 1222, 1258 (11th Cir.2011). Accordingly, we decline to address the issues Ms. Lattimore raises in her initial brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-26\">.
