Thereafter, Lavergne filed a civil rights complaint against the Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal Judges Jimmie C. Peters, Billy Howard Ez\u00e9ll, J. David Painter, and Clerk of Court Charles K. McNeely. The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim because the defendants were entitled to immunity and because the district court lacked the authority to grant the requested injunctive relief against the defendants. Additionally, the district court dismissed the claims Lavergne asserted under Louisiana state law without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-18\">On appeal, Lavergne contends that the district court for the Western District of Louisiana erred in denying his motions to amend his complaint and to transfer his case from the Lafayette Division to the Lake Charles Division. This court reviews a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo, applying the same standard that is used to review a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998) (per curiam). Questions of whether a defendant is entitled to immunity are likewise reviewed de novo. <em>Hale v. King, </em>642 F.3d 492, 497 (5th Cir.2011) (per cu-riam).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-19\">Lavergne has not challenged the district court\u2019s determination that Lavergne\u2019s claims against the defendants fail to state a claim because the defendants are entitled to immunity, that the district court did not have the authority to grant Lavergne\u2019s requested injunctive relief, that the district court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Lavergne\u2019s state law claims, or that allowing Lavergne to amend his complaint would be futile because the defendants are entitled to immunity. Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Lavergne has therefore failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying Lavergne\u2019s motion to amend his complaint. <em>Leal v. McHugh, </em>731 F.3d 405, 417 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>592 F.3d 675, 681 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Cir.2009) (per curiam). Additionally, Lavergne\u2019s unsupported assertion that venue was improper in the Lafayette Division is insufficient to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to transfer. <em>See Broussard v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>523 F.3d 618, 631 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Smith-Bowman, </em>76 F.3d 634, 637 (5th Cir.1996). To the extent Lavergne raises new claims on appeal, we do not address them. <em>See Williams v. Ballard, </em>466 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
