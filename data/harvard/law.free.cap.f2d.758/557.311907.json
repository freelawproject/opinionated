The sole issue raised is whether the district court erred in granting the government\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude Ware from presenting evidence that his Florida civil rights were restored after his state felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">The district court properly ruled that this evidence would be excluded. In <em>Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 103 S.Ct. 986, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983), the Supreme Court clearly held that postconviction state actions, such as ex-punctions, which grant certain relief from the effects of a state conviction, do not remove the federal firearms disabilities imposed by section 922(h)(1), because the application of section 922 is not dependent on state law. <em>Id. </em>at 118-21, 103 S.Ct. at 994-96. Therefore, the fact that Florida restored appellant\u2019s civil rights would be immaterial and irrelevant to a prosecution under section 922(h)(1). Furthermore, whether the appellant had actual, subjective knowledge that he was breaking the law by receiving the firearms is irrelevant, since knowledge is not an element of the crime defined by section 922(h). <em>United States v. Giles, </em>640 F.2d 621, 627 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981). Therefore, appellant\u2019s belief that Florida\u2019s restoration of his state civil rights permitted him to lawfully receive firearms would be irrelevant and, thus, inadmissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-17\">Since appellant's assertions are without merit, his conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
