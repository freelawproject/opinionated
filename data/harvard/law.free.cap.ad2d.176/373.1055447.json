The charges stemmed from drug transactions occurring on April 15 and 16, 1987 in a Sullivan County motel, which were arranged by a confidential police informant who had cooperated with the police on several successful drug investigations in the past. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The informant purchased a gram of cocaine from defendant on April 15, 1987. The next day, the informant met defendant in his motel room and paid $900 in marked bills for additional narcotics. Following this latter transaction, surveillance police officers attempted to arrest defendant outside of his motel room as he was leaving. Rather than submit to arrest, however, defendant reportedly \"dove\u201d back into the room and \"slammed\u201d the door. Through the slats in the Venetian blinds on the motel room window, an officer observed defendant in the bathroom area with his hand in the toilet. A police officer then kicked open the motel room door, pulled defendant away from the toilet and discovered inside the toilet bowl a bag containing 70 packets of heroin, six foil bags of cocaine and $860 in marked $20 bills. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of all counts and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\">Although defendant raises numerous arguments on appeal, the majority do not require extended discussion. <em>In our </em>view, County Court correctly concluded that sufficient probable cause existed to support the attempt by the police to make a warrantless arrest of defendant outside his motel room on April 16, 1987. While the probable cause determination was based principally upon hearsay information obtained from the informant, it is generally accepted that hearsay information is acceptable to establish probable cause as long as the informant is reliable and has an adequate basis of knowledge <em>(see, People v Bigelow, </em>66 NY2d 417, 423; <em>People v Johnson, </em>66 NY2d 398, 402). Here, the informant\u2019s information was gained through first-hand conversations and transactions with defendant, rather than being acquired through an intermediary. Moreover, the police were justified in relying on this information based on their own independent observations of defendant\u2019s activities and also the informant\u2019s proven reliability in the past <em>(see, People v Bigelow, supra, </em>at 423-424; <em>see also, People v Coston, </em>170 AD2d 773).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">As for the warrantless search and seizure of evidence in defendant\u2019s motel room, this was appropriately deemed to be valid in light of the imminent danger that evidence, specifically the marked cash given to defendant, would have been lost or destroyed if the police waited to obtain a search warrant before entering defendant\u2019s room <em>(see, e.g., People v Willsey, </em>144 AD2d 106, 108, <em>lv denied </em>73 NY2d 985; <em>People v Thomas, </em>129 AD2d 910, 912, <em>lv denied </em>70 NY2d 657).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments, including his claim that he was deprived of a fair trial, have been examined and have been found to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Mikoll, J. P., Levine, Mercure and Crew III, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
