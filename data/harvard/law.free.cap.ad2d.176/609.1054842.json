Thereafter, the People moved for a protective order denying disclosure to the defense of the affidavit supporting the search warrant on the ground that this information might reveal the identity of the confidential informant and pose a safety risk to the individual\u2019s life. The court, applying procedure set forth in <em>People v Seychel </em>(136 Misc 2d 310), examined the application for the search warrant, <em>ex parte </em>and <em>in camera, </em>and determined that it set forth probable cause for the search and was not perjurious on its face. The court also conducted an <em>in camera </em>review of the testimony in support of the search warrant and concluded that the informant\u2019s life or future investigations would be jeopardized by disclosures of the materials sought by the defense. The court then determined that the warrant could not be turned over to the defense in redacted form. Finally, the court held a <em>Dar</em>den-type inquiry hearing <em>ex parte </em>and <em>in camera </em>where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>credibility of the affiant was established, and where the defense claim that the warrant was tainted by a prior illegal entry into his apartment was dispelled. We find that the court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>and <em>ex parte </em>review procedure and denial of defendant\u2019s discovery request of the search warrant affidavit was entirely proper under the instant circumstances. <em>(See, People v Seychel, supra.)</em></p><p id=\"b658-4\">Contrary to the People\u2019s argument, the issue of the court\u2019s procedure in the handling of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and request for discovery of the search warrant application, is preserved for appellate review <em>(see, </em>CPL 710.70 [2]; <em>cf. People v Varon, </em>168 AD2d 349). Concur \u2014 Milonas, J. P., Ellerin, Asch and Rubin, JJ.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
