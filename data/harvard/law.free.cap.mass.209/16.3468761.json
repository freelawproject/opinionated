The plaintiff was employed by marketmen to deliver goods to their customers, which he carried in bundles either on his shoulders or in his arms. After making a delivery on the day of the accident he was returning to his place of employment when it became necessary to pass over the street where he was struck, while on the crosswalk, by the automobile, and the jury could find that before starting he looked in each direction and saw that \u201c everything looked clear.\u201d But, even if he had not taken this precaution, his conduct under the circumstances would not, as matter of law, have prevented his recovery if he had been injured by a passing team. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Armstrong Transfer Co. </em>167 Mass. 199. And the fact that the defendant\u2019s conveyance was an automobile instead of a horse drawn vehicle is immaterial. <em>Hennessey </em>v. Taylor, 189 Mass. 583. The jury further could have found that when the collision occurred the defendant\u2019s driver, having been engaged in conversation with an occupant of the car, with his head turned toward his companion, was giving little, if any, attention to travellers in front of him. It was for them to say, whether this inattention under the circumstances was sufficient proof of his negligence. The case cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>be distinguished in principle from <em>Donovan </em>v. Bernhard, <em>208 </em>Mass. 181, and should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b40-6\"><em>D. W. Corcoran, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b40-7\"><em>W. H.
