Writs dated June 19 and October 21,1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-12\">In the Superior Court the cases were tried together before <em>Lawton, </em>J. The plaintiff in the first case testified that he was a plumber,, whose place of employment was on Essex \u25a0 Street in Boston; that on the day of the accident he had been with the plaintiff in the second case to a jewelry store to get a locket repaired ; and that they came down Beach Street from Washington Street to Harrison Avenue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-13\">He then testified as follows: \u201cI had got about half ways across Harrison Avenue in Beach Street when a big double-horse team came around the corner, and there is a double set of tracks on Beach Street and there was a car, a Charlestown car, came up Harrison Avenue from Essex Street to go to the South <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Station. When I crossed the street I couldn\u2019t get any nearer to this wagon unless I wanted to get run over. This car came up Harrison Avenue, turned the corner and never rang the bell or anything; I never knew he was there until the car hit me and knocked me down. As it hit me it hit me on the left leg right at the muscle and I fell. I fell that way. And then the step hit me again and threw me, and then Miss Connors was thrown also.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-3\">The plaintiff in the second case testified that she was employed in a clerical position on Lincoln Street in Boston; that the accident happened at about noontime; that she, walking with the plaintiff in the first case, came down Washington Street to Beach Street and then started to walk on Beach Street toward Kingston Street. She then testified as follows: \u201c Well, we were walking along and we got there at the curbstone, and there was a two-horse team, a large two-horse team, coming along, and of course we had to wait there, we couldn\u2019t go by, and a car came down Harrison Avenue and I didn\u2019t hear no bell or nothing \u2014 there was nothing rung until Mr. Magner was knocked down by the car and threw me down.\u201d She was not struck by the car, but the plaintiff in the first case was knocked against her and she went down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-4\">It was testified that the plaintiff in the first case broke a rib and sustained other injuries and that the plaintiff in the second case sustained a severe nervous shock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-5\">At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, the judge ruled that there was no evidence that the plaintiffs were in the exercise of due care, and that the plaintiffs could not recover. He ordered a verdict for the defendant in each case; and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-6\">The case was argued at the bar in March, 1911, before <em>Knowlton, C</em>. J., <em>Morton, Hammond, Sheldon, Rugg, </em>JJ., and afterwards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-7\"><em>J. J. Mansfield, (J. J. Gear in </em>with him,) for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-8\"><em>J. E. Hannigan, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-9\">Sheldon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As\">While these cases are very close, the majority of the court are of opinion that they should have been left to the jury. The plaintiffs were not necessarily negligent in starting to cross Harrison Avenue as they were passing along Beach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Street. Their stopping on the crossing to allow a team to pass in front of them could be found to have been merely a proper act of precaution. Their failure to look around during this momentary pause was not decisive of negligence. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Armstrong Transfer Co. </em>167 Mass. 199, and cases cited. The cases differ from <em>Byrne </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated </em>Railway, 198 Mass. 444, <em>Callaghan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>200 Mass. 450, or <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>202 Mass. 489. See <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>189 Mass. 583; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>206 Mass. 11; <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>188 Mass. 434; <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>183 Mass. 249; <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Union Street Railway, </em>150 Mass. 86. The case last cited closely resembles those now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\">It does not appear to have been disputed that there was evidence of negligence for which the defendant was responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
