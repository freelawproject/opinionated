Sts. c. 7, \u00a7 5, cl. 2, afterwards re-enacted in successive statutes and embodied in R.

Coombs, late of Boston, for instructions as to whether the bequest of the remainder of a residuary trust fund, which was given to Bowdoin College in the State of Maine, was subject to pay \u00e1 succession and inheritance tax under St. 1891, c. 425, R. L. c. 15, \u00a7 1, it having been agreed that, if the property was subject to such tax, the amount to be paid to the treasurer of the Commonwealth would be $4,900. The bill alleged that at the time of the death of the testator Bowdoin College was an educational, literary, benevolent, charitable, scientific, and religious institution incorporated within this Commonwealth by a charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>enacted on June 24, 1794, St. 1794, c. 12, expressly confirmed and continued in full force by St. of 1819, c. 36, known as the Separation Act, and recognized and amended by resolves of June 12, 1820, and April 23, 1891.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-3\">In the Probate Court <em>Grant, </em>J., upon the authority of <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>180 Mass. 545, ruled that under the provisions of R. L. c. 15, \u00a7 1, the legacy was subject to the tax claimed by the treasurer of the Commonwealth, and made a decree to that effect. The executors, Bowdoin College, and Viola V. Coombs, of Bowdoinham in the State of Maine, who was a sister of the testator and a legatee, appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-4\">The appeal came on to be heard before <em>Hammond, </em>J., who with the consent of the parties reserved it for determination by the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-5\"><em>E.

L. c. 12, \u00a7 5, cl. 3, was not the subject of extended examination in the opinion that was rendered. But the case itself involved the precise question now presented, namely, whether a legacy, given by a resident of this State to the President and Fellows of Bowdoin College in the State of Maine, was exempt from taxation under St. 1891, c. 425, now embodied in R. L. c. 15. The case was a bill for instructions by the executor of the will, and the bill alleged that Bowdoin College was a corporation created by this Commonwealth, by the act of June 24, 1794, and that it was an educational and charitable institution which should be exempt from taxation under St. 1891, c. 425. The treasurer and receiver general answered alleging that a tax was due and the court so held. Manifestly, if the college was an institution incorporated within this Commonwealth within the meaning of the statute, the legacy was exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>from taxation, otherwise not, and it necessarily must have been decided in that case, in order to render the legacy taxable, that the college was not an institution incorporated within this Commonwealth within the meaning of the statute. If the question were an open one we should have no doubt that the legacy in question was subject to a tax, and that although the college was incorporated by this Commonwealth before the passage of the Separation Act, so called (St. 1819, c. 36), and its charter cannot be modified or changed by the State of Maine, nevertheless after the passage of the act it ceased to be an institution incorporated within this Commonwealth within the meaning of Rev. Sts. c. 7, \u00a7 5, cl. 2, and its s\u00fabsequent re-enactments. It is not necessary however to go into the consideration of the question now, and what we have said is more for the purpose of preventing a possible implication that if it were not for the case of <em>Rice </em>v. Bradford, <em>supra, </em>there might have been some doubt about the validity of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
