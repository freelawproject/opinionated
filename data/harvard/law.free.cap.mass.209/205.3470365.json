It appeared that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was a married woman, who had taken out the policy on the life of her husband, which was made payable to her upon her husband\u2019s death if she survived him, or, if she died before him, was made payable to their children, that by the terms of the policy no right was reserved to the insured to change the beneficiary with the consent of the company or to surrender the policy at his option for its value in cash, that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, after making the assignment, had died and that her husband and her children still were living. <em>Held, </em>that by the assignment the plaintiff acquired the interest of the wife in the policy, which was contingent on her surviving her husband, and that on her death during her husband\u2019s lifetime the whole beneficial interest in the policy passed to the children of the insured, whose rights could not be affected by the assignment made by their mother; so that the bill must be dismissed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-12\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on November 11, 1907, and amended by a supplemental bill filed on' June 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>1909, which in turn was amended by an amendment allowed on May 11, 1910, in which the plaintiff, as the alleged assignee of two policies of life insurance, which he held as security for a certain promissory note, on which he obtained a judgment as alleged in his supplemental bill, sought to have the cash surrender value of the policies applied to the payment of the judgment, the defendant insurance company being ready to pay the values of the policies to the proper parties upon the order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">In the Superior Court the case was heard by <em>Richardson, </em>J., who on a motion for a final decree, by agreement of the parties, reserved and reported the case upon the agreed facts, the testimony and the exhibits for determination by this court. The questions raised and the facts to which they relate are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-6\"><em>E. W.

Powers </em>with him,) for the individual defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-8\"><em>F. H.

Wilde, who is the insured. The right to relief is rested on the ground, that the assignments of the policies to the original creditor, to whose rights the plaintiff has succeeded, having been given as security for the debt of the insured, in which his wife, Catharine A. Wilde, who at that time was the \u201c assured \u201d joined, the plaintiff is entitled to a decree, ordering that the policies, which never were delivered to the assignee, shall be surrendered to the company and their value paid to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">It would be a sufficient answer to this claim if the defense had been made that the policies on their face contain no provision for a settlement until the death of the insured, and the bill does not allege that by force of some statute of the State of New Jersey, the company\u2019s domicil, the policies were given a cash surrender value. <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society, </em>181 Mass. 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">But, this question not having been raised by the pleadings and the company being willing to pay the cash surrender values <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>if the rights of all parties having an interest therein are released, the validity and effect of the assignments must be considered. These assignments, which having been made and delivered between parties residing here are governed by the local law, depend upon the construction of the policies. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>138 Mass. 24. The plaintiff contends that this question must be decided according to the laws of New Jersey. It being undisputed, however, that the insurance was applied for, the premiums paid, and the policies delivered here where the beneficiary, who was called the \u201c assured,\u201d and the insured resided and where the company did business, the contracts, even if at maturity the insurance money was to be paid at the home office, are to be construed, and the rights of the parties ascertained, by the laws of Massachusetts. <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Hudson River Fire Ins. Co. </em>12 Cush. 416, 422, 423. <em>Thwing </em>v. <em>Great Western Ins. Co. </em>111 Mass. 93, 108, 109. <em>Millard </em>v. <em>Brayton, </em>177 Mass. 533, 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">It consequently becomes unnecessary to consider the effect of the foreign statute, and the decision under it put in evidence by the plaintiff, and we come directly to the terms of the policies. The insurance was effected by the wife on the life of her husband, although the premiums were paid by him until the assignments. By a provision common to both policies the company agreed to pay the amount of the insurance to her or her \u201c assigns, within ninety days after due notice and proof of the death of \u201d the insured, \u201c and in case the said assured should die before the decease of the said George F. Wilde then the amount of this insurance shall be payable to their children or to their guardian if under age, within ninety days after due notice and proof of interest and of the death of the said George F. Wilde. . . .\u201d The right is not reserved to the insured to change the beneficiary with the consent of the company, or to surrender the policies at his option for their value in cash, and he had no pecuniary interest which he could assign. <em>Langdeau </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>194 Mass. 56, 66. <em>Weatherbee </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>182 Mass. 342. <em>Blinn </em>v. Dame, 207 Mass. 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The language of the company\u2019s obligation to the beneficiary is not uncertain, and should be given its apparent and usual meaning. It agreed to pay the money to the wife if she survived her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>husband, and this interest passed to the plaintiff by the assignments. <em>Boyden </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>153 Mass. 544, 546. <em>Sullivan </em>v. Maroney, 6 Buch. 104. But, if she was the primary beneficiary, yet upon her death after the assignments were given, the insured having survived, neither her,personal representatives nor assigns acquired any title to the insurance money. <em>Fuller </em>v. Linzee, 135 Mass. 468. If the wife predeceased her husband, the contract is, then, to pay to their children, who are to be ascertained at this period, and to succeed as beneficiaries. <em>Thomson </em>v. Ludington, 104 Mass. 193. The defendants, George F. Wilde, Jr., and Stella L. Wilde, having been at their mother\u2019s death the only living offspring of the marriage, their rights to the proceeds of the policies at their father\u2019s death not having been defeated by the assignments to which they were not parties, became absolute, and the bill must be dismissed with costs. <em>Millard </em>v. <em>Brayton, </em>177 Mass. 533. <em>Knickerbocker Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Weitz, </em>99 Mass. 157. <em>Pingrey </em>v. <em>National Life Ins. Co. </em>144 Mass. 374, 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
