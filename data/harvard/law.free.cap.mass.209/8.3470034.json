The facts which could have been found upon the evidence are stated in the opinion. At the close of all the evidence, the defendants asked the judge to rule that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. The judge refused to make this ruling and submitted the case to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $500. The defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-5\"><em>J. J. </em>Mansfield, (J. <em>J.

They might further find that the defendants, so expecting and intending, took no pains whatever to see whether the plank was suitable for that purpose; that the plank was not suitable, and that, in failing to take proper care in this respect, the defendants were negligent in the performance of a duty they owed to the plaintiff; that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care; and that the accident was attributable solely to this negligence of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Upon such findings there was a case for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
