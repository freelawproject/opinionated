The trustees, under instructions from this court given in <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>101 Mass. 341, had paid to the issue of each of the other children, as such children died, the fractional part of the fund of which their representative parents had received the income. In a suit in equity seeking instructions as to whether that portion of the principal which was left after the death without issue of the survivor of the children should be distributed as intestate property or should be divided among the issue of the deceased children, it was <em>held, </em>that the plain intention of the testator was to dispose of his whole estate, and, in the contingency which had happened, that the remaining principal should be divided in equal shares among his grandchildren and among the issue of any deceased grandchildren by right of representation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b504-4\">If real estate is devised to a trustee in trust to pay the income to certain named children of the testator until the death of the survivor of them, and an intention of the testator is apparent from a reading of the whole will, although it is nowhere expressed therein in terms, that, if after several of the children had died leaving issue the survivor should die without issue, then the trust estate should pass to the grandchildren of the testator in equal shares and to the issue of deceased grandchildren by right of representation, upon the happening of such a contingency the fee of the real estate does not pass to those entitled thereto without further action of the trustee, but he should convey it to them.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-5\">Bill in equity, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court on June 10, 1910, by the trustee under the will of Windsor Fay, late of Boston, for instructions as to the disposition of the trust estate at the termination of the trust on the death of the last holder of a life interest in the income, and also as to whether the trustee should convey to those entitled thereto as tenants in common such of the trust estate as was realty or whether, on the death of the last holder of a life interest in the income, the realty passed to the person entitled thereto without further action on the part of the trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\">George D.

He then provided as follows: \u201cIn case of the decease of either of my said children without children or lawful issue, I then will that the income and interest so given as aforesaid, shall in like manner be divided among the survivors, but in case my said children die leaving issue then the capital of such deceased child\u2019s share shall be equally divided among such issue share and share alike to their heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">One of these children died before the testator; and before August, 1868, three others of the testator\u2019s children died, of whom two left children and one had no issue. The trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>under the will thereupon filed a bill in equity in this court for instructions; and it was decided that no part of the principal of the trust fund should be distributed as undevised estate upon the death of a child without issue, but that the children of those of the testator\u2019s children who had died leaving issue were entitled respectively by representation to have \u201c the capital of such deceased child\u2019s share,\u201d that is, the fractional part of the fund of which their respective parents received the income, withdrawn from the fund and divided among them. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>101 Mass. 341. It was declared by Wells, J., in giving the opinion of the court (p. 342), that the will showed \u201c that the testator intended to dispose of the principal as well as the income \u201d of the fund, and to give the remainder after the life interest of his children \u201c to the issue of such as should leave issue.\u201d He also said (p. 343) that \u201c the will is made operative to pass the entire principal of the trust fund to the issue of such children as leave issue.\u201d The question however was not determined, because not then presented, whether the issue of a deceased child, whose share of capital already had been separated from the trust fund, were entitled to any share of the principal or income which would fall in by the subsequent decease without issue of any child of the testator. After this decision, all but one of the five remaining children of the testator successively died, leaving issue, and there was paid over to such issue respectively one fifth, one fourth, one third, and one half of the trust fund as it existed at those respective times. A daughter of the testator, Lydia A. Robbins, was thus left the sole survivor of the testator\u2019s children, and she received accordingly the whole income of the diminished trust fund during her life. She has now died without issue; and the question arises whether the fund is to go to the heirs of the testator as undevised or intestate estate, or whether by the terms of the will it devolves upon the issue of the other children of the testator, whose then expectant shares of the capital had before the death of Mrs. Robbins been separated from the trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We cannot read this will without seeing .that it was the intention of the testator to dispose of his whole estate, and moreover to provide that all the residue of his estate, after the termination of the life estate of his own children, should go to the issue of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>children. That was the view taken by this court in <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>101 Mass. 341. But in the event which has happened the existing fund has been left undisposed of by the literal terms of the will; for Mrs. Robbins has left no issue to whom it can go and no surviving brothers and sisters to whose shares it can be added. Unless there is to be found in the will not only a manifestation of the testator\u2019s intention that this fund should be disposed of by the will, but also a clear and certain designation of the persons to whom it is to be paid, it must go as undevised property to his heirs at law. <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>5 Cush. 232. <em>Buffington </em>v. <em>Maxam, </em>152 Mass. 477. <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>192 Mass. 144. <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>206 Mass. 20. If, however, the language of the will does plainly and distinctly show that he intended a particular disposition of the fund, the court must give effect to that intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The case is governed by our decisions in <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Framingham Parish, </em>128 Mass. 370, and <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>152 Mass. 95. Both of these cases go upon the ground stated by Gray, C. J., in the former of them: \u201c If a reading of the whole will produces a conviction that the testator must necessarily have intended an\u2019 interest to be given which is not bequeathed by express and formal words, the court must supply the defect by implication, and so mould the language of the testator as to carry into effect as far as possible, the intention which it is of opinion that he has on the whole will sufficiently declared.\u201d In each of the cases cited, the facts presented closely resembled those which are before us. In each case, the contingency which actually happened had not in terms been provided for, just as in the case at bar the event of the testator\u2019s last surviving child leaving no issue was not specifically provided for; but in each case the language which the testator used showed clearly and unmistakably that his intention would have been frustrated if effect had not been given to it in the manner adopted by the court. So in this case the language used leads directly and certainly to the conclusion that he intended the whole of .this fund to go finally to the, issue of his children to the exclusion of everybody else, although he did not, concern himself with its disposition after it should have come into the hands of such issue. We are not framing for the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>tator a conjectural intent, such as he might or perhaps naturally would have expressed, but which is not imported by the words which he has used. That we could not do. <em>Child </em>v. <em>Child, </em>185 Mass. 376. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Buffum, </em>186 Mass. 242. <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Tarbell, </em>187 Mass. 480. As was said by Loring, J., in <em>Lathrop </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>207 Mass. 6, 10, \u201c the province of the court is not to conjecture what the testator\u2019s intention was and then read it into the will, but to ascertain his intention by construing the words which he used as the declaration of it.\u201d If it necessarily appears from those words that he intended to make a disposition of his property which he has not formally and precisely expressed, his intention will be declared and carried into execution. Rugg, J., in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Gane, </em>205 Mass. 37, 45. The principle has been declared and applied in many cases, both in this Commonwealth and in England. See, besides those already cited, <em>Hood </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>148 Mass. 330; <em>Seaver </em>v. <em>Griffing, </em>176 Mass. 59; <em>Dary </em>v. Grau, 190 Mass. 482; <em>Polsey </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>199 Mass. 450; <em>Towns </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>11 Moore P. C. 526; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>7 H. L. Cas. 68; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Tootal, </em>11 H. L. Cas. 143; <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>5 Ch. D. 954. The reasoning in <em>Little </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>204 Mass. 114, though the point was not directly involved, tends to the same effect. And see the other cases cited in <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Framingham Parish, ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">But it has been argued that the language of the testator does not show that he intended the fund, in the event which has happened, to go to the issue of his deceased children. It is said that he dealt with file case of children dying without issue, and definitely provided that in that case it should go to his own surviving children, but chose to make no provision for the event of the last survivor having no issue. It is argued that he really provided that no part of the share of which children dying without issue had enjoyed the income should go to the issue of children who had previously deceased, but that the same should go to the surviving children. It is urged that his intention was that the issue of a deceased child, having received the \u201c capital of such deceased child\u2019s share \u2019\u2019 as it was at the time of the latter\u2019s death, should not thereafter receive any further part or share of the trust fund; for what he said and all that he said was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>that the income of a child dying without issue should be divided among the survivors, which of course meant the surviving children of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">This argument has been very ingeniously put by counsel, but its fallacy is that it first assumes that the testator could not have intended to make any other or further disposition of his property than what he has expressly and formally stated, and then rests upon the further assumption that the giving of a bequest to one set of beneficiaries, the issue of deceased children, together with a different disposition of other property or shares to take effect in a certain event, necessarily shows an intention that the first set of beneficiaries should in no event share in such other property. A similar line of argument applied to the facts of those cases would have reversed the decisions in <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Framingham </em>Parish, 128 Mass. 370, <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. Coffin, 152 Mass. 95, and in many of the other cases already cited, in which interests in bequests have been either created or extended beyond what could have been given under the mere words of the wills, in order to carry out the manifest intention of the testator. That intention must be gathered from all the language of the will, in connection with the circumstances that were known to the testator when he made it. We are not to look merely to singled out words, in which he plainly failed to express the whole of the intention which is apparent upon the face of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In this case we are satisfied by reading the will that the testator intended to dispose of all his estate and to provide that it finally should go to the issue of his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">We are of opinion upon the language of the will that distribution of the fund should now be made in equal shares among the grandchildren of the testator and the issue of any deceased granchildren by right of representation. <em>Dexter </em>v.
