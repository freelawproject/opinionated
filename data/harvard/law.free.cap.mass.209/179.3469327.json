The declaration contained two counts, the first for the amount named, alleged to be a balance found to be due to the plaintiff by the parties on an accounting together, and the second as follows: \u201cAnd the plaintiff says that the defendant made a promissory note payable to the plaintiff, a copy whereof is hereto annexed marked Exhibit A, and the plaintiff says that the defendant owes him thereon the amount of said note and interest thereon as therein stipulated when payment of the same was duly demanded from April 1,1904, to the date of this writ.\u201d Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated April 9, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-10\">The instrument, of which a copy was annexed to the second count and marked Exhibit A, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-11\">\u201c George M.

It appeared that the plaintiff and the defendant were brothers, and each of them testified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-18\">On the cross-examination of the plaintiff the defendant\u2019s counsel asked him in various forms whether the instrument de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>dared upon in the second count was not given by the defendant to the plaintiff as a mere memorandum of the amount due and not as a note. These questions were objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and were excluded by the judge. The defendant excepted. The defendant testified that the plaintiff asked him for a note; that he refused to give him a note, but said that he was willing to give a memorandum of the amount which the plaintiff claimed as due to him, and that he then wrote the paper and handed it to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">The defendant moved that the plaintiff should be required to elect on which count he would stand, and the plaintiff thereupon elected to stand on the second count of his declaration. The judge then ordered a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of the alleged note with interest, amounting in all to $836. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-7\"><em>J.

It is not a negotiable promissory note and is not declared on as such. The word \u201c payable \u201d in the connection in which it occurs imports a promise by the maker to pay at the time fixed the sum named. The promise is not one implied by law from an acknowledgment; of indebtedness, but is the maker\u2019s own promise. It is not contended that the other elements necessary to constitute a promissory note are not included in the instrument declared on. See <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>10 Wend. 675; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Rome Railroad, </em>17 Ga. 574; <em>Carver </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>47 Maine, 257; <em>Pepoon </em>v. <em>Stagg, </em>1 Nott. <em>&amp; </em>McC. 102; <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Hallack, </em>9 Col. 572; <em>Waithman </em>v. <em>Elsee, </em>1 C. &amp; K. 35; <em>Richer </em>v. <em>Voyer, </em>L. R. 5 P. C. 461, 476. The question whether the instrument was or was not a promissory note was one of law for the court and evidence that it was intended by the defendant as a memorandum merely was rightly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled with double costs and interest at twelve per cent.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
