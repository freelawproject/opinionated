There was testimony of a qualified expert for the plaintiff as to the law of Michigan, which was controverted, that \u201c in a case in chancery an appearance continued indefinitely.\u201d The judge ruled that, \u201cupon the undisputed evidence in the case, the decree of the Michigan court ... is entitled to full faith and credit under the United States Constitution.\u201d The defendant alleged exceptions and contended that on the undisputed evidence there was no proper service upon the defendant of notice of the petition upon which the decree sued on was based. <em>Held, </em>that the petition was not a new or original proceeding, but was incidental to the original divorce suit, and that, the defendant having been properly before the court originally, no further personal service upon him was necessary, and that, on the evidence before him, the trial judge was warranted in finding that the defendant had sufficient notice of the petition in the Michigan court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-6\">A number of copies of papers filed in divorce proceedings between certain parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>in a court of Michigan, bound together and bearing a certificate of the clerk of the court in which the proceeding was that \u201cthe writings annexed are true copies of originals on file and of record in [his] office, and that said originals, together, constitute the record of the proceedings of said court in this cause,\u201d is a proper record under R.

About a month after the case had been argued fully by counsel and after the expert had returned to Michigan, the judge sent for both parties and told them what his opinion then was on the matters in issue, stating among other things that he was not satisfied that proper service had been made upon the defendant, and that, if he could be satisfied on that matter, he should find for the plaintiff. On application by the plaintiff and subject to an exception by the defendant, the case thereupon was reopened, a deposition upon written interrogatories of another expert in Michigan was taken, and the case was reheard and judgment rendered for the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the action of the judge in reopening the case was within his power and was not the subject of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-6\">Two ACTIONS OF CONTRACT, upon two decrees of the Circuit Court for the County of Wayne in the State of Michigan in Chancery, dated respectively April 20, 1908, and February 23, 1909, for arrears of alimony and for sums spent by the plaintiff for the support and maintenance of a minor child of the parties, the, decrees being entered in divorce proceedings in which a decree originally was entered on October 6, 1905.

Farrell, clerk of the Circuit Court for the County of Wayne and State of Michigan, and which bore the seal of that court: \u201c I, Thomas F.

The objections of the defendant were overruled, the document was admitted in evidence and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">From documentary evidence it appeared that the original decree of divorce of the Michigan court directed the defendant in these actions to pay to the plaintiff \u201c as permanent alimony \u201d \u201c the sum of thirty-five dollars per month, beginning November 9, 1905, payable at the end of each month thereafter, monthly, for five years from and after October 9, 1905, the payment of such alimony to be in full of all interest in defendant\u2019s property, and all dower interest.\u201d It also provided that the plaintiff should \u201c be awarded the custody of \u201d the minor child of the parties \u201c during each summer vacation from the close of the graded public school in the summer until the opening of such school in the fall, and that she \u201d should \u201c also have her during the Christmas and spring vacations. The remainder of each year the grandmother of said child, Annie Wells,\u201d was given the custody of the child.

He also stated that \u201c in a case in chancery an appearance continued indefinitely.

Evidence of the defendant, which was undisputed, tended to show that the authority of his counsel to appear or to act for him was withdrawn immediately after the decree in 1905. Notice of the petition upon which the decree of February 23, 1909, was based was served upon the defendant in Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">The cases were heard on November 29 and 30, 1909, and fully argued,' both parties making in writing requests for findings of fact and for rulings of law. On December 21,1909, <em>\u201c </em>the presiding judge sent for counsel for both parties, and stated that he was of opinion that that portion of the decrees of the Michigan Court which referred to overdue alimony constituted a judgment to which he must give full faith and credit, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>as to so much of them as referred to allowances for support and maintenance of the child, he did not feel the same way. He also stated, however, that he nevertheless should find for the plaintiff if he could be satisfied that proper service or notice of the petitions upon which the decrees were based was given to the defendant, that he was not at the time satisfied that such service or notice was given. On application of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, however, and subject to an exception by the defendant, he said that he would hear further evidence.\u201d Thereafter the deposition of the witness Golden was taken and introduced in evidence as well as a copy of the rules of the circuit courts of Michigan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\">In answer to a hypothetical question in a cross-interrogatory by the defendant the witness Golden stated that, if he assumed \u201c that shortly after the entry of the decree in October, 1905, the authority of the defendant\u2019s solicitors to represent him in any way was withdrawn and all relations between them and the defendant had ceased; that in reply to\u201d a notice which was \u201c sent to the defendant\u2019s so-called solicitors in April of 1908, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors received information that the so-called defendant\u2019s solicitors were not his solicitors any longer and were not authorized to receive any notice with regard to him or with regard to said divorce proceedings,\u201dhe would be \u201cof the opinion that\u201d such notice \u201c would not be good service if there was not personal service of the notice upon the defendant.\u201d The information sent by the defendant\u2019s former solicitors in Michigan to the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor in reply to the notice of the pendency of the first petition was on a postal card which read as follows: \u201cI am in receipt of petition and notice of hearing of the same for the 20th. I hardly know what to say in relation to the matter. I am trying to get into touch with Mr. Wells and wish that you would let the matter stand over for one week until I can hear from him. While I was a solicitor of record in the case, I have not been in touch with Mr. Wells for some time, so I do not feel that I have any authority or right to represent him until I can hear from him. I will thank you to let me know as to whether this is agreeable to you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-6\">The fifth ruling asked for by the defendant and mentioned in the opinion was as follows: \u201c 5.

The fundamental question in these cases is whether an action can be maintained in this Commonwealth upon the decrees of the Circuit Court of Michigan which are declared on. If they are final decrees for the payment of ascertained sums of money constituting a debt of record, they are entitled to full faith and credit in every State and may be enforced by suit in the same way as any other judgments or decrees. And, while there has been some difference in the decisions, we regard it as now settled that <em>prima facie </em>at least a decree for the payment of a fixed sum of money found to be already due and payable to a wife for the past support of herself and her children is to be regarded as a final decree, although an order for future payments as a provision for future support, being ordinarily liable to modification at any time, is subject to the control of the court which made the order, and so is not a final order for the payment of a fixed sum. That was the conclusion reached by this court in a carefully considered opinion. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Page, </em>189 Mass. 85. It is supported by other decisions. <em>Purdon </em>v. <em>Blinn, </em>192 Mass. 387, and cases cited. <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>134 Mass. 353. <em>McIlroy </em>v. <em>McIlroy, </em>208 Mass. 458. <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>154 Mich. 386. <em>Trowbridge </em>v. <em>Spinning, </em>23 Wash. 48. <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Lynde, </em>181 U. S. 183, and 162 N. Y. 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">The defendant contends, however, that under the law of Michigan these decrees were not final, because under the statutes of that State they might at any time, upon the petition of either party, be revised and altered. 3 Mich. Comp. Laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>(1897), \u00a7\u00a7 8680-8641. Upon this question at the trial each party put in evidence, besides these statutes, certain decisions of the Supreme Court of Michigan and there was testimony of a qualified expert. Among these decisions were the following: In <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>146 Mich. 231, it was held that an order for alimony in a decree for divorce, being subject to modification at any time by the court which made it (\u00a7 8641, <em>ubi supra), </em>and that court having full power to enforce it, is not such a judgment for money that an action at law can be maintained upon it. The point decided went no further than our decision in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>100 Mass. 373, and does not settle the question before us. But the language of the opinion tends to sustain the defendant\u2019s contention. In <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Westerman, </em>62 Mich. 170, there is a <em>dictum </em>that a decree for alimony vests in a wife no absolute right thereto. In <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>10 Mich. 425, there is a similar <em>dictum, </em>and it was held that an order of the Circuit Court, opening an order for alimony and ordering a reference to a commissioner to hear evidence and make report to the court, was not a final decree from which an appeal could be taken to the Supreme Court. But it seems to be implied in the opinion that an order for past alimony made upon the coming in of the report would be such a final decree. In <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>154 Mich. 386, an action was sustained for arrears of payments ordered by an Oklahoma court to be made to a wife in a divorce case for her own support, but she was not allowed to recover arrears of payments, which the defendant had been ordered to make to her for the support of their children on the ground that these were subject to revision at any time by the Oklahoma court. This refusal was on the same reasoning as our decision in <em>Page </em>v. <em>Page, </em>189 Mass. 85, and scarcely helps the defendant. But in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Thison, </em>153 Mich. 516, it was held that an award of alimony to a divorced wife is a valid claim against the estate of her deceased husband. This agrees with our decision in <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>134 Mass. 353. And in <em>Ulman </em>v. <em>Ulman, </em>148 Mich. 353, a bill was maintained to collect out of land in one county a fixed amount which had been decreed for alimony in a suit for divorce in another county. It was decided also that the order for alimony was none the less a final decree because it might be modified by the court which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>entered it. The court said: \u201c Authorities are abundant which hold that such a decree, for a fixed sum, is a judgment of record, and will be received by other courts as such. And such a decree rendered in any State of the United States will be carried into judgment in any other State. <em>Lynde </em>v. Lynde, 162 N. Y. 405; affirmed, 181 U. S. 183. <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>21 How. 582. . . . It is urged that the statute (\u00a7 8641, 3 Comp. Laws) gives to the court which renders the decree creating the lien power to modify its decree, and thereby destroys its character as a final decree enforceable in any other forum. We do not agree with this contention,\u201d citing <em>Trowbridge </em>v. <em>Spinning, </em>23 Wash. 48, to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Upon this evidence, with the oral testimony of Baldwin and the other evidence stated in the exceptions, the judge had a right to find, and it now must be taken that he finally did find, that these decrees were final adjudications which might have been appealed from. As this was a question of fact and there was evidence which warranted the finding, we cannot revise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">2. The defendant contends that these decrees were entered without any proper or sufficient notice to him, and so that they are not binding upon him. In our opinion, these petitions were not new or independent proceedings, but were merely incidental to the original suit, of which he had had due notice and in which he had entered an appearance. The court doubtless would take care that proper steps were taken to give him knowledge of these proceedings, but it was not necessary that personal service should be made upon him as if new actions had been instituted, unless the laws of Michigan so required. The petitions asked only for further proceedings in the original action, proceedings which were authorized and contemplated by the terms of the statute under which the original action had been brought. The general rule is that in such a case no new personal service is needed. <em>Nations </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>24 How. 195. <em>Fitzsimmons </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>90 Tenn. 416, cited with approval in <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>95 U. S. 714, 734. <em>Laing </em>v. <em>Rigney, </em>160 U. S. 531. 2 Freem. Judgments, (4th ed.) \u00a7 569. 2 Black, Judgments, \u00a7 912. In <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Lynde, </em>162 N. Y. 405, and 181 U. S. 183, the decree for past alimony which was sustained was entered upon the same kind of notice to the defendant that was given to this defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>upon the petition on which the second decree here was entered. Upon the Michigan statutes and decisions and rules of court and the oral evidence before him the judge was well warranted in finding that this general rule was recognized in Michigan and governed - the proceedings that had been taken. It followed that the defendant had sufficient notice of both the petitions upon which the decrees sued on were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">3. The record offered in evidence was rightly admitted. It was not denied that it was duly attested and authenticated. It came fully within the rules of <em>Brainard </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>119 Mass. 262, and <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Abell, </em>10 Allen, 485. The objection is that the copies contained in the record did not include certain papers which- appeared by the \u201c calendar entries \u201d to have been filed in the case. But the certificate was that <em>\u201c </em>the writings annexed are true copies of originals on file and of record . . . and that said originals together constitute the record of the proceedings \u201d of the court. We cannot say against this certificate that the missing papers were part of the record. Every paper put on the files is not necessarily a part of the record. As to what was apparently a clerical error in the second decree sued in, by misreciting the date of the decree declared on in the first case, that does not seem to us important or material.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">4. Under these circumstances the ruling that upon the uncontroverted evidence the decrees of the Michigan court were entitled to full faith and credit was not erroneous. Nor do we find any material error in the rulings or refusals to rule which were excepted to. We need not consider whether the defendant\u2019s fifth request was correct as an abstract proposition. The refusal to make specific findings of fact was not the subject of exception. <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>204 Mass. 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">5. It was for the judge to decide whether he would reopen the case to allow further evidence to be taken. His conclusion is not the subject of exception. <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>165 Mass. 518. There was no error of law, after the reopening, in admitting Golden\u2019s deposition, and the interrogatories therein specifically objected to were not objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">In each case the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
