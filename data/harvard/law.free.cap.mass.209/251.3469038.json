Shattuck, Esquire, as master. Besides making the findings stated in the opinion, the master found, as the basis of his conclusion \u201c that the defendants\u2019 loaves, without any bands or names upon or about them, were not so similar to the 'Creamalt \u2019 loaf as to be likely to deceive the ordinary purchaser, having some knowledge of the appearance of the <em>\u2018 </em>Creamalt \u2019 loaf, or to constitute an instrument of fraud in the hands of the retail dealer,\u201d the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9d2\">Upon the loaf of bread manufactured by the plaintiff was pasted a label, one and five eighths inches long and three quarters of an inch wide, containing the words,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">Made with Milk and Malt Creamalt</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-8\">Reg.

Their upper surface was also glazed as was that of the \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 and other loaves commonly sold in this market. On the other hand, the defendants\u2019 loaves differed from the \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 loaf in that their tops were less rounded and in that the ends of the defendants\u2019 loaves were square instead of round, and consequently their corners were square, or at an angle, rather than round. This difference gave the defendants\u2019 loaves taken as a whole, rather a different appearance from the \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 loaf, because it impaired their oval shape, and in that way distinguished them from a loaf of which the most noticeable peculiarity was its oval shape.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-3\">About the central portion of each loaf of the defendants, before it left the factory, was wrapped a paper band about two and one eighth inches wide. The bands were not attached to the loaves and could easily be removed without defacing the loaves. Upon each band manufactured by the defendants in the first case was printed or engraved the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\">Best\u2019s</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">Rich in Cream</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">Finest</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0p0\">Log Cabin Loaf Malted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARk\">Flavor</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">The name \u201c Friend\u2019s \u201d appeared instead of \u201c Best\u2019s \u201d on the loaves manufactured by the defendant in the second case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">\u201c The defendants\u2019 loaves, . . . except for slight differences in the labels, are substantially the same in appearance as those in question in [George G.] Fox [Co.] <em>vs. </em>Hathaway, [199 Mass. 99], 'but as the evidence presented in that case with regard to the similarity of the plaintiff\u2019s and the defendants\u2019 loaves may have differed in some respects from the evidence in these cases, I find, purely as matter of fact on the evidence before me, as follows: \u2014 The names <em>'</em>Best \u2019 and 'Friend \u2019 stamped upon the bottoms of the defendants\u2019 loaves would not in themselves have been sufficient to distinguish their loaves from the * Creamalt \u2019 loaf. They were in an inconspicuous position, were often wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>or partially illegible, and would not be likely to attract the attention of the ordinary buyer. The bands placed around the defendants\u2019 loaves would, if they remained upon the loaves while in the hands of the retail dealers, be sufficient to distinguish them from the 'Creamalt\u2019 loaf; but as they were not attached to the bread and could easily be removed by a dishonest retailer, they would not be an adequate means of distinguishing the loaves, provided they were not otherwise distinguishable in appearance, and provided it was the defendants\u2019 duty to distinguish them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-4\">\u201c But it seems to me that wholly apart from the names on the bottom of the defendants\u2019 loaves and the bands around them, the ordinary purchaser, having some knowledge of the appearance of \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 bread, either from having bought it or from having seen advertisements and pictures of it, would have no difficulty in distinguishing the \u2018Log Cabin\u2019 from the \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 loaves. Excluding the French and Vienna breads, most of the ten cent loaves sold in the retail stores have some points of resemblance. They all have somewhat rounded tops and flat bottoms. A large proportion have glazed tops. They are all of about the same weight. The prominent characteristics of the \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 loaf were, as above stated, its oval contour, much rounded top and flaring sides, together with its more perfect glazing\u2014the whole giving an appearance of size or bulk. While the \u2018 Log Cabin \u2019 loaves had curved and flaring sides they had square ends and a less rounded top, and therefore lacked the distinct oval appearance of the \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 loaf and did not give the same impression of large size. Nor did it appear that the gloss and color of the top of the \u2018 Log Cabin \u2019 loaves were the same as those of the top of the \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 loaf. Moreover, the label pasted on each loaf of \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 bread and appearing in the advertised pictures of it served appreciably to distinguish it from the \u2018 Log Cabin \u2019 and other ten cent loaves.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">The plaintiff excepted to the master\u2019s report upon the following grounds among others:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">\u201c 1.

Fox Co. </em>v. <em>Glynn, </em>191 Mass. 344, and in <em>George G. Fox Co. </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>199 Mass. 99. The master in the case at bar has found (1) that the defendants began to sell the loaves here complained of \u201c soon after the decree of the Superior Court of this County [referred to in these bills] dismissing the bill in the case of the <em>George F. </em>[sic] <em>Fox Company </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>was entered,\u201d and (2) that \u201c The defendants\u2019 loaves here in question are, except for slight differences in the labels, substantially the same in appearance as those in question in <em>Fox </em>[szc] v. <em>Satha</em>way\u201d; but in the words of his report, (3) \u201c Upon all the facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>as above stated and upon an inspection of the exhibits in the cases, I therefore find that the defendants\u2019 loaves, without any bands or names upon or about them were not so similar to the <em>\u2018 </em>Creamalt \u2019 loaf as to be likely to deceive the ordinary purchaser, having some knowledge of the appearance of the \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 loaf, or to constitute an instrument of fraud in the hands of the retail dealer.\u201d In <em>George G. Fox Co. </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>we found as a fact that the visual appearance of the loaf there in question, which was \u201c substantially the same in appearance \u201d as that in question in the two suits now before us, was likely to mislead the ordinary purchaser into thinking that the defendants\u2019 bread was the plaintiff\u2019s bread. We adhere to our former finding. The master was plainly wrong in the last of the three findings stated above, and the plaintiff\u2019s first, third, fourth and fifth exceptions to his report must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The defendants contend that for two reasons this does not bring these two cases within the decision in <em>George G. Fox Co. </em>v. <em>Hathaway, ubi supra. </em>The first of these reasons is that it appeared in the Hathaway case \u201c that the oval shape adopted by the plaintiff was uncommon, although not entirely novel, and that it was uneconomical, and less convenient and satisfactory generally for the cutting of slices for all kinds of uses than the shapes generally adopted. There was nothing to show that the defendants\u2019 business interests required the combination of this shape with the same size, color and general visual appearance that had become associated with the plaintiff\u2019s trade in this \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 bread,\u201d while in the cases now before us it has been found as a fact that the oval-shaped loaf with its flaring sides and exaggerated rounding of the top is on the whole an advantageous loaf and for the following reasons: (1) It has an appearance of bulk and size which no other loaf of the same weight has and therefore purchasers who wish to get as much as possible for their money prefer it: (2) It has a handsome and attractive appearance: (3) Its rounded corners are less likely to be broken in transportation and the pans are more easily cleaned: (4) Although it is a fact that it is less adapted to being cut into uniform slices, that fact is of little importance in the \u201c family trade,\u201d for which the plaintiff\u2019s and the defendants\u2019 loaves are primarily intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The fact in the Hathaway case that the plaintiff\u2019s oval-shaped loaf was an uneconomical loaf and generally less convenient and satisfactory was spoken of because since that was the fact the case there presented was not a case of conflicting rights, but a case where the only explanation of the defendants\u2019 adopting the oval-shaped loaf was that they hoped to take advantage of the plaintiff\u2019s good will and to pass off their bread as the plaintiff\u2019s bread. There is nothing in that opinion which implies that if it had been found there as a fact that the oval shaped loaf was a desirable one the opposite result would have been reached. Not only that, but it is there stated in terms that the opposite result would not have been reached had that been the fact. After setting forth that the oval shaped loaf was an undesirable one and that there was nothing to show that the defendants\u2019 business interests required the adoption of it, this court went on to say: <em>\u201c </em>The plaintiff had no exclusive right in any one of the features of the combination, and if the defendants had required the use of this combination for the successful prosecution of their business, they would have had a right to use it, by taking such precautions as would prevent deception of the public and interference with the plaintiff\u2019s good will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The second ground on which the defendants seek to take the eases at bar out of the decision in the Hathaway case lies in the fact that the master has found that \"If the fact is material . . . the defendants, perceiving that a loaf like the 'Creamalt \u2019 loaf, with rounded and flaring sides, suited the public taste or whim, and desiring to meet the competition of the 'Creamalt \u2019 loaf, decided to make a loaf having such rounded and flaring sides.\u201d The plaintiff has no exclusive right to make and sell bread having an oval shape, flaring sides and an exaggerated rounding of the top. And the defendants would have a right to make and sell bread which has that shape were it not for the fact that bread of that shape means to the publip that it is made by the plaintiff. From this it follows (as was decided in <em>Flagg Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Holway, </em>178 Mass. 88, and as was stated in that part of the opinion of this court in <em>George G. Fox Co. </em>v. <em>Hathaway </em>quoted above) that the defendants can use that shape of loaf if they take such precautions as will prevent their bread from being taken for the plaintiff\u2019s bread. The only precautions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>taken by them in these cases consist in stamping their names on the bottom of the loaves and placing bands around them. But the master has found in terms that these two means of distinguishing the defendants\u2019 loaves from the plaintiff\u2019s loaves \u201c would not be an adequate means of distinguishing the loaves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AoD\">We are therefore of opinion that there is nothing in these eases which takes them out of the decision in <em>George G. Fox Co. </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>199 Mass. 99, and that the twelfth exception to the master\u2019s report must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">- A new defense, however, is set up, namely, that the plaintiff does not come with clean hands. The master has found (first) that the representation made by th\u00e9 plaintiff as to the ingredients of the bread is that it is made of milk and malt unless calling it \u201c Creamalt \u201d \u201c may be taken to connote the use of pure cream.\u201d In our opinion it does not. Secondly, the master found that when the bill was filed \u201cthe plaintiff widely advertised \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 bread as the \u2018 new bread made with milk and malt.\u2019 \u201d The findings of the master are that the plaintiff used malt as one of the ingredients of its bread because \u201c it was also thought by the plaintiff to impart a desirable flavor to the bread,\u201d and that \u201cthe ingredients used in making \u2018 Creamalt \u2019 bread were of good quality and were skilfully combined and baked, in accordance with a formula devised by the plaintiff\u2019s agents as the result of experiments.\u201d The bread therefore appears to have been made according to a new formula, and so might be fairly termed a new bread, although all the ingredients had been used in combination before in making bread. Thirdly. Up to and including the year 1906 the plaintiff did make misrepresentations of fact with respect to its \u201c Creamalt \u201d bread. It advertised that \u201cIt has twice the food value of any other bread.\u201d And there were other similar misrepresentations. But these advertisements had been stopped nearly a year and a half before these bills were filed on June 4, 1908. Although it is not so found in terms, we take it to be the fact on the findings made by the master that the increase in the plaintiff\u2019s daily sales from \u201c about one hundred loaves \u201d to \u201c about six thousand loaves \u201d may have come in some degree from these false representations. Notwithstanding that, the plaintiff has built up a large and remunerative business in selling a good bread which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the public like, and the defendants have put upon the market an imitation of its loaves, adapted to use in deceiving that part of the public who had only a general knowledge and recollection of that which had been recommended to them, or which they had been accustomed to buy. The question we have to decide is whether the plaintiff who, for nearly a year and a half before the bill was filed, stopped all advertisements which were not true, is to be precluded from having the defendants enjoined from selling their bread as the plaintiff\u2019s bread because some of its former advertisements contained statements which were not true. In our opinion that would be going too far, and the only authorities we have seen are to that effect. <em>Moxie Nerve Food Co. </em>v. <em>Modox Co. </em>153 Fed. Rep. 487. <em>Benedictus </em>v. <em>Sullivan, Powell &amp; Co. </em>12 R. P. C. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The orders overruling the first, third, fourth, fifth and twelfth exceptions to the master\u2019s report taken by the plaintiff must be reversed and said exceptions must be sustained. The orders for decrees dismissing the bills must be reversed and decrees entered in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
