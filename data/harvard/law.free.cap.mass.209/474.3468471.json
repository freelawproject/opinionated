An auditor to whom the case was referred found that the covering that the plaintiff had proposed using conformed to the requirements of the wording of the contract and that he could not find that it was inferior in quality to that demanded by the architect, that the architect thought that the covering specified in the contract was made only by the manufacturer whose product he insisted upon, but that he was mistaken. The case subsequently was heard by a judge without a jury and there were in evidence the auditor\u2019s report, certain documents, and oral testimony, the weight of which seemed strongly to show that the plaintiff complied with the terms of the contract and that the architect was wholly without justification in fact for the action he took, but there was some evidence tending to show that only the kind of covering insisted upon by the architect would satisfy the terms of the contract. The judge found for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions. <em>Held, </em>that under the contract the architect was constituted an arbitrator to determine practical questions of performance that might arise during the progress of the construction, and, so long as he acted honestly and with reasonable efficiency, his action was binding on the parties; that the evidence was not quite so conclusive as to make no finding reasonably possible except that the architect had acted unreasonably, capriciously or fraudulently, and therefore that the exceptions must be overruled.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b497-5\">Where at the trial of an action an affirmative issue must be established by one party upon evidence, a part of which is oral, ordinarily a ruling that such party as matter of law is entitled to recover cannot be given.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b497-6\">A contract in writing between a county and one who agreed to erect for the county a power electric and heating plant provided that the work was to be done and the materials were to be furnished \u201cunder the direction of an engineer selected by the architect and to the satisfaction of the architect and such engineer,\u201d and that, in case \u201c said work or materials . . . shall be unsatisfactory to the said architect,\u201d and upon the plaintiff being notified thereof in writing, the plaintiff was to remove the unsatisfactory work or materials and supply in place thereof \u201cthe work and materials satisfactory to the architect.\u201d The contract required the use of a certain pipe covering called \u201c Air Cell Class A.\u201d The contractor proposed to use a covering which he contended answered that description, but the architect refused to accept it, and insisted that a covering made by a certain manufacturer should be used, and, upon the contractor persisting in his course, the architect terminated the contract. At the trial of an action by the contractor against the county for breach of the contract, there was evidence to substantiate the contention of the architect, as well as evidence tending to show that he was mistaken and ignorant. The contractor asked the presiding judge to rule that \u201c if it is found that the covering furnished by the plaintiff was not inferior in quality, or otherwise, to that\u201d which the architect insisted upon, \u201cthe architect and engineer had no legal right to reject the same for reasons stated by them in their evidence.\u201d The ruling was refused, the judge found for the defendants; and the contractor alleged an exception. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>Held, </em>that, aside from the fact that the ruling requested a finding of fact which the judge had a right to determine against the plaintiff, so that it might have been refused properly on that ground alone, the ruling asked for did not contain an accurate statement of law, because, under the above quoted provisions of the contract, a rejection of the covering which the contractor proposed to use might have been within the legal right of the architect and engineer if they acted in good faith and not whimsically, even though they acted somewhat ignorantly or mistakenly.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b498-5\">By a contract in writing relating to the erection for a county of a power electric and heating plant, approval by the county commissioners of all sums to be paid for labor and materials besides those required by the contract was necessary and a method of arbitrating disputes was provided for. It also was provided that the contractor should not be entitled to demand or receive payment for any portion of the work done or materials furnished \u201c until each and all of the specifications \u201d of the contract \u201c are complied with and the architect shall have given his certificate to that effect, and until all disputes, disagreements, and questions between the parties . . . affecting the right to any portion of the amount claimed shall have been settled as above provided for.\u201d The architect under other provisions of the contract caused the contractor to cease work and the contractor brought an action against the county upon an account annexed for labor and materials furnished in addition to those required by the contract, at the trial of which it appeared that the labor and materials were ordered in writing by the county commissioners representing the county, and that the architect never had fixed the fair value of them because, as he testified, \u201c there was no necessity of my approving them until\u2019 the final adjustment of the accounts.\u201d Bequests for arbitration were made which came to nothing. The judge found for the defendant and the plaintiff alleged exceptions. <em>Held, </em>that the finding was warranted, since the jury might have found that the requirement in the contract of approval by the county commissioners of payments for items not called for by the contract was not waived.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-6\">Contract, with a declaration described in the opinion, for sums alleged to be due to the plaintiffs for work done and materials furnished upon a power electric and heating plant for the county buildings of the defendant in that part of Cambridge, called East Cambridge.

The declaration contains five counts, only four of which are now material. The first count is upon a written contract between the plaintiffs and the defendant, by which the former undertook to erect a power electric and heating plant for the defendant, and alleged partial performance by the plaintiffs and unreasonable refusal by the defendant to permit them to complete it. The third and fourth counts are for work done and materials supplied, as extras to the contract. The fifth count is upon a <em>quantum meruit </em>for the same work claimed under count one. The answer sets up that the contract did not comply with St. 1898, c. 170, or St. 1897, c. 137, and that the work under the contract was not done as required by it to the satisfaction of the architect, who for this reason acting under the contract stopped further performance of it. The case was sent to an auditor, who found the facts in favor of the plaintiffs. It was thereafter tried upon the auditor\u2019s report and additional evidence, part of which was oral, before a judge of the Superior Court, who found generally for the defendant. The case is brought here by the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions to the refusal of the trial judge to grant certain rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The contract provided that the work was \u201c A. ... to be done and materials furnished under the direction of an engineer selected by the architect and to the satisfaction of the architect and such engineer. . . . And in case . . . said work or materials . . . shall be unsatisfactory to the said architect, then the said party of the second part shall, on being notified thereof, in writing, by the said architect, immediately remove such unsatisfactory work or materials, and supply the place thereof with other work and materials satisfactory to the architect.\u201d \u201c B. . . . all work contemplated and described by the plans and these specifications and this contract shall be done to the satisfaction of the said architect and engineer . . . and who shall be the sole judges as to the fitness of the work and materials as herein set forth. If any objection is made by the architect or engineer to any work or materials, then the said party of the second part shall remove such unsatisfactory work and materials.\u201d \u201c C. And if, at any time, any of the work mentioned in said specifications is not progressing, or any materials are not in accordance with the said' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>specifications, to the entire satisfaction of the said architect, after five days\u2019 notice having been served on the said party of the second part by the said architect, then the said party of the first part shall have the right to enter upon and take possession of said work, and remove all materials that are considered by said architect unfit for said work, and furnish suitable materials instead therefor.\u201d The trouble arose over the furnishing of \u201c Sectional Covering . . . Air Cell Class A \u201d required by the specifications. The plaintiffs provided a kind of covering for pipe covering, which, they contended, complied with this description, and the architect contended that it did not, and on refusal by the plaintiffs to substitute he gave the notice to remove the materials, and' subsequently to terminate the contract. The auditor found that the covering furnished by the plaintiffs was \u201c Air Cell Sectional Covering Class A,\u201d and was so known in the trade, and was unable to find that it was inferior in quality to that demanded by the architect, which was manufactured by a particular manufacturer alone, and that the engineer and architect both supposed that the only kind of covering which would conform to the specification was that manufactured only by a particular manufacturer. He does not find that this was through corruption, but the inference appears to be that it was through ignorance. At the trial before the Superior Court there was some evidence tending to show that the goods furnished by the plaintiffs did not comply with the specification in that Class A covering meant a 5-ply covering, while that furnished by the plaintiffs was 4-ply covering. The weight of the evidence including the auditor\u2019s report seems strongly to support the view that the plaintiffs complied with the terms of the contract, and that the architect was wholly without justification in fact for the action he took, yet under the familiar rule that the findings of fact of a trial court are not open to revision by an appellate tribunal and can be set aside only when they have no foundation in evidence, we cannot disturb a general finding for the defendant. The evidence is not quite so conclusive as to enable us to say that no finding was reasonably possible, except that the architect acted unreasonably, capriciously, arbitrarily, wilfully or fraudulently. <em>Harper </em>v. Dewey, 191 Mass. 411. <em>Handy </em>v. Bliss, 204 Mass. 513. The architect by the terms of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>tract was constituted an arbitrator by the parties to determine practical questions of performance that might arise during the progress of the construction. So long as he acted honestly and with reasonable efficiency his action was binding upon the parties. <em>Norcross </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>187 Mass. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The first ruling asked for by the plaintiffs, which was a general one, that they were entitled to recover, could not have been given properly. The burden of proof was upon the plaintiffs, and where an affirmative issue must be made out by one party upon evidence, a part of which is oral, ordinarily such a ruling cannot be given as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The second ruling called for a finding of fact, which, by refusing to give, the trial judge apparently decided adversely to the plaintiffs. In view of the finding which must have been made in order to refuse the second prayer, the third was also properly refused. Moreover this prayer was not quite an accurate statement of the law. It might be that \u201c the covering furnished by the plaintiffs was not inferior in quality or otherwise to that of the Asbestos Paper Company,\u201d and yet a rejection of it might be within the legal right of the architect and engineer acting in good faith and not whimsically, even though somewhat ignorantly or mistakenly.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth requests ask for findings of fact, which by its refusal the court seems not to have been able to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The sixth prayer called for a ruling of law which was correct in its terms but for a finding of fact which it appears from the other findings of fact requested the court was unable to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The eighth and ninth prayers were requests for rulings of law based upon a certain construction of all the evidence. But, as there was some slight evidence that a five-ply covering alone would satisfy the terms of the contract, it does not appear that the facts existed which were assumed in the prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The contract also provided that the plaintiffs should not be entitled to demand payment for any portion of the work done or materials furnished \u201c until each and all of the stipulations \u201d contained in the contract \u201c are complied with and the architect shall have given his certificate to that effect, and until all disputes, disagreements, and questions between the parties hereto, affect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ing the right to any portion of the amount claimed shall have been settled as above provided for.\u201d It was found by the auditor and does not appear to have been disputed at the trial, that the labor and materials referred to in the third and fourth counts were in addition to that required under the contract, and were ordered in writing by the county commissioners, who represented the defendant. The fair value to be added to the contract price was not fixed by the architect as required by the contract, for the reason as testified by him that <em>\u201c </em>There was no necessity of my approving them until the final adjustment of the accounts.\u201d Requests for arbitration were made, but came to nothing. A clause in the contract required that the commissioners should also approve the additional sum to be paid for all additions to the contract. This was a detail of the contract which might have been Waived, but whether it was waived or not was a fact which it may be inferred from the general finding in favor of the defendant the trial judge was unable to make. The bill of exceptions does not state that it contains all the material evidence, and the defendant has taken this point in argument. Exceptions which depend upon a finding of fact may be disposed of on this ground. <em>Appleton </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>173 Mass. 398. <em>York </em>v. <em>Barstow, </em>175 Mass, 167. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Longarini, </em>207 Mass. 556. But we have placed the decision on a broader ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Although the case appears to be one of great hardship to the plaintiffs, the governing rules of law make no other result possible upon these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
