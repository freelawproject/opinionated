Upon this point there was evidence which is referred to briefly in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-3\">No copy of the construction mortgage agreement, referred to in the defendant\u2019s acceptance of the order, was included in the bill of exceptions. The following testimony in regard to its material provision occurred in the cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s president. He testified that the defendant did a large business in lending money on construction loans; that the written agreement as to the loan for the building to be put on lot A provided how the payments should be made; that the first and second payments were reached and paid, that the third payment of $1,500 was to be made according to the written agreement \u201c When said building shall be plastered and skimmed and all windows in and blinds hung \u201d ; that this was the plaster payment, so called; that the building did not reach the stage where the plaster payment, so called, could be required; and that the builders failed to earn the plaster payment by not putting in the windows. He further testified that he should have waived the objection that no blinds had been put on if it had been called to his attention that awnings were to be used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-4\">At the conclusion of the testimony, the judge stated that it appeared to be clear that there were holes in the wall with the wood work or frames around them, but that none of the cross bars, nor glass, none of the movable portion of the windows, had been put in, and that, this being so, he would find as a fact that the specified contract was not complied with, and that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-5\">The judge found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-7\"><em>J. F. O\u2019Connell, J. E. O\u2019Connell \u00a7 D. T. O\u2019Connell, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-8\"><em>J. L. Bates, F. N. Nay &amp; L. M. Abbott, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b37-9\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A51\">The acceptance of the draft was conditional and the condition was that the plaster payment should be due. Did that payment ever become due ? By the contract between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the builder and the defendant it was to be due \u201c when said building shall be plastered and skimmed and all windows in and blinds hung.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">All that the builder ever did as to the windows was to make the openings and put in the general frames without the sashes or glass. The plaintiff contended and introduced evidence, in support of the contention that windows were \u201cin\u201d when the holes were made and the general frames were inserted. But there was some conflict in the evidence. The defendant did not seem to rely upon the fact that the blinds were not hung, because awnings were to be used and blinds in such case would not be needed, but insisted that the part of the contract which related to the windows had not been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The judge before whom the case was tried without a jury found as a fact that the specified contract had not been complied with, and found generally for the defendant; and the case is before us upon the plaintiffs exceptions to those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The house to be constructed was situated in Brookline, and, we understand, was to be a dwelling house. It is unnecessary to recite the evidence in detail. It is sufficient to say that, whatever may be the meaning of the word \u201c window \u201d in certain connections, the evidence warranted a finding that the phrase \u201c all windows in,\u201d when taken in connection with the phrase \u201c blinds hung,\u201d and all being a part of a clause in the contract for the erection and completion of a dwelling house, meant windows fitted with sashes and glass ready for use as completed windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
