No copy of the plea or notice was served on the defendant\u2019s attorney in connection with the affidavit upon which this motion was founded, but the affidavit stated that a copy plea and notice of special matter had been served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney; and the notice of motion was, that the motion would be founded on the affidavit served, and the pleadings in the cause. On the motion coming on,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-6\"><em>M. T. </em>Reynolds, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMV\">produced what he alleged to be a copy of the plea and notice served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, signed, as he said, by the defendant\u2019s attorney; and insisted on using this copy as evidence to the court of the pleadings in the cause. To this,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-7\"><em>A. </em>Taber, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah8f\">objected, inasmuch as the paper was in no way verified.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"><em>By the </em>Court,</p>\n<author id=\"AOx\">Cowen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">The affidavit and notice of motion refer to the copy plea and notice served by the defendant\u2019s attorney; but no copy is verified except by the production of an alleged copy now in the hands of the moving counsel. This may be false;. and I am not aware of any decision which would authorize the receipt of it as evidence to us, without an affidavit showing it to be a true copy. But we arc every day in the habit of doing as much in respect to admissions of service, which we judicially notice as genuine under the same circumstances. In the case before us, the copy purports to be signed by an officer of the court, and is produced by an officer. It is on this ground, I take it, that we receive admissions of service. In each case there is room for imposition; but our decisions on summary applications are not final; and on being felt, impositions may be at once corrected on motion. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>case of admissions, too, the attorney by whom they purport to be made, is not supposed even to retain a copy or draft; whereas he always does retain one or the other of all pleadings which he sends out.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">It is very desirable, as far as possible, to dispense with the service of papers not necessary for the adverse party in respect to motions which arise on pleadings or otherwise. Enumerated motions present another large class of cases in which copies are received' upon the official responsibility of attorneys and counsel. <em>(Vide Jackson, ex dem, Wood, </em>v. <em>Harrow, </em>11 <em>John. R. </em>434, 436.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">I think the paper in question may be received. The consequence is, that the motion must be granted to strike out the'plea with costs, unless .the defendant\u2019s counsel shall elect to retain this. If <em>the </em>latter, let the notice be stricken out with, costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
