The plaintiff caused the writ to be returned and filed in this court, and, before the return day, entered the defendant\u2019s default for not pleading.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-8\"><em>A.

As to our power to grant relief\u2014when the writ is actually returned and filed, although, the return day has not arrived, we are sufficiently possessed of the cause to regulate the proceedings of the parties. And besides, the motion is to set aside a default entered in this court, and although nothing else were before us, this irregular entry might be vacated. In the case cited by Mr. Jenkins, we were asked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>quash certain proceedings of the supervisors before a certiorari had even been awarded to bring the matter before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
