Barthelemy and De Bouillon, plaintiffs in error, together with one John Collon, were convicted before the general sessions of the city and comity of New-York, in June, 1840, on an indictment, the first count of which charged a conspiracy to publish a libel with a view to extort money from the Rev. A. Yerren, a clergyman in the city of New-York, and the second count charged the simple publication of the libel. The court thereupon sentenced Barthelemy to imprisonment in the penitentiary for nine months, and De Bouillon to the like imprisonment for one year. \"They also imposed a fine of $250 upon each; and \"sentenced them to commitment till their fines should be respectively paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-11\">In the first count of the indictment the libel was described in a general way, as a book calling Mr. Yerren a hypocrite, slanderer, &amp;c., and imputing to him certain immoralities, such as adultery, seduction, hardness toward the poor, &amp;c. The second count set forth copious extracts from the book, which detailed with great particularity the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>conduct and language of Yerren in respect to his parishioners and others, at various times and places\u2014calling him an impostor, and concluding thus\u2014\u201cWe wished to establish four principal points; 1. Hardness toward the poor; 2. Dissoluteness of. morals; 3. Immorality in his principles ; 4. Habits of vice and calumny. We think we have accomplished this,\u201d &amp;c. The book was entitled\u2014\u201c Rev. Anthony Yerren, Pastor of the French Episcopal Church of the Saint-Esprit at New-York\u2014Judged by his works.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">At the trial, the publication, distribution and general sale of the book, were shown; and evidence given tending to prove the conspiracy charged in the first count. In respect to some of the charges in the libel, no attempt to prove <em>their truth was </em>made. The defendants below, however, endeavored to show that Yerren had been guilty of writing and sending anonymous letters, of a slanderous and obscene character\u2014that he had acted with hardness and rudeness toward certain of his parishioners, viz. Mr. and Mrs. Barbelet, in withholding their due share of a charitable fund provided by his congregation and placed under his control\u2014and that he had seduced and been guilty of criminal intercourse with the wife of De Bouillon. Considerable evidence was addressed to the jury, tending, on the one hand, to establish these charges, and on the other, to disprove them. In the course of the trial, the defendants\u2019 counsel proposed to en-quire of one Helie, as to a statement or declaration made to him by Yerren. This was excluded on the ground that Yerren had not yet been examined as a witness. The witness was then asked by defendants\u2019 counsel, what conversations he had had with Yerren, relative to American ladies'? This also was excluded, on the ground of its being a general enquiry into matters not set forth in the libel. The defendants\u2019 counsel next enquired of the witness, what he had heard Yerren say in regard to his motive in procuring the charge of his church in New-York? On being called upon to disclose what was expected to be proved by the answer to this question, the defendants\u2019 counsel said, they intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>show that Yerren avowed his motive was to make money; and thus lay the foundation for inferring that he was a hypocrite. The enquiry was objected to and overruled. The defendants\u2019 counsel then put the following questions to the witness: Did not Mr. Yerren slate to you that in preparing his sermons he had purloined from Yol taire, and that if the members of his church knew it they would turn him out of doors ? Have you ever heard Mr. Yerren call his father in law a d\u2014d old rascal ? Have you ever heard Mr. Yerren advise any person to buy goods and then cheat the seller out of his pay? Did Yerren admit to you that he had had intrigues with ladies in France, or Ferney ? These questions were severally overruled; and the defendants\u2019 counsel next asked the witness, whether Yerren had admitted himself to be an impostor ? This was excluded, on the ground of its not being coupled or proposed to be coupled with any charge contained in the libel and therein referred to as establishing the character of an impostor. The defendants\u2019 counsel then proposed to enquire of the witness, if Yerren had not admitted that he had written or intended to write anonymous letters ? The object of this enquiry, as avowed, was, to establish th\u00e9 general charge in the libel of \u201cHabits of vice and calumny.\u201d It was overruled on the ground, that the general charge referred to, purported to be a deduction from certain facts previously detailed in the libel, and that the question pro' pounded was not confined to those facts. The witness was then asked by the defendants\u2019 counsel, whether Yerren had not admitted that he had charged one of the vestrymen of his church with stealing money from him ? This was also objected to and overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-6\">The counsel for the defendants, for the purpose of showing the good motives of Barthelemy in making the publication in question, proposed to prove that he was a man of literary habits. This was objected to, and overruled; whereupon the defendants\u2019 counsel, for the like purpose, proposed to show that Barthelemy was a man of good character\u2014that he had sustained a good character in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>France, and subsequently in this country; but the court excluded the evidence. The defendants\u2019 counsel next proposed to prove the four general conclusions stated in the book in question as the \u201c principal points\u201d thereby sought to be established, viz: 1. Hardness toward the poor ; 2. Dissoluteness, &amp;c. ; 3. Immorality, &amp;c. ; 4. Habits of vice, &amp;c. This they avowed their intention of doing\u2014not by evidence of the circumstances detailed in the book as tending to those conclusions\u2014but by proving other facts not mentioned in the book. The evidence was objected to and overruled. The defendants\u2019 counsel then offered to prove the good character of Collon; which offer was also overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">In the course of the trial, John Granger was sworn as a witness on <em>the </em>part of <em>the people, </em>and gave material testimony against the defendants. After the testimony was closed by the consent of all parties, the court adjourned for the day, reserving the right of Collon to examine one Felix, should <em>he </em>appear before the summing up commenced. On the court assembling the next day, De Bouil-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">lon\u2019s counsel moved to open the proofs with a view to impeach the character of Granger, upon. an affidavit of De Bouillon that Granger\u2019s testimony was untrue and a surprise upon him. Verren\u2019s affidavit was read in opposition to De Bouillon\u2019s, and the court overruled the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\">To each of the several decisions above mentioned, the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted. They also excepted to the recorder\u2019s charge to the jury, and to his refusal to charge as requested; but as these exceptions were deemed clearly unfounded, and were apparently not much relied on by the counsel who argued the case at bar, it is deemed unnecessary to present the matters to which they related, in detail. After judgment in the court below, the defendants De Bouillon and Barthelemy brought error to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-8\"><em>H. M. Western &amp; C. De Wilt, </em>for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADv\">insisted that the court erred in denying the motion to admit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>testimony impeaching the character of Granger. The discretion which a court has in this respect is not an arbitrary, but a legal discretion, and it must be soundly and judiciously exercised. An abuse of discretion, where a discretionary power exists, or a refusal to grant relief under circumstances clearly entitling a party to relief, is error, and constitutes good matter for an exception. In the course of the discussion on this point, the counsel cited and commented on <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Sayer, </em>(7 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>306,) <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Vorce, </em>(15 <em>Wend. </em>193,) and <em>Cowen &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes to Phil. Ev. pp. </em>717, 718.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-5\">They next insisted, that the court erred in rejecting the offered testimony as to the good character of Barthelemy. It was competent under the count charging a conspiracy to extort money, as a circumstance to rebut the idea of his having acted from the motive imputed. It was also competent under the count for publishing the libel in question. We attempted to justify the libel j and a fair question was raised by the evidence whether the attempt had not been successful. Enough was proved at the trial to warrant the submission of that question to the jury. Indeed, <em>non constat that </em>the jury were not entirely with us on that point, and found the defendants guilty because, though they had published the truth, it had not been done <em>from \u201cgood </em>motives, and for justifiable ends.\u201d Truth itself may be libellous, if published from bad motives, and for purposes which the law condemns. In this view, therefore, the good character of Barthelemy would have come powerfully to his aid, and he had a right to invoke it. But the rule now is, that good character may always be shown by the prisoner in a criminal prosecution. Its weight and effect are matters for the consideration of the jury. We also submit that the court erred in rejecting evidence of the character of Col Ion. There could have been no conviction of any of the defendants for a conspiracy, unless Col Ion\u2019s guilt was establish\u00e9d; and whatever tended \"to exculpate him, was material for the rest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-6\">Again: the court erred in ruling that the defendants</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>were not at liberty to prove the truth of the four general conclusions stated in the book without reference to any facts particularly- detailed therein. The writer says: \u201c We wish to establish four principal points, viz; 1. Hardness toward the poor; <em>2. </em>Dissoluteness, &lt;fcc.; 3. Immorality, &amp;c.; 4. Habits of vice and calumny.\u201d It is submitted that these general conclusions constitute the very gist of the libel. To establish them, was the whole design of the book; and the writer expressly avows this. We therefore contend, that any thing tending to shew .these charges true, should have been admitted in justification. Moreover, it is plain that the writer in these general charges or conclusions was speaking of <em>habits, </em>prevailing dispositions or motives. It is a perversion of the entire scope and tenor of the book, to assume that he designed to produce conviction only of the instances of guilt detailed. On the contrary, this was evidently the smallest part of his object. He narrates an instance or two, and then alludes to others which are not particularized. His aim was not at facts merely, but at motives and thoughts; not at isolated instances, but habitual practices. The .number of facts related, tending to either one of the general conclusions is very small\u2014not enough, if taken by themselves, to shew a habit\u2014and yet the habit is charged; indeed, it is the main charge. Suppose, for illustration, A. publishes of B. that he is guilty of habitual lewdness\u2014that he is lascivious in disposition and heart; and for proof of this charge, A. says, that \u201c among many other instances which I might cite and can establish, I select two, the least offensive of all\u201d\u2014specifying and describing these two, and concluding with the general charge with which he commenced. Can it be pretended that A., if prosecuted, would be confined in his justification to the two instances narrated <em>1 </em>We think not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\">The counsel further contended, at considerable length, that the court below erred in overruling the several questions put to the witness Helie. \" They submitted, moreover, that there was error in the charge to the jury, as well as in the refusal to charge.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>J. R. Whiting, </em>(district attorney,) for the people,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1b\">insisted that the writ of error could not be sustained in this case, inasmuch as, on the face of the record, it appeared the defendant's term of imprisonment in the penitentiary had elapsed, and so the sentence pronounced by the court below was satisfied. He also controverted in detail the several propositions advanced by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error. As the main drift of his argument, however, was substantially in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion of the court, it is thought proper not to insert it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\n<em>By the Court,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"Ab2\">Cowen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axv\">To the preliminary objection raised by the district attorney, viz. the writ of error must fail, because it appears on the face of the record that the term of confinement in the penitentiary to which the plaintiffs in error were sentenced has elapsed, and so the sentence passed upon them by the court below satisfied, there are two answers. They were not only sentenced to imprisonment, but each was also fined ; and it is not apparent on the record that the fine of either has been paid. If it were necessary, therefore, to warrant their calling on this court for a reversal, that they should show the immediate pressure of an unsatisfied judgment upon them, we see enough in the fines uncancelled of record. But the payment or satisfaction of an erroneous judgment against a party, can never be allowed as a bar to a writ of error, even in a case where- we must see that no restitution could follow the reversal as a legal consequence, and no costs be recovered. An erroneous judgment against him is an injury <em>per se, </em>from which the law will intend he is or will be damnified by its continuing against him unreversed. There may be exceptions to the rule, as in case of a nonsuit, no costs being awarded; <em>(Monell </em>v. <em>Weller, 2 John. R. </em>8, 9;) <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> but a judgment on the merits is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>conclusive between the parties, and; if not by direct, it may be followed by remote consequences actually injurious. In some cases of libel, an erroneous conviction at the suit of the people might, unless reversed, by forever concluding the defendant, materially affect the profits to be otherwise derived from the salo of a valuable literary work. There is no doubt, therefore, that the plaintiffs in error have a right to demand a consideration of the exceptions which they took to the proceedings of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The exception to the charge of the recorder was clearly ill taken; and so of the exception that he refused to charge as requested by counsel. And to some offers of evidence an obvious objection was suggested by the court below. The proposition, for instance, to establish hardness of the plaintiff towards the poor, dissoluteness in his morals, immorality in his principles, and habits of vice and calumny, by instances of conduct not detailed or alluded to in the book, were inadmissible, for the reason that all these were imputed as conclusions deducible from particular instances enumerated and arranged in the book with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>view to the establishment of those conclusions. Most clearly the defendants below had no right to depart in their proof from the circumstances they had set forth. They say, for instance, Yerren wrote and sent anonymous letters of a certain character; therefore, he was 'guilty of calumny and obscenity. To allow proof of other instances, such as defamatory and obscene conversations, would be to violate - the well settled rule, that to justify a slander, charging a specific oifence, you shall not be permitted to prove another, though of the same character.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Upon the same principle, I am also inclined to think, the court below were right in excluding the testimony which was offered, having a tendency to show that Yerren was an impostor. True, he is called an impostor in the book, not, as in other instances, by way of express conclusion from the circumstances; but the charge amounts to that in fair construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Several of the questions proposed to be addressed to Helie were, therefore, improper^ as having no relevancy to instances stated in the book, while others were entirely irrelevant, in all respects; and I think the whole were properly excluded on one or the other of these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">There is, I apprehend, also another ground on which several of those questions were inadmissible. Some of them respected the naked admissions of Yerren\u2014such as that he was an impostor, that he was in a particular situation at a certain place, that he had intrigues with ladies at France and Ferney, &amp;c. The admissions were not in themselves facts, going to establish the vicious attributes imputed by the book or any others. In re\u25a0spect to such questions, it seems to me, therefore, the objection of the district attorney comes with great force, that they sought for naked declarations. Obscene or slanderous coversations, serious arguments against the truth of revelation, and the like, might have been pertinent ;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> as we receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>arguments in favor of atheism, coming from a witness, to show his incompetency from defect of religious principle.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> Such declarations are a part of the <em>res gestee. </em>But I am not prepared to concede that, when the people have instituted a criminal prosecution, they lie, in any case,- at the mercy of mere naked admissions made by the party injured, when they do not introduce him as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Whether farther testimony should have been heard in the cause after the proofs had been closed and the court below adjourned, touching Granger\u2019s character, or any other question in the cause, was so entirely a matter of discretion with the court, that the defendants could not have been entitled to a bill of exceptions under any circumstances, on the ground of the court\u2019s refusal to open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the proofs. <em>(Philadelphia &amp; Trenton Rail-Road Company </em>v. <em>Stimpson, </em>14 <em>Pet. </em>448, 463.) <footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">But there was an offer to prove the good character of both Barthelemy and Collon. And it is truly said, by the counsel for these plaintiffs in error, that in answer to the first count, which was for a conspiracy, they have a right, if such be the fact, to complain that proper testimony has been rejected not only in respect to themselves personally, but their supposed co-conspirator. Proof of his innocence might have enured as proof of theirs. The offer, however, was the same in respect to Barthelemy, and whether offered as an answer to the charge of conspiracy or libel, I should think it by no means clear that character might not have been material in the view stated when the offer was made. The defendants below had a right to assume, for the purposes of the offer, that the jury would think the truth of some portion of the libel had been established; but that was not a full answer to either count. In order to make out a case of complete innocence, good motives and justifiable ends in the publishers were necessary, of which the jury are, by the constitution, made judges. <em>(Art. </em>7, \u00a7 8, 1 <em>R. S. </em>45, <em>2d ed.) </em>Publication of the truth, and even conspiracy to publish the truth, from good motives and for justifiable ends would not be criminal; and, a certain line of character, as for good morals, great piety, or a laudable aversion to hypocrisy and imposture in all men, might form an important item in the defence against such a prosecution as this. But unfortunately for the plaintiffs in error, the offers came far short of any thing like what I have supposed. They were simply to show <em>good </em>character, not for \u25a0 any moral attribute whatever, nor even a general character for good morals. The offers might have been intended, for aught we can see, of good character for skill in the defendants\u2019 profession or calling. They were so indefinite as not to indicate a sort of character which could be relevant to the object avowed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The rule applicable to the case will be found with its il lustrations, in 1 <em>Phil. Ev. </em>177, <em>and the notes, Cowen &amp; Hill\u2019s ed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">I am of opinion, therefore, that none of the exceptions .were well taken; and that the judgment of the court below must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">I</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b271-6\"><em> </em>In the case cited, the plaintiff in error was nonsuited before a justice of the peace, and, as was held, erroneously; but as no costs were awarded against him, the court refused to interfere, either by way of affirmance or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>reversal, saying, that the judgment below was incomplete. They speak also of their inability to restore the party to the state he was in when the nonsuit was granted; and that the object of the plaintiff in error was merely to throw a bill of costs on the defendant. In a case immediately succeeding the above, in the same volume, <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Suits, </em>2 <em>John. Rep. </em>9,) the court held, that a certiorari will lie to reverse a justice\u2019s judgment of nonsuit <em>when costs are awarded. </em>These decisions have sometimes been interpreted as maintaining the general proposition, that error will in no case lie to reverse a judgment of nonsuit, provided the plaintiff has not been injured by being subjected to the payment of the defendant\u2019s costs. A doctrine the direct contrary of this seems to have been applied in the subsequent case of <em>Lovell </em>v. <em>Evertson, </em>(11 <em>John. Rep. </em>52.) There, the action was tried in the common pleas, and the plaintiff was erroneously nonsuited. On error brought, the judgment was reversed, though there was no award of costs upon the record in the court below against the plaintiff; and this, upon the express ground, that the plaintiff in error was aggrieved \u201c by being defeated of his right of action in that suit, and of his costs for prosecuting the same.\u201d Otherwise, where the plaintiff has <em>submitted, to a non-suit </em>in the court below. <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>4 <em>Wheat. </em>73. <em>See also Van Wormer </em>v. <em>The Mayor &amp;c. of Albany, </em>18 <em>Wend. </em>169, 172, 173, per <em>Walworth, Chancellor; and per Butter, J. in Kempland </em>v. <em>Macauley, </em>4 <em>T. R. </em>430, 437.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"> In most cases, where the state of mind, sentiment, or disposition of a person at a particular period, become pertinent topics of inquiry in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>legal proceedings, resort may, and frequently must be had to his declarations and conversations. These seem to come in, under such circumstances, as part of the res gestee. An obvious instance is the case of alleged insanity. (See <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Sharp et al., </em>1 <em>Pet. C. C. Rep. </em>118; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>1 <em>Hawk\u2019s Rep. </em>24.) The necessity of sometimes allowing a resort to this species of evidence, even as in favor of the declarant, was recognized and illustrated in <em>Darby's adm\u2019r, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>(2 <em>Nott </em>&amp; <em>McCord, </em>596.) \u201c For instance,\u201d say the court, <em>(id. </em>599,) \u201c if it should become a question whether the party knew the multiplication table, it could only be established by hearing him repeat it: what he has said therefore must be resorted to, to prove that he knew it.\u201d In <em>lAghtner </em>v. <em>Wike, </em>(4 <em>Serg. Rawle, </em>203, 206, 207,) a witness swore that the testator had made confidential communications to him relating to the family affairs of the former; and the testator\u2019s declarations, by which he showed suspicion of the witness\u2019 honesty, were admitted in reply. These, said Tilghman, C. J. were acts\u2014not merely hearsay. They showed a want of confidence, and the improbability that family concerns of a delicate nature would have been committed to the witness.
