Soon after, the plaintiff directed the sheriff <em>not .to proceed to sell unless forced to do so by subsequent judgments until further orders, as an arrangement </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>had been made which, if fulfilled by the </em>defendant,' <em>would prevent a sale. </em>Afterwards one McCagg obtained two judgments on bond and warrant against the same defendant in the Columbia common pleas, and issued executions thereon on the 14th day of October, 1841, before the expiration of thirty days from the rendition of the judgments. These executions' were delivered to the same sheriff who soon after advertised and sold the goods under all three of the executions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-5\"><em>J. </em>Gaul, <em>Jr.,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2L\">moved, in behalf of McCagg, that the execution in this cause be postponed to the two executions in the common pleas, and that the proceeds of the sale be first applied upon the latter. He insisted that Kimball\u2019s execution had become dormant in the hands of the sheriff, and cited <em>Storm </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>(11 <em>John. R. </em>110;) <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>(17 <em>id. </em>274;) <em>Rew </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>(3 <em>Cowen, </em>272.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-6\"><em>M. T. \u25a0,Reynolds, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASxm\">cited <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Alkyn, </em>(2 <em>Rawle, </em>282;) <em>Power </em>v. <em>Van Buren, </em>(7 <em>Cowen, </em>560;) <em>Grah. Pr. 2d ed. </em>382 <em>to </em>384, <em>and the cases there cited. </em>He contended that McCagg\u2019s executions were void, having been issued within thirty days from the rendition of the judgments. <em>(Sess. haws of </em>1840, <em>p. </em>334, \u00a7 24.) He further insisted that this court could not interfere, on motion, between judgments rendered in different courts. That the only remedy was by a suit at law against the sheriff for a false return.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-7\"><em>Gaul, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5T\">The statute which denies the right of issuing <em>afi.fa. </em>until the expiration of thirty days from the docketing of the judgment was intended for the benefit of the judgment debtor; it confers upon him a personal privilege of which he alone can take advantage. This court has power, on motion, to set aside the execution in this cause, or pronounce it dormant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\n<em>By the Court,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"ABxp\">Cowen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATv\">No doubt, on the facts stated, the execution in this court is dormant in respect to those in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the common pleas; and the main question is, whether we have jurisdiction to declare the preference of the latter in this summary way. We have no direct control over the parties in the common pleas executions, nor of the sheriff, who, in respect to them, is an officer of the common pleas; but we have control over the plaintiff Kimball, against whom McCagg moves, and also over the sheriff in respect to the execution on the judgment in this cause. McCagg voluntarily submits himself to our order; and it will be enough for the sheriff\u2019s purposes, if he be protected against an action at the suit of Kimball. He will be so protected by our order that <em>he </em>appropriate none of the proceeds to the satisfaction of Kimball\u2019s execution till the others be satisfied. McCagg may, I think, take a rule to that effect. The case is like that of a party coming to set off his judgment in the common pleas against a judgment in this court. This is often done; and we have even extended the same practice to judgments in a justice\u2019s court.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">It is objected that the two executions in the common pleas issued before thirty days from the time of entering the judgments respectively had expired, in violation of the statute allowing that time. What this objection might amount to were it urged by Munger it is not necessary to say, for he makes an affidavit in support of this application, and has evidently consented that the executions might go within the time; at least he has waived the irregularity. The statute enlarging the time for issuing execution was intended for the exclusive benefit of the debtor. It belongs to our system of delaying creditors and exempting property from their executions for the ease of the debtor. He may waive all legal delays and exemptions in despite of third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\"> See Ewen v. <em>Terry, </em>(8 <em>Cowen, </em>126 ;) <em>Story </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>(3 <em>Wend. </em>331.) <em>Barbour's Law of Set-Off, </em>36, 37, <em>and cases there </em>cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
