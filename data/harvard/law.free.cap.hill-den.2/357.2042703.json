The motion was granted, <em>the costs to abide the event. </em>On the second trial the defendants obtained a verdict, and, on taxation of costs, insisted that they were entitled to have the costs of proposing amendments to the bill of exceptions and other costs of opposing the motion for a new trial, taxed as a part of their general bill. This was refused by the taxing officer, and</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-5\"><em>J B.

The taxing officer put his disallowance on the ground that we had not awarded costs to the defendants. The rule is now produced, whence it appears that they were to <em>abide the event. </em>Such a rule I miderstand to mean, the costs of the motion for a new trial as well as the costs of the trial itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">It is supposed that the <em>dictum, </em>in <em>The People, ex rel. Manning, </em>v. <em>New- York C. P. </em>(13 <em>Wend. </em>649, 655,) conflicts with this construction of the rule. The point does not appear to have been involved in that case; and beside, the <em>dictum </em>was applied to costs on error in a court other than that where they were allowed. The remark in that case, that a party is never entitled to costs of a trial or motion in which he is unsuccessful, <em>(p. </em>655,) must be taken with many qualifications; and one is, I .think, where the costs of opposing a motion for a new trial are ordered to abide the event, and the party so opposing succeeds in the trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
