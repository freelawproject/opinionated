The defendant pleaded <em>first, </em>not guilty; <em>second and third, </em>special pleas of justification. In the second plea, the defendant set forth portions of the \u201c act to incorporate the city of Utica,\u201d passed February 13, 1832. <em>[Slat. </em>1832, <em>p. </em>IT.) By the thirty-eighth section of the act, it was enacted that the common council should, among other things, have power to make and establish ordinances,\" rules, regulations and by-laws, to prevent vice and immorality ; to preserve peace and good order; to restrain and suppress disorderly and gaming houses, billiard tables, and all' instruments and devices used for gaming. By the fortieth section, the common council was authorized to enforce observance of their ordinances and by-laws by imposing penalties not exceeding $25, for any one offence, \u201cto be recovered with costs, in an action of debt, in any court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>having cognizance thereof.\u201d The 42d section provided that actions brought to recover any penalty incurred under the act, or the ordinances, by-laws or police regulations made in pursuance of the act, should be brought in the corporate name [of the city.] \u201c The first process in any such action, brought before a justice of the peace, shall be by warrant; and execution may be issued thereon immediately on the rendition of the judgment.\u201d The plea then set out the 5th section of a law or ordinance made by the common council of the city, on the 27th of April, 1832, as follows: \u201c If any person shall keep a billiard table, shuffle board, Eotable, Faro-banlt, or any other instrument of gaming where, or on, or with which, money, liquor or other articles shall in any manner be played for in said city, or if any person shall keep a disorderly or gaming house in said city, such person shall for every offence forfeit and pay a penalty of twenty-five dollars,\u201d \u00abfee. After setting out portions of the charter and by-law, the defendant averred that before, and at the time when \u00abfee., he was the attorney for the city, duly appointed by the common council, in pursuance of the 26th section of the charter, which authorizes such appointment: that on the 11th of May, ,1840, he, as such attorney, directed to be issued by John Parsons, a justice of the peace in and for said city, a warrant against the plaintiff for a violation of the said 5th section of the laws and ordinances of the city: that thereupon a warrant was issued by the justice, directed to any constable \u00abfee., commanding him in the name of the people \u00abfee., to take the plaintiff and bring him before the justice at \u00abfee., to answer unto the city of Utica in a plea of debt \u00abfee.; which warrant was endorsed \u00abfee., and was delivered to John Pease, a constable \u00abfee., to be executed, who took and arrested the plaintiff -by his body, and kept and detained him in custody by virtue of the warrant, for the time in the declaration mentioned \u00abfee.: which is the same trespass \u00abfee. Verification.. The <em>third flea </em>was substantially like the second. The plaintiff <em>demurred </em>to each of the special pleas, and the court below rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>judgment on the demurrers in his favor. On the trial upon not guilty the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff and assessed his damages at six cents; and judgment having been rendered against the defendant on the whole record, he brought error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-5\"><em>W.

(2 <em>R. S. </em>229, \u00a7 19. <em>Laws of </em>\u201931, <em>p. </em>403, \u00a7\u00a7 30, 31.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\n<em>By the Court,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"AXv\">Bronson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"At-\">The plaintiff below takes no exception to the pleas in matter of form, and the only question is, whether they are good in substance. The first objection urged against the pleas is, that .the justice had \u25a0 no jurisdiction to issue the warrant: that neither the act relating to justices\u2019 courts nor the charter of the city give any jurisdiction to a justice of the peace in actions to recover penalties for the violation of a by-law or ordinance of the common council of that city. We are referred to 2 <em>jR. 8. </em>225, \u00a7 2, <em>subd. </em>3, giving to justices cognizance of \u201call actions for any penalty not exceeding fifty dollars given by any <em>statute </em>of this statewhich, it is said, does not extend to the case of a penalty inflicted by an <em>ordinance </em>or <em>by-law </em>though made in pursuance of a statute. I do not think it necessary to consider the soundness of the argument, for the first subdivision of the same section gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the justice jurisdiction of <em>\u201c </em>all actions of <em>debt, </em>covenant and assumpsit, wherein the debt or balance due, or the damages claimed, shall not exceed fifty dollars ;\u201d.and I see no reason why this provision should be so restricted by construction as to exclude an action of debt to recover a penalty under a by-law. The 40th section of the charter provides for the recovery of a penalty inflicted by the ordinances of the common council <em>\u201c </em>in an action of debt, in any court having cognizance thereofand the 42d section of the charter declares, that \u201c the first process in any such action, <em>brought before a justice of the peace, </em>shall be by warrant.\u201d Although the charter does not, in terms, declare that a justice shall have jurisdiction in actions for penalties under by-laws, as is the case in some other charters to which we were referred, I cannot doubt that the legislature intended these actions should be brought in justices\u2019 courts. The penalty is recoverable \u201c with costs,\u201d (\u00a7 40;) and it would be very burdensome to a defendant to require the action for a debt which cannot exceed $25 to be brought in a court of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The second point was made for the purpose of raising the objection that the act incorporating the city is a private act, and. has not been sufficiently pleaded; but the objection was abandoned on the argument. It was also suggested under this point that the common council could not group several offences in one ordinance or by-law ; but the counsel was also understood to say that he did not rely on this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">It was not necessary for the defendant to aver in his pleas that the plaintiff had in fact violated the ordinance. It was the duty of the defendant, as attorney for the city, to sue for the recovery of penalties, and the statute gives him no choice but to proceed by warrant. (\u00a7 42.) If he acts maliciously and without probable cause, the injured party may have redress by an action on the case. But where, as in this case, his motives have not been questioned, it is impossible to maintain that he is liable to an action of trespass and false imprisonment if he happens to be mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>taken in supposing that a penalty has been incurred by the person arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The last objection and the one principally relied on by the plaintiff is, that the warrant issued without such affidavit, as is required by the act relating to justices\u2019 courts. <em>(2 R. S. </em>229, \u00a7 19. <em>Statutes of </em>1831, <em>p. </em>403, \u00a7 30, 31.) But the act incorporating the city was passed since the justice act, and it provides that \u201c <em>the first process </em>in any such action, [to recover a penalty] brought before a justice of the peace, <em>shall be by </em>warrant.\u201d (\u00a7 42.) The warrant is here given without . oath or affidavit; and the city attorney has no choice to proceed in any other way.' The word is not <em>may, </em>but <em>shall. </em>Under the justice act a warrant cannot issue except upon very special circumstances; and to hold that the attorney must comply with that act, would, in many cases, amount to a denial of all remedy for a violation of the city ordinances. I see no reason why we should disregard, the charter in settling this question. That differs in another respect from the justice act. When a penalty is recovered, execution may issue immediately. on the rendition of the judgment; and if there be no goods or lands, the defendant may be imprisoned in the county jail for a. period not exceeding thirty days. (\u00a7 42.) So far as the charter goes, it gives the rule of proceeding in /suits to recover penalties. Beyond that,- the law and practice of the court in which the action is brought must be followed. There is nothing unusual in this. There are many other cases where the common course of proceeding is either set aside or modified by special legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We are referred to the bill of rights, (1 <em>R. S. </em>84, \u00a7 11,) which provides against unreasonable searches and <em>seizures; </em>and declares that \u201cno warrants can issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d \u25a0 This relates to criminal process, and has nothing to do with arrests in civil suits. We have always had a bill of rights; and yet, until within a very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>recent period, a man might he arrested on a <em>copias </em>and held to bail as a matter of course, and without any thing more than a mere claim on the part of the plaintiff, unsupported by oath or affirmation, that the defendant was his debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Each of the pleas contains a good answer to the action. The judgment of the court below must therefore be reversed, and judgment must be rendered for the plaintiff in error on the demurrers.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
