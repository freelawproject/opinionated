The defendant\u2019s attorney gave geneial notice of retainer after service of the summons-and before the actual return or return day of the writ; whereupon, and before the actual return or return day, the plaintiffs declared, and the defendant\u2019s attorney gave a written admission of the service of-the declaration.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-13\"><em>J. Benedict, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8i\">moved to set aside the declaration as premature, contending that it was irregular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>to serve it before the return day or actual return of the writ. In support of the motion, he cited <em>2 R. S. </em>432, \u00a7 11; <em>id. </em>435, \u00a7 35; <em>id. </em>434, \u00a7 28; <em>id. </em>433, \u00a7 20; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>(18 <em>Wend. </em>581;) <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Murdock et al. </em>(12 <em>id. </em>239;) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>(2 <em>id. </em>279 ;) <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>(18 <em>id. </em>631.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-5\">\n<em>W. McCall, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOb\">insisted that the plaintiffs might declare at any time after general notice of retainer, which, by the 26th rule of this court, amounted to an appearance. He further contended, that the irregularity, if such it was, was waived by the admission of service.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>By the Court,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"Amt\">Cowen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0O\">The admission of service goes only to the mode; and ought not to avail as a waiver of irregularity in the time of declaring.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">But the answer derived from the notice of retainer is conclusive. Such a notice has, by rule 26, the effect of an appearance the same as if the defendant had actually entered an appearance with the clerk. This may be done as well before, as after the return day of the writ</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
