Plaintiffs United Property Owners Association of Belmar, an association of approximately eighty property owners in Belmar, and three of its constituent members Nicholas Zampet-ti, Laura Gifford and John Roland (collectively plaintiffs), brought an action against the Borough of Belmar, Kenneth Pringle, Mayor of Belmar, and Jack Manutti, Patricia Provenzano, Andrew Gallagher and Doug McGill, all members of the Borough Council (collectively \u201cdefendants\u201d or \u201cBelmar\u201d) seeking to invalidate the Belmar Ordinance 1999-16 (the Ordinance). After an extended trial, the judge voided certain sections of the Ordinance and upheld others. Plaintiffs appeal, and defendants cross-appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Plaintiffs contend on appeal that the judge erred in failing to invalidate the Ordinance provisions that: (1) limit occupancy for summer rentals only; (2) impose more restrictive fire regulations than required; (3) impose liability for occupancy violations on all tenants; (4) increase licensing fees; (5) prohibit exceeding the occupancy rate at night; and (6) restrict noise. Plaintiffs also claim selective enforcement; assert that the Ordinance constituted a taking or inverse condemnation; object to the judge\u2019s failure to invalidate the entire Ordinance instead of selected provisions; and contend that their attorneys\u2019 fee, awarded under the Federal Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3601-3631 (the Act) was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Defendants on their cross-appeal contend that the judge erred in invalidating those sections of the Ordinance that: (1) require that when a unit is rented to a family with a school-aged child over the winter, the summer rental cannot begin until the end of the spring term of the school year; (2) compel the submission of information regarding tenants on applications for certification; (3) prohibit temporary certifications; (4) proscribe the use of flammable materials as partitions; and (5) prohibit commercial signs and strings of lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The trial judge, in a well-reasoned and thoughtful written opinion, upheld the validity of the Ordinance, including a prohibition on the presence of the number of occupants during certain hours, but determined that certain provisions were invalid. We conclude that the trial judge correctly determined the Ordinance was constitutional, was not selectively enforced, properly imposed liability on all tenants for occupancy violations, did not constitute a taking, did not impose punitive fees, and did violate the Act. We further conclude that the judge\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the Act was not inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">We determine, however, that the judge erred in declaring certain provisions of the Ordinance invalid, including the portions of the Ordinance that prohibit: (1) temporary certificates of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>, inspection for summer rentals; (2) the use of flammable materials as partitions; and (3) commercial signs and strings of lights on summer rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">A companion appeal (A-40-00T5) filed on behalf of plaintiffs Nicholas M. Zampetti, Jr. and Mariann Zampetti (Zampettis) against defendant Borough of Belmar challenges the imposition of a bond on landlords for multiple convictions of tenants for disorderly conduct, as well as the factual determination as to the necessity of a bond (the Zampetti appeal). Since we address the issue of a bond in the context of plaintiffs\u2019 omnibus challenge to the validity of the Ordinance, we consolidate the appeals for purposes of this opinion and determine the Zampetti appeal here as well. We conclude that the bond requirement is valid and affirm the judgment upholding the validity of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The genesis of the Ordinance is set forth in the legislative findings incorporated in the Ordinance. According to these findings, Belmar is a one-square-mile resort community with a year-round population of approximately 6,000 residents, which experiences an enormous influx of visitors each summer, many of whom seek to rent temporary accommodations while continuing to maintain a permanent residence elsewhere. As of the summer of 1998, Belmar had approximately 550 of such rental units that met the definition set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:52-1(n).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The legislative findings continue that, because of a great demand for seasonal rentals, they are frequently overcrowded, resulting in unsafe conditions including occupants sleeping in basements, blocking of doors as well as intentionally disabled smoke alarms, construction of partitions made of flammable materials, and \u201cstockpil[ing of] garbage in basements and closets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The findings conclude that \u201c[sjeasonal rental accommodations in Belmar are also frequently detrimental to the health, safety, welfare and quality of life of other nearby residents and visitors.\u201d Problems include \u201cexcessive noise, unruly behavior, obscene language, fighting, littering, parking of vehicles on lawns, public urination, poor maintenance of the property and grounds, and violation of trash collection ordinances.\u201d Belmar Ordinance 1999-16, \u00a7 26-7.1E.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">After extolling the progress of Belmar in recent year's, Mayor Pringle announced the proposed Ordinance in September 1998, commenting that \u201c[t]he only dark cloud on Belmar\u2019s horizon is our 560 summer rentals\u201d which have a negative \u201cimpact on our property values, our taxes, our school system and our quality of life.\u201d Much of Pringle\u2019s commentary was based on anecdotal information, but clearly the issue of summer rentals had been the topic <em>of </em>debate and notice <em>for </em>years in the Belmar community. He acknowledged the general problem of unruly behavior, obscene language, public urination and ongoing chronic problems of tenants living with beds on floors, in basements, in makeshift lofts, and \u201cmattresses spread from one end of the room to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Pringle\u2019s observations and perceptions were supported by substantive information including data presented by the zoning officer describing nine people sleeping in a seventy square foot room in three layers of stacked plywood, fourteen people living in a house with an occupancy limit of four, and a general conclusion that eight out of every ten summer rentals were overcrowded. Others described cars parked on lawns, people sleeping in cars, bottles and other debris littering rental properties and people \u201ctotally out of control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Plaintiffs challenged these observations claiming that the Borough was \u201cheavy-handed\u201d and trying to \u201cbeat the property owners\u201d out of the summer rental business. Plaintiffs also claimed that year-round rentals received more favorable treatment than summer rentals, and asserted \u201cselective enforcement\u201d of relevant codes and ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Law Division challenging then Belmar Ordinance 1998-16 (Sept. 9, 1998), as being so pervasively restrictive that it denied plaintiffs the right to use their properties as seasonal rentals. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint included allegations that: (1) different regulations applicable to short-term and long-term rentals violated equal protection; (2) the fees imposed were excessive; and (3) regulation based on occupancy of school-aged children violated the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Following the issuance of injunctive relief enjoining enforcement of that ordinance pending final disposition and, in response to this litigation, Belmar promulgated the Ordinance which amended Ordinance 1998-16 and which is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">In considering the positions of the parties, certain bedrock principles of appellate review apply. The trial judge\u2019s findings of fact \u201care considered binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence.\u201d <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). However, \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty v. Township Committee of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">With these considerations in mind, we now address plaintiffs\u2019 specific claims. Plaintiffs contend that the judge erred in failing to find that the occupancy limitation of Ordinance section 26-7.4 discriminates against summer rentals in violation of the equal protection guarantees of the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. Plaintiffs object to defendants\u2019 application of the occupancy restriction to summer rentals only and assert that the occupancy restriction has no rational relation to the Borough\u2019s problems, because defendants failed to prove that overcrowding or other problems emanate from summer rentals. Plaintiffs also argue that defendants incorrectly calculated occupancy by allowing only bedrooms to be used for sleeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Defendants counter that their method of calculation was correct, that they applied the occupancy restriction to all properties, and that the Ordinance was rationally related to protecting the welfare of summer tenants and the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Ordinance section 26-7.4(a) provides: \u201cEach Summer Rental License shall state thereon the maximum permitted occupancy of the dwelling unit as calculated by the Code Official pursuant to and in accordance with PM-405.\u201d PM-405 refers to <em>The BOCA (Building Officials &amp; Code Administrators International, Inc.) National Property Maintenance Code </em>(4th ed. 1993) (BOCA Code). The BOCA Code sets forth the minimum area required for a dwelling unit\u2019s living room, dining room, and kitchen, depending on the number of occupants. PM-405.5. The BOCA Code also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">PM-405.3 Area for sleeping purposes: Every room occupied for sleeping purposes by one <em>occupant </em>shall contain at least 70 square feet (70 m2) of floor area, and every room occupied for sleeping purposes by more than one <em>person </em>shall contain at least 50 square feet (50 m2) of floor area for each <em>occupant </em>thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">PM 405.7 Prohibited occupancy: Kitchens, nonhabitable spaces and interior public areas shall not be occupied for sleeping purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Both the zoning officer and the fire official interpreted the phrase \u201cinterior public areas\u201d in PM-^05.7, as including living rooms. The judge noted but did not address plaintiffs\u2019 argument that defendants \u201cmisinterpreted the BOCA Code by determining the \u2018maximum occupancy\u2019 strictly by measuring bedrooms.\u201d The judge determined only that Ordinance section 26-7.4(a) was consistent with the BOCA Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Plaintiffs contend that defendants\u2019 calculation of occupancy by using solely bedroom space \u201cgives short shrift to the rest of the dwelling and unjustifiably limits the number of occupants at the unit.\u201d Plaintiffs argue that the reference in PM-405.3 to rooms \u201coccupied for sleeping purposes,\u201d rather than bedrooms, implies that non-bedrooms could be used for sleeping purposes. They point out that the BOCA Code defines \u201chabitable space\u201d as \u201c[sjpace in a structure for living, sleeping, eating or cooking,\u201d PM-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>402.1, and they conclude that living rooms may be used for sleeping provided they meet the square footage requirements of PM-405.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation that all \u201chabitable space\u201d except kitchens could be used for sleeping. Such an expansive view would render the prohibition against using interior public areas for sleeping, set forth in PM-405.7, meaningless. While plaintiffs contest defendants\u2019 interpretation, they fail to offer any other reasonable meaning of \u201cinterior public areas,\u201d or to cite any authority for their interpretation of PM-405. We cannot accept plaintiffs\u2019 crabbed view of \u201coccupied for sleeping purposes\u201d other than the well-understood common parlance of \u201cbedrooms.\u201d We conclude, as did the trial judge, that defendants\u2019 interpretation that \u201cinterior public areas\u201d includes living rooms is reasonable and consistent with a logical reading of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Plaintiffs further claim that defendants apply PM-405 to determine occupancy for summer rentals, but not for year-round housing, in violation of plaintiffs\u2019 right to equal protection. According to plaintiffs, it is not disputed that the \u201cOrdinance is aimed at curbing the summer rental market.\u201d Plaintiffs cite the legislative findings sections of the Ordinance, 26-7.1, -11.1, which specifically address summer rentals. Plaintiffs suggests that PM-405 should apply to all properties. They note that PM-401.1, \u201cScope,\u201d provides that chapter four \u201cshall govern the minimum conditions and standards for ... space for the <em>occupancy </em>of a structure\u201d; there is no limitation to structures that are rented seasonally.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The Ordinance, however, does require the application of PM-405 to all buildings. It imposes a penalty for any violation of the BOCA Code, Ordinance \u00a7 26-2.8a, and establishes a fine for occupancy violations under PM-405, without any limitation to summer rentals, Ordinance \u00a7 26-2.8b. Despite its legislative findings targeting summer rentals, the occupancy provision of the Ordinance on its face is universal and does not discriminate against summer rentals. In fact, the zoning officer observed that he applied the BOCA Code to all properties, not just summer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>rentals. He said: \u201cI cover the whole Property Maintenance Code with respect to all the properties in Belmar\u201d including all rentals, summer, winter and year-round. On the other hand, Pringle conceded that occupancy standards were not imposed on full-time properties, explaining that \u201cwe have our biggest problems\u201d with summer rentals. Despite this apparent factual variance, even if defendants applied the BOCA Code occupancy standards only or primarily to summer rentals, we find no violation of plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection rights, and our consideration of both the Federal and State Constitutions supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The Fourteenth Amendment provides: \u201cNo State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. An economic regulation such as the Ordinance, which \u201cdoes not affect a suspect or semi-suspect class and does not attempt to regulate a fundamental right, ... need [only be] rationally related to a legitimate state interest to satisfy federal equal protection requirements.\u201d <em>Brown v. City of Newark, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>565, 573, 552 A.2d 125 (1989). An economic regulation must not be \u201carbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 552 A.2d 125. Plaintiffs concede that the rational basis standard applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The New Jersey Constitution does not use the term \u201cequal protection,\u201d but states: \u201cAll persons are by nature free and independent, and have certain natural and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\u201d <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u201cThe analysis of fundamental rights under the New Jersey Constitution differs from analysis of those rights under the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Greenberg v. Kimmelman, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>552, 567, 494 A.2d 294 (1985). Our analysis of this issue requires application of a balancing test, considering \u201cthe nature of the affected right, the extent to which the governmental restriction intrudes upon it, and the public need for the restriction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIn striking the balance ____ the more personal the right, the greater the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>public need must be to justify governmental interference with the exercise of that right.\u201d <em>George Harms Constr. Co. v. New Jersey Tpk. Autk, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>8, 29, 644 A.2d 76 (1994). In addition, the factors to be balanced are \u201cimplicit, if not explicit, in federal analysis of the due process and equal protection clauses.\u201d <em>Greenberg, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 567, 494 A.2d 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">An ordinance is entitled to a presumption of validity. <em>Dome Realty, Inc. v. City of Paterson, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>212, 235, 416 A.2d 334 (1980). In <em>Dome Realty, </em>the Court held that the exemption of owner-occupied, two-family homes from the requirements of an ordinance establishing standards of habitability did not violate federal equal protection. <em>Id. </em>at 243, 416 A.2d 334. The Court found a rational basis in the exemption because \u201c[ljandlords who live in their buildings have greater incentive to maintain them.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The city thus acted both rationally and efficiently in conserving \u201cits enforcement resources for larger buildings with absentee landlords.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">We conclude that directing enforcement of occupancy standards toward summer rentals, if that occurred, is rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of abating the overcrowding and resulting unacceptable conduct and conditions that occur in summer rentals. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, the judge\u2019s finding, and the underpinning of his equal protection analysis that these problems emanated from summer rentals, was supported by ample credible evidence. <em>Rova Farms, supra, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>at 484, 323 A.2d 495. The judge quoted the legislative findings of the Ordinance, cited the supporting testimony of the Mayor and Council members, and concluded that their testimony \u201cwas believable and generally supported the Borough\u2019s reasoning behind the Ordinance. The inescapable conclusion based on the testimony is that some summer renters create a significant problem for the law-abiding citizens of Belmar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">There was considerable persuasive evidence to support the finding that overcrowding, unsafe conditions, noise and unruly behavior in Belmar emanated from summer rentals. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>anecdotal, Pringle personally heard noise and observed rowdy behavior at summer rentals, and reported complaints about summer tenants using obscene language and urinating in public. Council members corroborated reports of drinking, noise, and bad behavior among summer renters. Borough officials reported overcrowding in summer rentals and the resulting unsafe conditions, both from personal observations and from complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Plaintiffs point to the absence of empirical data to support the conclusion that summer rentals caused Belmar\u2019s problems. However, formal studies conducted by experts are not required. \u201cLegislative bodies are presumed to act on the basis of adequate factual support and, absent a sufficient showing to the contrary, it will be assumed that their enactments rest upon some rational basis within their knowledge and experience.\u201d <em>Hutton Park Gardens v. Town Council of West Orange, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>543, 564-65, 350 A.2d 1 (1975) (upholding a rent control ordinance) (quoted in <em>Dome Realty, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 235, 416 A.2d 334). More recently, we explained: \u201cA municipality\u2019s legislative exercise is not to be set aside if any basis may reasonably be conceived to justify the ordinance.\u201d <em>Mannie\u2019s Cigarette Serv., Inc. v. Town of West New York, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 347-48, 613 A.2d 494 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Witnesses who observed overcrowding and unacceptable behavior at summer rentals, and who, in their capacity as municipal officials, received complaints from residents, provided an adequate basis for the judge\u2019s factual finding. Their observations constituted a rational basis, within defendants\u2019 knowledge and experience, to justify the Ordinance. Editorial comments noted by plaintiffs regarding a distaste for summer rentals are irrelevant to our analysis and will not invalidate an otherwise valid ordinance. Conversely, demonizing the proponents of the legislative action as \u201cevil\u201d is not persuasive in a facial attack on the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Finally, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that a small number of occupancy violation summonses issued in the summers of 1997 and 1998 proved that overcrowding did not exist. Pringle explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the problem with chrome overcrowding in Belmar, isn\u2019t how many summonses we give out. The problem is you don\u2019t get to give summonses out____I\u2019m not looking to give out more summonses for overcrowding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">But the number of summonses that we\u2019re giving out is a small percentage of the number of problems we have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">As the trial judge aptly noted, the Court in <em>Kirsch Holding Co. v. Borough of Manasquan, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>241, 281 A.2d 513 (1971), in invalidating zoning ordinances in the Boroughs of Belmar and Manasquan which prohibited group rentals, acknowledged the same problems in Belmar that the Ordinance here addresses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"al-dedup-0\">The evil which the ordinance provisions in question seek to prevent relates to the uninhibited social conduct of many such group rental occupants within and without the buildings. Unquestionably, and regrettably, excessive noise at all hours, wild parties, intoxication, acts of immorality, lewd and lascivious conduct and traffic and parking congestion often accompany these group rentals____ In essence, they constitute a public and private nuisance by not meeting the minimal standards of expected social conduct even in this rather permissive day and age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">[Id. at 245, 281 A.2d 513.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">To address overcrowding and its resulting problems, the Court suggested \u201chousing code provisions, which would have to be of general application, limiting the number of occupants in reasonable relation to available sleeping and bathroom facilities or requiring a minimum amount of habitable floor area per occupant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254, 281 A.2d 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">Our Supreme Court has subsequently approved municipalities\u2019 addressing overcrowding in this way, rather than by indirect means. <em>Borough of Glassboro v. Vallorosi, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>421, 428, 432-33, 568 A.2d 888 (1990) (noting that college students sharing a home qualified as a family unit under municipal ordinance); <em>State v. Baker, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>99, 110, 114, 405 A.2d 368 (1979) (observing that municipality may not condition residence on the number of unrelated persons living together).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">In <em>Sente v. Mayor of City of Clifton, </em>123 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 302 A.2d 536 (App.Div.1973), <em>vacated as moot, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>204, 209, 330 A.2d 321 (1974), we upheld an ordinance establishing minimum floor space requirements for housing, commenting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-15\">[H]ousing space limitations present fundamental policy decisions for determination by municipal governing units. Health regulations are of the utmost consequence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the general welfare, and if they are reasonable, impartial and not against the general policy of the State, they must be submitted to by individuals for the good of the public, irrespective of pecuniary loss. The record, as well as common sense, affirms the existence of a correlation between minimum dwelling space requirements and health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\"><em>|Id. </em>at 279, 302 A.2d 536 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">This is what defendants have done here. The Ordinance limits the number of occupants in relation to the available sleeping facilities and the amount of floor space, in accordance with the BOCA Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Defendants demonstrated that overcrowding and its accompanying problems occur predominantly in summer rentals. Directing enforcement of the Ordinance\u2019s occupancy restrictions toward summer rentals is rationally related to the legitimate public interest of abating these problems sufficient to withstand a federal constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Applying the balancing test analyses under Article I, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, the affected right is that of property owners to maximize their profits by renting to more tenants for the summer. The Ordinance intrudes upon this right by impacting upon the owners\u2019 profits. The counterbalance is the strong public need to alleviate summer overcrowding and its resulting conditions, which are unsafe to inhabitants and \u201cdetrimental to the health, safety, welfare and quality of life of other nearby residents and visitors.\u201d Ordinance section 26-7.1E. Plaintiffs\u2019 asserted right is economic, not personal; however, the public need is substantial. We find no constitutional basis for setting aside the occupancy limitation provisions of the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">Plaintiffs next assert that the judge erred in failing to void portions of the Ordinance\u2019s fire restrictions, which are more stringent for summer rentals than for other properties; they argue that these provisions violate equal protection principles and contradict the Uniform Fire Code, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:70 (UFC). Defendants counter that the fire safety regulations of the Ordinance are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>reasonably related to the protection of summer residences and the entire community, and are not preempted by state regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The provision in issue, Ordinance section 26-7.6, \u201cFire Prevention Regulations Applicable to Summer Rental Licensed Premises\u201d: (a) prohibits locks on bedroom doors designed to be locked from outside the room; (b) requires smoke detectors to be in working order at all times; and (c) prohibits \u201cbeds, mattresses, futons or sleeping bags\u201d in any location other than a bedroom, and prohibits the use of \u201ccurtains, sheets, cardboard or any other material of any kind\u201d as \u201ctemporary partitions between beds or sleeping areas.\u201d Ordinance \u00a7 26-7.6a-e.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Subsection d sets forth several requirements for summer rentals with a permitted occupancy of eight or more persons, including: (1) an approved smoke detection system; (2) a fire escape, in addition to another means of egress, for structures with bedrooms on a third floor or higher; (3) self-closing doors that open into passageways \u201cat grade or exit stair\u201d; and (4) corridor doors that are at least one and three-eighths inches solid-core wood or an approved equivalent. Ordinance \u00a7 26-7.6d.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The judge determined that the UFC did not preempt more restrictive requirements. Applying the rational basis test for equal protection, because the provisions in question did not target any fundamental right or suspect class, the judge held that they were \u201cpresumably valid.\u201d However, the judge ruled that subsection c was \u201ctoo broad.\u201d He reasoned that sleeping should be allowed in an area that was not a bedroom, so long as the area was habitable and satisfied the other BOCA requirements. Plaintiffs do not contest this aspect of the judge\u2019s ruling, but defendants object to the invalidation of the second sentence of subsection c, prohibiting the use of flammable materials as partitions, which the judge did not address.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>One of the provisions which plaintiffs contend that the judge ignored is the Uniform Fire Safety Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-213a (UFSA). It provides: \u201cThis act shall not be construed as authorizing the adoption of ... an ordinance requiring that a building conforming in all respects to the requirements of the \u2018State Uniform Construction Code Act\u2019 <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-119 to -140] be made to conform to more restrictive requirements.\u201d Plaintiffs complain that Ordinance section 26-7.6d violates this provision by requiring new smoke detection systems, when the old systems met the requirements of the Uniform Construction Code and UFC applicable when they were installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The Ordinance requires smoke detectors to comply with NFPA (National Fire Protection Association Code) section 70-93. Ordinance \u00a7 26-7.6d.1. The Uniform Construction Code, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:23-1.1 to 5.23-12A.6, adopts Chapter 9, \u201cFire Protection Systems,\u201d of the <em>BOCA National Building Code </em>(13th ed.1996), as part of its fire protection subcode. The <em>BOCA National Building Code </em>section 920.1 requires smoke detectors to be installed in accordance with NFPA section 72. The UFC, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:70-4.19(c), provides that smoke detectors \u201cshall be listed in accordance with ANSI/UL 217, incorporated herein by reference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the requirement set forth in the Ordinance is more restrictive than the requirement set forth in either the <em>BOCA National Building Code </em>or the UFC. Nor have they shown that any smoke detector in any summer rental conformed to any regulation in effect when it was installed. Moreover, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the judge correctly observed that an ordinance may impose more stringent fire safety standards than the UFC. The UFSA provides: \u201cNothing in this act shall preclude the right of any municipality to adopt an ordinance dealing with fire safety whether or not it is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>restrictive than this act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-202b.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The UFC allows local governments to regulate the repair, use and maintenance of buildings. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:70-1.4(c). This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">When any provision of this Code is found to be in conflict with any zoning, safety, health or other applicable ... ordinance ... of the jurisdiction existing on the effective date of this Code or hereafter adopted, the provision which establishes the higher standard for the promotion and protection of the safety and welfare of the public shall prevail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">[/A]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Plaintiffs claim that the fire-safety standard contained in the Ordinance is invalid because it is more stringent than a standard set forth in the UFC is not only erroneous, it conflicts with the plain language of the administrative code.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">' The fire protections set forth in Ordinance section 26-7.6 do not violate equal protection because they are rationally related to the legitimate government interest of containing the fire hazard caused by summer overcrowding. <em>See Brown, supra, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>at 573, 552 A.2d 125. Plaintiffs complain about the expense resulting from these more stringent fire regulations, but the financial impingement on them pales in comparison to the need for public fire safety. <em>See Greenberg, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 567, 494 A.2d 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">Plaintiffs focus on other seemingly unrelated conduct by defendants to support their fire protection claim. Arguing that such \u2022action constitutes discrimination, plaintiffs contend that \u201cBelmar prepared a flier to send out to former renters to weed out \u2018undesirables.\u2019 \u201d The flier stated: \u201cWelcome to Belmar ... WARNING! SUMMER RENTAL OCCUPANCY LIMITS STRICTLY ENFORCED.\u201d It admonished renters to learn the occupancy limit of their units, advised that it was unlawful to exceed the limit between 1:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., and warned that fines would be imposed for violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">Plaintiffs apparently view this alleged discrimination against summer rentals as another violation of equal protection, support<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ing their theory that the imposition of stricter fire regulations was discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">While alluding to instances of decreased interest in summer rentals by those reading the flier, plaintiffs failed to provide any evidential basis-for an inference that the purpose of the flier was to discourage \u201cundesirables.\u201d Making prospective tenants aware of new regulations is not unconstitutional; moreover, there is no constitutional prohibition against controlling dangerous conditions, such as overcrowding, and unruly behavior, such as drinking, cursing and urinating in public. \u201cUndesirables\u201d who create these conditions and indulge in this behavior are not a protected class. The imposition of more stringent fire restrictions on summer rentals did not violate either equal protection principles or the UFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">We likewise easily dispose of plaintiffs\u2019 next contention that the judge erred in rejecting their claim of selective enforcement of the Ordinance, again allegedly in violation of plaintiffs\u2019 right to equal protection. They essentially claim that summer landlords were subject to arbitrary enforcement inconsistent with the enforcement of such ordinances as applied to year-round properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Two elements must be established to succeed on a claim of unconstitutional enforcement of an ordinance \u2014 \u201ca discriminatory effect and a motivating discriminatory purpose.\u201d <em>Township of Pennsauken v. Schad, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>156, 183, 733 A.2d 1159 (1999); <em>State v. Di Frisco, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>253, 266, 571 A.2d 914 (1990). As the Court observed in <em>Schad:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">In order to establish unconstitutional enforco,ment of the ordinance, defendant must show both a discriminatory effect and a motivating discriminatory purpose. <em>[Wayte v. United States, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>598, 608, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1524, 1531, 84 L.Ed.2d 547, 556 (1985).] The conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not a constitutional violation unless the decision to prosecute is based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-11\"><em>[Schad, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 183, 733 A.2d 1159 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The judge found that \u201cBelmar\u2019s officials\u201d were not \u201cevil men and women bent on eliminating summer rentals through any means____They were decent people trying to deal with a problem that has historically plagued Belmar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The judge agreed with plaintiffs that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">violations of ordinances by non-summer rental properties ... have not been as vigorously enforced. However, the building department in Belmar is certainly not over staffed and then- priority has been directed toward the px-oblems ci\u2019eated from May to September. Perhaps, the Belmar officials could have acted more evenhanded in dealing with other municipal px-oblems, but the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that Belmar used an \u201cunjustifiable standard\u201d in enfoi'cing vax-ious Ordinance provisions against summer renters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">The basis for the inconsistent enforcement \u2014 summer rentals as opposed to year-round residents \u2014 was justified. As the judge found, summer rentals caused overcrowding and resulting hazards. Directing enforcement of the Ordinance \u201ctoward the problems created from May to September\u201d was not an arbitrary or unjustifiable standard; it was reasonably related to the legitimate government objective of abating the unsafe and undesirable conditions caused by overcrowding.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">We find no merit in plaintiffs\u2019 claims that Belmar\u2019s officials demonstrated favoritism or arbitrariness. The anecdotal references to enforcement regarding certain properties falls far short of establishing a pattern of discrimination. The plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to establish selective enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">\n<em>V.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Ordinance is unconstitutional on substantive due process grounds. Plaintiffs contend that the judge erred in refusing to invalidate Ordinance section 26-2.8, which imposes liability for occupancy violations on all tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">Ordinance section 26-2.8b provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-15\">All tenants of a dwelling unit at the time the occupancy thereof unlawfully exceeds the maximum permitted occupancy thex-eof as calculated by the Code Official pursuant to Section PM-405.0 Occupancy Limitations shall be issued a summons which carries a minimum fine of two hundred and sixty-five ($265.00) dollax\u2019s, plus court costs, payable through the Violations Bux-eau of the Municipal Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The judge, relying on <em>State v. Kiejdan, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 437 A.2d 324 (App.Div.1981), determined that Ordinance section 26-2.8 was constitutional because \u201cstrict liability is a permissible tool for a municipal ordinance that is attempting to deal with a serious health and safety problem.\u201d He explained that the strict liability provision \u201cwas appropriate due to the well documented problems associated with overcrowding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In <em>Kiejdan, </em>a landlord was convicted of failing to provide heat to tenants despite his claim that the heating system had been repeatedly vandalized. We held that strict liability was \u201can unexceptionable and appropriate legislative option where employed to implement a regulatory scheme designed to deal with a serious social problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 437 A.2d 324. We considered the landlord\u2019s obligation to furnish heat as \u201ca regulatory scheme intended to protect and advance the public health and safety,\u201d and the imposition of strict liability as \u201ca necessary tool for the effectuation of its public purpose.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We rejected defendant\u2019s claim that strict liability violated his right to substantive due process, noting that he could have, but failed to take action to prevent a recurrence of vandalism. <em>Id. </em>at 260, 437 A.2d 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Plaintiffs distinguish <em>Kiejdan, </em>suggesting that \u201cit was well established in [Kiejdan] that the failure to provide heat posed a threat to the health and safety of the tenants,\u201d whereas \u201c[i]n the instant case no serious social problem exists.\u201d As did the trial judge, we disagree. The record clearly supported a finding of overcrowding and the problems attendant to such condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Generally, unless fundamental rights are involved, \u201ca state statute does not violate substantive due process if the statute reasonably relates to a legitimate legislative purpose and is not arbitrary or discriminatory.\u201d <em>Greenberg, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 494 A.2d 294. Interpreting substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, our Supreme Court set forth a more stringent standard: \u201csubstantive due process is reserved for the most egregious governmental abuses against liberty or property rights.\u201d <em>Rivkin v. Dover Township Rent Leveling Bd., </em>143 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>352, 366, 368, 671 A.2d 567, <em>cert. denied, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>911, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>275, 136 L.Ed.2d 198 (1996) (noting that bias of member of rent leveling board did not result in violation of substantive due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We do not perceive that holding tenants liable for occupancy violations is an egregious abuse against liberty or property rights. Imposing liability on all tenants for occupancy violations is not arbitrary or discriminatory and advances the legitimate purpose of alleviating overcrowding and its resulting problems. The realities of the tenancies must be recognized. The complaints fostering the promulgation of the challenged Ordinance are premised on summer congregants sharing the common benefits of the rental; imposing liability for the misdeeds of fellow tenants is an acceptable burden to be assumed by all.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that Ordinance section 26-2.8 interferes with their \u201cfundamental right of privacy,\u201d the Ordinance carefully protects the privacy of occupants and owners. Critical procedural safeguards are in place. The Ordinance requires the code official to attempt to locate the owner or person in control of the building to request entry. Ordinance \u00a7 26-2.1a. If the request is denied, the code official must obtain a search warrant. Ordinance \u00a7 26-2.1a, c. No municipal official may enter a dwelling to determine whether an occupancy violation has occurred without first obtaining the permission of the occupant. Ordinance \u00a7 26-2. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">In <em>State v. Maldonado, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>536, 645 A.2d 1165 (1994), upholding the imposition of strict criminal liability on manufacturers and distributors of controlled dangerous substances when death results from their ingestion, the Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">Absolute liability for regulatory offenses traditionally finds justification in administrative convenience, the need to deter through the most effective forms of prosecution, dispensing with proof of intent, and imposing relatively minor punishment, all adding up to a conclusion that whatever injustice results from strict liability is more than counterbalanced by benefit to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 550, 645 A.2d 1165.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Here, the need to deter overcrowding is substantial, and the punishment, a fine of at least $265 plus costs, is relatively minor. The benefit to the public in abating the hazardous and undesirable results of overcrowding outweighs any injustice resulting from strict liability. The judge was correct in determining that strict liability imposed on all tenants for violation of occupancy restrictions did not violate plaintiffs\u2019 (or tenants\u2019) right to substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>VI.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In their broad challenge to the Ordinance, plaintiffs assert that the Ordinance so severely restricted their use of and ability to rent their properties that its enforcement constituted a taking of private property for public use, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Article I, Paragraph 20 of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Both the United States and New Jersey Constitutions prohibit the taking of private property \u201cfor public use, without just compensation.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend.

In <em>Gardner, </em>the Court upheld a portion of the Pineland Commission\u2019s Comprehensive Management Plan which restricted residential development to forty-acre lots, thirty-nine of which had to be permanently dedicated to agricultural use. <em>Id. </em>at 204-10, 593 A.2d 251. The Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">takings analysis makes two fundamental demands of any zoning scheme: it must substantially advance legitimate state interests, and it cannot deny an owner all economically viable use of the land____ The economic effect of the regulatory scheme can be assessed in terms of the adjustment of economic benefits and burdens or the extent of interference with \u201cdistinct investment-backed expectations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 205, 593 A.2d 251 (citation omitted) <em>(quoting Penn Cent.

Assocs. v. Borough of Edgewater, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>267, 271-72, 493 A.2d 11 (App.Div. 1985), <em>aff'd, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>227, 510 A.2d 1178 (1986) (holding that the protections afforded to tenants upon conversion from apartments to condominiums under the Senior Citizens and Disabled Protected Tenancy Act were not an unconstitutional taking since they advanced compelling public policies and represented a valid exercise of police power).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Plaintiffs claims here are multifaceted. They first assert that the application and inspection requirements of the Ordinance prevent them from renting their properties for an entire year. The Ordinance prohibits the code official from inspecting \u201cany dwelling unit for purposes of issuing a Summer Rental License during a period it is occupied by another tenant, regardless of whether the tenant is present at the time of the inspection.\u201d Ordinance \u00a7 26-3.9c. There is an exception for units occupied by families with school-aged children in the winter (summer rentals at these units may not begin until three days after the last school day). Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 26-3.9c, -7.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">This restriction does not prevent plaintiffs from renting their properties for the entire year. It has no impact on year-round rentals. If a landlord chooses seasonal rentals, this provision imposes only a short period of unrented time between the summer and winter leases. Inspections must occur within five business days if the summer rental license application is filed before May 1, or within ten business days if the application is filed after May 1. Ordinance \u00a7 26-3.9a.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In <em>Dome Realty, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>212, 416 A.2d 334, the Court rejected the argument that requiring that a unit be vacant when it was inspected was arbitrary and unreasonable, and that it prevented landlords from earning fair profits. <em>Id. </em>at 235-37, 416 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>334. The Court accepted the testimony of housing inspectors that inspections of vacant dwellings were more effective and noted that this scheme encouraged landlords to make apartments available for inspection and to remedy defects. In addition, if violations were uncovered, there would be no need to evict tenants. These considerations also apply to housing in Belmar.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 generalized claims that the Ordinance reduces the privacy of short term tenancies; that it limits plaintiffs\u2019 abilities to expand their properties; or that the fire or occupancy restrictions so impair the profitability of the rental units as to amount to a taking. These claims are not supported by the record; in fact, the record suggests that the summer rental market has not abated. Little credible evidence was presented that suggested a reduction in profits. Proofs suggesting \u201crent concessions,\u201d standing alone, fail to satisfy plaintiffs\u2019 burden to establish a taking. <em>Gardner, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 210, 593 A.2d 251. Although plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cinvestment-backed expectations\u201d are a relevant consideration in determining economic impact, <em>Penn Cent., supra, </em>438 <em>U.S. </em>at 124, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2659, 57 L.Ed.2d at 648; <em>Gardner, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 205, 593 A.2d 251, such proofs, woefully deficient here, must be considered in the context of whether a property owner is deprived of all or substantially all of the beneficial use of the totality of his property. <em>See Karam v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>225, 234-35, 705 A.2d 1221 (App.Div.1998), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>187, 723 A.2d 943, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>814, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>51, 145 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>45 (1999) (holding that the denial of a permit to build a dock on riverfront property, because it would interfere with a shellfish habitat, did not constitute a taking. Destruction of the owner\u2019s investment-backed expectations is a factor to be considered, together with whether the regulation deprived the owner of \u2018Virtually all economically viable uses of the property\u201d and whether the interest that was taken was vested with the owner).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Certain facts are inviolate. Plaintiffs retain a viable economic use of their property. The Legislature has acted to regulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>summer shore rentals, authorizing municipalities to license and supervise them, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:52-1(n), and to hold landlords responsible for tenants\u2019 disorderly behavior, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12n-r. The Ordinance promotes public health and safety by abating overcrowding and fire hazards. Plaintiffs have failed to establish that the Ordinance deprived them of all economically viable use of their property. There was no taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\n<em>VII.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">We now focus our attention on plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the judge incorrectly upheld Ordinance section 26-7.4, prohibiting the presence of more than the permitted number of occupants in a summer rental at certain hours, on the ground that it did not constitute a curfew. Plaintiffs assert that the Ordinance restrictions are \u201can infringement on one\u2019s right to privacy, due process and equal protection,\u201d as well as overbroad. Defendants contend that the Ordinance does not constitute a curfew because it does not compel people to remove themselves from the streets at an appointed time. We agree that the Ordinance does not create a curfew but disagree with the judge\u2019s conclusion as to the effect of the Ordinance on occupancy. We reverse this determination and invalidate this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Ordinance section 26-7.4b provides: \u201cIt shall be unlawful at any time between the hours of 1:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. for the number of adults in a Summer Rental Licensed dwelling unit to exceed the maximum permitted occupancy as calculated by the Code Official.\u201d We agree with both the judge and defendants that Ordinance section 26-7.4b does not constitute a curfew because it does not prohibit anyone from appearing in public or on \u201cthe streets\u201d after a specified hour. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>344 (5th ed.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">We disagree, however, with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the Ordinance improperly enforces occupancy limits. Ordinance section 26-7.4b does not pertain to occupancy per se. It prohibits the <em>presence </em>of adult occupants and non-occupants alike in a summer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>rental when the number of people exceeds the permitted occupancy. This does not serve to keep or insure the occupancy level at the permitted number.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Ordinance contains no definition of occupancy or occupant, but the common meaning of occupant is a person who resides in a dwelling. The number of residents or occupants remains the same regardless of how many people are present in the dwelling at any particular time. The effect of this Ordinance provision is to either exclude guests when all occupants are present or exclude occupants so that guests may be present, during the specified hours. We conclude that Ordinance section 26-7.4b interferes with summer residents\u2019 right to have visitors in their homes, a component of their right to privacy, and that it is overbroad in accomplishing a legitimate municipal goal, in violation of summer residents\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We first observe that the right to have guests or visitors \u2014 non-occupants \u2014 present in one\u2019s home is not, in and of itself, a constitutional or fundamental right. However, as the United States Supreme Court has acknowledged, the right to privacy in one\u2019s home encompasses the right to host guests. In an unrelated context, the United States Supreme Court explored the relationship of social guests and privacy rights. In <em>Minnesota v.

The Court commented that its holding \u201cmerely recognizes the everyday expectations of privacy that we all share. Staying overnight in another\u2019s home is a longstanding social custom that serves functions recognized as valuable by society.\u201d 495 <em>U.S. </em>at 98, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1689, 109 L.Ed.2d at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">More recently, Justice Ginsburg, in dissent, emphasized that the home was \u201cthe most essential bastion of privacy recognized by the law.\u201d <em>Minnesota v.

She commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">My concern centers on an individual\u2019s choice to share her home and her associations there with persons she selects. Our decisions indicate that people have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their homes in part because they have the prerogative to exclude others. The power to exclude implies the power to include. See, e.g., ... Alschiler, <em>Interpersonal Privacy and the Fourth Amendment, </em>4 <em>N. Ill. U.L.Rev. </em>1, 13 (1983) (\u201c[0]ne of the main rights attaching to property is the right to share its shelter, its comfort and its privacy with others.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">[525 <em>U.S. </em>at 107, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 482, 142 L.Ed.2d at 391 (other citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Here, plaintiffs and their summer tenants have no complaint about any physical intrusion into, or search of their homes. Nevertheless, their right to privacy in their homes includes the choice to share it with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The right to privacy in New Jersey is expansive. It derives not only from the Search and Seizure Clause of the New Jersey Constitution, <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, \u00b6 7, and New Jersey common law, but also from the \u201cnatural and unalienable rights\u201d which all people have under Article I, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution. <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, \u00b6 1, <em>supra, </em>p. 17, 777 A.2d pp. 959-60. <em>Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle Point Oil Co., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>81, 94-99, 609 A.2d 11 (1992) (declining to decide whether a private employer\u2019s random urine testing of an employee for drugs violated the employee\u2019s right to privacy, but holding that \u201cconstitutional privacy protections may form the basis for a clear mandate of public policy supporting a wrongful-discharge claim\u201d). A summer tenants\u2019 right to share their homes with guests or visitors, even when all occupants are present, is within the panoply of their right of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">There are other legitimate complaints pertaining to the effect of this section of the Ordinance. We conclude that the Ordinance provision in issue here is overbroad. \u201c[T]he overbreadth doctrine \u2018involves substantive due process considerations concerning excessive governmental intrusion into protected areas.\u2019\u201d <em>Karins v. City of Atlantic City, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>532, 544, 706 A.2d 706 (1998) (quoting <em>In re Soto, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>303, 324, 565 A.2d 1088 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>608, 583 A.2d 310 (1990), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>496 <em>U.S. </em>937, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>3216, 110 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>664 (1990)). The Legislation must reach \u201ca substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,\u201d and \u201cthere must be a strong showing that the statute\u2019s deterrent effect on legitimate expression is real and substantial.\u201d <em>In re Soto, supra, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 324, 565 A.2d 1088. The overbreath concept \u201crests on principles of substantive due process\u201d and \u201cwhether the reach of the law extends too far. The evil of an overbroad law is that in proscribing constitutionally protected activity, it may reach farther than is permitted or necessary to fulfill the state\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Town Tobacconist v. Kimmelman, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>85, 125 n. 21, 462 A.2d 573 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Substantive due process requires that the legislation under attack have a legitimate purpose or a \u201cconceivable rational basis.\u201d <em>Greenberg, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 494 A.2d 294. However, when a fundamental right is involved, due process requires a \u201cmore exacting\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 494 A.2d 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The Court set forth this standard in cases in which the statute in question \u201cencroach[es] on First Amendment interests\u201d; whether it is overbroad</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">turns upon whether there is a compelling state interest to be served by the statute and a substantial connection between that compelling governmental interest and the statutory regulation; the compelling stale interest must clearly outweigh the \u201crepressive effect\" on expressional or associational rights engendered by the application of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\"><em>[New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce v. New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Comm'n, 82 N.J. </em>57, 70, 411 A.2d 168 (1980).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Defendants have articulated no legislative purpose for Ordinance section 26-7.4b, other than to assertedly address the general overcrowding, and resulting safety hazards and nuisances, that occur in summer rentals, as set forth in Ordinance section 26-7.1, \u201cLegislative Findings.\u201d Prohibiting the number of people allowed in a dwelling between 1:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. to exceed the occupancy rate abates overcrowding due to guests, but it does not abate the continuous or long-term overcrowded living conditions resulting from too many occupants. We acknowledge that limiting the number of people allowed in a dwelling during the specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>hours may alleviate the problems of \u201cexcessive noise, unruly behavior, obscene language, fighting, littering, parking of vehicles on lawns, public urination, poor maintenance of the property and grounds, and violation of trash collection ordinances,\u201d at least during the hours defendants chose for its application. It thus has a \u201cconceivable rational basis.\u201d <em>See Greenberg, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 494 A.2d 294. However, applying the \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d test used when the legislation encroaches upon First Amendment or fundamental rights, <em>Chamber of Commerce, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 70, 411 A.2d 168, the government interest served by Ordinance section 26-7.4b, reducing the undesirable behavior described in Ordinance section 26-7.1, and overcrowding due to guests, does not outweigh its repressive effect on privacy and associational rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">There are instances where the asserted public safety interests claimed by defendants are potentially at cross-purposes. It is a short inductive leap to envisage summer rental occupants or their guests consuming alcoholic beverages. In these circumstances, we can further perceive the restriction potentially encouraging people who are intoxicated to drive because they are not allowed to remain in the dwelling unit after 1:30 a.m. if the number of people present exceeds the occupancy limit. Public safety would be well-served by permitting intoxicated guests or occupants to remain at the summer rental unit until they are able to depart safely, instead of forcing them to leave. This public safety problem of driving while intoxicated renders the necessity for Ordinance section 26-7.4b less compelling in a balancing test.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Additional probable circumstances are equally of concern. Other ordinances or statutes prohibiting disorderly or criminal conduct apply to the objectionable behavior which Ordinance sections 26-7.1 and -7.4b seek to prevent. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-2a(1) (engaging in \u201cfighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior\u201d is a petty disorderly persons offense); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-11 (defacing or damaging private property without the permission of the owner or tenant is a crime of the fourth degree); <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>2C:33-4 (harassment, which includes communicating \u201cin offensively coarse language\u201d and \u201cstriking, kicking, shoving, or other offensive conduct, or threatening to do so,\u201d is a petty disorderly persons offense). In addition, Belmar Ordinance section 16-3 prohibits excessive noise. In instances when such objectionable conduct occurs, defendants may prosecute under these provisions. Ordinance section 7.4b is thus duplicative of these more specific provisions, another factor rendering its governmental purpose less compelling and contributing to the conclusion that it is overbroad. These various statutes and related ordinances present a less drastic means to accomplish legitimate municipal goals, including preventing breaches of the peace. <em>Compare Allen v. City of Bordentown, </em>216 <em>NJ.Super. </em>557, 562-78, 524 A.2d 478 (Law Div.1987) (voiding a curfew imposed on minors), <em>with N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.52b, d (permitting municipalities to impose curfews on juveniles between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., with exceptions for medical emergencies and events sponsored by educational, religious, or community organizations).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Our Supreme Court has admonished municipalities that zoning ordinances are inappropriate means to \u201cprevent one segment of the summer population from ... adversely affecting other vacationers and permanent residents.\u201d <em>Kirsch, supra, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>at 253, 281 A.2d 513. The Court said: \u201cOrdinarily obnoxious personal behavior can best be dealt with officially by vigorous and persistent enforcement of general police power ordinances and criminal statutes---- Zoning ordinances are not intended and cannot be expected to cure or prevent most anti-social conduct in dwelling situations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253-54, 281 A.2d 513. <em>See also Vallorosi, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 433, 568 A.2d 888; <em>Baker, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 111, 405 A.2d 368. Although Ordinance section 26-7.4b is not a zoning ordinance, the same principles apply. Its broad application, like that of zoning provisions, makes it inappropriate to control \u201cobnoxious personal behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">We further conclude that Ordinance section 26-7.4b implicates protected conduct and extends too far in fulfilling Belmar\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>est. Limiting the number of people allowed in a dwelling to the occupancy rate extends to potentially ban many groups whose presence does not result in overcrowding, production of excessive noise, unruly behavior, fighting, littering, parking of vehicles on the lawn, urinating in public, causing poor property maintenance, or violating trash ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The record fails to support the premise that many or most gatherings in numbers that exceed the occupancy rate during the proscribed hours engage in this objectionable conduct. To the contrary, the evidence suggests that most summer tenants do not cause these problems. Witnesses describe the problem as applying to \u201ca handful of properties\u201d and \u201cmaybe 20 percent\u201d of summer tenants behaved badly. Such evidence is insufficient to serve as a factual predicate for the broad scope of this section. The Ordinance impacts upon a substantial amount of protected behavior, more than is necessary to abate the nuisances described in the Ordinance\u2019s legislative findings in section 26-7.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We conclude that although Ordinance section 26-7.4b does not constitute a curfew, it is an overbroad intrusion on summer tenants\u2019 privacy rights to share their homes with others, and violates their right to substantive due process. That provision of the Ordinance is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\n<em>IX.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Before addressing defendants\u2019 cross-appeal, we easily dispose of plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find no merit in plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the fee increase for summer rental licenses to $100 is unsubstantiated and punitive. We first observe that the summer rental licensing provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:52-1(n) authorize the licensing; moreover, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12m permits the municipality to charge a fee. We are satisfied that the presumption of reasonableness applies with substantial force here. <em>See State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>Boston Juvenile Shoes, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>249, 258, 288 A.2d 7 (1972). We find nothing in the record to suggest that this fee is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We reach the same result with respect to the fifty-dollar tourism fee. The fee is authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:52-7, and nothing in the record suggests that it is excessive. We affirm the trial judge\u2019s findings in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Finally, we dispose of plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the judge improperly severed portions of the Ordinance or provided a \u201cguidebook\u201d to defendants in his opinion as to how to amend the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The trial judge had the authority to engage in \u201cjudicial surgery,\u201d or narrow construction of a statute or ordinance, to free it from constitutional doubt or defect. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>1:10-1; <em>Chamber of Commerce, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 75, 411 A.2d 168. The issue focuses on both legislative intent, <em>ibid., </em>and whether the objectionable feature of the ordinance can be excised without substantial impairment of the principal object of the statute. <em>Affiliated Distillers Brands Corp. v. Sills, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>342, 345, 289 A.2d 257 (1972). We will enforce severability where the invalid portion is independent and the remaining portion forms a complete act within itself. <em>Inganamort v. Borough of Fort Lee, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>412, 423, 371 A.2d 34 (1977). Such is the case here, as the remaining provisions present a viable legislative action, constitutionally sound, and capable of lawful enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">So too, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 claim that an ordinance under attack may not be amended during the course of litigation. <em>See Van Dalen v. Washington Township, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 333, 500 A.2d 776 (Law Div.1984) (noting that where an ordinance is amended during the course of litigation, a court will ordinarily decide the validity of the ordinance in its amended form). All of these contentions are clearly without merit and need no further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>z.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">We now address defendants\u2019 claims of error. Defendants first mount a multi-faceted challenge to the judge\u2019s invalidation of Ordinance section 26-7.3, under the Act and equal protection principles. Ordinance section 26-7.3 requires that rentals to families with children, for any time from September 15 to May 15, not be occupied for the summer until the third day after the last day of the school year. Defendants argue substantively that: a) plaintiffs did not have standing to raise a claim under the Act; b) the Act is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause as applied to the Ordinance; and c) the Ordinance does not discriminate on the basis of family status. We also consider plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the quantum of counsel fees awarded on its claim under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The factual predicate for section 26-7.3 was based in part on a descriptive summary of the plight of Belmar school children in that community. Dr. Lester Richens, Belmar\u2019s Superintendent of Schools for over twenty years, explained that children starting school late and leaving early was a long-term problem. Richens noted that Belmar\u2019s mobility rate always exceeded the state average of 16%, ranging from 22.5% to 38% between 1994 and 1999. According to Richens, keeping a child in the district for the full school term was \u201creally beneficial for the educational program of that child.\u201d Richens said that \u201cthe majority of the students leaving after March is due to the winter rental situation,\u201d and many of the families who are displaced in the spring become homeless or move into motels. When families relocate into welfare motels, their living quarters are overcrowded, and the children are unable to complete homework assignments. In addition, some children whose families move out of the district in the spring finish the school year in Belmar, with their families providing transportation, but many of these children are left \u201cto wander the streets after school\u201d until their families pick them up at 5:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. Children\u2019s attention patterns become sporadic and their tardiness increases. According to Richens, \u201cwe have a real problem when it comes to children needing stability, and if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Belmar community can give them one year of stability in their education, I think it\u2019s well worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The Act provides, in relevant part, that \u201cit shall be unlawful ... [t]o discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling ... because of ... familial status.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3604(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The Act further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to invalidate or limit \u00a1my law of a Slate or political subdivision of a State ... that grants, guarantees, or protects the same rights as are granted by this subchapter; but any law of a State, a political subdivision, or other such jurisdiction that purports to require or permit any action that would be a discriminatory housing practice under this subchapter shall to that extent be invalid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">[42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3615.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">We briefly address the issue of standing. The judge determined that plaintiffs had standing under the Act, concluding that courts have interpreted standing to pursue a claim under the Act broadly and that the Act includes associations and legal representatives in its definition of \u201cpersons.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3602(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">The Act authorizes an \u201caggrieved person\u201d to commence a civil action in state court. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3613(a)(1)(A). An \u201caggrieved person\u201d is defined as \u201cany person who \u2014 (1) claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice; or (2) believes that such person will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3602(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">The judge relied on <em>Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, </em>441 <em>U.S. </em>91, 103 n. 9, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1601, 1609 n. 9, 60 L.Ed.2d 66, 79 n. 9 (1979) (\u201cas long as the plaintiff suffers actual injury as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, he is permitted to prove that the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>another were infringed\u201d), and concluded that plaintiffs were sufficiently aggrieved to pursue a claim under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">We reject defendants\u2019 argument that plaintiffs do not have standing because they are not \u201cmembers of the class of individuals protected by the Federal Fair Housing Act.\u201d Other courts have consistently allowed non-members of a protected class to bring actions under the Act, as long as the defendant\u2019s violation of the Act resulted in injury to the plaintiffs. For example, in <em>San Pedro Hotel Co. v. City of Los Angeles, </em>159 F.3d 470, 472-75 (9th Cir.1998), plaintiff hotel owners who had contracted to sell their hotel to a non-profit developer for use as housing for the mentally disabled had standing to sue under the Act, when the city declined to approve a federally-funded loan to finance the project, despite plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ctenuous\u201d connection to the protected individuals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">[T]o establish standing under the Act, all the [plaintiffs] need show is that the City interfered with the housing rights of the mentally ill and that, as a result, the [plaintiffs] suffered an actual injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">As potential sellers of the property who were unable to sell their property to a buyer because of the City\u2019s allegedly improper interference with an HUD loan, the [plaintiffs] meet this test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">[Id at 475.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-10\"><em>See also, Baytree of Inverrary Realty Partners v. City of Lauderhill, </em>873 F.2d 1407, 1408 (11th Cir.1989) (holding that a real estate developer, not a member of the protected class under the Act, had standing under the Act to challenge a municipality\u2019s refusal to amend a zoning ordinance to allow low-income housing); <em>Mackey v. Nationwide Ins. Cos., </em>724 F.2d 419, 420, 422-23 (4th Cir.1984) (holding that former agent of defendant-insurance company who alleged that defendant practiced \u201credlining,\u201d or an \u201carbitrary refusal to underwrite the risks of persons residing in predominantly black neighborhoods,\u201d had standing under the Act because he alleged \u201can economic injury to himself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Plaintiffs suffer actual economic injury as a result of the Ordinance; when they rent to families with children over the winter, the term of their summer rentals becomes restricted. Like the owners who were unable to sell their property in <em>San Pedro, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>supra, </em>159 <em>F.</em>3d at 475, and the builder who was unable to build low-income housing in <em>Baytree, supra, </em>873 <em>F.</em>2d at 1408, plaintiffs are unable to lease their properties for the terms that are most profitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We agree with defendants\u2019 observation that plaintiffs\u2019 interests are adverse to the interests of the family-tenants whom the Ordinance seeks to protect. However, that diversity of interest, even contrary to the protected class, does not deprive plaintiffs of standing under the Act. Plaintiffs need show only actual injury to themselves as a result of defendants\u2019 conduct. <em>Bellwood, supra, </em>441 <em>U.S. </em>at 103 n. 9, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1610 n. 9, 60 L.Ed.2d at 79 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">We reject defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Nasser v. City of Homewood, </em>671 F.2d 432 (11th Cir.1982). The denial of standing in <em>Nasser </em>was based on zoning which impacted on plaintiffs economic loss alone. <em>Id. </em>at 435-38. Here, in contrast, the Ordinance restricts plaintiffs\u2019 use of their properties only when they rent to families with children. The Ordinance thus imposes special conditions for rentals to a class protected by the Act. Unlike <em>Nasser, </em>here the disparate treatment set forth in the Ordinance causes plaintiffs\u2019 economic loss. It is this disparate treatment under the Ordinance which serves as the underpinning to support plaintiffs\u2019 claim of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Defendants attack the Act as unconstitutional, asserting that its enactment is beyond the authority of Congress under the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment. The Commerce Clause provides: \u201cThe Congress shall have Power ... [t]o regulate Commerce ... among the several States.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. Defendants rely on <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>549, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), in which the Court held that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 922(q)(1)(A) (1988 Supp. V), prohibiting possession of a firearm in a school zone, exceeded Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause, because the prohibited conduct was not among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u201cthose activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, <em>i.e., </em>those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 558-59, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1629-30, 131 L.Ed.2d at 637 (citation omitted). However, in <em>Lopez, </em>the Court emphasized that the Gun-Free School Zones Act was \u201ca criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with \u2018commerce\u2019 or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms,\u201d and noted that states retained primary authority to define and enforce criminal law. 514 <em>U.S. </em>at 561, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1631, 131 L.Ed.2d at 638. The Court rejected, as too remote, arguments that violent crime affected the national economy, 514 <em>U.S. </em>at 563-64, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1632, 131 L.Ed.2d at 640, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">The possession of a gun in a local school zone is in no sense an economic activity that might, through repetition elsewhere, substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">To uphold the Government\u2019s contentions here, we would have to pile inference upon inference in a manner that would bid fair to convert congressional authority under the Commerce Clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">[514 <em>U.S. </em>at 567, 115 <em>S.Ct </em>at 1634, 131 L.Ed.2d at 642-43.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-8\"><em>See also United States v.

The Ordinance regulates rental properties, and the rental of real estate is an activity that affects commerce. Unlike the crimes at issue in <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison, </em>the summer rental of homes or apartments in Belmar constitutes an economic enterprise. Residential real estate rentals, including seasonal resort properties, is part of a broad commercial market that is not \u201ctruly local.\u201d <em>Morrison, supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 617, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1754, 146 L.Ed.2d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The Court in <em>Lopez </em>acknowledged that \u201c \u2018where <em>a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, </em>the <em>de minimis </em>character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.\u2019 \u201d 514 <em>U.S. </em>at 558, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1629, 131 L.Ed.2d at 637 (quoting <em>Maryland v. Wirtz, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>183, 197 n. 27, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>2017, 2024 n. 27, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020, 1031 n. 27 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Defendants\u2019 view that the Ordinance simply applies to the dislocation of specific tenants is myopic. The housing rental market is a matter of national concern, and the Commerce Clause authorizes the regulation, despite what may be perceived to be the minimal character of the dislocation of a specific tenant. Defendants\u2019 reasoning that \u201cthis is a regulation designed to protect school age children currently in residence, not a regulation of commerce\u201d is also incorrect. It is not the Ordinance that the Commerce Clause authorizes, but the Fair Housing Act. The Act was designed to protect families with children, and in doing so it regulates housing rentals, an activity with a substantial relation to interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">This principle was explored recently in <em>Groome Resources Ltd. v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>234 F.3d 192 (5th Cir.2000). There, the Parish challenged a provision of the Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B), which includes, as unlawful discrimination, \u201ca refusal to make reasonable accommodations\u201d to handicapped buyers or renters. <em>Groome, supra, </em>234 F.3d at 195. Plaintiff, a business that operated group homes for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, requested reasonable accommodation in the form of permission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>house five people in a group home, when defendant\u2019s zoning ordinance allowed only four. <em>Id. </em>at 196. Because of local opposition, the Parish did not act on plaintiffs application. <em>Id. </em>at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The court held that the purchase and rental of residential housing, and plaintiffs proposed operation of its group home, were commercial or economic activity and, citing <em>Jones v. U.S., </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>848, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000) and <em>Russell, </em>concluded that \u201crenting and otherwise using housing for commercial purposes implicates the federal commerce power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206. The court explained that the occurrence of an act of discrimination \u201con a local stage is of no moment, because when Congress has chosen a national arena to regulate, every actor that affects commerce is subject to regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The court found the connection between discrimination against the handicapped in housing and interstate commerce strong enough to pass the attenuation test set forth in <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison. Id. </em>at 214-17. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">We do not need to pile \u201cinference upon inference\u201d to see that by refusing to reasonably accommodate the disabled by discriminatory zoning laws, there will be less opportunity for handicapped individuals to buy, sell, or rent homes____ Therefore, the regulation of discriminatory policies in the purchase or rental of housing directly affects the housing industry and the economy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">[id at 215.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">This reasoning is applicable here. Seasonal rentals in Belmar are commercial activity, earning profits for plaintiff-owners, just as in <em>Groome. </em>The Ordinance\u2019s restriction on seasonal rentals following the tenancy of a family with school-aged children affects the housing rental industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">Other courts have also concluded that the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to regulate housing through the Act. <em>Oxford House-C v. City of St. Louis, </em>77 F.3d 249, 251 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>816, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>65, 136 L.Ed.2d 27 (1996) (considering a zoning ordinance limiting the number of residents in a group home for recovering substance abusers); <em>Morgan v. Sec\u2019y of HUD, </em>985 F.2d 1451, 1455-56 (10th Cir.1993) (considering a mobile home park restriction against renting to families with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>children); <em>Seniors Civil Liberties Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Kemp, </em>965 F.2d 1030, 1033-34 (11th Cir.1992) (considering the complaint of senior citizens that the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of familial status violated their rights to freedom of association, liberty, property, and privacy).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In conclusion, we reject defendants\u2019 argument that the Act is an invalid exercise of Congress\u2019 power under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\n<em>C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">We now address the merits of defendants\u2019 discrimination claim. The judge held that the Ordinance \u201con its face discriminates against families with school-aged children.\u201d He noted that if a family moved out of a rental in October, \u201cthe Ordinance would still literally force the landlord to wait until the end of the academic year to rent for the summer.\u201d The judge was concerned that \u201cthe Ordinance will discourage winter rentals to families with children and actually prevent them from getting an education in Belmar,\u201d noting that defendants failed to demonstrate \u201cthat there are no other alternate solutions if summer rentals represent the true source of the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">To determine whether there has been discrimination under the Act, we apply the analysis utilized in employment discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2000e; the plaintiff must prove either disparate treatment or disparate impact. <em>Harris v. Itzhaki, </em>183 <em>F.3d </em>1043, 1051 (9th Cir.1999). We surmise that the judge analyzed the issue as one of disparate impact. To establish a prima facie case of disparate impact, one must demonstrate that a facially neutral practice or policy resulted in a significantly disproportionate or adverse impact on members of the affected class. <em>Pfaff v. HUD, </em>88 <em>F.3d </em>739, 745 (9th Cir.1996) (reversing a determination that a landlord\u2019s occupancy limit discriminated on the basis of familial status). Thus, plaintiffs must establish actual discriminatory impact; raising an inference is insufficient. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Even though plaintiffs assert that the Ordinance discriminates on its face, they commenced this action within months of the enactment of the Ordinance and before defendants had an opportunity to apply it to the extent that its impact could be measured. Plaintiffs thus did not and could not prove even a prima facie case of disparate impact. Despite this failure of proof, we agree that section 26-7.3 is discriminatory on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Section 26-7.3 imposes disparate treatment upon families with children because of their familial status. It does not grant or protect the freedom from discrimination as set forth in 42 U.S.C.A \u00a7 3604(b). Although it does not directly affect families with school-aged children, it restricts the use of dwellings rented to such families between the specified dates. This clearly impacts on the terms and conditions of these families\u2019 leases. Imposing this different or disparate treatment on units rented to families with school-aged children constitutes a discriminatory housing practice and is invalid under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3604(b) and 3615.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">We have scrupulously required that state and municipal regulations conform to the Act. <em>See, e.g., Borough of Merchantville v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>258, 264-66, 738 A.2d 981 (App.Div.1999) (interpreting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:11B-2, which provides for community residences for the mentally ill, to include people with other handicaps, such as recovering alcoholics and substance abusers, in order to avoid discrimination prohibited by the Act); <em>In Re Commitment J.W., </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>197, 207-08, 672 A.2d 199 (App.Div.1996) (invalidating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:11B-2 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-66.2, which prohibit a person found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity from living in a community group home, as \u201cfatally inconsistent with 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3604\u201d because the Act requires \u201ca careful, individualized consideration of the particular facts justifying their exclusion\u201d); <em>Cherry Hill Township v. Oxford House, Inc., </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 55, 621 A.2d 952 (App.Div.1993) (remanding for trial to determine whether the township, through its zoning ordinances, had discriminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>against former substance abusers living in group homes, in violation of the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In sum, section 26-7.3 authorizes discriminatory treatment of dwellings rented to families with school-aged children. The legislative construct creates circumstances that potentially inure not only to the detriment of summer landlords, but to the very children defendants purport to protect. Although well-intentioned, such treatment constitutes discrimination on the basis of familial status in violation of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3604(b). We agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that section 26-7.3 violated the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\n<em>D.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Lastly, as to claims raised under the Act, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the attorneys\u2019 fee award of $18,000 for services rendered with respect to their claims under the Act was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">We first observe that plaintiffs\u2019 Act claim was discrete. In similar circumstances, where fee-shifting claims are combined with non fee-shifting claims, we have suggested that while plaintiffs are entitled to fees, the integration of the various claims is a factor to be considered. <em>Chattin v. Cape May Greene, Inc., </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 614, 581 A.2d 91 (App.Div.1990), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>520, 591 A.2d 943 (1991); <em>49 Prospect St. Tenants Ass\u2019n v. Sheva Gardens, Inc., </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 470, 547 A.2d 1134 (App.Div.1988). We further note that while plaintiffs prevailed on this aspect of the claim, the overall attack of the Ordinance was generally unsuccessful. This is another relevant factor for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Ultimately, the issue of counsel fees attributable to this claim was a discretionary determination. The trial judge carefully considered the fee application, noted that counsel\u2019s time records did not establish the time expended on the Act claim, and awarded ten percent of the claimed $180,297.15. We find that there was no abuse of discretion, and we affirm the judge\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\n<em>XI.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">We now address defendants\u2019 contention that the judge erred in holding that the Ordinance sections requiring disclosure of personal information about tenants (names, addresses, telephone numbers, copies of drivers\u2019 licenses or other identification, copies of leases if they are in writing, and names and ages of child-occupants) is an invalid invasion of tenants\u2019 privacy. Defendants assert that plaintiffs, as landlords, lacked standing to assert the rights of their tenants. They further argue that such compelled disclosures do not violate tenants\u2019 privacy because the information is available, and defendants are not required to disclose it to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">We quickly dispose of the issue of plaintiffs\u2019 standing by recognizing that \u201cNew Jersey courts take a broad and liberal approach to standing.\u201d <em>New Jersey Citizen Action v. Riviera Motel Corp., </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>402, 415, 686 A.2d 1265 (App.Div. 1997); <em>New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 67, 411 A.2d 168 (\u201cEntitlement to sue requires a sufficient stake and real adverseness with respect to the subject matter of the litigation. A substantial likelihood of some harm visited upon the plaintiff in the event of an unfavorable decision is needed for purposes of standing.\u201d (citation omitted)). Plaintiffs have a substantial stake in the outcome and a likelihood of harm if the decision is adverse to them. If tenants are required to provide personal information to the municipality, it will be more difficult for plaintiffs to find tenants, and the value of plaintiffs\u2019 summer rentals may well decrease. Plaintiffs, as owners of the affected properties, are directly involved in the controversy and are significantly adverse with respect to its subject matter. Some of the Ordinance provisions challenged require submission of copies of leases to the municipality. Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 26-2.4(d), -3.5(a)(4), and -3.5(b)(5). Plaintiffs are parties to their leases, and submission of leases involves their right to privacy as well as that of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>tenants. Plaintiffs are not strangers to the proceedings, and we are satisfied that they had standing to challenge this provision of the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The judge invalidated the following provisions of the Ordinance:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Applications for certificates of inspection must include both (1) a copy of the lease, if there is a written lease, \u201cexecuted by all adult persons who will be tenants\u201d; the applicant may redact the rent amount, Ordinance \u00a7 26-2.4d; and (2) an affidavit of each tenant stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">i. whether he or she maintains a residence elsewhere, and providing the full address thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">ii. providing a true and correct copy of his or her driver\u2019s license or if not available alternative proof of identification;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">iii. listing the names of all minors who will occupy the dwelling unit, and the ages of each child as of the date of the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">LOrdinance \u00a7 26-2.4e.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">We note that applications for public accommodations licenses for hotels and motels must include the names and addresses of all tenants, and a copy of the lease if it is in writing (monetary amounts may be redacted), Ordinance \u00a7 26-3.5a.4, while applications for summer rental licenses must include: (1) \u201c[t]he names and mailing addresses of all tenants and of all adult persons who are tenants,\u201d Ordinance \u00a7 26-3.5b.l.iv, or when a special license is issued, covering short-term rentals for thirty-one days or less, the applicant must provide the identities of new tenants and the dates of their occupancy, Ordinance \u00a7 26-3.4; (2) a copy of the lease if it is in writing, with the option to delete the amount, Ordinance \u00a7 26-3.5b.5; (3) an affidavit of each tenant \u201cstating whether he or she maintains a residence elsewhere, providing the full address and telephone number thereof, [and] stating whether the other address is his or her permanent address,\u201d as well as \u201c[a] copy of the tenant\u2019s driver\u2019s license or if not available such alternative proof of identification,\u201d Ordinance \u00a7 26-3.5b.6; (4) an affidavit of each tenant substantially as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>I HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE that the maximum permitted occupancy of this Summer Rental is_persons. I understand that occupancy by a number of persons greater than this maximum limit between the hours of 1:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. is a violation of Borough Ordinance and shall result in the issuing of a summons____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">I further understand that Summer Rental occupancy limits are strictly enforced, and that they apply to all occupants of Summer Rentals regardless of whether they are tenants or guests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">[Ordinance \u00a7 26-3.5b.Y.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Anyone who becomes a tenant after the issuance of a summer rental license must also submit this affidavit unless a special license for short-term rentals is issued in accordance with Ordinance section 26-3.4. Ordinance \u00a7 26-3.1a.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">Defendants\u2019 justification for requiring this information was that a copy of the lease was necessary to determine whether it \u201cwould fall under the enabling authority,\u201d which depended on the period of the tenancy. Also, it was necessary to ascertain whether any children would be residing in a rental unit, so that the Borough could determine whether its restriction on such rentals was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">According to Pringle, the Borough obtained the names of tenants to require them to \u201csign off on a disclosure as to what the occupancy was,\u201d which would prevent occupancy violations. \u201cThe whole point of this process is to make sure that every person that pays money to live in a summer rental in Belmar, is told what the occupancy is----[and] the hours during which it was going to be enforced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-15\">The judge determined that the required information \u201cimplicate[s] privacy interests\u201d; it could \u201cprovide details of familial relationships and other intimate living arrangements.\u201d <em>Yeager v. Hackensack Water Co., </em>615 <em>F.Supp. </em>1087, 1092 (D.N.J.1985). Balancing Belmar\u2019s legitimate \u201cinterest in protecting itself from the problems caused by summer residents\u201d against \u201cindividuals\u2019 privacy rights,\u201d he concluded that the disclosure requirements of the Ordinance were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-16\">not narrowly tailored to the end sought to be achieved. The Borough is essentially attempting to curb the rowdiness type behavior caused by summer residents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>indirectly by requiring them to provide the Borough with private information. However, the Borough does not need to know the names of tenants or then-addresses or other personal information to enforce an occupancy limit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\"><em>Yeager </em>is particularly instructive. In <em>Yeager, </em>defendant-water company demanded the names and social security numbers of residents of homes to which it supplied water, to ration water according to the number of people in the home, in accordance with a state drought emergency program. <em>Id. </em>at 1089. The court held that the demand for social security numbers violated the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 552a. 615 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1089-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Regarding the names of residents, the court determined that \u201cthe right to be free from compelled disclosure of the names of household members is within the right of privacy which has been recognized by the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1092. The water company alleged that the names were necessary \u201cto verify the number of water users,\u201d in order to determine whether rations were being exceeded. <em>Id. </em>at 1092-93. The court acknowledged the state\u2019s \u201csubstantial interest in alleviating the water emergency,\u201d but determined that \u201cthere exist[ed] less intrusive methods by which defendants might achieve their objectives. Contrary to then-assertions, defendants [showed] no evidence that individuals, if asked, would intentionally misrepresent the number of household members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1093.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">In <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 662 A.2d 367 (1995), the Supreme Court upheld the disclosure requirements of the Registration and Community Notification Laws, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1 to -11 (Megan\u2019s Law), against a challenge that public disclosure of private information related to convicted sex offenders invaded their privacy rights. 142 <em>N.J. </em>at 77-91, 662 A.2d 367. The Court explained that the initial inquiry was whether \u201cplaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information disclosed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 662 A.2d 367. If plaintiff did have such a reasonable expectation, \u201cwe must decide whether the intrusion on the right of privacy is justified, balancing the governmental interest in disclosure against the private interest in confidentiality.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The Court analyzed each item of information that the provisions required to be disclosed and determined that plaintiff had no reasonable expectation of privacy in most of the items because they were readily available to the public. <em>Id. </em>at 79-83, 662 A.2d 367. The Court noted that the records of the Division of Motor Vehicles, which included the applicant\u2019s address, were public records under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-2. 142 <em>N.J. </em>at 80, 662 A.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Despite its public availability, the Court held that disclosure of a home address implicated privacy interests, because it might result in unsolicited contact. <em>Id. </em>at 82-84, 662 A.2d 367. The Court also held that \u201ca privacy interest is implicated when the government assembles those diverse pieces of information into a single package and disseminates that package to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87, 662 A.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Nevertheless, on the other side of the equation, the Court said: \u201cThe state interest in protecting the safety of members of the public from sex offenders is clear and compelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 662 A.2d 367. The Court noted that \u201cthe degree and scope of disclosure is carefully calibrated to the need for public disclosure: the risk of reoffense.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In reference to this Ordinance, we have held that the restrictions on rentals to tenants with school-aged children violate the Fair Housing Act; that conclusion places in substantial issue whether Belmar has any legitimate interest in obtaining the names and ages of children who will occupy dwelling units. We answer that query in the negative and conclude that Ordinance section 26-2.4e.iii, requiring this information, is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">In addition, the judge invalidated the requirement of the tenant\u2019s affidavit acknowledging the rental\u2019s maximum permitted occupancy as a violation of tenants\u2019 right to privacy. However, we observe that the proposed affidavit does not implicate any privacy rights because it does not state any private facts about tenants. <em>Cf. Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 78, 662 A.2d 367. Requiring tenants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>execute this affidavit thus does not infringe on their right to privacy, and the judge erred in voiding this requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">As the Court pointed out in <em>Doe, </em>drivers\u2019 licenses or other identification are \u201crecords which are required by law to be made, maintained, or kept on file,\u201d and are thus are public records under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-2. <em>See </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 80, 662 A.2d 367. However, despite the availability of home addresses, their disclosure implicates privacy interests. <em>Id. </em>at 82-84, 662 A.2d 367. In addition, neither unlisted telephone numbers nor copies of leases are public records or otherwise available to the public. Tenants and plaintiffs thus have a reasonable expectation of privacy of this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Defendants argue that the Borough does not disclose the information to the public. Nor does it compile \u201cdiverse pieces of information into a single package.\u201d Names, addresses, and identification do not constitute confidential or private information. Unlisted telephone numbers and leases seem more worthy of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Belmar has established no interest in disclosure. Defendants have failed to explain why it is necessary to review an entire lease to determine its term. As the court said in <em>Yeager, </em>there are less intrusive methods for obtaining this information; license applicants would supply it when asked. <em>See </em>615 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1093. Nor have defendants stated any reason for requiring addresses, telephone numbers, or document identification of tenants. Pringle explained that the Borough obtained the names of tenants to require them to \u201csign off on a disclosure as to what the occupancy was,\u201d which would prevent occupancy violations. However, ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>dresses, telephone numbers and identification are not necessary to obtain a signed occupancy disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Under Ordinance section 26-3.5b.7, applications for summer rental licenses must include tenants\u2019 affidavits acknowledging occupancy restrictions. Such a requirement precludes defendants\u2019 need to contact tenants to inform them of occupancy limits or to obtain this signed disclosure. It is provided with the application for the summer rental license. The judge was correct that defendants \u201cneed not know the names or addresses of tenants in order to enforce occupancy limits,\u201d and that the Ordinance requirements are \u201cnot narrowly tailored to the end sought to be achieved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In conclusion, the judge erred in voiding that portion of Ordinance section 26-3.5b.7, requiring tenants to submit affidavits acknowledging their rentals\u2019 occupancy limits, because it does not violate any right to privacy. The judge properly invalidated all the other Ordinance provisions requiring disclosure of information about tenants and copies of leases, as a violation of plaintiffs\u2019 and tenants\u2019 right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\n<em>XII.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">The Ordinance contains a provision, Ordinance section 26-3.7, prohibiting temporary certificates for summer rentals. The judge held that this provision was unconstitutional. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Ordinance section 26-3.7 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">No Summer Rental License or Public Accommodations License shall be issued by the Code Official unless the dwelling unit or premises, as appropriate, has first been inspected and determined to be in full compliance with the Code, and the requirements of Chapter XXVI. No temporary or conditional certificates of inspection or conditional licenses shall be issued in connection with any Summer Rental License or Public Accommodations License.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">This section goes on to allow temporary certificates of inspection for dwelling units \u201csubject to the restriction set forth in Section 26-7.3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Various property owners complained that minor violations such as dirty windows, dirty carpets, a window sill requiring painting, two different colors of paint on soffits, untrimmed hedges, a crack in the sidewalk, a crack in a corner of a window, or rust on a can of shaving cream in a medicine cabinet prompted license denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">A minor violation leads to a denial of a Summer Rental License. This Court finds no rational basis for the Borough\u2019s position that no temporary or conditional licenses will be issued to summer rentals, simply because of past violations by some summer landlords. Certainly, the Borough can cite landlords for noncompliance if violations are not corrected by the expiration of the license and deny any extensions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The judge added that he \u201cdoes not find any problems with a conditional Certificate being issued for 20 days or less to accommodate the Borough\u2019s concern that the delects be quickly corrected. The Court simply finds a constitutional problem with \u00a7 26-3.7 as currently formulated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Although not fully articulated, the parties apparently focused on equal protection principles in support of the constitutional claim, as the argument is not \u201cthat the legislative means are forbidden, but that the Legislature must write evenhandedly.\u201d <em>Greenberg, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 562, 494 A.2d 294. Because no fundamental right or suspect class is involved, \u201cthe legislative classification need only be rationally related to a legitimate interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 494 A.2d 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Defendants cite <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12m, which authorizes municipalities to regulate \u201cthe maintenance and condition\u201d of residential rentals \u201cfor the purpose of the safety, healthfulness, and upkeep of the structure and the adherence to such other standards of maintenance and condition as are required in the interest of public safety, health and welfare.\u201d The statute provides for certificates of inspection or occupancy prior to rental, which \u201cshall be issued by the municipality upon the inspection of the unit of dwelling space by a municipal inspector and his finding that such unit meets the standards provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Defendants argue that the full compliance requirement of Ordinance section 26-3.7 \u201cis specifically allowed by\u201d this statute. Plaintiffs have cited no statutory or other right to temporary certificates. The statutory scheme does not provide for temporary certificates to allow owners a period of time to correct minor violations. Instead, it provides that certificates of inspection or occupancy be issued upon the finding of the municipal inspector that the unit meets the applicable standards. This is exactly what Ordinance section 26-3.7 accomplishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Plaintiffs argue that minor violations do not impact health and safety. However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12m is not limited to violations \u2014 it also speaks to \u201cupkeep of the structure\u201d and adherence to \u201cstandards of maintenance.\u201d Alleged minor items such as dirty and garbage-strewn premises, uncut lawns and cracked windows are health hazards to varying degrees. Inoperative smoke detectors, a minor item according to one property owner, clearly constitutes a safety hazard under any reasonable interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We accept as reasonable defendants\u2019 explanation for precluding temporary certificates for summer rentals. The summer rentals are, by definition, relatively short term leases. There is a time-gap between identifying the violation, repair, inspection, and inception of the lease. The Borough determined to make the inspections at an earlier date and eliminate the need for temporary certificates. This approach is a rational, reasonable, and sufficient shield against a constitutional challenge. We conclude that the judge erred in holding Ordinance section 26-3.7 unconstitutional. It was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of ensuring full compliance with housing maintenance requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\n<em>XIII.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The judge invalidated Ordinance section 26-7.12 prohibiting commercial signs and strings of electric lights, as a violation of summer tenants\u2019 First Amendment right to free speech. Defendants contest the judge\u2019s determinations that the Ordinance restricted noncommercial speech and that it was content-based. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>They also argue that strings of lights left on all week are a fire hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Ordinance section 26-7.12 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">It shall be unlawful for any person to affix to, hang from, or otherwise display on the exterior of any structure or premise containing a Summer Rental Licensed dwelling unit during any period the license is in effect, any sign, advertisement, banner, poster, cut-out figure or other display advertising a commercial product or service, or to display strings of electric lights. Nothing contained in this section 26.7.12 shall be construed to prohibit or otherwise restrict advertising of the rental of a Summer Licensed dwelling unit in accordance with this Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The First Amendment provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. I. It applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 <em>U.S. </em>296, 303, 60 <em>S.Ct. </em>900, 903, 84 <em>L.Ed. </em>1213, 1218 (1940); <em>Hamilton Amusement Ctr. v. Verniero, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>254, 264, 716 A.2d 1137 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>527 <em>U.S. </em>1021, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>2365, 144 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>770 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The primary complaint prompting the limitation on signs was the proliferation of \u201cplacards and signs and cutouts\u201d that were \u201cpasted all over the front of rental properties.\u201d Many of these signs advertised various beers. The signs were located in primarily residential zones and were characterized as \u201ca culturally positive thing for group rental properties to do,\u201d but \u201cinappropriate in residential neighborhoods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The judge found that the restriction on signs was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-12\">not a \u201ccommercial speech\u201d restriction. The restriction [a]ffects residential housing, not commercial enterprises. Although the signs are commercial in nature, they are not displayed for commercial purposes, rather they are presumably displayed as a form of expression ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">The signage prohibitions in the regulation are content-based. The regulation is aimed at the content of signs because the regulation does not restrict all signs, but only signs that advertise \u201ca commercial product or service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">The judge concluded that because the restriction was content-based and applied to noncommercial speech, it was presumed invalid and defendants failed to present evidence to overcome this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>presumption. \u201c \u2018Eye-sore\u2019 concerns can be addressed through regulating the physical characteristics of the signs.\u201d We disagree with this finding and reverse this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Plaintiffs are incorrect that the Ordinance \u201cincludes both commercial and non-commercial speech\u201d because it prohibits \u201ca political or religious advertisement.\u201d The Ordinance prohibits only displays \u201cadvertising a commercial product or service,\u201d except for rental advertising. Ordinance \u00a7 26-7.12. It does not bar political or religious messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The Supreme Court recently considered whether restrictions on commercial speech violated the First Amendment in <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>254, 716 A.2d 1137. There, plaintiffs challenged <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-7c, which restricted the size, number and content of signs that sexually-oriented businesses could display. <em>Id. </em>at 262-63, 716 A.2d 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The Court applied two tests for determining whether the regulation violated the First Amendment. The first was a four-part inquiry: (1) whether the regulated speech concerned unlawful conduct or is misleading; (2) \u201cwhether the asserted governmental interest is substantial,\u201d and, if so; (3) \u201cwhether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and\u201d; (4) whether the regulation \u201cis no more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 716 A.2d 1137 (quoting <em>Cent. Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>557, 566, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2343, 2350, 65 L.Ed.2d 341, 351 (1980)). The second and overlapping test was whether \u201ctime, place and manner restrictions\u201d were justified without regard to the content of the speech, advanced a significant governmental interest, and left alternative means of communication open. <em>Id. </em>at 267-68, 716 <em>A.2d </em>1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">We disagree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the regulation is content-based because it \u201cdoes not restrict all signs, but only signs that advertise \u2018a commercial product or service.\u2019 \u201d The judge did not specify whether he considered the Ordinance content-based because it regulated only some commercial speech, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>because it regulated only commercial speech. The prohibition against signs advertising a commercial product or service, set forth in the Ordinance, encompasses all commercial signs. Regulation of all commercial speech cannot be considered content-based because it does not include noncommercial speech; although many regulations cover both, where they do not, we consider the two categories separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In <em>Hamilton, </em>the Court rejected the argument that the statute applied \u201cbeyond the commercial context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 716 A.2d 1137. Acknowledging that outdoor signs were used to convey political and social messages, the Court noted that \u201cplaintiffs ... made no showing of actual noncommercial use.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Nevertheless, even though it regulated only commercial speech, the Court held that the statute in issue was not content-based. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 716 A.2d 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Here too, application of the Ordinance only to commercial speech does not render it content-based. Nor does the exception for rental signs render the prohibition content-based. The United States Supreme Court has determined that a municipality may not prohibit \u201cfor sale\u201d signs on homes because alternative channels for communication are inadequate, and the prohibition \u201crestrictfs] the free flow of truthful information.\u201d <em>Linmark Assocs., Inc. v. Township of Willingboro, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>85, 92-95, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1614, 1618-20, 52 L.Ed.2d 155, 161-63 (1977). New Jersey courts have also invalidated prohibitions against or severe restrictions on \u201cfor sale\u201d signs on residences. <em>Berg Agency v. Township of Maplewood, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542, 895 A.2d 261 (Law Div.1978); <em>Schoen v. Township of Hillside, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>286, 382 A.2d 704 (Law Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">In <em>Hamilton </em>the Court explained: \u201cA statute or ordinance is considered to be content-neutral when the legislature\u2019s predominant concern is with adverse secondary effects, such as those caused by sexually oriented businesses, and not with the content of the speech being restricted.\u201d 156 <em>N.J. </em>at 268, 716 A.2d 1137. Here, Belmar\u2019s concern was not with the content of the prohibited advertising signs, but with their adverse secondary effects in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>residential neighborhoods, i.e., their appearance, or \u201ceye-sore,\u201d as the judge put it.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Appearance is a valid governmental objective. In <em>City of Ladue v. Gilleo, </em>512 <em>U.S. </em>43, 54, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>2038, 2044-45,129 L.Ed.2d 36, 46 (1994), invalidating a nearly total ban on residential signs, the Court recognized that \u201cthe City\u2019s interest in minimizing the visual clutter associated with signs\u201d was a \u201cconeededly valid\u201d interest. Similarly, in <em>State v. Miller, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>402, 409, 416 A.2d 821 (1980), invalidating another virtually complete ban on signs in residential zones, the Court, noting that \u201cclean, salubrious neighborhoods contribute to psychological and emotional stability and well-being as well as stimulate a sense of civic pride,\u201d held that \u201ca zoning ordinance may accommodate aesthetic concerns.\u201d <em>See also Bell v. Township of Stafford, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>384, 396, 541 A.2d 692 (1988) (acknowledging \u201cpreserving aesthetics\u201d as a legitimate municipal goal, while invalidating a nearly total ban on both commercial and noncommercial signs). A prohibition against commercial signs furthers this goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Finally, Ordinance section 26-7.12 is no more restrictive than necessary and leaves open alternate channels for communication. It applies only to summer rentals during the periods that their licenses are in effect, which focuses on the problem. Summer renters may express themselves by exhibiting any type of noncommercial sign they choose, as Ordinance section 26-7.12 prohibits only commercial signs. The prohibition on commercial signs at summer rentals is no more restrictive than necessary to preserve the character and aesthetics of residential neighborhoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Our courts have upheld zoning bans on commercial or advertising signs. In <em>United Advertising Corp. v. Borough of Metuchen, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>1, 3, 198 A.2d 447 (1964), the Court upheld a ban throughout the municipality on \u201coutdoor advertising signs other than those related to a business conducted on the premises.\u201d The plaintiff sought to erect billboards in business and manufacturing districts. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court held that the \u201caesthetic impact of billboards is an economic fact which may bear heavily upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>enjoyment and value of property. It is a relevant zoning consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 198 A.2d 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In <em>State v. J &amp; J Painting, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>384, 400 A.2d 1204 (App.Div.1979), we upheld an ordinance prohibiting contractors\u2019 signs in residential districts. The defendant-contractors claimed that the ban on posting their business signs at homes on which they were performing work violated their rights to free speech and equal protection. <em>Id. </em>at 385-86, 400 A.2d 1204. We rejected this argument: \u201cThe ordinance regulation is a reasonable one and, fundamentally, simply prohibits the carrying on of a purely commercial activity in a residential zone restricted against such uses\u2014 long a valid zoning proscription.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386, 400 A.2d 1204. We concluded that the prohibition \u201cserves legitimate municipal zoning functions in the protection of real estate values and considerations of aesthetics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386-87, 400 A.2d 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Here also, the ban on advertising signs at summer rentals prohibits commercial activity in a residential zone. It leaves all other means of advertising, as well as personal expression open, and advances the legitimate governmental purpose of promoting aesthetics.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">In conclusion, the judge erred in invalidating the prohibition against commercial signs set forth in Ordinance section 26-7.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">The prohibition against lights was also based on aesthetic and safety concerns. The Borough established a rational basis for the prohibition against strings of lights, that is, they constituted a fire hazard. This assertion was unrefuted; it is the only evidence in the record on this issue. Plaintiffs failed in their burden of proving that the prohibition against strings of lights was unreasonable; they submitted no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The Ordinance enjoys a presumption of validity. <em>Dome Realty, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 235, 416 A.2d 334. The rational basis of fire-safety justifies it. <em>Mannie\u2019s Cigarette Serv., supra, </em>259 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>per. </em>at 347-48, 613 A.2d 494. The judge erred in invalidating this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\n<em>XIV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">We now address the common issue raised in both the United Property Owners\u2019 appeal (A-2938-99T5) and the Zampetti appeal (A-40-00T5) \u2014 the propriety of Ordinance section 26-11.3a, permitting the Borough to impose a bond requirement on landlords whose tenants have acted in a repeatedly disorderly manner as defined by the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Our consideration of the issue requires us to summarily set forth the procedural and factual background of the Zampetti appeal. The Zampettis, owners of property in defendant Belmar, leased their property to summer tenants in 1997, two of whom were issued three summonses and pled guilty to violations of Belmar\u2019s noise ordinance. Belmar instituted a proceeding to require plaintiffs to post a bond to insure future compliance, pursuant to Belmar Ordinance section 26-11 and its enabling act, N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12n-r. After a hearing, Belmar\u2019s hearing officer required plaintiffs to post a $1500 bond. Plaintiffs contested this decision, and the trial judge affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Plaintiffs appeal, contending that: (1) Ordinance section 26-11 is void because it does not conform to the enabling act; (2) both the Ordinance and the enabling act deprive plaintiffs of their right to due process, and the enabling act constitutes special legislation; and (3) defendant failed to prove that a bond was necessary. All of the issues raised in the United Property Owners\u2019 appeal were raised by the Zampettis as well. We reject these arguments and affirm the judge\u2019s determination that the bonding requirement is lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Plaintiffs argue that the judge erred in failing to determine that Ordinance section 26-11 is invalid because it \u201cincludes tenant offenses,\u201d i.e., excessive noise, \u201cthat are not authorized\u201d by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>enabling act. Plaintiffs reason that the Ordinance is \u201ccontrary to State law\u201d and thus void.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The Legislature determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">a. Many of the shore resort communities in this State ... have experienced disturbances, damage and public expense resulting from carelessly granted and inadequately supervised seasonal rentals to irresponsible vacationers by inept or indifferent landlords.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">b. To preserve the peace and tranquility of those communities ... it is necessary and desirable that those communities have adequate means to curb and discourage those occasional excesses arising from irresponsible seasonal rentals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">c. Accordingly, it is the purpose of this legislation to enable such communities to take effective action to assure that excesses, when they occur, shall not be repeated, and that landlords offering seasonal rentals be held to sufficient standards of responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12n.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">To accomplish this goal, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12p.a, authorizes municipalities in fifth- or sixth-class counties to enact ordinances requiring such landlords to post a bond, \u201cunder certain circumstances, as hereinafter in this act described ... against the consequences of disorderly behavior of their tenants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">These circumstances are described in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12q:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-13\">An ordinance adopted under authority of this section shall provide:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\">a. If in any one year a specified number, which shall not be less than three,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of complaints, on separate occasions, of disorderly, indecent, tumultuous or riotous conduct upon or in proximity to any seasonal rental premises, and attributable to the acts ... of any of the tenants of those premises, have been substantiated ... the municipal governing body ... may institute proceedings to require the landlord to post a bond against the consequences of future incidents of the same character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-15\">Belmar Ordinance section 26-11 substantially mirrors this enabling act. The section to which plaintiffs object, 26-11.3a, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>If in any one (1) year, three (3) substantiated complaints ... of disorderly, indecent, tumultuous or riotous conduct, including by way of example, but not limited to, simple assault, assault, terroristic threats, harassment, lewdness, urinating in public, criminal mischief, or excessive noise, upon or in proximity to any seasonal rental premises, and attributable to the acts ... of any of the tenants of those premises, have been substantiated ... the Borough Council ... may institute proceedings to require the landlord of the seasonal rental premises to post a bond against the consequences of future incidents of the same character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Plaintiffs claim that because the enabling act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12q.a, includes only \u201cdisorderly, indecent, tumultuous or riotous conduct\u201d as the subject of complaints that can result in the initiation of a bond proceeding, the inclusion of \u201cexcessive noise\u201d in this category in Ordinance section 26-11.3a is unauthorized, improper, and contrary to the statute. The judge concluded that the Ordinance \u201chas not gone too far. Even though the enabling act does not list \u2018excessive noise\u2019 as grounds for a complaint, this Court finds that the \u2018substantiated complaint\u2019 definition includes \u2018excessive noise,\u2019 which is a form of disorderly conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Plaintiffs invoke the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>\u201cthe express mention of one thing necessarily implies the exclusion of all others.\u201d <em>In re K.L.F., </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>507, 517, 646 A.2d 532 (Ch.Div.1993). They argue that the Legislature\u2019s failure to specify \u201cexcessive noise\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12q.a precludes defendant from including excessive noise in its Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The list of offenses in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12q.a, \u201cdisorderly, indecent, tumultuous or riotous conduct,\u201d sets forth \u201ca general type of conduct\u201d rather than an exclusive list of particular offenses with the intent to exclude all others. If the Legislature had intended a list of specific offenses, it would have listed specific offenses. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-19 (setting forth those specific statutory offenses constituting domestic violence). It would not have used the general term \u201cconduct,\u201d and it would have included references to the criminal code.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">According to plaintiffs, the Legislature intended that the offenses which may cause the initiation of a bond proceeding \u201cmust rise to the level of \u2018disorderly conduct,\u2019 as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-2a and b, or \u2018riot,\u2019 as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-1a.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Fighting, violent or tumultuous behavior, threatening, creating a hazard, and offensive language are prohibited under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-2(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Plaintiffs note that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-2(b) also prohibits noise, but its scope is much narrower than that set forth in Belmar Ordinance section 16-3.1. Under the statute, the prohibited noise must be not only unreasonably loud, but also offensively coarse or abusive and intended to offend.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Under the Ordinance, the prohibited noise may be merely \u201cloud, unnecessary or unusual.\u201d The Ordinance also specifies that a loud, disturbing and unnecessary noise includes the playing or operating of a radio, phonograph or other sound-producing device \u201cin such manner or volume as to cause a noise disturbance to others in the vicinity.\u201d Ordinance \u00a7 16-8.2c. A noise disturbance is a sound which annoys or disturbs a reasonable person, or which \u201cinjures or endangers the comfort, repose, health, hearing, peace or safety of other persons.\u201d Ordinance \u00a7 16-3.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 thesis that an offense must rise to the level of disorderly conduct or riot under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-1 and -2 to cause the commencement of a bond proceeding would render the terms \u201cindecent\u201d and \u201ctumultuous\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12q.a superfluous. There is no offense for either tumultuous or indecent conduct in the criminal code, although the word tumultuous is part of the description of disorderly conduct. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-2a(1). Ordinarily, we assume that the Legislature intends \u201cthat the words of a statute have a meaning that is not superfluous or irrelevant.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Curiale, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>608, 618, 608 A.2d 895 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Although excessive noise does not qualify as disorderly conduct under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-2b, unless it consists of coarse or abusive language, it falls within the rubric of tumultuous. Tumult is defined as either \u201cuproar\u201d or \u201cviolent agitation of mind or feelings.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New American Dictionary </em>555 (Smithmark 1995). Excessive noise could qualify as an uproar or a violent agitation to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>In addition, the Legislature declared that its intent in enacting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12n-r was \u201c[t]o preserve the peace and tranquility\u201d of shore resort communities. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12n.b. Including excessive noise as one of the types of predicate conduct for a bond proceeding comports with this intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Another statutory provision supports this result. The amount of the bond must be adequate \u201cto make reparation for ... damages consequent upon disruption of affected residents\u2019 rights of ... quiet possession of their premises.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12q.d. The inclusion of disruption of quiet possession as a harm justifying damages denotes a legislative intent to include noise among the disturbances it empowered municipalities to curb and discourage.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The judge did not err in declining to declare Ordinance section 26-11 invalid. The Ordinance includes excessive noise as a tenant offense that could cause the commencement of a bond proceeding against the landlord, and such conduct is included within the scope of the enabling act.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">We reject, without further comment, plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the Ordinance is invalid because it failed to specify that the municipality may be heard at the hearing provided for in the Ordinance. While we agree with the judge that this Ordinance provision was inartfully and carelessly drafted, \u201cthe clear intent of the [Ordinance] was to provide for an appropriate hearing.\u201d Because we determine that plaintiffs\u2019 argument is without merit, we need not address plaintiffs\u2019 standing to raise this issue or explore the issue in any greater depth.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">We likewise reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the judge erred in failing to invalidate Ordinance section 26-11 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12n-r on the ground that they violated plaintiffs\u2019 right to substantive due process under the New Jersey Constitution. Plaintiffs complain that the act and Ordinance improperly hold landlords liable for their tenants\u2019 misdeeds, serve no legitimate governmental purpose, and indirectly prohibit group rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Citing <em>Rivkin, </em>plaintiffs assert that \u201c[sjubstantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment provides more limited protection of property interests,\u201d than substantive due process under the New Jersey Constitution. In <em>Rivkin, </em>the Court considered only the Fourteenth Amendment, not the New Jersey Constitution, and it stressed the availability of other remedies. <em>Rivkin, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 363-71, 671 A.2d 567 (rejecting plaintiff-property owners\u2019 federal civil rights claim, under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983, that defendant-rent leveling board deprived them of their property without due process, on their application for a rent increase, when one of its members was flagrantly biased and the rest of the board refused to disqualify him). The Court commented that \u201csubstantive due process is reserved for the most egregious governmental abuses against liberty or property lights,\u201d such as extreme cases of \u201cintrusions on an individual\u2019s privacy and bodily integrity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 671 A.2d 567. The Court held that the board\u2019s conduct did not \u201crise to the level of a substantive due process violation under the Supreme Court\u2019s standards.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Prior to <em>Rivkin, </em>our Supreme Court used the same, more lenient standard for substantive due process challenges under both the State and Federal Constitutions; the challenged regulation only had to be rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective. <em>Fanelli v. City of Trenton, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>582, 592-94, 641 A.2d 541 (1994) (an ordinance prohibiting pushcart peddling in a Special Improvement District did not violate due process); <em>Holmdel Builders Ass\u2019n v. Township of Holmdel, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>550, 581-82, 583 A.2d 277 (1990) (ordinances imposing fees dedicated to affordable housing on developers did not violate due process, but were subject to approval by the Council on Affordable Housing); <em>Taxpayers Ass\u2019n of Weymouth Township v. Weymouth Township, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>6, 44-45, 364 A.2d 1016 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>977, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1672, 52 L.Ed.2d 373 (1977) (a zoning ordinance allowing a mobile home park for the elderly did not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The distinction between the appropriate standards makes little difference, as plaintiffs\u2019 claim fails under either the strict standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>set forth in <em>Rivkin </em>or the more lenient standard. Under the standard set forth in <em>Rivkin, </em>imposing limited liability on landlords for the actions of their tenants does not intrude on anyone\u2019s privacy or bodily integrity and is not an egregious governmental abuse. 143 <em>N.J. </em>at 366, 671 A.2d 567. Like the conduct of the biased board member in <em>Rivkin, N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12n-r and Ordinance section 26-11 do not rise to the level of a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The Court set forth the <em>pre-Rivkin </em>standard in <em>Board of Education of Piscataway Township v. Caffiero, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>308, 431 A.2d 799, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>1025, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>560, 70 L.Ed.2d 470 (1981): \u201cDue process requires \u2018only that a law shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, and that the means selected bear a relation to the legislative object sought to be obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 431 A.2d 799 (quoting <em>Robson v. Rodriquez, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>517, 522, 141 A.2d 1 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe bonding requirement fails to advance a legitimate governmental purpose, and is merely punitive, because there is no real possibility that a <em>court </em>would impose vicarious liability on ... landlords for their tenant[s\u2019] actions.\u201d Plaintiffs complain that the statutory scheme is unfair to them because they have no right to participate in the municipal court actions against their tenants, yet are bound by the results; they could not have known of the convictions until after the summer rental season; and neither the statute nor the Ordinance provided them with guidance on what they should do when there are complaints against tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is flawed. The Court in <em>Piscataway </em>held that a legislative judgment to impose vicarious liability does not violate substantive due process. 86 <em>N.J. </em>at 317-21, 431 A.2d 799. Upholding <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:37-3, which imposed liability on parents <em>for </em>damages to school property caused by their children, the Court said: \u201cDue process does not restrict legislative imposition of liability to situations in which a defendant or his agent is at fault. Other considerations may warrant the imposition of liability and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>statute will be struck down only if it operates arbitrarily or capriciously.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 431 A.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The Court determined that the legislative purposes of compensating the public and deterring delinquent behavior were not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALd\">unreasonable and therefore an invalid basis for imposition of vicarious liability. As long as the means chosen by the Legislature have a rational relation to obtaining the objective sought, the statute will not be in violation of due process as an arbitrary or capricious enactment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">The existence of the parent-child relationship provides a rational basis for imposing liabiliiy and is a reasonable means to accomplish the purposes of compensation and deterrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">[<em>Id. </em>at 319-20, 431 A.2d 799.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Here also, the statute and ordinance advance the legitimate legislative goal of compensation and deterrence. The legislative intent is \u201cto curb and discourage\u201d the \u201cdisturbances, damage and public expense\u201d that result from \u201cirresponsible summer rentals.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12n.a, b.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The landlord-tenant relationship constitutes a rational basis for imposing liability. Holding landlords liable will force them to regulate and supervise their summer rentals more closely. <em>See also Adler\u2019s Quality Bakery, Inc. v. Gaseteria, Inc., </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>55, 67-72, 159 A.2d 97 (1960) (imposing strict liability under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>6:2-7 on an aircraft owner for damages caused by its operation did not violate the owner\u2019s right to due process); <em>Torchia v. Fisher, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>43, 47-49, 468 A.2d 1061 (1983) (upholding the same statute against the same claim, when the aircraft was stolen).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Plaintiffs cite <em>Baker, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 106-14, 405 A.2d 368 (invalidating a zoning ordinance that restricted residency on the basis of the number of unrelated persons), <em>Berger v.

Plaintiffs argue that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12n-r and Ordinance section 26-11 \u201cconstitute an indirect attempt to interfere into\u201d the \u201cprivate areas\u201d protected by these decisions and do an \u201cend run\u201d around due process principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>However, the statute and ordinance here do not limit residency-on the basis of family status and do not pertain to this \u201cprivate area\u201d in any way. They seek to prevent and compensate the community for \u201cdisorderly, indecent, tumultuous or riotous conduct,\u201d and plaintiffs do not challenge the legitimacy of this stated goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Plaintiffs complain that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12n-r improperly goes beyond the \u201cvigorous and persistent enforcement of general police power ordinances and criminal statutes\u201d that the Court in <em>Kirsch </em>suggested as a means to control \u201cobnoxious personal behavior.\u201d 59 <em>N.J. </em>at 253, 281 A.2d 513. However, <em>Kirsch </em>did not place any limit on legislation enabling municipalities to control the \u201cpublic and private nuisance\u201d of summer group rentals in shore communities. <em>Id. </em>at 245, 281 A.2d 513. To the contrary, the Court said: \u201cWe are entirely sympathetic to the community desire to prevent one segment of the summer population from so adversely affecting other vacationers and permanent residents, as well as the municipality as a whole, by their conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 281 A.2d 513. The Legislature has empowered municipalities to accomplish this goal in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12n-r. <em>Cf. Apartment House Council v.
