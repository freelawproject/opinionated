On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred by: (1) failing to instruct the jury that a finding of bad faith was required for the breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim; (2) failing to require the jury to find that a grievance proceeding would have resulted in plaintiffs reinstatement; (3) denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; and (4) allowing plaintiff to recover damages of lost wages in contravention of the exclusive remedy of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The evidence presented at trial showed that plaintiff began working for defendant in 1982 as a nurse\u2019s aide, and eventually became a unit secretary in 1991. In addition to performing her ordinary duties as a unit secretary, plaintiff was asked by a supervisor and agreed to collect money from employees in her unit for various occasions such as weddings, baby showers, and funerals. Plaintiff would tell her co-workers about the collection, and place the money she received in an envelope. She did not put the names of the individuals or the amounts they donated on the envelopes to avoid embarrassing them, but did put the name of the intended beneficiary on the envelope. Once all of the money was collected, she would purchase a card and give the card and the funds collected to the intended recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>In March 1996, plaintiff was asked by her supervisor to begin a collection for an employee. Plaintiff began the collection, took an excused medical sick leave for eight days, and completed the collection upon her return to work. Plaintiff also collected for two other employees around the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">On April 2, 1996, Joan Alverzo, the director of nursing at the hospital, informed plaintiff she was being suspended for three days due to an impropriety with the money plaintiff was collecting. This was the first time plaintiffs integrity had ever been questioned. After the suspension ended on April 5 plaintiff met with Alverzo to further discuss the issue. Plaintiff brought the three envelopes containing the collection money with her and gave them to Alverzo, along with letters explaining the status of the collections. Alverzo informed plaintiff she was being terminated because plaintiff \u201ccollected money way back and did not give it to the patient or person until they came back to [the hospital], [and] was still holding the money.\u201d The sole reason given to plaintiff for her termination was the alleged mishandling of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Plaintiff tried to explain the reason she had not given the money to its intended recipients was because she was trying to collect more money to make it a more \u201crespectable amount,\u201d but was terminated anyway. Alverzo claimed that one of the envelopes was short $5, but plaintiff denied this. Plaintiff stated there was no way Alverzo could have known this based upon her method for making the collections. Plaintiff testified she was so upset at the time that she was suicidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The employee handbook, which all employees received, provided procedures by which employees could present a grievance. Plaintiff drafted letters asking for a hearing on the matter and sent them to Kenneth Atchison, the president of the hospital, Stanley Shepard, the assistant vice president, Robert Geller, vice president of human resources, and the labor board. Plaintiff stated in the letters that she had a grievance and requested a fair hearing. Plaintiff also called Geller\u2019s office a few times, but never received a response, in writing or by telephone. She became depressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>because her side of the story was never heard and no one would believe her. She claimed the ordeal negatively affected her job search because her \u201cmind [was] not there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Plaintiff presented the testimony of Dr. Paul J. Kiell, a board certified psychiatrist. Dr. Kiell testified plaintiff suffered from a major depressive disorder. He said it is considered major depression because \u201cshe has a sleep disorder, and an eating disorder, and ... loss of pleasure seeking. There\u2019s no drive, ... no zest for living.\u201d Given a hypothetical that plaintiff testified she suffered \u201cfrom humiliation, emotional distress, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, [and] loss of interest socially,\u201d Dr. Kiell opined there would \u201cdefinitely\u201d be a causal relation to her termination and the accusation of her mishandling funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The jury was asked to decide whether plaintiff proved that defendant (1) breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (2) breached the implied employment contract; or (3) intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon plaintiff. Following a four-day trial, the jury decided in favor of plaintiff on the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim and decided in favor of defendant on the other two issues. The jury awarded plaintiff $65,000. Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment not withstanding the verdict was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in the charge for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Specifically, defendant contends the trial court failed to instruct the jury that a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing required a finding of bad faith on the part of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Initially, we note that appropriate and proper jury charges are essential for a fair trial. <em>Velazquez v. Portadin, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>677, 688, 751 A.2d 102 (2000). \u201cJury charges must outline the function of the jury, set forth the issues, correctly state the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>applicable law in understandable language, and plainly spell out how the jury should apply the legal principles to the facts as it may find them.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted.) However, \u201c[t]he trial judge\u2019s instructions must be read as a whole. So long as the charges adequately convey the law to the jury and do not mislead or confuse, we should not interfere.\u201d <em>Zappasodi v. Department of Corrections, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 89, 761 A.2d 96 (App.Div.2000)(citing <em>Sons of Thunder, Inc. v. Borden, Inc., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>396, 418, 690 A.2d 575 (1997)). Nevertheless, an improper jury instruction may require reversal if the instruction tended to confuse or mislead the jury. <em>See Conklin v. Hannoch Weisman, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>395, 409, 678 A.2d 1060 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Before applying these principles, we state the basic law regarding the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \u201c[Ejvery contract in New Jersey contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d <em>Sons of Thunder, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 420, 690 A.2d 575. Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[i]n every contract there is an implied covenant that \u2018neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract; in other words, in every contract there exists an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Palisades Properties Inc. v. Brunetti, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>117, 130, 207 A.2d 522 (1965) quoting 5 <em>Williston on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 670, pp. 159-60 (3d ed.1961). <em>See also Wilson v. Amerada, Hess Corporation, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>236, 773 A.2d 1121 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> However, \u201c[i]n the absence of a contract, there can be no breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d <em>Noye v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>430, 434, 570 A.2d 12 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>146, 584 A.2d 218 (1990). The obligation to perform in good faith exists in every contract including where the contract is terminable at will. <em>Bonczek v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>593, 599, 701 A.2d 742 (App.Div.1997), <em>certif. denied, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>51, 707 A.2d 154 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>While we have not developed a definition of good faith and fair dealing for all eases, recently our Supreme Court gave guidance in this area. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">What constitutes good faith performance and fail' dealing has been the subject of considerable analysis. For transactions involving merchants and the sale of goods, the Uniform Commercial Code has defined good faith as \u201chonesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.\u201d N.J.S.A. 12A:2-103(1)(b). The Restatement (Second) of Contracts notes that every contract imposes on each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and enforcement. <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 205 (1981). A comment to the Restatement states that \u201c[glood faith performance or enforcement of a contract emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party; it excludes a variety of types of conduct characterized as involving \u2018bad faith\u2019 because they violate community standards of decency, fairness or reasonableness.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 205 comment a (1981).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\"><em>[Wilson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 245, 773 A.2d 1121.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The Court emphasized that \u201c[b]ad motive or intention is essential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251, 773 A.2d 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">One commentator has described good faith as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">Good faith, as judges generally use the term in matters contractual, is best understood as an \u201cexcluder\u201d \u2014 a phrase with no general meaning or meanings of its own. Instead, it functions to rule out many different forms of bad faith. It is hard to get this point across to persons used to thinking that every word must have one or more general meanings of its own \u2014 must be either univoeal or ambiguous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">... In most cases the party acting in bad faith frustrates the justified expectations of another ... whether an aggrieved party\u2019s expectations are justified must inevitably vary with attendant circumstances. For these reasons it is not fi'uitful to try to generalize further. It is easy enough to formulate examples of bad faith and work from them. Besides, any general definition of good faith, if not vacuous, is sure to be unduly restrictive, especially if east in statutory form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">[Robert S. Summers, <em>\u201cGood Faith\u201d in General Contract Law and the Sales Provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, </em>54 VA. L.Rev. 195, 262-63 (1968) (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Judge Stein in his concurrence in <em>Noye, </em>noted that \u201c[t]he majority opinion does not define \u2018good faith and fair dealing\u2019---This is understandable. Concepts such as good faith and fair dealing are chameleonlike in character, necessarily assuming the colorings of the surroundings in which they find themselves.\u201d <em>Noye, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 442, 570 A.2d 12. Judge Stein suggested that the employer breaches the covenant of good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>and fair dealing \u201cwhere the employer, without an honest belief that good cause for discharge in fact exists, attempts to deprive the employee of the benefit of the employment agreement.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Other state courts have attempted to develop a definition for the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Alaska Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">This court has recognized a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in all at-will employment contracts. This covenant does not lend itself to precise definition, but it requires at a minimum that an employer not impair the right of an employee to receive the benefits of the employment agreement. We have also stated ... [t]he covenant of good faith and fair dealing ... includes an objective standard, under which the employer must act in a manner which a reasonable person would regard as fair. The covenant also includes a subjective element. An employer engages in subjective bad faith when it discharges an employee for the purpose of depriving him or her of one of the benefits of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\"><em>[Holland v. Union, Oil Co., </em>993 <em>P.</em>2d 1026, 1032 (Alaska 2000)(internal quotation marks and footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">California has developed a model jury charge for the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The relevant charge provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">In even/ contract of employment there is an implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing upon each party to the contract that neither party will engage in conduct for the purpose of, denying to the other the benefits of the contract. If any party to the contract violates that obligation, that party is in breach of the employment contract and is liable for damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">The plaintiff ... seeks to recover damages based upon a claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, arising out of a contract of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">The essential elements of such a claim are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-13\">1. There was a contract of employment between plaintiff and defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-14\">2. Plaintiffs performance, [unless excused];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-15\">3. The defendant, as employer, engaged in conduct, separate and apart from the performance of obligations under the contract, without good faith and for the purpose of depriving the plaintiff, as employee, of rights and benefits under the contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-16\">4. Such conduct caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-17\">An employer who acts in good faith on an honest but mistaken belief that discharge of an employee is required by a legitimate business reason has not breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. If you find that defendant honestly believed that the termination of plaintiff was for a legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>business reason, you must find for defendant even if defendant was mistaken in that belief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">[Cal. Jury Instr.\u2014Civ. (8th ed.) 10.35, 10.05, 10.37]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In the present case, plaintiff was an at will employee. She contended that defendant withheld her \u201creasonably expected rights to a grievance procedure entitled to her by implied contract.\u201d To be sure, an implied contract can be found based on an employment manual if the employee can show that termination procedures in the manual could reasonably be understood by an employee to create binding duties and obligations between the employer and employee. <em>Woolley v. Hoffmann-La Roche, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>284, 297-98, 491 A.2d 1257 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Consequently, plaintiff could recover damages for breach of either an implied contract and/or the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing so long as the jury found: (1) a contract existed between plaintiff and defendant; and (2) defendant breached the terms of that contract, as expressed in the employee manual; or (1) an implied contract existed between plaintiff and defendant; and (2) defendant breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The trial court began its instructions to the jury by summarizing plaintiffs allegations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">Now the plaintiff in this cause of action contends that \u2014 that she was wrongfully discharged from her position at the Kessler Institute. She says that they wrongfully \u2014 her contention is that they wrongfully breached their duty of fair dealing, a covenant of fair dealing when they discharged her and the manner in which they discharged her in \u2014 in not giving her a \u2014 a review or a-she says a hearing or some procedure to review that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">She also says that her termination violated the actual terms of her employment, her implied employment contract as outlined in an employee handbook. It gave her certain rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">While it may not be a written contract between the parties, it \u2014 it listed certain rights that she had and outlined for her and led her to believe in her mind that this was an employment contract, this booklet she had, and they violated provisions of that by not allowing her to have her grievance procedure or a grievance hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">After discussing plaintiffs claim of emotional distress, the burden of proof, direct and circumstantial evidence and credibility, the trial court then proceeded to instruct the jury regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">Every contract, there\u2019s an implied covenant of good faith and of fair dealing, and in this case the plaintiff indicates that this \u2014 the defendant violated that covenant in the \u2014 in the employment relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">The plaintiff alleges that she did not have a fair hearing or a fair grievance procedure, which in fact was actually contrary to the \u2014 the manual that\u2019s been referred t o for resolving work problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">The procedures that she relies upon are contained in the employment manual, and they provide for a grievance procedure or hearing, and as such plaintiff contends that she was terminated in violation by the company of their own manual and as such it was actually a violation of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The trial court then proceeded to instruct the jury on the implied contract claim, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">Additionally, she asserts that the defendant \u2014 that the defendant breached the employment contract. Plaintiffs claim is not based upon an individual contract that she had with the defendant but rather upon the personnel manual or employment, document that\u2019s in evidence before you, and that they violate the provisions of that \u2014 that document, and therefore she\u2019s entitled to damages for lost \u2014 and her damages are limited, as I indicated, to lost income \u2014 I will indicate is lost income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The court; then explained to the jury that it must first determine whether the manual created a contract by examining whether a reasonable employee would believe that the manual was intended to create an enforceable agreement. After explaining how to determine whether a reasonable employee would have believed that the manual included an agreement, the court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">If you \u2014 if you determine that the manual did not create a contract between the parties, then there can be no breach of a contract and the plaintiffs not entitled to damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-12\">If on the other hand you determine that the manual did create a contract between the parties, you must then make the second determination as to whether or not the \u2014 the defendant actually breached the contract or breached the terms of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-13\">The plaintiff claimed that the defendant breached the manual by terming her\u2014 by terminating her employment without giving her certain rights of review of \u2014 of that termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-14\">You must determine wheth \u2014 you must determine whether the defendants followed the progressive disciplinary procedures contained in the manual and whether or not it followed the rights of review of any termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>If the termination \u2014 if you determine that the defendant did follow the procedures, then you could \u2014 then you would find that they did not breach the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">If on the other hand you find \u2014 find that they did not follow the procedures can\u2014 contained in the manual, then, of course, you would find that they did breach the employment contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">Now if \u2014 if there is a \u2014 if you find that there is a violation of the employment agreement, that is that there was either \u2014 either the [sic] breached the covenant of fair dealing or that they failed to supply her with her rights under the employment agreement, you then must determine whether or not those \u2014 that action proximately caused her to lose income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The jury verdict sheet and the jury\u2019s responses to the relevant questions follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">1. [Did] defendant, Kessler Institute, breach its covenant of [good faith and fair dealing,] when it terminated the plaintiff and failed [to hold] a hearing under the grievance procedures?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">Yes X No _ 6-OX 5-1 _</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">2. [Did] defendant terminate the plaintiff in violation of the manual outlining the terms of her employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">Yes_ NoX 6-OX 5-1 _</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-12\">[If you] answered yes to either question # 1 or # 2, proceed to [question] # 3. If you answered no to both questions # 1 and # 2, [end] your deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-13\">3. [Did the] conduct of the defendant proximately cause loss of [earnings] to the plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-14\">Yes X No _ 6-0 X 5-1 _</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">After the charge was given to the jury, and the court asked if there were any objections, defense counsel said, \u201cI believe under the covenant of good faith and fair dealing ... the plaintiff has to prove [defendant] acted without an honest belief that there was good cause to discharge her to have a violation.\u201d The court indicated that it would not amend the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">Defendant now argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury that it needed to find bad faith on the part of the defendant in connection with its failure to process the grievance. Plaintiff asserts such an instruction is unnecessary, and that bad faith is not a \u201cnecessary element in a good faith, fair dealing action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">In our view, the jury charge was misleading and subject to confusing the jury. The trial court failed to instruct the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>an implied contract must be found before the jury could find that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing had been breached. As noted above, every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. However, before this issue is addressed, the jury should first determine if there is a contract. This was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The seriousness of the court\u2019s omission of the requirement of a contract was exacerbated by the court\u2019s decision to instruct the jury on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim before the implied contract claim. This may well have led the jury to incorrectly believe that the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim was independent of the requirement for an implied contract to exist. It is possible the jury found that an implied contract existed, that defendant did not breach that contract, but did breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It is just as likely however, that the jury found no implied contract existed and yet improperly decided the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Further, the jury could have believed it was required to find a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing as long as plaintiff was not given her grievance procedure. As noted, plaintiff testified she sent a letter requesting a grievance hearing and called, but never spoke to anyone about it. Defendant presented evidence that it never received the request. The charge to the jury failed to explain that defendant must have received the grievance notice and refused to respond to plaintiff in order to find a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The charge as given allowed the jury to return a verdict in favor of plaintiff even if it believed both that plaintiff requested the grievance hearing and that defendant did not receive plaintiffs request, or that defendant did receive plaintiffs request and negligently failed to respond. In sum, we conclude the jury instructions had the clear capacity to mislead the jury and produce an unjust result.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>We add one'additional point. As noted, there is no model jury-charge for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The trial court\u2019s instructions on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim failed to inform the jury of the elements of such a claim, stating only that \u201cplaintiff contends that she was terminated in violation by the company of their own manual and as such it was actually a violation of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d At retrial, the court should expand upon the meaning of good faith and fair dealing to make clear that \u201cbad motive or intention is essential.\u201d This may be accomplished by referring to the definition of good faith in the UCC (good faith means honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned), or by using the definition adopted by the Alaska Supreme Court, or by adopting Judge Stein\u2019s suggested instruction in <em>Noye </em>that defendant acted without an honest belief that there was good cause for failing to give plaintiff a grievance hearing. Further, the definition may be expanded to include a reference to defendant acting in bad faith. We recommend the Supreme Court Committee on Model Civil Jury Charges consider developing a model jury charge for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Defendant next argues that the trial court erred in failing to require the jury to find, as a condition to an award of money damages, that defendant\u2019s decision to terminate plaintiff likely would have been reversed, if plaintiff had been provided a grievance hearing. Defendant urges that because the jury was never required to make that finding, there is no evidence that defendant\u2019s failure to process plaintiffs grievance was the proximate cause of her lost earnings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Generally, a plaintiff who is awarded a verdict for breach of contract is entitled to compensatory damages for such losses as may fairly be considered to have arisen naturally from the defendant\u2019s breach of contract. <em>Pickett v. Lloyd\u2019s, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>457, 474, 621 A.2d 445 (1993); <em>see also Model Jury Charge (Civil), </em>\u00a7 6.18 (1993). The measure of damages for breach of an implied employment contract consists of lost wages, including future lost wages. <em>Preston v. Claridge Hotel &amp; Casino, Ltd., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>81, 88, 555 A.2d 12 (App.Div.1989). In <em>Sons of Thunder, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that \u201clost profits are an appropriate remedy when a buyer breaches the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d <em>Sons of Thunder, Inc., </em>supra, 148 <em>N.J. </em>at 425, 690 A.2d 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Applying these principles here, we find no fault with the court\u2019s instruction on proximate cause. The court charged the jury that if it should find defendant either breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing or breached the implied contract, then it must determine whether that breach proximately caused plaintiff to lose income. The court correctly defined proximate cause, stating that it requires both \u201cbut for\u201d causation and that defendant was the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing plaintiff\u2019s loss. Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">Now if \u2014 if there is a \u2014 if you find that there is a violation of the employment agreement, that is that there was either \u2014 either the [sic I breached the covenant of fair dealing or that they failed to supply her with her rights under the employment agreement, you then must determine whether or not those \u2014 that action proximalely caused her to lose income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">Now by proximate cause the basic question for you to resolve is whether the plaintiff would have lost \u2014 whether the plaintiffs loss of income is so connected with the breach of the employment agreement of the plain \u2014 by the plain \u2014 by the defendant that it\u2019s reasonable to hold the defendant either wholly or partially responsible for that loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">By proximate cause I refer to a cause that in the natural and continuance sequence produces that loss and that withouf^-without that particular conduct there would have been no \u2014 no loss or no loss would have occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">A \u2014 a person is held responsible for \u2014 for any loss that results in the ordinary course of events from his or her conduct. This means you must first find that the resulting loss would not have occurred but for the conduct of the defendant, and second, you must find that the conduct of the defendant was substantial factor in bringing about the resulting loss to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">In our view, defendant fails to recognize that the pertinent inquiry was whether defendant\u2019s behavior in failing to provide plaintiff with a hearing or grievance procedure proximately caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>her injury. If defendant acted to deprive defendant of a grievance hearing, the remedy of furnishing plaintiff with a fair hearing several years later would not make plaintiff whole. Beyond that, if defendant were found to have breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to follow the grievance procedure, one would not expect defendant to provide plaintiff with a fair grievance hearing. Thus, once the jury determined defendant breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and that breach proximately caused plaintiff monetary damages, defendant was liable to plaintiff for her reasonable losses arising from that breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Defendant claims the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) because the clear weight of the evidence showed that plaintiff failed to mitigate damages. Defendant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">A trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for JNOV shall not be reversed unless it \u201cclearly appears that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-1. Our review must focus on whether the evidence submitted to the jury, and any legitimate inferences which can be drawn from that evidence, support the jury verdict. <em>Sons of Thunder, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 415, 690 A.2d 575; <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5-6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969). A jury\u2019s factual determinations will be disturbed only if a reviewing court finds that the jury could not have reasonably used the evidence to reach its verdict. <em>Sons of Thunder, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 415, 690 A.2d 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">In a wrongful discharge case, an employer is permitted to reduce its damages by showing that the employee has earned wages from another employer or could have secured other employment by reasonable efforts. <em>Sandler v. Lawn-A-Mat Chem. &amp; Equip. Corp., </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 455, 358 A.2d 805 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>503, 366 A.2d 658 (1976); <em>Roselle v. La Fera </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>Contracting Co., </em>18 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19, 28, 86 A.2d 449 (Ch.Div.1952). However, mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense, and the defendant has the burden of proving the appropriateness of its application. <em>Goodman v. London Metals Exch., Inc., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>19, 40, 429 A.2d 341 (1981). Defendant may show that a plaintiff has failed to mitigate his or her damages by introducing evidence that: (1) plaintiff made no effort or no reasonable effort to secure employment; and (2) other employment opportunities were available that were comparable to the position that the plaintiff lost. <em>Id. </em>at 34-40, 429 A.2d 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Here, plaintiff testified that she is currently unemployed, has not worked since defendant fired her in April 1996, but that she applied for two positions after she was terminated. She also testified she has been severely depressed since the loss of her job. Thus, when she applied for the jobs and had to take application tests, her \u201cmind [was] not there.\u201d She also testified that she did not think she could \u201chold down a job.\u201d At the time plaintiff was terminated, she earned $26,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In light of plaintiffs testimony, the jury could reasonably have concluded that given her mental state plaintiff made reasonable efforts to secure employment. The jury could have concluded that, in her condition, her application for two jobs constituted a reasonable effort. Moreover, as plaintiff points out, she sought $104,000 in lost wages (because she has been unemployed for four and one-half years), but the jury only awarded her $65,000, or approximately two and one half years of her lost salary. Thus, the jury did reduce plaintiffs damages and considered the reasonableness of her job search effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Defendant next argues the trial court erred in permitting plaintiff to recover a verdict for lost wages because her sole remedy was to seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We find this contention is clearly without merit and requires no discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(C). Suffice it to say, this was a breach of contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>claim and not subject to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 to -142.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
