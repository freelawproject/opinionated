The effect of the decision of the Board of Review was that Mullarney was ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits because he had left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to the work. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5. In addition, he was required to refund $10,140 in benefits previously paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Mullarney was employed as a case manager by Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in Hamilton Township. That position required a nursing license, which Mullarney possessed. In early 1998, he was suffering from a major depression. On March 26, 1998, Mullarney took a discarded medication patch from a trash can. The patch contained fentanyl, which he knew to be a powerful narcotic. He took the patch home, extracted the narcotic, mixed it with water and injected himself with the resultant solution. He claimed that it was his purpose to commit suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Mullarney lost consciousness. He awoke to find himself surrounded by police and emergency personnel. He was charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance, and incarcerated in the Middlesex County Jail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the charges were resolved, Mullarney underwent psychiatric treatment for major depression at Hampton Hospital. During his incarceration and subsequent hospitalization, Mullarney remained in contact with his employer, advising that he would be out of work due to his illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Mullarney applied for, and received, state temporary disability benefits until September 9, 1998. The State Board of Nursing (the Board) began an investigation as a result of the attempt to commit suicide by overdosing on a narcotic. The Board requested Mullarney to voluntarily relinquish his license while the investigation was pending. He claimed that the Board advised him that if he did not surrender his license voluntarily, the Board would compel him to do so. Consequently, during the first week of May, 1998, shortly after his release from the hospital, Mullarney mailed his license to the Board. Shortly thereafter, he received a letter from the hospital, dated April 30, 1998, stating that he would be terminated from his employment, because he no longer qualified for the position since he had voluntarily relinquished his license. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>On July 2, 1998, the Board suspended his license for two years, effective March 28,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">When Mullarney\u2019s temporary disability benefits ended, he thought he had recovered to the point where he could resume working. Indeed, he said his physician advised him that it was safe to do so. Accordingly, unable to find employment, Mullarney applied for unemployment compensation benefits on September 20, 1998, and collected benefits for the weeks ending September 26,1998, through March 20,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The Deputy Director determined that Mullarney was disqualified from unemployment benefits effective March 1998 because he \u201cleft work voluntarily.\u201d The basis of that determination was the fact that his employment required a license as a prerequisite of employment, and that his \u201c[ejmployment ended when [he] lost this license for committing a voluntary act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The Deputy Director further determined that Mullarney was aware that his actions could jeopardize his license, and, consequently, his separation was considered to be a voluntary quit without good cause attributable to the work, disqualifying him from benefits. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5. Mullarney appealed to the Appeal Tribunal, which reversed, concluding that Mullarney\u2019s act of attempting to commit suicide, which resulted from his diagnosed illness of major depression, did not constitute a \u201cvoluntary foolish act\u201d barring him from receiving unemployment benefits. A claims supervisor appealed that decision to the Board of Review, which reversed the Appeal Tribunal concluding that Mullarney had taken the drug home to inject it, rather than spontaneously doing so at work, affording him \u201cample time to reflect on his actions and consider their consequences.\u201d The Board further concluded that \u201c[e]ven if it argued that his depressive state clouded his judgment, we are not persuaded that it compelled him to illegally obtain a controlled dangerous substance from his employer, which jeopardized his license and his job.\u201d Finally, the Board concluded that Mullarney\u2019s voluntary actions resulted in the loss of his license, which was a prerequisite for his employment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The Board determined that not only was Mullarney ineligible for benefits, but was also responsible to refund $10,140 in benefits he received for the weeks ending September 26, 1998 through March 20,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">On this appeal, Mullarney argues, as follows: (1) the Board erred in concluding that <em>Yardville Supply Co. v. Board of Review, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>371, 554 A.2d 1337 (1989) is controlling; (2) the Board erred in holding Mullarney\u2019s actions to be voluntary based upon the time delay between taking the drug and attempting suicide, and (3) the Board erred in concluding that Mullarney was responsible for reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Our scope of review of the decisions of an administrative agency is quite limited. If the Board\u2019s factual determinations are supported by sufficient credible evidence, we must accept them. <em>Brady v. Board of Review, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>197, 210, 704 A.2d 547 (1997). We may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency, even though we may have reached a different result. <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, we may not disturb the agency\u2019s decision unless we conclude that it was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, our scope of review of an agency decision is restricted to the following four inquiries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">(1) Whether the agency\u2019s decision offends the State or Federal Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">(2) Whether the agency\u2019s action violates express or implied legislative policies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">(3) Whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the findings on which the agency based its actions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">(4) Whether in applying the legislative policies to the facts, the agency clearly erred in reaching a conclusion that could not reasonably have been made on a showing of the relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 210-11, 704 A.2d 547]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-11\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-12\">\u201cAn individual shall be disqualified for benefits: For the week in which the individual has left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to such work, and for each week thereafter until the individual becomes reemployed and works four (4) weeks in employment which may include employment for the federal government and has earned in employment at least six (6) times the individual\u2019s weekly benefit rate, as determined in each case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Our Supreme Court has held that \u201c[w]here it is reasonably foreseeable that an employee\u2019s voluntary eonduet will render him unemployable, and his actions actually do lead to the loss of a prerequisite of employment, the employee leaves work \u2018voluntarily\u2019 without good cause attributable to such work under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(a).\u201d <em>Yardville Supply Co. v. Board of Review, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 377, 554 A.2d 1337. In <em>Yardville, </em>the employee, a truck driver, had lost his driver\u2019s license after being convicted of driving while intoxicated. <em>Id. </em>at 872, 554 A.2d 1337. The Court held that his unemployment was traceable directly to conduct for which he was responsible, namely, his decision to drink and drive. <em>Id. </em>at 376, 554 A.2d 1337. The Court further held that he made that decision despite the knowledge that by risking his driving privileges, he was endangering his livelihood as a truck driver. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Here, the Board could reasonably conclude that Mullarney\u2019s decision to take the discarded narcotic patch was also a voluntary act, and it was reasonably foreseeable that the loss of his nursing license could result from his voluntary conduct. We reject his contention that his acts should not be considered voluntary because they were done in the midst of a mental health crisis. It was within the purview of the Board to reject that contention. The Board determined that since Mullarney took the drug home he had ample time to reflect on his actions and consider their consequences. It ultimately concluded that even if Mullarney\u2019s depressive state clouded his judgment, it was not persuaded that it compelled him to illegally obtain a controlled dangerous substance from his employer. That inference could reasonably have been drawn from the evidence presented. Thus, given our limited scope of review of the factual determinations of the Board, we accept its conclusion. Consequently, we find that the Board\u2019s determination that Mullarney had left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to the work is supported by the record, and we affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Mullarney claims that the taking of the narcotic patch was a product of his mental illness, designed solely to facilitate his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>efforts to commit suicide, and he did not comprehend that his actions could result in the loss of employment. Thus, he claims that he did not abandon or leave employment. We reject that contention. To be sure, an employee who is unable to work because of illness and makes an attempt to protect his or her employment is not considered to have left work voluntarily, and is, therefore, entitled to benefits. <em>Yardville Supply Co., supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 375-76, 554 A.2d 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In essence, Mullarney contends that his illness caused him to take the narcotic patch. He claims that the Board\u2019s conclusion that there was ample time for him to reflect on his actions and consider their consequences is not supported by record, and also claims that that conclusion is not supported by medical proof present in the record. Mullarney misperceives the burden of proof. An unemployment compensation claimant has the burden of proving an entitlement to benefits. <em>Brady v. Board of Review, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>197, 218, 704 A.2d 547 (1997). Thus, it was Mullarney\u2019s burden to prove that he left the job for good cause attributable to the work. Consequently, Mullarney also had the burden of proving his contention that his mental illness so affected his judgment that he was incapable of realizing that the unauthorized taking of the narcotic patch was illegal, could jeopardize his license, and, consequently, his employment. That contention is so esoteric that a fact-finder of common judgment and experience cannot form a valid judgment on the contention without the assistance of expert testimony. <em>State v. Jones, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174, 185, 705 A.2d 805 (App.Div.), <em>certif. den. </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>380, 718 A.2d 1209 (1998). It was Mullarney\u2019s burden to supply the requisite expert proof. Suffice it to say the record supports the Board\u2019s decision to reject Mullarney\u2019s contention that his illness compelled him to illegally obtain the narcotic patch, which ultimately caused the loss of his license and his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">We next consider Mullarney\u2019s contention that the \u201cDepartment of Labor must waive any recovery of overpayment pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:17-14.2\u201d because he was \u201cdisabled and no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>able to work.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:17-14.2 allows an unemployment compensation claimant to request a full waiver of recovery of an overpayment of benefits if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the claimant did not misrepresent or withhold any material fact in obtaining benefits, and the claimant is deceased or permanently disabled and no longer able to work. The regulation also provides that a claimant\u2019s \u201ccurrent receipt of Social Security Disability benefits may be deemed evidence of current permanent disability.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:17-14.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Apparently, until Mullarney filed his appellate brief he never advised the Division of Unemployment Compensation that on May 29, 1999 he had been awarded Social Security Disability benefits (SSD), retroactive to September 1998. We are troubled by his failure to reveal that fact while his administrative appeals were pending, particularly since he received unemployment compensation benefits for the same period of time he was receiving SSD benefits. At his hearing before the Appeal Tribunal, Mullarney stated, in response to a question from the Appeals Examiner, \u201cthat his psychiatrist advised him that he was not able to work and that he had a letter to that effect.\u201d In response to the Appeal Examiner\u2019s request to supply the letter, Dr. Carlo J. Baril sent a letter to the Appeal Examiner, dated August 10,1999, opining that Mullarney was \u201cseverely depressed, despondent, unable to function.\u201d Baril also noted that he had recommended that Mullarney \u201capply for [SSD].\u201d Thus, the Department of Labor was on notice that Mullarney might apply for SSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">We recognize that there is support for the Board\u2019s implicit rejection of Mullarney\u2019s present claim that he is permanently disabled. Indeed, Mullarney testified before the Appeal Tribunal that he had sufficiently recovered from his depression after the exhaustion of his temporary disability benefits and was able to seek employment at that time. We further acknowledge that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:17-14.2(a)(1) disallows a waiver of recovery of an overpayment of benefits if the claimant misrepresented or withheld \u201cany material fact in obtaining benefits.\u201d As previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>noted, we are troubled by Mullarney\u2019s failure to state that he was receiving SSD benefits. Nevertheless, he appears to be disabled, and, even though the letter was sent to the Appeal Examiner, and presumably considered by the Division before ordering reimbursement, we believe the question of a waiver of recovery should be decided in the first instance, by the Division, applying its expertise. In addition, we prefer to have the benefit of a full record, to be developed on remand for any further review. Of course, if it so desires the Division is entitled to require Mullarney to submit to an impartial physical examination by a physician of its choosing. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:17-14.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Affirmed in part, and remanded to the Division of Unemployment Compensation for consideration of Mullarney\u2019s contention that the claim for reimbursement of benefits should be waived. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> It is unclear whether he was released on April 2, 1998 or April 7, 1998. In addition, the disposition of the criminal charges is unclear.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
