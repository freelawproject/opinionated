He lived with his parents in Seoul, South Korea until December 1996, when he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle in Tenafly. The Tenafly Board of Education does not dispute P.B.K.\u2019s domicile in Tenafly or E.Y.\u2019s residence with P.B.K. It was also conceded that P.B.K. w\u2019as supporting E.Y. without assistance from E.Y.\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">At the time of his arrival in December 1996, E.Y. was fifteen years old. Within the same month P.B.K. sought to enroll his nephew in the ninth grade of the Tenafly School District. The school district gave him \u201cschool affidavit forms\u201d for both P.B.K. and E.Y.\u2019s parents to fill out and submit. In response to the question on the form as to why E.Y. was not living with his parents, the answer given both by P.B.K. and E.Y.\u2019s father was that the parents resided in South Korea and E.Y. wanted to continue his education in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">By letter of January 8, 1997, the Board of Education rejected E.Y.\u2019s enrollment in the Tenafly school system because, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>desire to be educated in the United States is not a \u2018personal or financial hardship\u2019\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-1(a). P.B.K. then petitioned the Commissioner of the Department of Education (\u201cCommissioner\u201d), seeking immediate access for E.Y. to the Tenafly Public School System pending appeal and final determination of his right to a free education within the school district. In accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-1(b) E.Y. was enrolled in the Tenafly school on March 5, 1997, pending outcome of the petition. The Commissioner transferred the matter to the Office of Administrative Law for a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) as a contested case pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B to -15 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14F-1 to -13.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Prior to the scheduled hearing, the Tenafly Board of Education filed a motion for summary decision. After receipt of briefs from the parties, the ALJ denied Tenafly\u2019s motion. However, she elected to treat P.B.K.\u2019s request for relief as a cross-motion for summary disposition and ordered that E.Y. be admitted to the Tenafly school district for a free public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The ALJ set forth the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">In this ease[,] E.Y. has relatives domiciled in the United States who are willing to support him gratis, and [it is] this fact, more than a specific desire to go to school in Tenafly, that has dictated E.Y.\u2019s choice of residence. Indeed, the fact that residency was established in Tenafly is purely happenstance. If his uncle had resided in Leonia, for example, E.Y. would have enrolled in that school district. Thus, I FIND E.Y. is not seeking to be educated in Tenafly solely for the purpose of receiving a free education within the district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">I FIND that E.Y. has met the requirements of the \u201caffidavit student\u201d law as articulated by the Commissioner in <em>[Gunderson v. City of Brigantine Bd. of Educ., </em>95 <em>N.J.A.R.2d </em>(EDU) 39, 1994 WL 760538] E.Y. has no home, or possibility of school attendance, other than with the non-parent district resident and ... such resident is for all intents and purposes the sole caretaker and supporter of the child. <em>Ibid. </em>It is undisputed that the petitioner has taken full charge of E.Y.\u2019s welfare, and is currently in the process of obtaining guardianship over E.Y. As noted by petitioner, E.Y. would otherwise have no entitlement to an education anywhere in the U.S.. The spirit of the law in this case should control over the letter, for to hold otherwise would work a substantial injustice by harming a party the legislature never meant to penalize, and would subvert the state\u2019s interest in providing an education for its children. For the foregoing reasons, I CONCLUDE that E.Y. is entitled to admittance in the respondent\u2019s school district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The Tenafly Board of Education filed exceptions to the ALJ decision with the Commissioner. On October 14, 1997 the Commissioner reversed the decision of the ALJ and directed that P.B.K. remit tuition pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:16-1 to the Tenafly Board of Education prorated to the first date of E.Y.\u2019s attendance at a Tenafly school. The decision reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">Initially, the Commissioner concurs with the ALJ\u2019s and the Board\u2019s view that, since petitioner has not brought forth proof that he has gained legal custody of his nephew, then E.Y. cannot be found to be domiciled with him, since the domicile of an unemancipated minor follows that of the parent or guardian having legal control over him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">Here, both petitioner and E.Y.\u2019s parents have specifically affirmed that E.Y. is living with his uncle because he \u201cwants to continue his education in the United States.\u201d Further, as the Board noted in its exceptions, petitioner has not established, nor has he even claimed, that E.Y.\u2019s parents, due to family or economic hardship, are not presently capable of supporting or providing care for E.Y.; instead, petitioner incorrectly argues that this provision of the statute is inapplicable in this matter. In this regard, the Commissioner is cognizant of the Slate Board\u2019s recent guidance concerning a petitioner\u2019s burden to demonstrate family or economic hardship in order to fulfill the requirements of the affidavit student statute. The Slate Board has specifically provided that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">... in order to satisfy that standard, the family or economic hardship must be real and demonstrable, evincing a current incapability on the part of [the minor child\u2019s] parents to support him or provide him care as the result of that hardship. | J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">Accordingly, the initial decision of the ALJ determining that E.Y. is entitled to admittance in the Board\u2019s district is reversed. Further, with respect to the ALJ\u2019s statement that absent a conclusion that E.Y. is entitled to admittance in the Board\u2019s district, E.Y. \u201c * \u2019 * would otherwise have no entitlement to an education anywhere in the U.S.[,]\u201d the Commissioner notes that, should E.Y.\u2019s parents wish to procure an education for their son in a school district in New Jersey, they may presumably do so, with the consent of the local board, by paying the necessary tuition, in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-3. Having determined, however, that petitioner fails to meet the relevant statutory requirements, the Commissioner cannot find that E.Y. is entitled to a <em>free </em>education .. (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">On November 12, 1997, P.B.K. appealed to the State Board of Education (\u201cState Board\u201d). While the appeal was pending, the Tenafly Board of Education wrote P.B.K. on February 2, 1998, demanding reimbursement for tuition in the amount of $9,560.94, in lieu of which E.Y. would be removed from school. On applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>tion of P B.K. the State Board stayed the decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">After the State Board granted P.B.K.\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal, an affidavit of E.Y.\u2019s father was provided stating that E.Y. had attended a private international school in Seoul until his father lost his job. The family of four lived off their savings for two years until the father became re-employed at a substantially lower salary. E.Y. matriculated from middle school, but the cost for further attendance at the international school was $15,000 per year. Since his father was making only $27,500 per year, he was unable to pay that sum for E.Y.\u2019s schooling. The father further certified that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">The public high school in Seoul is not an option due to the fact that E.Y. -is an American citizen and because he had attended the international middle school. At the international school, he had been instructed in English, and the curriculum and cultural environment were substantially different from that in the public school. E.Y. does not have the foundation in the Korean language necessary to succeed at an advanced educational level in the public school. His status as an American citizen is cause for harassment at the hands of students at the public school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">Thus, the family was faced with the prospect of not being able to provide our son with a proper education due to economic hardship. Although I am employed, my salary is not sufficient enough to be able to pay the international school tuition while providing for the other needs of my family. My wife does not work outside the home.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">It never was our intention to have E.Y. attend high school in the United States. Had it not been for the extended period for which I was unemployed, and my inability to obtain a new job at my former salary, E.Y. would have been continuing his education at the international school. It was solely for the reason of economic hardship that E.Y. moved to Tenafly to live with his uncle, who has obtained legal guardianship of him. E.Y. continuously has been living in Tenafly since December 1996. Neither his mother nor I wanted to break up our family but we believed it was the only thing we could do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Also submitted in supplementation of the record were Letters of Guardianship from the Bergen County Surrogate issued on June 11, 1997, prior to the decision of the Commissioner, appointing P.B.K. as guardian of E.Y. A form supplied to the Bergen County Surrogate indicated the father\u2019s assent to the appointment of P.B.K. as guardian for E.Y. The form was notarized on January 21, 1997, about a month after E.Y. came to live with P.B.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>On January 5, 2000, the State Board reversed the Commissioner, reasoning that since P.B.K. had been domiciled in Tenafly during all relevant times and P.B.K. was appointed E.Y.\u2019s legal guardian on June 11, 1997, the child was entitled to a free public education pursuant to <em>N.J.SA </em>18A:38-la. With regard to the time period between December 1996, when E.Y. began living with P.B.K. in Tenafly, and June 11, 1997, when P.B.K. was appointed E.Y.\u2019s legal guardian, the State Board held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">Given the unique circumstances before us on the basis of the record as supplemented, we conclude that the petitioner has demonstrated that E.Y.\u2019s parents were not capable of supporting or providing care for him due to a family or economic hardship and that E.Y. was not residing with the petitioner solely for the purpose of receiving a free public education in the district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">Consequently, on the basis of the record as supplemented on appeal, we conclude that E.Y. was entitled to a free public education in the Tenafly school district commencing in December 1996, when he began to live with the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">On appeal the Tenafly Board of Education presents the following issues for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\"><em>POINT </em>/ \u2014 PETITIONER HAS FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE A \u201cFAMILY OR ECONOMIC HARDSHIP\u201d AS REQUIRED IN <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-l(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\"><em>POINT </em>// \u2014 PETITIONER SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD IN THIS MATTER SINCE PETITIONER DID NOT OFFER NEW EVIDENCE THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THE COMMISSIONER DECIDED THIS MATTER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\"><em>POINT </em>/// \u2014 THE LETTER OF GUARDIANSHIP IS NOT DETERMINATIVE OF THE STUDENT\u2019S RIGHT TO A FREE EDUCATION IN TENAFLY PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\"><em>POINT </em>/V \u2014 APPELLANT IS ENTITLED TO TUITION FOR THE STUDENT\u2019S ATTENDANCE IN TENAFLY PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">By order of September 6, 2000, we granted the motion of the New Jersey School Boards Association (\u201cNJSBA\u201d) to appear as <em>amicus curiae. </em>It submits the following arguments to us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\"><em>POINT </em>/ \u2014 THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION\u2019S CONCLUSION THAT THE PETITIONER DEMONSTRATED THAT E.Y.\u2019S PARENTS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING OR PROVIDING CARE FOR E.Y. IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE FACTS. THIS CONCLUSION EVISCERATES THE STATUTORY STANDARD REGARDING HARDSHIP CONTRARY TO THE LEGISLATURE\u2019S EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE STATUTORY STANDARD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-14\"><em>POINT </em>// \u2014 INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE RELATIVE QUALITY OF EDUCATION RECEIVED IN ONE EDUCATIONAL SETTING VERSUS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>ANOTHER HAVE NO PLACE IN HARDSHIP DETERMINATIONS UNDER THE AFFIDAVIT PUPIL STATUTE. INSOFAR AS THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION HAS ERRONEOUSLY CREATED A NEW HARDSHIP STANDARD TAKING SUCH CONSIDERATIONS INTO ACCOUNT, THE STATE BOARD\u2019S DECISION IS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS AND MUST BE REVERSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\"><em>POINT </em>/// \u2014 ASSUMING, <em>ARGUENDO, </em>THAT A FAMILY OR ECONOMIC HARDSHIP EXISTED IN THE PRESENT CASE, EVEN UNDER THE DILUTED STATUTORY HARDSHIP STANDARD, E.Y. WAS NOT ENTITLED TO TUITION-FREE ENROLLMENT IN THE TENAFLY PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT AS AN AFFIDAVIT PUPIL. THEREFORE, THE STATE BOARD\u2019S DECISION MUST BE REVERSED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We find no abuse of discretion in the decision of the State Board to permit P.B.K. to supplement the record. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:21-1.9 permits supplementation \u201cif at any time during the pendency of the appeal ... it appears that the evidence unadduced at the proceedings below may be material to the issues on appeal ...\u201d Ample justification was given by the State Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">In response to exceptions filed by the Tenafly Board to the report of our Legal Committee, we note that our review of this matter is not limited to consideration of the documents which the petitioner had provided to the Board at the time he was attempting to enroll E.Y. in the district. Rather, the issue before us is whether\u2014 on the basis of the entire record developed during these proceedings \u2014 E.Y. was entitled to a free public education in the Tenafly district under the standard set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A38-1. We reiterate in that regard that the petitioner had not filed a motion for summary decision with the ALJ. Rather, the ALJ treated the petitioner\u2019s claim for relief as a motion for summary decision and determined on the basis of the record before [her] that the petitioner had established E.Y.\u2019s entitlement to attend school in Tenafly. Hence, the petitioner had not submitted documents in support of such a motion during the proceedings in the Office of Administrative Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">Moreover, in any event, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:2-1.9 expressly authorizes the State Board to direct supplementation of the record if \u201c[a]t any time during the pendency of the appeal ... it appears that evidence unadduced at the proceedings below may be material to the issues on appeal ...\u201d By decision dated April 1, 1998, we granted the petitioner\u2019s request to supplement the record with, <em>inter alia, </em>the affidavit of E.Y.\u2019s father. Such document was, therefore, part of the record before us during our review of the merits of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">In considering Tenafly\u2019s substantive arguments, we focus on the governing statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-1, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Public schools shall be free to the following persons over five and under twenty years of age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">a. Any person who is domiciled within the school district;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">b. (1) Any person who is kept in the home of another person domiciled within the school district and is supported by such other person gratis as if he were such other person\u2019s own child, upon filing by such other person with the secretary of the school board of education of the district, if so required by the board, a sworn statement that he is domiciled within the district and is supporting the child gratis and will assume all personal obligations for the child relative to school requirements and that he intends so to keep and support the child for longer than merely through the school term, and a copy of a lease if a tenant, or a sworn statement by his landlord acknowledging his tenancy if residing as a tenant without a written lease, and upon filing by the child\u2019s parent or guardian with the secretary of the board of education a sworn statement that he is not capable of supporting or providing care for the child due to family or economic hardship and that the child is not residing with the resident of the district solely for the purpose of receiving a free public education within the district. ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">For purposes of subsection (a) the domicile of an unemancipated child is the domicile of the parent, custodian or guardian. <em>Bd. of Educ. of Summit v. Millburn Twp. Bd. of Educ., </em>95 <em>N.J. Admin.2d </em>(EDU) 506 (1994); <em>Clifton Bd. of Educ. v. Sauro, </em>96 <em>N.J. Admin.2d </em>(EDU) 497, 500 (1996) (citing <em>Mansfield Twp. v. State Bd. of Educ., </em>101 <em>N.J.L. </em>474, 478, 129 <em>A. </em>765 (Sup.Ct.1925)). The Tenafly Board admits that E.Y. resided with P.B.K. beginning in December 1996. It does not challenge that Letters of Guardianship were granted to P.B.K. for E.Y. in June 1997, or that steps were taken toward formal guardianship as early as January 1997. Rather, the Tenafly Board contends that legal guardianship is not dispositive because guardianship was undertaken solely to enable E.Y. to attend the Tenafly public schools without cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">No such factual findings were made by the State Board, and the record does not command such a conclusion. This is not an instance when a child and the parents or guardian establish a convenient residence in another school district to take advantage of academic or athletic programs. No other school in the United States existed for E.Y. other than the school district of his uncle and guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Without specifically so stating, the Tenafly Board invites us to imply a fraudulent design by P.B.K. in obtaining the letters of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>guardianship for E.Y. We decline to do so. The record does not support fraud or deception. With E.Y.\u2019s parents over half a world away, ample reason existed for a formal guardianship aside from satisfying the conditions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We therefore concur with the determination of the State Board that P.B.K. was entitled to a free education in the Tenafly school district from and after June 11, 1997, the date of the issuance of Letters of Guardianship to P.B.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The remaining issue relates to the time frame between December 1996, when E.Y. began living with P.B.K. and the date of the formal guardianship. The State Board correctly noted that the issue is to be determined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-1(b), which requires a showing by the child\u2019s parent or guardian that he or she is incapable of caring for the child due to \u201cfamily or economic hardship\u201d and that the child is not residing in the district solely for purposes of receiving a free public education in the district. <em>See Gunderson, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. Admin.2d </em>(EDU) 39 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The language \u201cfamily or economic hardship\u201d was added by amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-1 by P.L.1993, c. 380. The statement by the sponsor to the amendment indicated that the purpose was \u201cto ease the burden on local boards of education attempting to remove illegally enrolled students.\u201d <em>Gunderson, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. Admin.2d </em>(EDU) at 42. Clearly it was directed at instances where the student is living with a parent or guardian claiming to be but not actually domiciled in the school district or, alternatively, where a child is placed with a person other than the parent or guardian to obtain the benefit of a free education in that district. Certainly it did not address this situation where, accepting the Tenafly Board\u2019s argument, E.Y. will be left as a student without a school even though a resident domiciliary. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Administrative case law tends to support the decision of the State Board. In <em>D.K.S. and K.S.S., ex rel H.I.L. v. Bd. of Educ. of Fort Lee, </em>Agency Dkt. No. 43-3/99,1999 WL 609259, the Commissioner held that a family hardship which made it \u201cdifficult for the parents to properly provide care and stability for the child,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>qualified under the statute. In a case with a similar factual scenario the Commissioner also held that a Korean student qualified for a free education when his parents were unable to move to the United States and \u201cprovide [him with] the privileges of an American citizen including the intimate knowledge of American culture and heritage while they [lived] in Korea.\u201d <em>R.C.P., ex rel A.S.K. v. Bd. of Educ. of the Ramapo Indian Hills Reg\u2019l High Sch. Dist., </em>Agency Dkt. No. 247-8/99, 2000 WL 869427.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In this instance E.Y.\u2019s father certified that he lost his job, was unemployed for two years, and that when he finally obtained employment with a significant loss of income he could not provide for his family and keep E.Y. in the private international school. He also explained the significant problems E.Y. would face as a student in a Korean school.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">We find that there is substantial credible evidence in the record to uphold the determination of the State Board that E.Y. qualified for a free education under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:31-1(b) as well as subsection (a) of the statute. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(D); <em>Dore v. Bedminster Twp. Bd. of Educ., </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>447, 453, 449 A.2d 547 (App.Div. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The remaining arguments made in favor of reversal of the State Board are without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
