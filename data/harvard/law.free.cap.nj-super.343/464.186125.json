(\u201cGMI\u201d), from the previous owners, the Stickling family. Kaye became president of GMI, and defendant served as vice-president. A management agreement was adopted in which the Sticklings would remain the owners of GMI and have two seats on the Board of Directors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, they agreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>NCF would receive <em>1% </em>of GMI\u2019s \u201c \u2018shipments\u2019 as a \u2018management fee.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">GMI\u2019s main business from 1988 to 1991 was developing a manufacturing method for mainframe computer parts for IBM, GMI\u2019s principal customer. Kaye was responsible for managing the company, while defendant handled sales and manufacturing. Because GMI focused on research and development and had few sales, it was only marginally profitable at first.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In April 1988, Carol Capuano (\u201cCapuano\u201d) was hired as GMI\u2019s financial manager, with responsibility for the company\u2019s finances, including accounts payable, billing, reports, income statements, tax returns and preparation of checks for tax payments. She also helped set up the company\u2019s accounting program. From 1988 to 1991, Kaye was responsible for overseeing the payment of all taxes, including state unemployment insurance taxes and employee withholding taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In 1991, GMI\u2019s performance improved dramatically because IBM was buying most of the mainframe parts it manufactured. Further, defendant testified that a dispute concerning the Stick-lings\u2019 use of funds led to a settlement agreement whereby the Sticklings resigned from the Board, and GMI Holding, Inc. acquired the right to appoint directors and officers. Thereafter, defendant unilaterally appointed himself president of GMI in February 1991. Kaye testified that he accepted defendant\u2019s appointment because the company was \u201cstarting to do well,\u201d while Capuano testified that defendant told her that Kaye was pushed out as president because the Sticklings were dissatisfied with his performance. In any event, Capuano testified that when defendant became president, \u201che took over personnel and all the financial responsibility\u201d because Kaye was often absent from work. Prior to defendant\u2019s appointment, Capuano sought Kaye\u2019s authorization to make any payments required in the course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">In April 1991, defendant moved the company's accounts to a new bank and excluded Kaye as a signatory from the general operating account. As a result, Kaye no longer saw corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>bank statements, did not write checks on the general account, and signed only payroll and occasionally vendor checks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Capuano testified that she needed defendant\u2019s approval for all GMI payments, including taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Defendant denied having control over the finances of GMI. He testified that when GMI Holding, Inc. was authorized to appoint directors and officers, Capuano was appointed to the position of treasurer and that \u201cshe would now take over the responsibility of accounting on a higher level.\u201d He further stated that it was Capuano who was in \u201ctotal control\u201d of all records and accounting books. Defendant explained that not including a money market account, Capuano was authorized to access and transfer funds from all other accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">During the first, second and third quarters of 1991, and the first and second quarters of 1992, GMI failed to make unemployment and disability payments to the New Jersey Department of Labor totaling $82,543.83 for its employees. It was Capuano\u2019s responsibility to make such payments, but she testified there was insufficient money in the payroll account with which to do so. Capuano testified that she often asked defendant to deposit additional money into the account so the required tax payments could be made, but that he would only cover the payroll.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Capuano further testified that she discussed this issue weekly with defendant from 1990 to 1992, telling him it was his responsibility as a corporate officer to make the payments, but he \u201cgave [her] a look\u201d in response and never gave her sufficient money with which to do so. Defendant contradicted her testimony, claiming Capuano had total control of the company\u2019s finances and he told her \u201ca hundred times\u201d to pay the taxes when he learned they had not been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>According to Capuano, GMI received five late notices from the Department of Labor (\u201cDepartment\u201d), but defendant told her to do nothing until contacted by them. Although the Department contacted Capuano regarding the delinquent payments, and she requested an installment agreement in 1992, no payment was made while she was employed at GMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In addition, from August 1990 until December 1992, GMI failed to pay employee withholding taxes totaling $57,725.06 to the New Jersey Division of Taxation (\u201cDivision\u201d). Moreover, neither employee withholding taxes nor unemployment and disability contributions were withheld from defendant\u2019s salary because he was not directly compensated. Defendant\u2019s salary checks were made payable to NCF at his direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The non-payment of taxes led to an investigation by the Division auditor Ellen Kocon. Her examination, which included GMI\u2019s wage and tax statements and employee withholding tax returns, indicated that GMI deducted earnings for tax withholding from employee paychecks but did not remit those funds to the State. Further investigation revealed that defendant did not file personal income tax returns from 1988 to 1994, GMI did not file corporate tax returns in 1991 and 1992, defendant received his \u201cremuneration\u201d from GMI by payments to NCF, and NCF did not file corporate tax returns from 1985 to 1991. In September 1991, NCF\u2019s corporate charter was vacated for non-payment of state taxes, but it remained in business and accepted defendant\u2019s salary payments after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">In 1991, the year for which the convictions flowed from NCF\u2019s failure to file a return, all of NCF\u2019s income came from GMI. Defendant testified that NCF was a consulting business, but he did not provide a customer list when investigators requested one, and they could not find records of any customer deposits. It was discovered that checks from NCF were used to pay defendant\u2019s personal expenses; further, checks from GMI, drawing from several accounts, were also signed by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>In late 1991 or early 1992, IBM informed GMI that it would not be making any purchases for two months to one year, which left the company financially devastated. Because there was little business and the company did not have enough cash to pay his salary, Kaye left the company in April or May of 1992, and the company did not pay the taxes withheld, nor employee or employer disability and unemployment contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Defendant had expressed dissatisfaction with his retained counsel\u2019s preparation for trial and had consulted with other attorneys. However, his motion for adjournment to obtain new counsel came on the day the trial commenced,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and his application to proceed <em>pro se </em>was made after jury selection was completed. Defendant now contends that the trial judge improperly denied his constitutional right to proceed <em>pro se. </em>We reject the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u201c[L]ike any other request for substitution of an attorney, a defendant\u2019s decision to dismiss his lawyer and represent himself must be exercised in a timely fashion. The right of self-representation is not a license to disrupt the criminal calendar, or a trial in progress,\u201d <em>State v. Buhl, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 362, 635 A.2d 562 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>468, 640 A.2d 850 (1994). Here, defendant\u2019s application to proceed <em>pro se </em>was made after the jury was selected and immediately before opening statements. The trial judge, therefore, did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se. Id. </em>at 363-64, 635 A.2d 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Defendant argues his convictions on counts two and four, regarding his failure as a corporate officer to remit unemployment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>and disability payments to the State, are without \u201cbasis in law, because the unemployment compensation law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-1 <em>et seq., </em>is entirely self-contained, and therefore provides the only penalties which may be applied to violations of its provisions.\u201d He asserts that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-16 is the specific statute governing violations of the law in this respect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">Any employing unit, or any officer or agent of an employing unit, which officer or agent is directly or indirectly responsible for collecting, truthfully accounting for, remitting when payable any contribution, or filing or causing to be filed any report or statement required by this chapter, or employer, or person failing to remit, when payable, any employer eontribu-tions, or worker contributions ... or filing or causing to be filed ... any false or fraudulent report or statement with intent to defraud the State ... or with intent to evade the payment of any contributions, interest or penalties ... which shall be due under the provisions of this chapter (R.S. 43:21-1 et seq.), shall be liable for each offense upon conviction before any Superior Court or municipal court, to a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 or by imprisonment for a term not to exceed 90 days, or both____The fine ... shall be payable to the unemployment compensation auxiliary fund. Any penalties imposed by this subsection shall be in addition to those otherwise prescribed in this chapter (R.S. 43:21-1 et seq.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-16(e).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Defendant relies primarily on <em>State v. Pescatore, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 516 A.2d 261 (App.Div.1986), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>441, 522 A.2d 440 (1987), which concerned whether a failure to remit sales taxes could be prosecuted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-9 and 2C:21-15 as well as specific provisions of the Sales Tax Act. After noting that \u201c[w]hether the specific [statute] bars prosecution under other more general legislation is a matter of legislative intent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 29, 516 A.2d 261, the court found that the statutory phrase permitting prosecutions under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-26(b) \u201cin addition to any other penalties herein or elsewhere prescribed,\u201d indicated a legislative intent to permit prosecution under Title 2C as well. <em>Id. </em>at 29-30, 516 A.2d 261.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, defendant points out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>that, unlike the Sales Tax Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-16(e) specifically refers only to permitted prosecutions authorized under that section or as \u201cotherwise prescribed in\u201d chapter 21 of Title 43. Nevertheless, we cannot conclude that the Legislature intended to prohibit traditional Title 2G criminal prosecution for thefts or misappropriations of unemployment and disability funds withheld from employees and not paid over to the State. Hence, while matters may be prosecuted under Title 43, <em>see State v. Paone, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>494, 497, 676 A.2d 159 (App.Div.1996); <em>State v. Paladino, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>537, 539, 497 A.2d 562 (App.Div.1985), the prosecutor may exercise his or her discretion to prosecute by indictment and trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">It is axiomatic that \u201c[s]pecific conduct may violate more than one statute.\u201d <em>State v. Blount, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>23, 31, 286 A.2d 36 (1972); <em>see also State v. Eure, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>469, 473-76, 701 A.2d 464 (App.Div.1997), <em>certif. denied, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>193, 704 A.2d 23 (1998); <em>Pescatore, supra, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28-29, 516 A.2d 261. Therefore, \u201c[i]n the many situations where criminal statutes overlap in prohibiting the same basic act, the [prosecutor] in the sound exercise of the discretion committed to him may proceed under either act,\u201d <em>State v. Gledhill, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>565, 574, 342 A.2d 161 (1975) (quoting <em>State v. States, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>285, 292, 208 A.2d 633 (1965)); <em>State v. Eure, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 475, 701 A.2d 464, so long as judgment is not entered against the defendant \u201cunder more than one statute for the same offense.\u201d <em>Pescatore, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 30, 516 A.2d 261. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8(a). The legislative intent for prosecution under a single statute or to prohibit the prosecutor\u2019s election \u201cmust be manifest\u201d and \u201ccapable of no other reasonable interpretation,\u201d <em>Gledhill, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 580, 342 A.2d 161 (quoting <em>States, </em>44 <em>N.J. supra, </em>at 291, 208 A.2d 633); <em>see also State v. Damiano, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 53, 730 A.2d 376 (App.Div.1999), <em>certif. denied, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>396, 749 A.2d 369 (2000); <em>State v. Stelzner, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 239, 608 A.2d 386 (App.Div.), <em>cert. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>396, 614 A.2d 619 (1992); <em>cf. State v. Altenburg, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>289, 298, 588 A.2d 822 (App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>508, 551 A.2d 534 (1988); and such legislative intent does not exist in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Defendant also argues that employer contributions to State unemployment and disability compensation funds are neither \u201cobtain[ed]\u201d nor \u201cretain[ed]\u201d funds, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-9, nor \u201centrusted\u201d funds, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-15.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 1991 and 1992, GMI failed to make unemployment and disability payments totaling $82,543.83 for its employees, of which approximately $19,000 were employee, as opposed to employer, contributions. The employer deducts the employee\u2019s contributions from paychecks, and holds them in trust until paid to the State quarterly, whereas the employer must pay its contributions directly. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-2(a)(d). Defendant insists that the $75,000 threshold for a second degree crime has not been satisfied because the corporation never \u201cobtain[ed]\u201d or \u201cretain[ed]\u201d its portion of the contribution, as required for a prosecution under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-9. Defendant also contends the corporation\u2019s contributions were neither \u201centrusted\u201d to the defendant as a fiduciary, nor \u201cbelong[ed] to or required to be withheld for the benefit of the government,\u201d as required under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Defendant further argues that according to <em>In re Hoerst, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>98, 103-03, 638 A.2d 801 (1994), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-9 applies only to \u201cspecific and discrete\u201d property that has been obtained or retained from a specific source, such as employee withholding, and not to property from an unspecified source, like employer contributions from the corporation\u2019s general operating account.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\"><em>Hoerst </em>refers to the elements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>[t]he offense . . is committed when a person (1) purposely obtains or retains property ... upon agreement or subject to a, known legal obligation to make specified payment or other disposition ...; (2) deals with the property obtained as his own .. ; and (3) fails to make the required payment or disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">[135 <em>N.J. </em>at 103-04, 638 A.2d 801 (citing <em>State v. Kelly, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 287, 498 A.2d 784 (App.Div.1985)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We agree with defendant that a criminal statute must be strictly construed, <em>see State v. Valentin, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>14, 17, 519 A.2d 322 (1987), and have difficulty with the State\u2019s argument under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-9 in the absence of a jury finding that relates the amount of funds not paid to the State to amounts defendant obtained or retained for personal expenses instead of making the required payments to the State. Similarly, while accomplice liability was charged to the jury and the State\u2019s summation seemed to relate defendant\u2019s conduct to the corporation\u2019s retention of funds for its use, the jury was not instructed as to the theory of liability by which the State proceeded or the factual prerequisites for accomplice liability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, as count two was merged into count four, and defendant was neither sentenced nor the subject of a judgment of conviction on count two, we decline to pass on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s argument that the conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-15 cannot stand. As defendant points out, in <em>State v. Altenburg, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>289, 297, 538 A.2d 822 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>508, 551 A.2d 534 (1988), we rejected the concept that the first five percent or six percent of sales of non-exempt tangible personal property must be retained for the purpose of paying sales tax, and thus, belongs to the State. <em>Id. </em>at 297, 538 A.2d 822. We found that the sales tax is not retained from the amount of a given sale, but is charged in addition to the sale itself. <em>Id. </em>at 293, 297, 538 A.2d 822. Because the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>never charged or collected the sales tax, he neither \u201cobtain[ed]\u201d nor \u201cretain[ed]\u201d the tax and could not pay it from a specified source \u201centrusted\u201d to him or \u201cbelonging to or required to be withheld for the benefit of the government,\u201d as required under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-15. <em>Id. </em>at 297, 538 A.2d 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Here, however, the employer contributions were due from the corporation, from any corporate revenues or funds, and not from a dedicated sales tax. <em>Id. </em>at 293, 538 A.2d 822. Moreover, <em>Altenburg </em>pointed out the then-recent amendment to the definition of \u201cbenefit derived\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-15 which was expanded to include \u201cthe amount of any tax avoided, evaded or otherwise unpaid or improperly retained or disposed of,\u201d which applies in this ease. 223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 298, n. 1, 538 A.2d 822; <em>L. </em>1987, <em>c. </em>76, \u00a7 33. We are satisfied, from our careful review of the trial transcript, that the jury could properly find that defendant was a \u201cperson carrying on fiduciary functions on behalf of a corporation,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-15, and responsible for the non-payment of the required contributions. He also could have been an accomplice of the corporation in its decision not to make the required payments. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6; 2C:2-7. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-14(g) defining \u201cperson\u201d as including \u201ca corporation.\u201d We therefore uphold the conviction on count four.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Defendant argues that the order of restitution of $140,268.89, minus the amount paid by Kaye, was improper absent a hearing as to ability to pay. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-2 reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">b. The court shall sentence a defendant to pay restitution ... if (l)[t]he victim ... suffered a loss; and (2)[t]he defendant is able to pay or, given a fair opportunity, will be able to pay restitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">c. In determining the amount and method of payment of restitution, the court <em>shall </em>take into account all financial resources of the defendant, including the defendant\u2019s likely future earnings, and <em>shall </em>set the amount of restitution so as to provide the victim with the fullest compensation for loss that is consistent with the defendant\u2019s ability to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">[ (Emphasis added).] <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>See, e.g., State v.

Moreover, unlike cases such as <em>Orji, </em>defendant \u201cdisput[ed]\u201d the amount of restitution, and he was no longer employed, had lost his business, and was about to be incarcerated. Furthermore, the amount of restitution was made subject to an unknown credit for any amount paid by Kaye, and there was no fixed responsibility in terms of the obligation of either defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we remand lor reconsideration of the restitution award in light of the statute and subsequent developments, including the conditions of parole established by the Parole Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed, except as to the restitution ordered, and the matter is remanded for a restitution hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-14\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-7 was cited because General Machine and Instrument Co., Inc., was a co-deiendant, as was another of its principals, Warren Kaye, who pled guilty and testified for the State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-15\"> Defendant and Kaye constituted the remaining members of the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\"> Kaye entered a guilty plea on counts two and six of the indictment and was sentenced to five years probation.
