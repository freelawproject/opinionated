W. Hubbell.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-10\">\n<em>Contra, R. S. Green.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b517-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b517-12\">Reed, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATb\">The declaration was upon a bond made by a woman. The plea was coverture. The replications set up such facts as it was supposed fixed a liability upon a married woman, by force of the act of 1862. <em>Nix. Dig., p. </em>548. The bond was made previous to the enactment of the present act relative to the ability of married women to enter into contracts. <em>Rev., p. </em>637.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">The replications concluded to the country. They set up new matter, and should have concluded with a verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">For this reason, the motion must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">There is another view, in which the replications must be regarded with disfavor. They are departures from the ground taken in the declaration. In the case of <em>Eckert </em>v. <em>Reuter, </em>4 <em>Vroom </em>266, it was ruled- that, in actions under this statute, the declarations should be special, and not simply on the common counts. The rule is that, where the plaintiff should have founded his action upon a statute, his declaration assert-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ing a right at common law is not supported by a replication grounded upon the statute. <em>Gould Plead., ch. VIIL, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 69, 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The replications must be struck out, with leave to the plaintiff to amend his declaration upon payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
