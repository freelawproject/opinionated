L.,p. </em>832,) if the execution creditor could not find goods of the testator upon which to levy, he obtained satisfaction of his judgment in an action against the executor suggesting a <em>devastavit. </em>In such suit the judgment was conclusive evidence of a <em>devastavit </em>when the executor failed to plead <em>plene administravit. </em>3 <em>Wins. Ex\u2019rs </em>(1983.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Thus in any event the judgment creditor obtained satisfaction. If goods of the testator could be found, they were sold under the <em>fi. fa. </em>and the judgment paid; if <em>nulla bona </em>was returned, the executor was proceeded against upon suggestion of a <em>devastavit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">By the act of 1865, the law was changed only in this respect, that notwithstanding failure to plead <em>plene administravit </em>in the original suit, the executor may, in the subsequent action against him, show that he has fully administered. <em>Rev. p. </em>380, \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">Therefore if goods of the testator cannot be found to levy upon, the judgment creditor may fail to derive any advantage from his judgment. This does not, however, deprive him of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the right to make his claim out of the goods of the testator, if any such goods can be found upon which to levy, but simply enables the executor, if he is proceeded against on suggestion of a <em>devastavit, </em>to controvert that by showing due administration. \u25a0 ...</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The executor, by permitting execution to issue, has enabled the creditor to sell the goods of the testator, and the proceeds must be applied to the satisfaction of the execution. It is not necessary to decide what responsibility the executor has incurred by reason of his neglect to declare the estate insolvent before execution was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The plaintiff is entitled to have the moneys made by the sheriff under the <em>fi. fa. </em>applied to the satisfaction of her execution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
