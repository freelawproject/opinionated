L. </em>1871, <em>p. </em>1131,) are void, because the amount of tax imposed was determined by rates adopted by the board of public works of Jersey City, without regard to special benefits received by the land-owners. -</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">Since 1875, they are also illegal, if laid as general taxes, under the clause in the constitution that property shall be assessed for taxes, under general laws and by uniform rules, according to its true value. <em>Jersey City </em>v. <em>Vreeland, </em>14 <em>Vroom, </em>135, 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">The act is also defective in conferring the power to fix the sum to be assessed annually upon vacant lots and lots with buildings thereon in Which water is not taken, on the board of public works. Where a tax is imposed for public improvements, the legislative act of taxation must itself distribute the burden, or prescribe the standard by which siich distribution shall be made. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson County Avenue Commissioners, </em>8 <em>Vroom </em>12; <em>Bogert </em>v. <em>City of Elizabeth, </em>12 <em>C.
