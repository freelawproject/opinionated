If this affidavit be included in the terms of that act, the indictment should have alleged that it was necessary or proper to be made, taken and used, or for a lawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"AZx\">The indictment is also defective because it is too general in its ter.ms, and does not charge who, among the persons who-had signed the recommendation, were not freeholders, and who, to the knowledge or belief of the deponent, had signed-another application.</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">There should be particularity in the averments of falsity. In this indictment the charges of falsity are not sufficiently specific to enable the accused to prepare his defence.</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">A general averment thai defendant swore falsely upon the whole matter will not be sufficient. The indictment must proceed by particular averments (technically termed assignments of perjury) to negative that which is false. <em>Whart. Am. Or. Law (2d ed.) </em>661.</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">The indictment is quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
