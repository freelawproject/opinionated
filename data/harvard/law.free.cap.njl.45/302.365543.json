The prosecutor contends that the jurisdiction of the justice is ousted by force of the sixth section of the District Court act, <em>(.Rev., p. </em>1302,) which gives District Courts exclusive jurisdiction in all cases arising under that act when the defendant resides in the city where the courts exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">But I think an action by <em>scire facias </em>upon a justice's judgment in attachment is not to be regarded as being in the class of <em>\u201c </em>cases arising under the District Court act.\u201d Such a suit must be brought in the court where the record of the judgment is, (Com. v. <em>Downey, </em>9 <em>Mass. </em>520; <em>Slape </em>v. <em>State, </em>15 <em>Vroom </em>264,) and consequently a District Court would have no jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The plaintiff might, indeed, have avoided this question by purchasing his writ of attachment from the District Court, but he was not bound to do so. The jurisdiction of these courts by attachment against non-resident defendants is not declared to be exclusive merely because a garnishee is resident in the city, and we cannot hold it practically to be so by any roundabout inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The judgment of the justice must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
