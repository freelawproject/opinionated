At the earlier hearing the judge had advised the defendant of the consequence of deportation but failed to warn that her guilty plea additionally \u201cmay have the consequences of. . . exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States,\u201d as mandated by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, inserted by St. 1978, c. 383. In this appeal the Commonwealth argues that the defendant, who faces deportation, is not entitled to withdraw her guilty plea because her exclusion from reentry to the United States is speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>We address the question left open by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ber-thold, </em>441 Mass. 183, 186 n.4 (2004), \u201cwhether the automatic denial of readmission for certain periods of time following deportation ... as contrasted with the denial of readmission on the basis of one\u2019s criminal record alone. . . is a consequence (separate from deportation) of which \u00a7 29D was intended to warn.\u201d We agree with the motion judge that because the defendant now also faces immigration consequences about which she was not warned (denial of readmission), the plain language of the statute requires that the defendant be permitted to withdraw her guilty plea. More specifically, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s conviction \u2014 a drug-related \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of immigration law \u2014 results in the automatic, and now permanent, denial of readmission to the United States, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A) (2000),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that this is an \u201cenumerated consequence\u201d of the defendant\u2019s plea about which she was not warned.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><em>Background. </em>In 1993, the defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to a suspended term of from seven to ten years and two years\u2019 probation, with a number of conditions, including drug treatment, counselling, and various fees. At the plea colloquy, the motion judge advised the defendant: \u201cYou need to understand that a finding of guilt on this offense may mean that you will be deported from the United States, that you may lose your permanent residence, your green card, and that you may lose your right to remain in the United States lawfully. Do you understand that?\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cYes, sir, I understand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>In 2004, the defendant moved to vacate her plea on grounds that she had not been given sufficient warning of the effect of the plea on her immigration rights as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, and that she was now the subject of pending deportation proceedings. In an affidavit accompanying the motion, her counsel stated that the defendant \u201chas been ordered to answer in removal proceedings that could result in her deportation.\u201d The affidavit also states that the defendant was not \u201cadvised that she will never be allowed to return to the United States as a result of her plea.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the hearing, both the prosecutor and defense counsel represented that the defendant had been the subject of deportation proceedings before an immigration court and had been ordered deported. Defense counsel further argued that Federal law enacted in 1996<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> created categories of aggravated felonies that now include the offense to which the defendant had pleaded guilty and eliminated discretionary relief that previously had been available to immigration judges. He went on to argue that under this law, the defendant now would be barred from reentry for an extended period and that she seeks reentry to be with her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">It was not contested that the defendant has three children who are United States citizens. The prosecutor argued that in light of the facts that the defendant has three young children, one of whom has had frequent hospitalizations due to illness, and that there have been no additions to the defendant\u2019s criminal record since her guilty plea, she might succeed in her appeal from the deportation order on humanitarian grounds and that it was, in any case, merely speculative that the defendant would be barred from reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The motion judge (who, as we have observed, also heard the plea and provided the colloquy) found that the defendant\u2019s conviction of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>qualified as an aggravated felony under the immigration laws of this country.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He allowed the motion to vacate on the ground that the defendant \u201cis facing an immigration consequence that she was not warned of: denial of naturalization.\u201d For reasons not evident in the record, he did not address the defendant\u2019s claim that he had failed to warn of the bar to reentry and that the defendant faced this consequence as a result of having been deported.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">We conclude that the defendant should have been permitted to withdraw her guilty plea, but on grounds other than that stated by the motion judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 102 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sweezey, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 48, 51 n.8 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 29D, requires that, before accepting a guilty or nolo contendere plea,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a judge must provide a defendant with an advisement, which is set out in quotation marks in the statute. In 1993, that advisement was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\u201cIf you are not a citizen of the United States, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense for which you have been charged may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization, pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Section 29D, now as then, requires that a defendant be warned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>in the manner specified by the statute. Thus \u201c[t]o comply with the statute, the judge must give the alien warning, preferably by reading the single quoted sentence directly from the statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, 437 </em>Mass. 809, 819 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>431 Mass. 340, 342 (2000) (\u201cThe Legislature has put the three required warnings in quotation marks, and each of them is required to be given so that a person pleading guilty knows exactly what immigration consequences his or her plea may have\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\u201cThe statute further provides that, if the judge fails to give the statutory warning and the defendant \u2018later at any time shows that his plea and conviction <em>may </em>have one of the enumerated consequences, the court, on the defendant\u2019s motion, <em>shall </em>vacate the judgment, and permit the defendant to . . . enter a plea of not guilty.\u2019 (emphasis added).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berthold, </em>441 Mass. at 184-185, quoting from G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, as appearing in St. 1996, c. 450, \u00a7 254 (the language of which is in all significant respects identical to that of St. 1978, c. 383, the version applicable here). The Supreme Judicial Court has interpreted this \u201cremedy clause of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, [as being] triggered only when a defendant can additionally demonstrate that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\u2018may\u2019 become subject to one of the immigration consequences enumerated in the statute. We construe this requirement to mean that a defendant must demonstrate more than a hypothetical risk of such a consequence, but that he actually faces the prospect of its occurring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The Commonwealth contends on appeal that the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate her guilty plea should have been denied because the defendant was warned about the consequence of deportation, the exact consequence she actually faces. It argues that the statute offers no remedy unless the defendant can show that, in addition, she actually faces one of the consequences about which she was not warned \u2014 exclusion from admission to the United States or denial of naturalization. For this proposition, the Commonwealth relies on <em>Berthold, </em>in which the court said: \u201cA defendant who has been warned under the statute of the very consequences with which he must subsequently contend is not entitled to withdraw his plea, even if he was not warned of other enumerated consequences that have not materialized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">As is also the case here, the defendant in <em>Berthold </em>faced deportation, a consequence about which he had been warned. In <em>Berthold, </em>however, the defendant failed to raise in his motion to withdraw his guilty plea the \u201cargument that, now deported, he likely will be excluded from admission to the United States, and thus may face an \u2018immigration consequence\u2019 enumerated in \u00a7 29D of which he was not advised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186 n.4. Because the argument was not raised below, it was deemed waived, thereby leaving unanswered the question \u201cwhether the automatic denial of readmission for certain periods of time following deportation, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii) (2000), as contrasted with the denial of readmission on the basis of one\u2019s criminal record alone, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2) (2000), is a consequence (separate from deportation) of which \u00a7 29D was intended to warn.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Unlike the defendants in <em>Berthold </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Agbogun, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 206 (2003), the defendant here based her motion to vacate on the consequence of exclusion from the readmission to the United States, which is the automatic and direct result of the deportation stemming from her convic-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>tian. This was not a consequence the defendant \u201cmay face only in some hypothetical future,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Agbogun, supra </em>at 208; instead, she \u201cactually faces the prospect of its occurring.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berthold, </em>441 Mass. at 185. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, </em>437 Mass. at 813-814 (\u201cWith the commencement of deportation proceedings against [the defendant], there is no dispute that the defendant \u2018may\u2019 suffer one of the enumerated immigration consequences . . .\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The defendant\u2019s conviction of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under Federal immigration law and permanently bars her readmission to the United States. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), 1182(a)(9)(A) (2000).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casimir, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 258 n.2 (2007). Under current Federal immigration law, the defendant\u2019s conviction of an aggravated felony related to a controlled substance violation subjects her to deportation, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (2000), and to automatic denial of readmission, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A). Thus, the defendant faces immigration consequences about which she had not been advised: \u201cthe automatic denial of readmission for certain periods of time following deportation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berthold, </em>441 Mass. at 186 n.4, citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii). We conclude that this is \u201ca consequence (separate from deportation) of which \u00a7 29D was intended to warn.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Cf. <em>Van Slytman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>804 A.2d 1113, 1117 (D.C. 2002) (alien with aggravated felony conviction warned of consequence of deportation but not that, once deported, he would be excluded from reentry for twenty years and could not become citizen for five years after convic-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>tian; court concluded that this brought him \u201cwithin the protection of the [immigration warning] statute with respect to the unwarned consequences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty plea is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\">If the defendant had been ordered deported soon after her 1993 conviction, automatic denial of readmission to the United States would have been for a period of twenty years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(B)(iv) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Even if there had been no automatic exclusion in 1993, we would still affirm the new trial order. The defendant\u2019s subjective understanding of immigration law in effect at the time of the guilty plea is irrelevant to the remedy available to aliens under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. The judge\u2019s obligation is to give the advisement that is set forth in quoted language in the statute. \u201cBeyond that, in the absence of special circumstances, a judge need not explain to the defendant the intricacies of the immigration laws.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 840, 844 (1989). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 913,913 (2002) (defendant should not have been permitted to withdraw his pleas merely because his former counsel may have failed to inform him of recent amendments to Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101[a] [1994]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Counsel\u2019s affidavit avers, \u201cThe Court does not clearly and separately advise the defendant of ... the sep[or]ate and distinct consequences of her plea, inasmuch as she is not patently advised that she will never be allowed to return to the United States as a result of her plea.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.

In California, evidence that the defendant was \u201cat risk of . . . exclusion from admission to the United States\u201d because of prior crimes of moral turpitude coupled with a border patrol hold by Federal immigration authorities was sufficient to show that it was \u201cmore than just a remote possibility\u201d that the defendant actually faced immigration consequences. <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Ct.
