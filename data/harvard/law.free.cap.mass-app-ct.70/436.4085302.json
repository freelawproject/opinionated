Schuker (father) appeals from three judgments of contempt entered against him in the Probate and Family Court when he failed to pay child support determined to be due to Maria Tatar (mother) under the terms of their divorce judgment. The father claims that (1) in the absence of a modification judgment ordering that support continue beyond age eighteen, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, must be read to provide for automatic termination of his support obligation upon the younger child reaching age eighteen; (2) he was wrongfully denied evidentiary hearings in connection with the contempt proceedings; (3) his support obligation should have been reduced by the amount of Social Security payments allegedly received by the younger child; (4) attorney\u2019s fees should not have been awarded to the mother; and (5) the judge should have recused herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The father\u2019s primary contention in this appeal is that because the child support obligation imposed by his divorce judgment contained no termination date or other contingency specifically related to ending the obligation, it ended automatically upon his younger child\u2019s reaching the age of eighteen. We decide that the probate judge hearing the contempt actions could properly conclude that the father\u2019s obligation continued until the child was emancipated as defined by G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, as amended by, St. 1976, c. 29, \u00a7 1 (i.e., the child has attained age eighteen but \u201cnot attained age twenty-one, ... is domiciled in the home of a parent, and is principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance\u201d); however, because the order was not sufficiently clear on this point, he could not be held in contempt in connection with the first proceeding. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">1. <em>Background. </em>Two children were bom to the parties during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>their marriage: a son, in October, 1986, and a daughter, in June, 1984. When the parties were divorced by a judgment nisi, following a trial, the children were three and five years old. By an amended judgment dated October 11, 1989, nunc pro tune to July 31, 1989, the mother was adjudged the \u201cprimary custodial parent,\u201d and the father was ordered to pay \u201cto the [mother] as child support the sum of two hundred and eighty-six ($286.00) dollars each week, beginning forthwith, and each week thereafter.\u201d The judgment is silent as to termination of this obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">By the fall of 2004, both children had graduated high school and were full-time college students.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The child support provision of the divorce judgment was not modified throughout this period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the younger child turned eighteen years old at the end of October, 2004, the father stopped making child support payments, and the mother filed the first of the three contempt actions at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In the first contempt complaint, filed in August, 2005, the mother alleged that the father had failed to pay weekly child support as ordered by the divorce judgment, in essence claiming that the divorce judgment required support to continue until the children were emancipated under the statute and that the younger son was not emancipated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Answering the complaint, the father admitted \u201cthat he [had] failed to make some of the child sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>port payments,\u201d and set forth no defense to his nonpayment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nowhere in his answer did the father raise the defense that the younger child was no longer domiciled with the mother nor principally dependent on her for support, and nothing in the record on appeal reflects that, in connection with his request for an evidentiary hearing, the father made a timely offer of proof that the son\u2019s domicile had changed from that of his mother or that he was no longer principally dependent upon her for noneducation support.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See note 14, <em>infra. </em>The probate judge denied his request for an evidentiary hearing and found the father in contempt on the basis of his admissions that he failed to make the child support payments \u2014 determined to be in the amount of $14,681 \u2014 and made no claim that he was unable to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"A5d\">In a motion for relief from this judgment, Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 60(b), the father set forth in an \u201cOffer of Proof\u201d the following: the amended judgment of divorce obligated him to pay weekly child support in the amount of $286; the \u201cjudgment [made] no provision for termination of child support\u201d and \u201cno mention of emancipation of minor children\u201d; the parties\u2019 younger child \u201cbecame 18 years of age on October 29, 2004\u201d; the \u201c[flather paid weekly child support through the end of October, 2004\u201d; the son received $3,508 from the Social Security Administration in November, 2004, for which he was eligible \u201con account of Father\u2019s age\u201d; in June, 2005, \u201cFather paid Mother $969.63\u201d for the son \u201cwhich he was not required to pay\u201d; and \u201cMother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>has made no contribution to the college expenses (either tuition or living) ... of the children.\u201d The motion showed that the father\u2019s defense to the contempt judgment was one of law, not fact: the father claimed that his obligation terminated by operation of law \u201con the eighteenth birthday of the youngest child\u201d and that the mother \u201cmust file a Complaint for Modification,\u201d if she \u201cwishe[d] to receive child support\u201d after that date. The judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In her second and third complaints, filed in January and March, 2006, the mother sought additional unpaid child support accumulated since entry of the first contempt judgment, as well interest on the unpaid support.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following nonevidentiary hearings, the father was found in contempt and judgments entered against him. The judgment on the January complaint fixed the arrearage at $5,270, and further provided that \u201c[t]he father shall pay <em>child support for the children who are unemancipated according to the statute </em>retroactive to his last payment\u201d (emphasis added). Judgment on the March complaint fixed the additional arrearage at $5,148, adding twelve percent interest to this sum for the period from the date of filing the complaint to the date of judgment. In addition, as to the second and third contempt complaints, the mother was awarded attorney\u2019s fees in amounts of $7,746.10 and $5,636.25, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The father appealed from the three contempt judgments and the denial of his rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Judgments of contempt, </em>(i) <em>Analytical framework. </em>Because this case involves a divorce judgment that did not incorporate an agreement of the parties,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we begin our discussion by looking to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, which provides authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>to the Probate and Family Courts to make orders for child support.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The particular portion of \u00a7 28 with which we are concerned provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cUpon a judgment of divorce, the court may make such judgment as it considers expedient relative to the care, custody and maintenance of the minor children of the parties. . . . The court may make appropriate orders of maintenance, support and education of any child who has attained age eighteen but who has not attained age twenty-one and who is domiciled in the home of a parent, and is principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">It is the father\u2019s continued obligation for general support of his children, and not a new obligation to contribute to their education, that is at issue in this case. That the younger child\u2019s domicile remained with his mother and that he continued to be principally dependent on her for support after he reached age eighteen were not timely raised as issues of fact below. See notes 18 &amp; 20, <em>infra. </em>This is very likely because the father pin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ned success not on a determination of these facts in the context of the contempt action, but on his legal argument that under the language of the divorce judgment, termination of his obligation was automatic when his son reached eighteen. Nor has any question been raised as to the father\u2019s ability to pay. Thus, we are faced with the narrow question whether the provision in the divorce judgment ordering the father to pay \u201cto the [mother] as child support the sum of two hundred and eighty-six ($286.00) dollars each week, beginning forthwith, and each week thereafter,\u201d presents a clear and unambiguous command to the father that his child support continue until the younger child is emancipated under the statute. See <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 338, 340 (1990) (\u201cto find a defendant in civil contempt there must be a clear and unequivocal command and an equally clear and undoubted disobedience\u201d). We conclude that the father\u2019s obligation to support continues until his son\u2019s emancipation, and did not expire when he reached his eighteenth birthday, but that the order was not sufficiently clear on this point so as to support a finding of contempt. Also, in the circumstances presented, the mother was not required to file a modification complaint to establish the father\u2019s continued obligation for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We begin our discussion by observing that the statutory framework clearly reflects a legislative intent to require parents to support their unemancipated children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., </em>432 Mass. 438, 444 &amp; n.17 (2000). It is \u201cthe declared public policy of this Commonwealth \u2018that dependent children shall be maintained, as completely as possible, from the resources of their parents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, quoting from G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1, and citing G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 20. The mother in the <em>L.W.K. </em>case brought an action that established paternity of the parties\u2019 son, then not quite two; the trial judge \u201cordered the father to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>child support of $100 a week to the mother, the order to remain in effect \u2018until further order of the Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra </em>at 440. The court noted that \u201c[i]n this case, the child support order is in force <em>until the child is emancipated </em>or \u2018until further order of the Court,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 446 (emphasis added),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and held that where neither contingency had occurred, the support obligation survived the death of the father. <em>Id. </em>at 446-447. Among the authorities quoted in <em>L.W.K. </em>in support of this proposition was the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act \u00a7 316(c), 9A U.L.A. 102 (Master ed. 1998). That sections states, \u201cUnless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly provided in the decree, provisions for the support of a child are terminated by emancipation of the child but not by the death of a parent obligated to support the child\u201d; and the comment to \u00a7 316(c) further notes that \u201cthis section terminates the obligation of a parent to support a child, only upon the child\u2019s emancipation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103. The court in <em>L.W.K. </em>also quoted with favor this principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]he fundamental difference between the marital and parental duty of parents is that after a divorce the relation of husband and wife is at an end, and all marital obligations not preserved by the decree are at an end, while the relation of parent and child continues unchanged, and <em>a father\u2019s obligation to support his offspring continues to exist unless cut off by the </em>decree.\u2019 <em>Allison </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>188 Kan. 593, 597 (1961)\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\"><em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra </em>at 446 n.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Thus, our courts have concluded that \u201c[t]he Legislature did not intend that emancipation \u2018automatically occur on reaching the age of majority\u2019 in all circumstances.\u201d <em>Eccleston </em>v. <em>Bankosky, </em>438 Mass. 428, 434 (2003), quoting from <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 418, 420 n.3 (1991). See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Mc-Cune, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 864, 865 (1976) (emancipation not automatic when child reaches age of majority). Contrast <em>Pemberton </em>v. <em>Pemberton, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 9, 14 (1980) (noting in dictum that statutory changes reducing age of majority to eighteen \u201cestablish[ed] an earlier age of emancipation\u201d). See also <em>Conlon </em>v. <em>Sawin, </em>420 Mass. 735, 737 (1995) (\u201cSupport obligations under G. L. c. 209C do not terminate in all instances when a child bom out of wedlock attains majority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The history of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, further reflects that, despite the reduction in the age of majority from age twenty-one to eighteen that occurred \u201cin response to the conscription of men eighteen years of age to serve in the Vietnam War,\u201d <em>Eccleston </em>v. <em>Bankosky, </em>438 Mass. at 434 n.14,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Legislature did not intend that emancipation occur, presumptively, at age eighteen. \u201c[Sjince lowering the presumptive age of majority . . . the Legislature has acted repeatedly to clarify and reinforce its intent that a child\u2019s attaining eighteen years does not, of itself, terminate the support obligations of a noncustodial parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434-435. Within two years of lowering the age of majority, the Legislature amended \u00a7 28, to restore to the Probate and Family Court the authority to award maintenance for children between eighteen and twenty-one. See St. 1975, c. 661, \u00a7 1. A year later, the statute was again amended by inserting the words \u201csupport and education\u201d in the sentence added by the prior amendment. See St. 1976, c. 279, \u00a7 1. \u201cIn enacting such statutes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Commonwealth has recognized that merely attaining the age of eighteen years does not by itself endow young people with the ability to be self-sufficient in the adult world.\u201d <em>Eccleston </em>v. <em>Ban-kosky, supra </em>at 436. See <em>Orlandella </em>v. <em>Orlandella, </em>370 Mass. 225, 227-230 (1976) (support decree ordering husband to pay weekly support for \u201cminor child\u201d entered before effective date of statutes reducing age of majority to eighteen \u201cis not automatically modified by legislative redefinition of age of majority\u201d). \u201cThe Legislature apparently intended that children meeting the requirements set forth in [G. L. c. 208,] \u00a7 28, continue to be considered \u2018minors\u2019 at least for purposes of support.\u201d <em>Stolk </em>v. <em>Stolk, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 904-905 (1991). See <em>Heider </em>v. <em>Heider, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 634 (1993).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See also <em>Kelsey </em>v. <em>Panarelli, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 480, 482-483 (1977) (Armstrong, J., concurring) (G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, and G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 37, \u201crepresent a reasonable legislative attempt to secure to dependent children of broken homes advantages customarily made available to children of other homes and comparable age. In families that remain together, decisions by parents whether to terminate support when their children reach the age of majority are usually tempered by consideration of the educational and economic realities of our time . . ,\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">At oral argument, the father cited dictum in <em>Lombardi </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>Lombardi, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 407, 412 (2007) (\u201cIn the case of child support . . . responsibility [for support of a child] ceases with certain exceptions, when the child attains the age of majority\u201d), as providing support for his position. We note, however, that the record in that case reflects that the judgment at issue provided for support of \u201cminor children.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 408 &amp; 409 n.8. Further, that statement should not be read to suggest that support ceases automatically at age eighteen. Compare <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., </em>432 Mass. at 445 (\u201cGeneral Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 1, imposes child support responsibility on a parent from the child\u2019s birth to the age of eighteen, and beyond that period if certain statutory and readily discernible circumstances exist\u201d). A probate judge does, of course, have the discretion to enter an order for child support for a child who is a minor at the time of the judgment that terminates when a child reaches age eighteen.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Brogle </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (1985); <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 144 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We think, based on the foregoing authorities, that (except in the case of educational support) the trial judge is not required to wait until a child nears the end of his or her minority to make an order for general support that continues until a child is emancipated (as defined by the statutory framework), by virtue of continued dependency on and domicile with a custodial parent. See, e.g., <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 79 (2000); <em>Braun </em>v. <em>Braun, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 846, 849 (2007). This is particularly so when it is apparent from the facts of the case that the parties anticipate that their children will be attending college and thus likely will not be emancipated when they reach the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">(ii) <em>Application to present appeal. </em>Although the child support order at issue does not refer to a specific termination date, it ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>pears from other provisions in the divorce judgment that the judge did not assume the children would no longer require support upon reaching age eighteen. Indeed, as we also observed in <em>Tatar </em>v. <em>Schuker, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 534, 535-536 (1991), provisions in the parties\u2019 divorce judgment are geared towards permitting the wife to maintain the marital home for the benefit of the children until their emancipation, and such provisions are \u201ctraditional child support provisionfs].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536, quoting from <em>Hartog </em>v. <em>Hartog, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 124, 128 (1989).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In light of the fact that no issue had been raised whether the son remained principally dependent on his mother for support and domiciled in her home, it was appropriate for the probate judge to conclude that the father\u2019s obligation for child support continued. Had the father been unclear as to the basis for the first contempt judgment, he could have requested findings on that score. As it was, the judge\u2019s basis became apparent in the second judgment of contempt, ordering \u201cchild support for the children who are unemancipated according to the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Cf. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 308, 312 (1983) (\u201cA Probate Court has power to modify a support order in the context of either a complaint for contempt or a complaint for modification\u201d). See <em>Pemberton </em>v. <em>Pemberton, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 13; <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. at 149. The mother was not required, in the circumstances presented, to initiate a separate complaint for modification in order to obtain a determination that the father\u2019s child support obligation continued after the son reached age eighteen. To decide otherwise would require a custodial parent to face unilateral termination of payments unless she obtains an order for continued support that is not even based on changed circumstances but on circumstances (dependency and domicil) that have not changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">That said, we do not think the divorce judgment here was sufficiently clear as to the father\u2019s ongoing obligation to provide such support, and we encourage judges to specify in their judgments the contingencies terminating child support obligations. It was not until the first contempt judgment entered that the father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>was clearly informed that his obligation continued.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We thus vacate the finding of contempt made in connection with the judgment of October 28, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">b. <em>Credit for other payments. </em>The father alleges that shortly after he stopped paying child support, his son received $3,508 in Social Security benefits as a consequence of the father\u2019s age. In order to receive a credit based on such payments, the father was first required to seek and obtain a modification judgment. See <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. 182, 188 (1998) (\u201cThe noncustodial parent may apply the credit [for parent\u2019s disability benefits paid to unemancipated child] against a child support obligation only after seeking modification and receiving an appropriate modification judgment\u201d). The father here seeks a retroactive adjustment, and we thus need not address whether an obligor parent may obtain prospective relief based on such payments in the context of a contempt action brought by the custodial parent. See <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. at 147-148 (\u201cG. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 13[a], no longer permits a judge to moot or reduce arrearages for child support except for any period during which there is pending a complaint for modification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">c. <em>Evidentiary hearing. </em>The judge did not err in denying the father\u2019s request for evidentiary hearings on the contempt matters. See <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 537, 540 (2006) (where material facts are not in dispute, \u201ca judge may properly rule on a complaint for contempt without an evidentiary hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ing, or without receiving live testimony\u201d). The father has identified no disputed issue of material fact that was timely raised.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Rodriquez </em>v. <em>Furtado, </em>410 Mass. 878, 880 n.3 (1991) (summary judgment appropriate where only facts in dispute are not material to disposition). \u201cThe information before the judge was clearly sufficient to warrant findings that the father had the present ability to pay the sums due in full,. . . that his continued refusal to do so was contumacious . . . , and that no material change in circumstances had occurred which would justify any change in the original . . . order. . . . [T]he [father] had an adequate opportunity to present his position on all the material issues raised in both complaints\u201d for contempt. <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 874, 875-876 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">d. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>An award of attorney\u2019s fees is authorized by G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 34A(a), inserted by St. 1982, c. 282, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201cIn entering a judgment of contempt for failure to comply with an order or judgment for monetary payment, there shall be a presumption that the plaintiff is entitled to receive from the defendant ... all of his reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expenses relating to the attempted resolution, initiation and prosecution of the complaint for contempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">There was no abuse of discretion in the award of fees made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>in connection with the second and third contempt judgments. Nor did the probate judge abuse her discretion in determining the amount of the attorney\u2019s fee award. \u201cWhat constitutes a reasonable fee is a question that is committed to the sound discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Linnane, </em>434 Mass. 301, 302-303 (2001). That amount should \u201creflect[] consideration of the conservative principles appropriate to an award of fees in these circumstances.\u201d <em>Aroesty </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>62 Mass.

The divorce judgment ordered the father to convey the marital residence in Cambridge to the mother; the mother was ordered to pay the father $240,000 in satisfaction of any interest he might have in the home, with payment deferred until the sale of the home; the mother\u2019s remarriage; \u201cor the emancipation of the children.\u201d <em>Tatar </em>v. <em>Shuker, supra </em>at 535. An order for six percent interest on the unpaid amount was also deferred until the occurrence of these contingencies. In addition, as noted in the divorce judgment the parents are academics and, as evidenced by their having established UGMA accounts, planned for eventual college attendance by their children. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\">As we noted earlier in this opinion, the record reflects that the father belatedly raised as an issue of fact the mother\u2019s contribution to the children\u2019s \u201ccollege expenses (either tuition or living)\u201d in his rule 60(b) motion. See <em>Cullen Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Assn., </em>399 Mass. 886, 894 (1987) (\u201cIf the moving party fails to show why he did not have the evidence at the time of the original proceeding, the party will not prevail\u201d). The first record reference to a possible question as to the son\u2019s dependency and domicil is in the father\u2019s motion for stay pending appeal, wherein he states that there are substantial questions as to, among other things, \u201cthe current principal residence of the children\u201d and \u201cthe extent to which the children remain dependent on each of the parents.\u201d In support of the former, he refers to the son\u2019s 2004 and 2005 Virginia tax returns. In support of the latter, the father makes the general assertion that \u201c[h]e alone provides the funds for the children\u2019s college education, spending money, trips to Europe, etc. and all of the other pursuits and activities which children</p>\n<p id=\"Ake\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>similarly situated pursue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Even assuming that the judge had this evidence before her in deciding that the children were \u201cunemancipated under the statute\u201d (as we have observed, the father failed to include in the record transcripts of the contempt hearings), she need not have concluded on this evidence that the son changed his residence to that of his father and was no longer domiciled in the mother\u2019s home as he had been since the divorce. The judge also could consider the mother\u2019s expenses in connection with maintaining the marital home for the son when considering his dependency. That the children\u2019s college expenses were paid out of funds set aside for those expenses, as evidenced by provisions in the divorce judgment providing for custody of the fund and the parties\u2019 stipulation which the judge incorporated in a judgment, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>is not dispositive. See <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 342-343 (where child determined to be principally dependent on mother, pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, though father paid all of child\u2019s \u201cexpenses associated with [her] college education including her tuition, room and board and travel expenses,\u201d allowance and per diem when with her mother; mother\u2019s indirect contributions, including maintaining her home where child spent vacations, and \u201cproviding lodging, food, utilities, telephone, etc.\u201d supported finding of principal dependency on mother); <em>Stolk </em>v. <em>Stolk, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 905 (judge did not err in finding child principally dependent on recipient parent, even though child had attained age of majority and was enrolled in college). Compare <em>Kirwood </em>v. <em>Kirwood, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 1156, 1156, 1157 (1989) (noting that \u201c[i]n considering the statutory question, a judge should not limit inquiry solely to the direct financial contributions made by the parties\u201d and upholding determination that son was principally dependent on father as properly \u201cbased on a consideration of all the evidence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">We do not condone the father\u2019s use of self-help in terminating support. Had the divorce judgment here been clearer in providing that support would not end until the children were emancipated according to the statute, we would have upheld the finding of contempt, even if the father had timely raised the question whether the younger child remained domiciled with the mother and principally dependent on her for his support. As set forth in <em>Heistand </em>v. <em>Heistand, </em>384 Mass. 20, 29-30 (1981), where the court upheld a finding of contempt even though \u201cthe defendant was correct on the merits of his argument!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [because] he inappropriately resorted to self-help, unilaterally reducing the support payments and thereby flouting a valid order of the court. The defendant\u2019s recourse upon the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to pay her share should be to petition the Probate Court for a declaration\u201d regarding a contested issue. An obligor who is unclear about the extent of his or her obligation but does not seek clarification, runs the risk of being found in contempt and responsible for attorney\u2019s fees and interest on any unpaid amounts.
