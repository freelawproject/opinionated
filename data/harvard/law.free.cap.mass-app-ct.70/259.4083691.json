L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, that a claim is not \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous\u201d preclusive of the issue whether the claim was \u201cdevoid of any reasonable factual support or arguable basis in law,\u201d incident to a special motion to dismiss a subsequent action based on the same claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> statute)? We conclude that the prior determination that the claim is not frivolous is preclusive for such purposes and accordingly affirm the judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\"><em>Background. </em>The plaintiff, Demoulas Super Markets, Inc. (Demoulas), owns a shopping center located at 1900 Main Street, Tewksbury, known as Oakdale Plaza. The shopping center, which was originally built in the 1970\u2019s, had become outdated by 2002, when Demoulas purchased it. Incident to a proposed renovation of the shopping center, Demoulas sought and obtained from the Tewksbury planning board certain zoning relief (the nature of which is not specified in the record). In addition, because the proposed work posed potential impacts to wetlands areas, Demoulas sought and obtained from the Tewksbury conservation commission an order of conditions under G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, and the Tewksbury wetlands protection by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The defendants, owners of homes in the vicinity of the shopping center (homeowners),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appealed from both the planning board decision and the order of conditions. The appeal of the planning board decision, under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, began by complaint to the Land Court and was eventually dismissed by stipulation of the parties. The homeowners appealed from the order of conditions both administratively, to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for a superseding order of conditions, and judicially, by complaint to the Superior Court in the nature of certiorari, under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. The Superior Court action was thereafter dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, because the allegations of the certiorari complaint implicated no provision of the Tewksbury wetlands protection by-law that is more stringent than the corresponding provisions of the State Wetlands Protection Act. See <em>T.D.J. Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of N. Andover, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 124, 126 (1994).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Following dismissal of the homeowners\u2019 certiorari complaint, Demoulas filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees, under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. The judge who had previously allowed Demoulas\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint denied the \u00a7 6F motion, stating that the complaint was not wholly insubstantial or frivolous. The judge specifically declined to enter any finding that the homeowners\u2019 complaint had been filed in bad faith. Demoulas did not appeal from the denial of its \u00a7 6F motion, as was its right under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Approximately six months following dismissal of the homeowners\u2019 certiorari complaint, Demoulas filed the present complaint, in three counts: abuse of process; malicious prosecution; and interference with contractual relations. The homeowners timely filed a special motion to dismiss the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute. After a nonevidentiary hearing, a judge of the Superior Court<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> allowed the homeowners\u2019 motion, and Demoulas appealed from the resulting judgment of dismissal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The anti-SLAPP statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">\u201cwas enacted by the Legislature to provide a quick remedy for those citizens targeted by frivolous lawsuits based on their government petitioning activities. See preamble to 1994 House Doc. No. 1520. See also <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 161-162 (1998). The statute employs a number of mechanisms to protect the rights of those providing information to the government, including a special motion to dismiss and expedited hearing on the motion, a stay of discovery proceedings pending the motion\u2019s disposition, and the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to successful moving parties. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. It applies to matters of both public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>and private concern, <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>[431 Mass. 343, 347 (2000)]; <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 164; and encompasses petitions brought before governmental agencies. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H; <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 122-123 (2002) (applying anti-SLAPP statute to one defendant\u2019s communications with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. 327, 331 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Though its scope is not limited to the land development paradigm, it is nonetheless true that \u201c[t]he typical mischief that the legislation intended to remedy was lawsuits directed at individual citizens of modest means for speaking publicly against development projects.\u201d <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 121-122, quoting from <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The procedure governing a special motion to dismiss under the anti-SLAPP statute is well established. As a threshold matter, the moving party has the burden to show that the claims against it are \u201c \u2018based on\u2019 the petitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 167-168. At this stage, \u201c[t]he focus solely is on the conduct complained of, and, if the only conduct complained of is petitioning activity, then there can be no other \u2018substantial basis\u2019 for the claim.\u201d <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 122. If the moving party makes that showing, then the burden shifts to the nonmov-ing party to demonstrate that \u201c(1) the moving party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and (2) the moving party\u2019s acts caused actual injury to the responding party.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, as amended by St. 1996, c. 450, \u00a7 245. See <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, supra </em>at 349; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 552 (2001); <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, 436 </em>Mass. 517, 520 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">We review the Superior Court judge\u2019s order allowing the homeowners\u2019 special motion to dismiss for abuse of discretion or other error of law. See <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, supra </em>at 348; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, supra </em>at 550. As a threshold matter, we have no difficulty concluding that the motion judge correctly ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>that Demoulas\u2019s complaint was based on the homeowners\u2019 petitioning activities alone and had no other substantial basis. The counts for abuse of process and malicious prosecution were based explicitly and exclusively on the homeowners\u2019 certiorari action. Similarly, the sole means by which Demoulas alleged that the homeowners interfered with Demoulas\u2019s contractual relations was by the homeowners\u2019 prosecution of the certiorari complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Demoulas argues that its complaint alleged a separate basis for its claims, in the form of its allegation that the homeowners were recruited to file the certiorari complaint by, and received financial and other assistance from, an unidentified third party. The argument is misplaced. Demoulas\u2019s complaint is directed solely against the homeowners, and the only <em>conduct </em>of the homeowners on which Demoulas\u2019s complaint is based is their prosecution of the certiorari complaint. As the motion judge observed, the homeowners\u2019 motives in bringing the certiorari complaint are irrelevant to a threshold determination whether the conduct complained of is protected petitioning. <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 122. Compare <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>Schlichtmann, </em>448 Mass. 242, 250 (2007) (statements designed to attract potential clients for legal services not petitioning).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Having determined that Demoulas\u2019s complaint is based on the homeowners\u2019 petitioning activity alone and has no substantial basis other than the petitioning activity, our inquiry turns to whether the homeowners\u2019 petitioning activity (the certiorari complaint) was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law. In its opposition to the homeowners\u2019 special motion to dismiss in the Superior Court and in its brief on appeal, Demoulas cites <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 414-415 (2000), for its contention that the dismissal of the homeowners\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is alone sufficient to establish that the complaint was without reasonable factual support or arguable legal basis. Unlike the circumstances in <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, supra, </em>however, in which the jurisdictional defect lay in the failure timely to pursue administrative and judicial relief, the question of jurisdiction in the present case depended on the particular nature of the proposed work and the interrelationship between the Tewksbury wetlands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>protection by-law and the State Wetlands Protection Act. Whether the provisions of a local wetlands by-law impose more stringent requirements than the State Wetlands Protection Act and hence furnish grounds for judicial review in the nature of certiorari independent of administrative review by the DEP may, in some circumstances, be a fairly nuanced question. See <em>Hobbs Brook Farm Prop. Co. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Lincoln, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 142, 149-150 (2005).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We see no reason to hold that dismissal of a certiorari action seeking review of a decision issued under a local wetlands by-law is, per se, tantamount to a determination that the action is devoid of reasonable factual support or arguable basis in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In the present case, neither the record nor the findings of the \u00a7 59H motion judge allow us to determine whether the absence of certiorari jurisdiction should have been apparent to the homeowners (or at least their attorney) at the time they filed their complaint.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In his memorandum of decision dismissing the certiorari complaint, the judge observed that the portions of the Tewksbury by-law that are more stringent than those of the State Wetlands Protection Act are those that impose additional buffer zone requirements under a section of the Tewksbury bylaw, but that the plaintiffs made no allegations under that section. In his supplemental findings after remand, the \u00a7 59H motion judge stated that it was only during the hearing on the home<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>owners\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings in the certiorari action that it became clear that they based their certiorari complaint on the claim that the order of conditions contravened the DEP\u2019s stormwater policy rather than on any provision of the Tewksbury by-law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, neither the judge\u2019s findings nor the arguments of the parties describe with any particularity how the allegations of the complaint assert any ground that a reasonable person could justifiably have thought to invoke those provisions of the Tewksbury by-law that are more stringent than the requirements of the State Wetlands Protection Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We need not resolve whether the homeowners\u2019 complaint presented a col-orable question of jurisdiction, however, since the nonffivolous nature of the homeowners\u2019 complaint was finally and conclusively established when Demoulas\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, in the certiorari action was denied.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u201cThe doctrine of issue preclusion provides that when an issue has been \u2018actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties whether on the same or different claim.\u2019 <em>Cousineau </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>v. <em>Laramee, </em>388 Mass. 859, 863 n.4 (1983), quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982).\u201d <em>Jarosz </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>436 Mass. 526, 530-531 (2002). See <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 25 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Both the homeowners and Demoulas were parties to the prior certiorari action and to the G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, proceeding that followed it. The denial of Demoulas\u2019s \u00a7 6F motion was subject to appeal (though Demoulas took no appeal); the order of denial was accordingly final and conclusive for purposes of the doctrine of issue preclusion. See <em>Jarosz </em>v. <em>Palmer, supra </em>at 534 (in order for determination to be final there must be available avenue for appellate review).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Demoulas argues that the finding that the homeowners\u2019 certiorari complaint was not frivolous should not be given preclusive effect, because its \u00a7 6F motion was collateral to the disposition of the homeowners\u2019 underlying certiorari complaint. See <em>Ben </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 808, 813 (1999). The argument is misplaced. The proceeding on Demoulas\u2019s \u00a7 6F motion was collateral to the underlying certiorari complaint in the sense that it was separate and independent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, within the context of the \u00a7 6F proceeding relevant to the present case, the determination that the homeowners\u2019 complaint was not frivolous was essential to the result; though an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 6F generally requires a showing that the action is both frivolous and advanced in bad faith, in the present case the \u00a7 6F motion judge specifically declined to reach the bad faith issue and based his denial of a fee award on his conclusion that the homeowners\u2019 complaint was not frivolous. Compare <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. at 412 (prior fee request denied because judge was \u201cunable to brand the attorney\u2019s conduct as \u2018bad faith\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">It remains for us to consider whether the issue decided in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u00a7 6F proceeding is identical to the issue involved in the \u00a7 59H motion. That is to say, for purposes of issue preclusion, is a determination that an action is not \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous\u201d under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, equivalent to a determination that it is not \u201cdevoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law\u201d? Though we acknowledge that the two statutory standards are not linguistic mirrors of each other, we are persuaded that they resolve the same essential question.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u201cFrivolous\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201cof little weight or importance: having no basis in law or fact.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 913 (1993). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 692 (8th ed. 2004) similarly defines the term as \u201c[l]acking a legal basis or legal merit; not serious; not reasonably purposeful.\u201d As applied to a claim, the plain meaning of the word \u201cfrivolous\u201d describes an absence of legal or factual basis for the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Though no Massachusetts appellate decision has had occasion to compare the standard of \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous\u201d under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, with that of \u201cdevoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law\u201d under the anti-SLAPP statute, our cases have tended to equate the standard under the anti-SLAPP statute with the concept of frivolousness. See, e.g., <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 595, 600 (2000), citing <em>Home Sav. Bank of America, FSB </em>v. <em>Camillo, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 910, 912 (1998). In <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 165, the court commented that the test under Mass.R.Civ.P. 11, 365 Mass. 753 (1974), which addresses whether there is a good faith basis to believe that a claim has a basis in fact or law, see <em>Van Christo Advertising, Inc. </em>v. <em>M/A-COM/LCS, </em>426 Mass. 410, 416 (1998), \u201cechoes\u201d the first prong of the test to defeat a special motion to dismiss under the anti-SLAPP statute. Continuing, the discussion in <em>Duracraft </em>then used the term \u201cfrivolous\u201d in observing that the focus of the test under the anti-SLAPP statute is on the merit of the defendants\u2019 prior petitioning activity, rather than on the merit of the claim that is targeted by the anti-SLAPP special motion to dismiss. <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We also note that, after enacting the anti-SLAPP statute, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Legislature has equated the term \u201cfrivolous\u201d with the standard of \u201cdevoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law\u201d in creating a cognate special motion to dismiss under the lis pendens statute. See G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 15(c), inserted by St. 2002, c. 496, \u00a7 2 (\u201cThe special motion to dismiss shall be granted if the court finds that the action or claim is frivolous <em>because </em>(1) it is devoid of any reasonable factual support; or (2) it is devoid of any arguable basis in law; or (3) the action or claim is subject to dismissal based on a valid legal defense such as the statute of frauds\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">According preclusive effect for \u00a7 59H purposes to a prior adjudication that a claim is not frivolous is consistent with the purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute because it relieves citizens of the burden of having to prove, in successive proceedings, the nonfrivolous nature of their protected petitioning activity. And it further reduces the likelihood that disputes over the petitioning activity itself will spawn excessive \u201csatellite litigation.\u201d Cf. <em>Van Christo Advertising, Inc. </em>v. <em>M/A-COM/LCS, supra </em>at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Demoulas\u2019s complaint was based solely on the homeowners\u2019 certiorari complaint, which constituted petitioning activity within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP statute. The denial of Demoulas\u2019s prior motion for attorney\u2019s fees, under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, on the sole ground that the certiorari complaint was not wholly insubstantial and frivolous, precludes Demoulas from contending, in opposition to the homeowners\u2019 special motion to dismiss under the anti-SLAPP statute, that the certiorari complaint was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law. The judgment of the Superior Court is accordingly affirmed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The anti-SLAPP statute entitles the homeowners to their attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred on appeal.

However, Demoulas did not submit the administrative record with its opposition to the homeowners\u2019 motion, so its factual assertions on standing were wholly unsubstantiated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">For purposes of examining the question, we consider the record as it stood before the \u00a7 59H motion judge when he ruled on the homeowners\u2019 special motion to dismiss. With its opposition to the homeowners\u2019 special motion to dismiss, Demoulas did not submit the record from the certiorari action, a copy of the Tewksbury wetlands protection by-law, or even the certiorari complaint, instead arguing (as it continues to argue on appeal) that the dismissal on jurisdictional grounds was sufficient to establish that the homeowners\u2019 complaint was baseless. Though Demoulas presented additional materials to the motion judge during the proceedings on remand for supplemental findings, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>we agree with the homeowners that Demoulas may not rely for support of its position on appeal on evidentiary materials not presented to the motion judge in opposition to the homeowners\u2019 special motion to dismiss prior to their appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Demoulas disputes the accuracy of the finding that the homeowners\u2019 exclusive reliance on the DEP\u2019s stormwater management policy emerged only at the hearing. However, the only support Demoulas cites for its assertion is its opposition to the homeowners\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings in the certiorari action, which Demoulas did not include in the record. The burden to provide a complete record is, of cours\u00e9, on the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">We disregard for this purpose the judge\u2019s comments in his supplemental findings concerning the potential applicability of a section of the Tewksbury by-law, because the homeowners did not assert any such claim in their certiorari complaint or in any of their other submissions. We also do not consider those supplemental findings entered by the judge which examined the potential merit of the homeowners\u2019 flooding concerns, as the potential merit of their claims does not confer jurisdiction on the Superior Court (as compared to the DEP) to hear them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\"> \u201cIt is well established that, on appeal, we may consider any ground apparent on the record that supports the result reached in the lower court.\u201d <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Federal Natl.

Though the \u00a7 59H motion judge did not rest his determination that the homeowners\u2019 certiorari complaint was not devoid of reasonable factual support or arguable basis in law on the prior determination that the complaint was not wholly insubstantial and frivolous, we note that the homeowners argued issue preclusion both to the motion judge and on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\">For purposes of issue preclusion, it does not matter that the \u00a7 6F motion judge did not hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion. See <em>Jarosz </em>v. <em>Palmer, supra </em>at 531-532. Section 6F provides the opportunity for actual litigation of the issues of frivolousness, insubstantiality, and lack of good faith. The statute requires the court to hold a hearing on the motion and to enter findings and reasons in support of any award. See <em>Strand </em>v. <em>Herrick &amp; Smith, </em>396 Mass. 783, 791-792 (1986); <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Greyhound Real Estate Fin. Co., </em>41 Mass.
