L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 5A-50, inserted by St. 2000, c. 159, \u00a7 18, because of his role in uncovering fraudulent practices by Putnam Investments, Inc. (Putnam). We agree with the motion judge\u2019s reasoning, set forth in a thoughtful memorandum of decision, that Scannell\u2019s failure to file a qui tam action against Putnam on behalf of the Commonwealth or its subdivisions precludes recovery under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>MFCA. We also conclude that Scannell is not entitled to recover on the basis of his asserted equitable theories.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We take as true the allegations set out in Scanners amended complaint, drawing inferences therefrom and resolving doubts in his favor. See <em>Warner-Lambert Co. </em>v. <em>Execu-quest Corp., </em>427 Mass. 46, 47 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In 2000, while Scannell was working as a call center service representative for Putnam, he became aware that his employer was engaging in \u201cmarket-timing\u201d activity and excessive short-term trading with respect to a particular fund. As described in Scannell\u2019s complaint, \u201c[m]arket-timing is frequent trading by short-term investors hoping to exploit fund share prices that lag behind the value of underlying securities assets.\u201d Although that practice is not itself illegal, mutual fund advisors have a duty to treat investors equally. Market-timing detrimentally affects long-term investors, and Putnam misrepresented in its prospectus that it did not engage in the activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Scannell transferred to another Putnam division as a broker in December, 2001, and there learned that the company allowed certain preferred investors to engage in market-timing and reap the benefits, and that some fund managers also profited. He became aware that among Putnam clients that stood to be harmed by the market-timing were several Massachusetts municipalities and a State-run institutional investor. Concerned, Scannell conducted research and acquired information about increased market-timing activity at Putnam and confronted his superiors with this information, but they did nothing to curtail the practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Scannell resolved to report Putnam\u2019s activities to the appropriate authorities and retrieved incriminating data from company computers. In September, 2003, represented by an attorney, Scan-nell gave the data he had amassed to the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Securities Division (Secretary of State). Based on this evidence, the Secretary of State commenced an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>investigation that led to the filing of an administrative complaint against Putnam. The Federal Securities and Exchange Commission then also filed a complaint against the company on the same grounds in Federal Court. Both actions were settled with Putnam acknowledging wrongdoing. In the settlement and consent order entered into between the Secretary of State and Putnam, Putnam agreed to pay a $50 million fine to the Commonwealth in addition to restitution to investors that had suffered losses attributable to the illegal activities. The amount due to investors was eventually determined to be $88.5 million. In the parallel Federal Court action, Putnam agreed to pay $55 million in restitution and penalties. All told, Putnam paid a total of $193.5 million to settle the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In July, 2005, Scannell commenced the within action against the Attorney General and the Commonwealth claiming, in essence, that he is entitled under provisions of the MFCA to a percentage of the total $193.5 million recovery from Putnam.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The amended complaint also alleges that as a result of his efforts leading to exposure of Putnam\u2019s practices, Scannell incurred serious head injuries, developed significant emotional trauma and stress for which he requires medical care, became unemployable within the securities industry, and suffered a significant loss in earning capacity and salary. As additional bases for relief, the amended complaint seeks recovery under a theory of unjust enrichment and asserts equitable remedies of restitution and constructive trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was allowed \u201cas to all claims.\u201d Scannell\u2019s motions for reconsideration and clarification were denied, and he filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">2. <em>Discussion. Claims under the MFCA. </em>The MFCA encourages individuals with direct and independent knowledge of information that an entity is defrauding the Commonwealth to come forward by awarding to such individuals a percentage of the Commonwealth\u2019s recovery from the defrauding entity. See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 5A, 5C(2), 5F. To be entitled to the bounty, an individual in possession of such knowledge must attain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>status of a \u201crelator\u201d by filing suit against the defrauding entity in Superior Court in the name of the Commonwealth or a subdivision thereof. See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5C(2). See also G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5A, defining \u201c[r]elator\u201d as \u201can individual who brings an action under paragraph (2) of section 5C.\u201d Such an action is also referred to as a \u201cqui tam\u201d action. \u201cThis is a Latin expression which translates in full into \u2018who sues on behalf of the king as well as for himself.\u2019 It is an action brought by an informer sometimes called a \u2018whistle blower.\u2019 His motive is to expose and redress a wrong, generally a fraud or false claim against the government and also to collect his bounty for his action.\u201d Nolan &amp; Sartorio, Equitable Remedies \u00a7 476A, at 139 (2d ed. 2003 &amp; Supp. 2006). See <em>United States ex rel. Lu </em>v. <em>Ou, </em>368 F.3d 773, 774 (7th Cir. 2004).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The complaint must be filed under seal and a copy served on the Attorney General along with \u201cwritten disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the relator possesses.\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5C(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The complaint remains under seal for 120 days (or longer, if the court grants extensions as provided in the statute), during which time the Attorney General may elect to intervene on behalf of the Commonwealth or a political subdivision. <em>Ibid. </em>This period affords the Attorney General the opportunity to assess the merits of the qui tam action and determine how best to proceed. See <em>United States ex rel. Williams </em>v. <em>Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., 417 </em>F.3d 450, 455 (5th Cir. 2005). Before the expiration of this 120-day period (or any extensions thereof), the Attorney General must either \u201cassume control of the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by [her],\u201d or \u201cnotify the court that [she] declines to take over the action, in which case the relator shall have the right to conduct the action.\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5C(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u201cIf the attorney general proceeds with the action, [she] shall have primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by any act of the relator,\u201d who shall have the right to continue as a party. G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5D(1). Upon a showing by the Attorney General, the court may <em>restrict </em>the relator\u2019s involvement, such as by placing limits on the number of witnesses the relator may call, or \u201cotherwise limiting the participation by the relator in the litigation.\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5D(4). Notwithstanding any objection by the relator, the Attorney General may enter into a settlement that is determined by the court to be \u201cfair, adequate and reasonable\u201d or \u201cmay dismiss the action.\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5D(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Even if the Attorney General declines initially to intervene in the action, she may monitor the qui tam suit and has the right to receive copies of all pleadings and deposition transcripts. G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5D(6). On a showing of good cause, a court may permit the Attorney General to intervene at a later date. <em>Ibid. </em>If the Attorney General decides against intervention, the relator then prosecutes the action, but any recovery is still subject to the provisions of the MFCA. See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5F.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The MFCA further subordinates the interests of a would-be relator to those of the Commonwealth, the real party in interest, by placing restrictions on the ability of a would-be relator to file a qui tam lawsuit. For example, no person may bring a qui tam complaint predicated on information that is already the subject of a civil suit or administrative proceeding to which the Commonwealth is a party, see G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5G(2), and no court has subject matter jurisdiction over an action brought by a relator based upon publicly disclosed allegations or transactions, unless the relator is an \u201coriginal source of the information\u201d that forms the foundation of the action. G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5G(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Because Scannell has failed to establish that he is a relator pursuant to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5A, we reject his claim that he is entitled to enforcement of the bounty provision of the MFCA. See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5F(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The words of the statute plainly reflect that the bounty is available only to a person who has filed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Superior Court an action under seal in the name of the Commonwealth or its subdivisions and has served upon the Attorney General a copy of the complaint and all supporting information in accordance with the statute. See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 5A et seq. See also <em>Walburn </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>431 F.3d 966, 970 (6th Cir. 2005) (would-be relators must place government on notice of essential facts of case by service of the qui tarn complaint on the government). Because Scannell failed to bring a qui tarn suit against Putnam in Superior Court on behalf of the Commonwealth or its subdivisions in accordance with the provisions of the MFCA, he is precluded from receiving a portion of the settlement proceeds recovered by the defendants in settlement of proceedings initiated by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We disagree with Scannell\u2019s assertion that our conclusion contradicts the legislative intent of the statute. The history of the analogous Federal False Claims Act\u2019s qui tarn provisions demonstrates attempts by Congress to balance competing policies: (1) \u201cto encourage \u2018whistleblowers to act as private attomeysgeneral\u2019 in bringing suits for the common good . . . [, and (2)] to discourage opportunistic plaintiffs from bringing parasitic lawsuits whereby would-be relators merely feed off a previous disclosure of fraud.\u201d <em>Walburn </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>431 F.3d at 970 (citations omitted). These goals are promoted by the requirement that individuals seeking to recover a bounty must first file suit and be prepared to prosecute the action to conclusion. See Sylvia, The False Claims Act: Fraud Against the Government \u00a7 1:12, at 13-15 (2004); Androphy, Federal False Claims and Qui Tam Litigation \u00a7 2.02 (2d ed. 2007). The requirement involves individuals in the prosecution of claims, increasing the likelihood that \u201cthe Government does not neglect evidence, cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>undu[e] delay, or drop the false claims case without legitimate reason,\u201d and frees up governmental resources.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> S. Rep. No. 99-345, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., at 26 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C. C.A.N. 5266, 5291. See Sylvia, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 2.9, at 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Permitting a person in Scannell\u2019s position to share in the settlement proceeds against Putnam would effectively eliminate the qui tam lawsuit requirement and undermine the foregoing objectives, all of which are reflected in the statutory framework of the MFCA. The requirement of filing suit is no mere technicality, and Scannell, \u201c[a] person who did not satisfy the requirements of [the statute] in bringing a qui tam action[,] can not share in a subsequent government recovery.\u201d <em>Stinson, Lyons &amp; Bustamante, P.A. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>79 F.3d 136, 138 (Fed. Cir. 1996). See <em>ibid. </em>(\u201c[w]e do not share [the] view that it is not necessary to be a relator in order to share in a recovery obtained under the False Claims Act\u201d); <em>Donald </em>v. <em>University of Cal. Bd. of Regents, </em>329 F.3d 1040, 1044 (9th Cir. 2003) (private party \u201chas a legal right to recovery only from a qui tam action brought pursuant to [the False Claims Act]\u201d). See also <em>United States ex rel. Green </em>v. <em>Northrop Corp., </em>59 F.3d 953, 965-969 (9th Cir. 1995) (courts should construe the False Claims Act to encourage the bringing of qui tam lawsuits).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">We also reject Scannell\u2019s claims that he is entitled to recover because the Commonwealth elected to prosecute its claims against Putnam through administrative proceedings, an \u201calternate remedy\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5E.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\"><em>Other claims. </em>We similarly reject Scannell\u2019s claims for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>covery under a theory of unjust enrichment and other equitable remedies. \u201cThe underlying basis for awarding quantum meruit damages in a quasi-contract case is unjust enrichment of one party and unjust detriment to the other party.\u201d <em>Salomon </em>v. <em>Terra, </em>394 Mass. 857, 859 (1985). Because Scannell never attained relator status and therefore was not entitled to a bounty, his complaint fails to allege a cognizable detriment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Santagate </em>v. <em>Tower, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 324, 329 (2005) (\u201cequitable remedy for unjust enrichment is not available to a party with an adequate remedy at law\u201d). Injury to the Commonwealth, not Scannell, gave rise to the Commonwealth\u2019s action and eventual recompense. See <em>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Stevens, </em>529 U.S. 765, 772-773 (2000) (qui tam relator has \u201ca concrete private interest in the outcome of [the] suit\u201d but that interest is the same as that of \u201csomeone who has placed a wager upon the outcome. ... A qui tam relator has suffered no [personal harm]\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is affirmed, and judgment shall enter accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-9\">We note that no judgment of dismissal appears to have been entered in the trial court. It also does not appear that the appellant was granted leave to file an interlocutory appeal. In our discretion, we reach the merits of issues briefed by the parties and addressed by the motion judge. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>391 Mass. 517, 519-520 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Of this amount, the $55 million Putnam paid on account of the Federal Court action was presumably pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act. See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729 et seq. (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b73-6\">There is little decisional law interpreting the MFCA, and its legislative history is scant. However, the MFCA was modeled on the similarly worded Federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729 et seq. See Davidson, Governmental Responses to Elder Abuse and Neglect in Nursing Homes: The Criminal Justice System and the Civil False Claims Act, 12 Elder L.J. 327, 351 n.183 (2004). Therefore, we look for guidance to cases and treatises interpreting the Federal False Claims Act. See <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 611 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Service on the Attorney General must be conducted in accordance with Mass.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(3), as amended, 370 Mass. 918 (1976).

G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5F(1). If the court finds that the action is based primarily on information other than that provided by the relator, \u201cthe court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 per cent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the relator bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation.\u201d G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5F(2). \u201cIf the attorney general does not proceed with an action pursuant to section 5C [of the MFCA], the relator bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive . . . not less than 25 per cent nor more than 30 per cent of the proceeds\u201d collected on behalf of the Commonwealth, as well as reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5F(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\"> \u201cMost obviously, public resource scarcity typically requires an executive agency charged with enforcing the law to assess not only \u2018whether a violation has occurred, but whether agency resources are best spent on this violation or another, whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts, whether the particular enforcement action . . . best fits the agency\u2019s overall policies, and, indeed, whether the agency has enough resources to undertake the action at all.\u2019 \u201d Caminker, The Constitutionality of Qui Tam Actions, 99 Yale L.J. 341, 359 (1989), quoting from <em>Heckler </em>v. <em>Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Section 5E of G.

In neither case was the relator status of the plaintiff at issue. Thus, the cases do not stand for the proposition that a whistleblower may recover a bounty where a qui tam suit was never filed. See <em>United States ex rel. Bledsoe </em>v. <em>Community Health Sys., Inc., </em>342 F.3d 634, 650 (6th Cir. 2003) (\u201ca threshold requirement for a relator\u2019s ability to share in the proceeds of a [False Claims Act] lawsuit is to file a valid qui tam action\u201d); United States <em>vs. </em>Bisig, U.S. Dist.
