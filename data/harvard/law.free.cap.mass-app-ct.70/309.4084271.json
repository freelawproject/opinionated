The petitioner\u2019s argument is limited solely to the following determination by the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-14\">\u201cUpon careful reading, however, it does not appear that the hearing officer found, or assumed, that the 1991 of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>fense was a forcible rape. The conclusion that Doe \u2018sexually assaulted a stranger child victim, raping her multiple times over a two-hour period,\u2019 is a technically correct (if vivid) description of a conviction on two counts of statutory rape, where the offender had known the victim for less than 24 hours. See 83 [Code of Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 1.40 (3)(c).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The petitioner asserts that this determination by the judge, and the findings of the hearing officer regarding the sexual assault are error because the only evidence of a forcible rape was the statement of the victim contained in the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) police report, and in the Department of Correction (department) records of the petitioner. Because the evidence of the statements is hearsay, the petitioner argues that there was not substantial evidence to classify him as a level three sex offender. Our reading of the hearing officer\u2019s decision confirms that he credited the victim\u2019s statement when he found that the petitioner committed a forcible rape (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A), despite having pleaded guilty to statutory rape (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23). This reading is underscored in the hearing officer\u2019s discussion of the petitioner\u2019s refusal to participate in sex offender therapy. Specifically, he faults the petitioner for having \u201cconsistently denied that he forced the victim to have sexual intercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The police report at issue, summarized in the department\u2019s record, stated that the victim and two other girls had traveled from Randolph into Boston together and in the train station became casually acquainted with the petitioner, who was then twenty years old. After spending some hours in Boston they returned to the station to catch a train home and again encountered and talked with the petitioner, who held the victim back while the others boarded the train. As the door closed, the petitioner yelled to the others to get off at the next stop. He then forced the victim to go up to the street and into a car with two other males in it. They drove about fifteen minutes to a house. The victim and the petitioner entered the house and went to a bedroom, where the petitioner closed the door, stripped her clothing off, forced her onto the bed, and had penile-vaginal intercourse with her over her objections. The petitioner\u2019s story, to which he testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>fled at the hearing, was that the victim went with him voluntarily, that the acts of intercourse were voluntary, that he walked her to a bus when she was ready to leave, that she gave him a ring to remember her by, that they planned to get together again, but that when he called her she \u201csounded strange\u201d and told him not to call again.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The petitioner\u2019s argument in the Superior Court was that in order to classify him as a level three offender, the hearing examiner had to base his findings of forcible rape on totem pole hearsay, namely, the department\u2019s rendition of the facts of the index crime, derived from the original MBTA police report, which was also contained in the department\u2019s record but was too illegible to read. The Superior Court judge agreed that if the hearing examiner\u2019s decision were based on second and third level hearsay, reversal would be required for want of substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the judge\u2019s view, the only credible evidence in the record as to the facts of the index crime was (1) the convictions themselves, which were of statutory (i.e., non-forcible) rape of a child (two counts); and (2) the petitioner\u2019s testimony, which was of consensual sex with a female claiming to be seventeen. Hence, the significance of the judge\u2019s statement, quoted in the opening paragraphs, whereby he affirmed the decision of the hearing examiner. The judge\u2019s thorough review of the hearing officer\u2019s report and the record before him, however, was crucial to his decision to affirm the board\u2019s classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">An appeal from a classification decision by the board is pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and is confined to the administrative record. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M. In reviewing the record we must determine whether the decision of the board is supported by substantial evidence. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>No. 1211 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 750, 764 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The issue presented by this appeal is whether the hearing examiner erred in crediting the statement attributed to the victim where the statement was presented to him through a partially illegible police report and the department\u2019s records. Our conclusion is that he did not err when he relied on the report as substantive evidence in support of the level three classification. The documents that related the victim\u2019s story bore the requisite indi-cia of reliability to be admissible in the administrative hearing. <em>Embers of Salisbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 526, 530 (1988). See also <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Serv., </em>439 Mass. 766, 786 (2003) (\u201cSubstantial evidence may be based on hearsay alone if that hearsay has \u2018indicia of reliability\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The most legible account of the victim\u2019s story is the synopsis contained in the department\u2019s classification report. The department\u2019s synopsis, having been based on the original police report, is third level hearsay. The danger of third level hearsay, as contrasted with second level hearsay (i.e., the victim\u2019s statement in the police report), is that it may not accurately represent the second level hearsay. In this case that danger is not present. The original police report, although in parts illegible, included in its legible portions verification of all the substantial elements related in the department\u2019s report, including such details as that there were five instances of penetration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">While the board, under its regulations, is not bound by the rules of evidence observed by courts but may receive and consider evidence of a kind \u201con which reasonable people are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs,\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 119(1), a non-eyewitness police report, standing alone, cannot constitute substantial evidence within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A. See <em>Merisme </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies and Bonds, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 470, 473-476 (1989). However, particular narratives related therein may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>admissible in board hearings depending on the general plausibility and consistency of the victim\u2019s or witness\u2019s story, the circumstances under which it is related, the degree of detail, the motives of the narrator, the presence or absence of corroboration and the like. See, e.g., <em>Dolphino Corp. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. Control Commn., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 954, 956 (1990) (police reports admitted without limitation, certain details of which were corroborated by testimony, considered sufficiently plausible to constitute substantive evidence before the ABCC); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 131, 137 (2005) (statements in police reports, admitted at a probation surrender hearing, are reliable where they are corroborated by the defendant\u2019s admissions). The victim\u2019s story, contained in the police reports, was plausible, consistent and highly detailed. It was corroborated by the petitioner\u2019s testimony wherein he admitted that he had taken the victim to a house in the neighborhood and engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">For purposes of the board\u2019s classification decision, we conclude that the hearing examiner did not err in giving credence to the victim\u2019s story as appearing in the department\u2019s classification report and the partially legible police report on which it was based.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A hearing examiner of the board is not, in our view, limited to the terms of the plea agreement, which can be and generally is based on factors other than the facts of the case. The board\u2019s level three classification is not otherwise challenged in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Although the index crimes were the only offenses of a sexual nature on the defendant\u2019s record, the record is replete with other offenses, including a manslaughter conviction and numerous prison disciplinary violations, supporting the examiner\u2019s conclusion that he is of a nature not well restrained by community mores and that, due to having been released from prison relatively recently, he needs more offense-free time in the community to live down his past.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The judge wrote: \u201cA superficial reading of the hearing officer\u2019s decision including ... his conclusion that Doe had \u2018sexually assaulted a stranger child victim, raping her multiple times over a two-hour period\u2019 could leave one with the impression that the hearing officer relied on, and credited, the second-level hearsay, mostly illegible account of the offense appearing in the MBTA [plolice report, or (more likely) the far more legible third-level summary in the [department\u2019s] [classification [r]eport. Were this the case, reversal and remand would be required, as hearsay statements appearing in a police report cannot, absent adequate \u2018indicia of reliability and probative value,\u2019 stand alone as substantial evidence for an agency finding. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b336-8\">We mention the five instances of penetration because the judge stated that he found no basis in the record for the hearing examiner\u2019s finding of four instances, that at most the record only substantiated two instances, which he (the judge) based on the number of court convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">It is not unlikely that the department official who prepared the classification report in 1991 had the benefit of a more legible copy of the police report than the one reproduced in our record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
