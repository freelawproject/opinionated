On March 15, 2005, the defendant offered to give Renaldo Cox a ride to his math class that started at 8:00 p.m.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant was driving a red Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle. The defendant picked up two more friends, Jose Mow and Carlos Moore, and because it was still early, the foursome drove to the Archdale Community Center to see if they could reserve a basketball court to use after the defendant dropped Cox off at his class. The community center is located in the Archdale housing development in the Roslindale area of Boston. They arrived at the community center at about 7:30 p.m. The defendant and Mow, who was sitting directly behind the defendant in the rear passenger seat, got out of the vehicle and went around the corner of the community center. Cox remained in the front passenger seat, and Moore stayed in the rear passenger seat directly behind him.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">After about two or three minutes, Cox heard gun shots and saw the defendant and Mow run back to the vehicle. When the defendant opened the door to get in, Cox testified, \u201ca gun landed in my lap\u201d and \u201cI tossed it in the back.\u201d Although the defendant had a gunshot wound to the stomach, he got into the driver\u2019s seat and tried to drive himself to the hospital. The defendant drove for about thirty seconds on Washington Street in Roslindale and then pulled into the Emporium gasoline station and stopped. He opened the driver\u2019s side door and fell out.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Officer Kenneth Reid saw the defendant drive by him on Washington Street between 7:45 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. Reid was working undercover on Washington Street and was in a parked, unmarked Chevrolet Trailblazer when the defendant passed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>location. The defendant\u2019s vehicle caught his attention because it \u201cwas traveling on the wrong side of the street on Washington Street ... at a high rate of speed and passing cars on the right.\u201d When pressed to explain what he meant by the \u201cwrong side of the street,\u201d he explained that he meant the \u201cleft hand side of the street, and usually you travel on the right hand side.\u201d Reid saw the vehicle stop in the gasoline station and the driver \u201cstumble out on to the pavement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">When the defendant fell out of the vehicle, Cox got out and walked to the driver\u2019s side to try to help him. At about the same time, Reid and two other officers got out of the Trailblazer, displayed their badges and firearms, and yelled, \u201cBoston police \u2014 Stop.\u201d Cox got into the driver\u2019s seat of the Explorer and drove away because he saw two men running toward them with guns drawn and did not know that they were police officers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The defense called one witness \u2014 Mow. Mow testified that when they arrived at the Archdale Community Center, he got out of the Explorer and went alone to the gym. Mow had made arrangements to meet a friend there, but when he could not find him, he turned around and went back to the Explorer. Mow was nervous and did not feel safe without his friend because neither he, nor anyone with whom he had arrived, lived in the Archdale housing development or knew anyone who did. As he started to walk back to the Explorer, there was a \u201ccommotion outside, like there was all kind of people around,\u201d and he saw the defendant walking toward him \u201cto make sure that everything was all right with [him].\u201d As they walked together to the Explorer, \u201cthe shooting started to happen, and [the defendant] accidentally got hit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">According to Mow, \u201cthe two dudes that were shooting they ran off in the same direction towards us, towards the [Explorer].\u201d When Mow and the defendant got to the Explorer, Moore was outside smoking a cigarette, and Cox was still inside. The defendant got into the driver\u2019s seat, and Mow got into the backseat. As the defendant drove the car, he kept repeating, \u201cI am shot, I got <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>to get to the hospital.\u201d Mow did not hate a driver\u2019s license, nor did he know how to drive. Mow did not notice anything unusual about the defendant\u2019s condition while he was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant argues that the police testimony that he was driving on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of the road \u201ccannot substitute for hard evidence that [the defendant] violated traffic laws or was driving in a hazardous manner.\u201d The testimony properly permits an inference that he was driving in the oncoming lane of traffic. Such conduct is sufficient to sustain his conviction for reckless driving. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horsfall, </em>213 Mass. 232, 235 (1913); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Con-stantino, </em>443 Mass. 521, 526-527 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">2. <em>Necessity defense. </em>The defendant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a necessity instruction on the basis that \u201che was fleeing mortal danger and attempting to reach the hospital for treatment of a life threatening injury.\u201d \u201cThe occasions when a court can resolve an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal are exceptional, and our case law strongly disfavors raising ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zinser, </em>446 Mass. 807, 809 n.2 (2006). The claim may nevertheless be resolved on direct appeal when \u201cthe factual basis of the [ineffective assistance] claim appears indisputably on the trial record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>448 Mass. 286,289 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zinser, </em>446 Mass. at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The defense of necessity in the common law provides that \u201ca crime committed under the pressure of imminent danger may be excused if the harm sought to be avoided far exceeds the harm resulting from the crime committed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schuchardt, </em>408 Mass. 347, 349 (1990).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defense is limited to \u201cthe following circumstances: (1) the defendant is faced with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>clear and imminent danger, not one which is debatable or speculative; (2) the defendant can reasonably expect that his [or her] action will be effective as the direct cause of abating the danger; [and] (3) there is [no] legal alternative which will be effective in abating the danger.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>389 Mass. 581, 591 (1983), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brugmann, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 379 (1982). Only where \u201cthere is evidence that would warrant a reasonable doubt whether [the defendant\u2019s actions were] justified as a choice between evils\u201d is the defendant entitled to an instruction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leno, </em>415 Mass. 835, 839 (1993), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schuchardt, </em>408 Mass. at 349. \u201cIf the question is properly raised, the Commonwealth then has the burden to prove the absence of justification beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brugmann, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Here, there is little dispute that the evidence was sufficient to establish the first requirement, that the defendant faced imminent danger as he fled from the gunman who shot him in the abdomen. The second element requires proof that the defendant reasonably expects that his action will be effective as the direct cause of abating the danger. Where the evidence shows that the defendant drove away quickly to obtain medical help, it is readily inferable that his actions abated the immediate risk of being shot again while simultaneously seeking medical help for his wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Third, the evidence must suggest that there was no available legal alternative. The evidence shows that the defendant drove about one-quarter mile on Washington Street, for a period of about thirty seconds, and that at some point in this short trip, he exceeded the speed limit while in the oncoming lane. There was testimony that the defendant had to pass several cars on his right, but there was no evidence that there were any cars in the oncoming lane of traffic. In these circumstances, we conclude there was sufficient evidence produced to raise a \u201creasonable doubt whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>[the defendant\u2019s actions were] justified as a choice between evils.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leno, </em>415 Mass. at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Here, the risk of harm posed by the gunshot wound to defendant\u2019s abdomen outweighed the harm posed by his having briefly driven on the wrong side of the road to reach a location where he could obtain assistance. See <em>Tarvestad </em>v. <em>State, </em>261 Ga. 605, 606 (1991) (necessity defense properly raised where defendant drove without license in order to bring his pregnant wife, who was having early labor pains, to doctor); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>304 S.C. 47, 48-50 (1991) (error for judge to refuse to charge jury on defense of necessity where defendant drove with suspended license in order to get to telephone to call for help for his wife who was six months pregnant and experiencing significant pain). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>400 Mass. 612, 615 (1987) (necessity defense appropriate when defendant \u201cseizes a firearm from one who had expressed an immediate intention to use it, and flees [with the weapon] to a place of safe-keeping\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Iglesia, </em>403 Mass. 132, 133-134 (1988) (evidence that defendant wrested gun from assailant and went directly to police station to turn it in was sufficient to raise necessity defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">We conclude in this case that the defense of necessity was fairly raised by the evidence and that the instruction should have been given. Because we can discern no basis for trial counsel\u2019s failure to request the instruction, we conclude that counsel was ineffective, and that \u201cbetter work might have accomplished something material for the defence.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977). To the extent the defendant also argues that the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury, sua sponte, on the defense of necessity created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, the outcome is unchanged; whether the issue is viewed in terms of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness or whether the judge\u2019s failure created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, the standards are essentially the same. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>435 Mass. 675, 685 (2002). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 698, 701 (2002) (judge\u2019s failure to instruct on self-defense, sua sponte, even absent request from defense counsel, created substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>risk of miscarriage of justice where there was evidentiary basis for instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aao-dedup-1\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-16\">The complaint on which the defendant was tried also indicated that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>cited civilly for committing a marked lanes violation and a passing violation. At the conclusion of the trial, the judge found the defendant responsible for each infraction and placed the citations on file.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Cox was also charged with illegal possession of ammunition as the result of his participation in the incident. At the time of his testimony in this case, Cox had pleaded guilty and was awaiting sentencing. In exchange for his testimony, the Commonwealth agreed to recommend that the guilty finding be changed to a continuation without a finding and to recommend a lighter sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Cox was stopped shortly thereafter, and a search of the Explorer turned up a handgun under the right rear passenger seat. The gun had eight rounds of live ammunition in it. Cox, Mow, and Moore were arrested and taken to the police station.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 400 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brugmann, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 379 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Although some appellate cases have not explicitly weighed the competing harms at issue in assessing whether a defense of necessity has been raised, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Kane, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 466, 469-470 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ben B., </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 919-920 (2003), this principle is clearly a component of the decisional law and is a factor that should be considered in any determination whether the evidence sufficiently raises the defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schuchardt, </em>408 Mass. at 349; <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>v. <em>Hutchins, </em>410 Mass. 726, 730-731 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. at 400.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\">A fourth requirement was set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brugmann, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. at 379, but needs no discussion here: \u201cthe Legislature has not acted to preclude the defense by a clear and deliberate choice regarding the values at issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel is not the same as his trial counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
