L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, for purposes of calculating the plaintiffs\u2019 retirement allowances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board (board) and the Contribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>tory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> determined that they did not so qualify, the plaintiffs sought judicial review of CRAB\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. A judge of the Superior Court, concluding that CRAB was in error and that the payments were regular compensation, granted the plaintiffs judgment on the pleadings. This is an appeal by the board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The facts are not in dispute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During collective bargaining negotiations for the period September 1, 2002 to August 31, 2005 between the school committee and BEA, the teachers\u2019 exclusive bargaining representative,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the school committee proposed to increase the employee health insurance premium contribution rate from twenty percent to twenty-five percent of the cost of the total annual premium. After lengthy negotiations, the parties agreed, in a memorandum of agreement subsequently incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement, that teachers would contribute twenty-five percent of the premiums of the city-offered plan they had chosen and that active teachers who had been enrolled in a city-offered plan in 2002-2003 would receive stipends, effective July 1, 2003, \u201cto be paid as part of their regular salary.\u201d As explained in a parenthetical note, the stipends \u201cwill be the dollar amounts that correspond to five percent of the total annual premiums\u201d for the city-offered health insurance plan in which the teacher had been enrolled in 2002-2003.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To be eligible, teachers had to be employed in 2002-2003 and had to have been enrolled in a city-offered health insurance plan in 2002-2003. The collective bargaining agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\u201cBeginning on July 1, 2004, the listed stipends will be increased by the amount of the general salary increase in that year and in future years. Eligible teachers who change plans, change level of coverage, or drop off of health insurance entirely after June 30, 2003 will continue to receive the stipend that corresponds to the plan and level of coverage that they had during 2002-2003. Eligible teachers who return from an approved leave of absence or who are recalled after a layoff will remain eligible for the stipend. Eligible teachers who resign and who later are rehired, however, will no longer be eligible for the stipend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Thus, for the first year, the stipend was to be in an amount equal to the premiums paid, but thereafter the stipend was not tied to the cost of health insurance. In all subsequent years the stipend was to increase at the rate of the general salary increase of that year and to continue whether or not the teacher remained in a city-offered plan. One thousand fifty-nine of the BEA\u2019s approximately 1,400 members received the stipend.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In reviewing GRAB\u2019S decision, while we must give \u201c \u2018due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it\u2019 . . . [w]e exercise de nova review of legal questions, . . . and we must overturn agency decisions that are not consistent with governing law.\u201d <em>Bulger </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 447 </em>Mass. 651, 657 (2006) (citations omitted). As in that case the only dispute revolves around the term \u201cregular compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In relevant part, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1979, c. 681, defines \u201cregular compensation\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">\u201c \u2018Regular compensation\u2019. . . shall mean the salary, wages or other compensation in whatever form, lawfully determined for the individual service of the employee by the employing authority, not including bonus, overtime, severance pay for any and all unused sick leave, early retirement incentives, or any other payments made as a result of giving notice of retirement, . . . provided, that. . . salary, wages or other compensation payable in the form of cost of living bonuses and cost of living pay adjustments shall be included in such term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>In arguing for their respective interpretations of \u201cregular compensation\u201d \u2014 the board to exclude the stipend, and the plaintiffs to include it \u2014 both rely on <em>Boston Assn. of Sch. Administrators &amp; Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>383 Mass. 336 (1981). We turn to that case, which we will refer to as the <em>BASAS </em>case. After the Boston school committee intended to abolish certain administrative positions, it entered a collective bargaining agreement with the Boston Association of School Administrators and Supervisors (BASAS). Under the agreement a BASAS member who retired between ages fifty-five and sixty-five would receive as a \u201csalary increase\u201d either twenty percent of his final year\u2019s salary or ten percent of each of his last two years\u2019 salary. If a member received a payment but did not retire, he would be required to return the payment plus interest. <em>Id. </em>at 337-338. At issue was whether these payments to employees which were contingent on retirement were \u201cregular compensation\u201d for purposes of retirement benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In construing the statute (prior to its 1979 amendment), the <em>BASAS </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">\u201cThe yearly amount of a retirement allowance is by [G. L. c. 32,] \u00a7 5(2)(a) to be based on the \u2018average\u2019 rate of \u2018regular compensation\u2019 over the three years. The expression seems to us to point to recurrent or repeated amounts of compensation not inflated by extraordinary ad hoc payments. This view is confirmed when we go to the definition of \u2018regular compensation\u2019 in \u00a7 1. In the words \u2018salary, wages or other compensation in whatever form\u2019 the last generic phrase takes its color of meaning from \u2018salary\u2019 and \u2018wages,\u2019 . . . and the whole refers to remuneration geared to work or services performed; moreover \u2018regular,\u2019 as it modifies \u2018compensation,\u2019 imports the idea of ordinariness or normality as well as the idea of recurrence. All this contrasts with \u2018overtime\u2019 and with the compendious \u2018bonus\u2019 which are to be excluded from the compensation that figures in computing retirement benefits. Taking \u00a7 5(2)(a) together with \u00a7 1 we find a safeguard against the introduction into the computations of adventitious payments to employees which could place untoward, massive, continuing burdens on the retirement systems. (The safeguard is needed especially where the public entity that negotiates a collective agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ment is not the one that will have to find the funds to pay the continuing retirement benefits above the avails of employee contributions.) . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">\u201cThe payments are, in truth, not salary increases for those years, e.g., increases across the board to employees in given job classifications which do properly figure in retirement calculations, but money held out simply to induce early retirement. The payments promised are not \u2018regular compensation\u2019 but have the character of premiums to particular individuals, beyond such compensation, which conform to the idea of a \u2018bonus\u2019 in the common understanding of that term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 341-342 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The board lays stress on the language of remuneration geared to \u201cwork or services performed\u201d and argues that the stipend here is not for such work or services but is a bonus for particular employees. Eligibility for the stipend is not dependent on services provided by a teacher but rather on whether he or she was an active teacher enrolled in a city-offered health plan during the 2002-2003 school year. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, emphasize that the stipend is a recurrent or repeated amount of compensation and, after the first year, is not geared to the cost of health care or a teacher\u2019s continued participation in a city-offered health plan. Moreover, unlike the agreement in <em>BASAS, </em>the stipend was not a bonus to induce early retirement, but rather an annual increase in salary dependent on the amount of the general salary increase for such year.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Subsequent to the <em>BASAS </em>case, and also subsequent to the trial court\u2019s opinion, the Supreme Judicial Court decided another case relevant to our discussion: <em>Bulger </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>447 Mass. 651 (2006). One of the issues in that case was whether a housing allowance paid to the president of the University of Massachusetts was \u201cregular compensation.\u201d In view of the interpretation in <em>BASAS, </em>the <em>Bulger </em>court, <em>supra </em>at 658, considered the statutory language \u201cstraightforward and unambiguous.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Referring to <em>BASAS </em>and to <em>Bower </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>393 Mass. 427, 429 (1984), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u201cWe have recognized that the expression \u2018regular compensation\u2019 \u2018point[s] to recurrent or repeated amounts of compensation not inflated by extraordinary ad hoc payments. . . . [M] oreo ver \u201cregular,\u201d as it modifies \u201ccompensation,\u201d imports the idea of ordinariness or normality as well as the idea of recurrence.\u2019 The use of the terms \u2018salary, wages or other compensation in whatever form,\u2019 denotes, unquestionably in our minds, a legislative intent to include the many distinct ways in which individuals are paid for their services. As wages have a meaning apart from salary, so <em>\u2018other compensation in whatever form\u2019 must be understood to encompass all other forms of recurring payments for an employee\u2019s services, so long as the payments comport with the other requirements of [G. L. c. 32,] \u00a7 </em>1\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\"><em>Bulger </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>447 Mass. at 658 (citations omitted). The court then held that the housing allowances were \u201crecurrent,\u201d \u201cregular,\u201d and \u201cordinary\u201d remuneration for Bulger\u2019s services and rejected CRAB\u2019s characterization of the payments as designed to reimburse Bulger for the additional expenses associated with maintaining a residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Here, the trial judge was correct in determining the stipend to be \u201cregular compensation,\u201d falling within \u201cother compensation in whatever form,\u201d a term that the <em>Bulger </em>court stated \u201cmust be understood to encompass all other forms of recurring payments for an employee\u2019s services, so long as the payments comport with the other requirements of [G. L. c. 32,] \u00a7 1.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge pointed out that \u201cnegotiating parties need not match every salary increase with a particular service rendered to the employer in order for that salary increase to constitute \u2018regular compensation.\u2019 \u201d An annual salary increase may be bargained for in exchange for the continued comprehensive services rendered by BEA members to the school committee. The trial court\u2019s analysis, rendered before the <em>Bulger </em>opinion, was also implicitly approved in that case, when the court noted that the trustees \u201cconsidered Bulger\u2019s acceptance of a housing allowance as an important enhancement of his compensation package <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>that would motivate his interest in the presidency for an additional five-year term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659. Similarly, here, the school committee could well have thought that in order to retain teachers who were losing certain benefits, the committee had to provide a more generous compensation package.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While the benefits lost may not have been \u201cregular compensation,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the compensation package provided was.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-16\">The basic formula for computing a member\u2019s retirement amount is set forth in G.
