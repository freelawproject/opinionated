In it, he bequeathed one-fifth of the family home and \u201cthe right to remain there for as long as she desires\u201d to his friend and recent bride, the petitioner, Sue-Ellen Hershman-Tcherepnin. He also bequeathed one-fifth of the family home to each of his four children by an earlier marriage to Anne Tcherepnin.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The children contend that he bequeathed a present possessory interest in the property to all five devisees. The petitioner contends that he bequeathed to her a life estate in the property, with the right to exclusive possession, and a one-fifth remainder interest to each of the four children. Taking into account the instrument as a whole and all the circumstances known to the testator at the time he executed the will, we conclude that the testator devised a one-fifth present possessory interest in the property to the petitioner and each of his four children, making them tenants in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The property in dispute, 96 Russell Avenue, Water-town, was previously owned by the stepfather and mother of Anne Tcherepnin. They transferred title to the property to Anne and the testator in 1983. Anne and the testator resided at 96 Russell Avenue with their four children \u2014 Nicholas, Stefan, Sergei, and Sarina, the respondents in this case. Pursuant to the terms of their marital separation agreement, Anne transferred title to the property to the testator in September, 1994. After the divorce, Nicholas, Stefan, and Sergei continued to maintain bedrooms in their father\u2019s house, Stefan living in the residence from 1994 until \u201csome time in 2000,\u201d and Sergei visiting \u201cnearly every weekend.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In January, 1995, the petitioner, a friend of the testator for a number of years, moved into 96 Russell Avenue. The testator became ill that same year, the illness becoming worse in late 1997 and early 1998. In late December, 1997, the petitioner and the testator were married. They continued to reside at 96 Russell Avenue. Using a computer software program, the testator drafted the will at issue on March 13, 1998. At the time the testator\u2019s will was signed, he lived at 96 Russell Avenue along with the petitioner, Stefan, and Stefan\u2019s girlfriend. Less than one month later, on April 11, 1998, the testator died.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The relevant portions of the will are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">\u201cSIXTH: I give one fifth (x/s) ownership of the property at 96 Russell Avenue, Watertown, Ma., the right to remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>there for as long as she desires, and her choice of furnishings and bric-a-broc[] in my house and office, my Macintosh Ilci, monitor and TI laserprinter, fifty thousand (50,000) dollars in cash or stocks, my 1987 SAAB automobile and the print \u2018Boy and Bug\u2019 by Margo Hoff to Sue Ellen Hershman-Tcherepnin. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201cTENTH: I give one fifth (Vs) of the property at 96 Russell Ave., Watertown and its furnishings, and all photos and documents pertaining to my mother[,] to Sarina Tcherepnin. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201cELEVENTH: I give one fifth (Vs) of the property at 96 Russell Ave., Watertown and its furnishings, the Macintosh 5300 powerbook and accessories and the Sharp videocamcorder and tripod to Nicholas Tcherepnin. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201cTWELFTH: I give one fifth (Vs) of the property at 96 Russell Ave., Watertown and its furnishings, Macintosh 660AV and accessories, psalteries and santur, electronic music instruments, including Serge Modular stuff, and the Steinway grand piano[,] to Stefan Tcherepnin. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201cTHIRTEENTH: I give one fifth (Vs) of the property at 96 Russell Ave., Watertown, one fifth (Vs) of all furnishings, all photographic equipment and the Sony Hi-8 video-cam and accessories to Serge Tcherepnin, my son.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Probate of the will was allowed in the Probate and Family Court in Middlesex County.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">After the testator\u2019s death, the petitioner and Stefan continued to reside at 96 Russell Avenue; Stefan moved out some time in 2000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From 1998 to 2000, the testator\u2019s estate, managed by his brother, Peter Tcherepnin, the executor of his will, paid the taxes and mortgage on the property. Since \u201cearly 2000\u201d the petitioner has paid all taxes assessed upon the residence, the mortgage, and all maintenance, repairs, upkeep, and homeowner\u2019s insurance. In 2000, Sarina and her husband negotiated with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>petitioner regarding a purchase of the property but did not reach an agreement. In 2002, the petitioner changed the locks on the residence, alleging that the testator\u2019s children had removed from the residence various items, including a laptop computer, the testator\u2019s diaries, and works of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">On June 4, 2004, the petitioner filed a petition for partition of the real property at 96 Russell Avenue. The petition states that she, as well as Nicholas, Stefan, Sergei, and Satina, each possess twenty percent remainders in said property. Further, the petition represents that the petitioner possesses a \u201cright to occupy for life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The respondents (Nicholas, Stefan, Sergei, and Satina) filed a response to the petition and a counterclaim for declaratory judgment in which they contended that the will created five equal present interests in the property and granted the petitioner \u201ca mere right of occupancy and a defense to ouster and partition.\u201d Cross motions for summary judgment were subsequently filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">On September 23, 2005, a probate judge found that \u201c[t]he four comers of Testator\u2019s Will indicate unambiguously that he intended to grant [petitioner] a life estate in the Russell Avenue Property with the exclusive right to reside on the premises.\u201d The judge also determined that the will provided the petitioner and each of the four children with a one-fifth remainder interest in the property. In so deciding, the judge declined to consider extrinsic evidence regarding the testator\u2019s intent. Finally, the judge allowed the petitioner as a life tenant to seek partition of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The respondents filed a notice of appeal on June 23, 2006. Thereafter, on May 21, 2007, the probate judge found the fair market value of the property to be $790,500. The judge valued the petitioner\u2019s life estate at $613,169.86 and the remainder interest, divided among the petitioner and the four children, at $177,330.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe fundamental object in the construction of a will is to ascertain the testator\u2019s intention from the whole instrument, attributing due weight to all its language, considered in light of the circumstances known to the testator at the time of its execution, and to give effect to that intent unless some positive rule of law forbids.\u201d <em>Flannery </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>432 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>665, 667-668 (2000), quoting from <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>366 Mass. 261, 266 (1974). See <em>Tucci </em>v. DiGregorio, 358 Mass. 493, 495 (1970), quoting from Ware v. <em>Minot, </em>202 Mass. 512, 516 (1909) (\u201c[t]he accepted rule for the interpretation of a will is to ascertain the intent of the maker as gathered from the testamentary language read in the light of the knowledge possessed by him and of the material circumstances attendant upon him at the time, attributing due weight to all the words used, not stressing provisions of doubtful meaning but searching for a general plan from a survey of the whole instrument. . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The bequests here are not easily classified. The testator was not learned in the law, and, not surprisingly, he used layman\u2019s language rather than legal terms of art. See <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>126 Mass. 213, 215 (1879) (\u201c[i]t is easy to see that the will . . . was not the work of an accomplished conveyancer\u201d); <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>197 Mass. 283, 287 (1908). The testator gave one-fifth of the property to the petitioner and each of the four children. These bequests were not described as remainder interests. They appear to make a present transfer of the property to the five devisees. This would ordinarily make them tenants in common, with the right to use and occupy the property subject to the equal rights of the other tenants. See G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 7 (\u201cA conveyance or devise of land to two or more persons . . . shall create an estate in common\u201d). See also <em>Tucci </em>v. <em>DiGregorio, </em>358 Mass. at 497; <em>Brady </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 691, 695 (2003). The question is how these provisions are affected by the additional language allowing the petitioner to remain in the home so long as she desires. The petitioner contends that this additional clause provides her with a life estate and thereby renders the other bequests only remainder interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The testator did not use the classic formulations of a life estate. See, e.g., Restatement of Property \u00a7 18, at 46 (1936) (\u201cto A for his own life\u201d creates a life estate). Nor did he use essentially equivalent language. See, e.g., <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Shorey, </em>287 Mass. 76, 78-79 (1934) (\u201cgrantor\u2019s reservation of \u2018right to occupy, rent, or improve . . . premises during her life\u2019 . . . operate^] to seise the grantor of a life estate and ... to vest the remainder in the grantee\u201d); <em>Langlois </em>v. <em>Langlois, </em>326 Mass. 85, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>86 (1950) (\u201cto have and to hold and use ... as she see[s] fit during her lifetime\u201d); <em>Breare </em>v. <em>Assessors of Peabody, </em>350 Mass. 391, 392-393 (1966), and authorities cited (grantor\u2019s reservation of \u201cright to occupy the premises with the grantee during the term of his natural life\u201d created a life estate); <em>Bernat </em>v. <em>Kivior, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 957, 958 (1986) (\u201cright[]... to occupy the granted premises for the rest of her life\u201d conferred life estate). Compare <em>Rolland </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>314 Mass. 56, 57-58 (1943) (devise made until the death of the devisee held to create a life estate; court observed that \u201c[i]t is not essential that the words \u2018for life\u2019 or their precise equivalent be used in order to create a life estate\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">There is little authority in Massachusetts defining the legal interest created by a devise, as here, of \u201cthe right to remain there so long as [one] desires.\u201d In <em>Wilmarth </em>v. <em>Bridges, </em>113 Mass. 407, 408, 410 (1873), the testator bequeathed to his daughter, \u201cin view of her misfortunes, present circumstances, and her attention to and care of her parents, the use and improvement of all my real estate ... so long as she chooses personally to occupy and improve the same; on condition of her keeping the building in repair and paying the taxes and cost of insurance . . . .\u201d The Supreme Judicial Court, without elaboration, interpreted this bequest to provide a life estate defeasible by termination of occupancy or death. In <em>Hesseltine </em>v. <em>Partridge, </em>236 Mass. 77, 79, 81 (1920), however, the testator\u2019s devise to his widow of \u201c \u2018the use and occupation\u2019 of his house in Melrose, \u2018so long as she shall desire to reside therein,\u2019 \u201d was described as \u201can interest in real estate of an unascertained, and probably indeterminate, value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">A review of other jurisdictions also confirms that \u201cvery little can be laid down by way of rule or generalization\u201d in defining the legal interest created by the right to remain in a home so long as a devisee desires. Annot., Quantum or Character of Estate or Interest Created by Language Providing Premises as a Home, or Giving or Granting Same for Such Use, 45 A.L.R. 2d 699, 700 (1956). Language similar to that used by the testator here has been interpreted by courts in other jurisdictions to create either a defeasible life estate or a more limited right of occupancy, depending on other provisions in the will and the circumstances of its formulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>a. <em>Limited right of occupancy. </em>In <em>Cruse </em>v. <em>Reinhard, </em>208 S.W.2d 598, 601 (Tex. Ct. App. 1948), for example, the court considered a bequest providing, \u201cIt is my will and wish that my daughter Ethel continue to live in my home till and unless she wishes to change her residence . . . .\u201d The court held that the bequest did not create a life estate. The court focused on the literal meaning of the words selected, emphasizing that the bequest was of \u201cthe right to <em>live </em>in the \u2018home,\u2019 \u201d as opposed to the right to the \u201c \u2018home\u2019 itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605. As the testator was not learned in the law, the court emphasized that it was interpreting the words literally and \u201cavoiding implications which might occur only to a lawyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604. The court also relied on the failure of the testator to provide her daughter with the right to receive income from the property or to charge her with the responsibility to pay its liabilities, including taxes, insurance, and repairs. <em>Id. </em>at 606. For other cases rejecting life estates in favor of much more limited rights of occupation or their equivalent, see <em>Day </em>v. Tribble, 233 Ga. 242 (1974); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>122 Ind. App. 618 (1952); <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>51 N.C. App. 670 (1981); <em>Baldes-berger </em>v. <em>Baldesberger, </em>378 Pa. 113 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">b. <em>Defeasible life estate. </em>Other jurisdictions, however, have interpreted language providing a right of personal occupation to create a life estate defeasible by the grantee\u2019s abandonment of the property. See Annot., 45 A.L.R. 2d 699, <em>supra. </em>Many of these cases are distinguishable from the right of occupancy cases because they concern wills that reference the \u201clife\u201d of the devisee or use other language indicative of a life estate in the bequest. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>McCowen, </em>154 Cal. 798, 800 (1908) (devisee was granted land \u201cfor the term of her natural life . . . should [she] remove permanently from said lands during the period of her lifetime then and in that case the said lands shall become the absolute property of [testatrix\u2019s nephew]\u201d); <em>Benham </em>v. <em>Board-man, </em>146 N.Y.S. 434, 435, 437 (Sup. Ct. 1914) (will granting the devisee a farm on which \u201cto live during her life . . . not [to] sell or convey or lease\u201d created a defeasible life estate); <em>Brinkley </em>v. <em>Day, </em>88 N.C. App. 101, 102-103 (1987) (will providing that the wife \u201cis to live in the apartment presently occupied by her now for her lifetime rent free, tax free . . . insurance and maint[en] anee . . . free\u201d created a life estate); <em>Boulevard from Second St., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>230 Pa. 491, 493, 494 (1911) (will providing that property \u201cshall be held and enjoyed by them during all the term of their natural lives . . . upon the express condition that they shall make the homestead property . . . their place of permanent residence\u201d created a life estate).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Still other jurisdictions, however, find defeasible life estates even in the absence of references to the life of the devisee. See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kelly\u2019s Ex\u2019r, </em>299 Ky. 861, 862, 866 (1945) (where the testator granted his wife the right to \u201chave and enjoy a homestead in my farm if she cares to live upon it, but if not, then it is my will that she have her dower interest in my farm,\u201d the court held that these words granted the wife the option to take either a life estate or a dower interest). See also <em>Estate of Peacock, </em>914 F.2d 230, 231, 233 (11th Cir. 1990) (will provision that gave the husband the right \u201cto occupy said property for as long as he desires\u201d and required him to pay the taxes on the property and keep it fully insured and in a reasonable state of repair created \u201ca degree of beneficial enjoyment of the property equivalent to a life estate\u201d under Alabama law). In sum, \u201c[t]he question of what character or quantum of estate or interest is created by a will, deed, or other instrument which. . . purports to establish premises as a home for one or more designated persons, is plainly one of the intent and true construction of the particular instrument.\u201d Annot., 45 A.L.R. 2d at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Our interpretation of the language of this particular provision, in these circumstances, leads us to conclude that the testator intended to provide the petitioner only with a one-fifth present possessory interest in the property as a tenant in common with the children. The bequests of one-fifth of the property were not phrased as remainder interests. The testator did not devise the property to the petitioner for her life. Rather, he only provided her with the right to \u201cremain\u201d in the family home, compare <em>Cruse </em>v. <em>Reinhard, </em>208 S.W.2d at 601 (no life estate where the daughter was given the right to \u201ccontinue to live in my home till and unless she wishes to change her residence\u201d), which, at the time the will was executed, was occupied by other family members as well. As the testator was \u201cnot versed in the niceties of legal nomenclature,\u201d <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>197 Mass. at 287, we place special emphasis on the literal meaning of the words he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>selected. <em>Cruse </em>v. <em>Reinhard, supra </em>at 605. Unlike the situation in <em>Wilmarth </em>v. <em>Bridges, </em>113 Mass. at 408, the testator here did not provide the petitioner with the responsibility of maintenance and the payment of taxes and insurance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the will does not demonstrate an intention to provide the petitioner with control over and responsibility for the property. See <em>Cruse </em>v. <em>Reinhard, supra </em>at 606 (\u201cright of occupancy and nothing more\u201d). Contrast <em>Estate of Peacock, </em>914 F.2d at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In addition, providing the petitioner with a life estate, with the right to exclusive possession, undermines the over-all intention in the will, see <em>Tucci </em>v. <em>DiGregorio, </em>358 Mass. at 495; <em>Flannery </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>432 Mass. at 667-668, to provide an equal and shared right to the property. The property was the family home. At the time the will was executed one child was living there, albeit subject to the testator\u2019s stated conditions, and another, then still a minor and living with his mother, was visiting nearly every weekend. In the will, ownership of the home was devised in five equal parts. Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s contention, nothing in the will suggests that the testator intended to grant her such a disproportionate interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We also do not discern an over-all intention in the will to provide the petitioner with the right to exclude the children from the family home. The right to \u201cremain\u201d in the home appears to provide the petitioner with a right of occupancy, but not an exclusive one.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Tenants in common, of course, \u201cmay not . . . preclude other cotenants from exercising their right to possession, as doing so destroys the common estate.\u201d <em>Brady </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">We understand that the petitioner is the only individual who has been expressly provided the right to remain in the house. Likewise we recognize that as a tenant in common she had a right to occupy the house, as did the children. The disputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>provision therefore appears unnecessary or precatory. The circumstances of the bequest, however, explain the testator\u2019s decision to include such a provision. He was not a lawyer, and the will demonstrates he had little familiarity with property law, including, we assume, the rights incident to tenancy in common. He was also seriously ill and newly married. The primary asset in the estate was the family home, a source of potential emotional and financial conflict in these circumstances. His children from his earlier marriage were being given four-fifths interests in the property. The disputed provision ensured that everyone involved understood that the testator intended that his new wife have the right to remain in the family home. It was the apparent hope of the testator that the devisees would be able to agree upon the use and occupancy of the property; in the event that they could not, however, we are confident that the testator did not intend to provide the petitioner with the right to exclude his children from the home during her lifetime or to acquire a vastly unequal division of the proceeds from the sale of the property. See, e.g., <em>Tucci </em>v. <em>DiGregorio, </em>358 Mass. at 497 (\u201c[i]f the tenants in common are unable to agree upon occupancy of the common property in accordance with the apparent hopes of the testator, then the division of the real estate ... or the sale of the real estate and the division of the proceeds therefrom can be accomplished more appropriately by proceedings for partition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The will provided the petitioner and each of the testator\u2019s four children with a one-fifth present possessory interest in the property as tenants in common. The petitioner was not granted a life estate in the property. The judgment is therefore reversed and the matter is remanded to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings and declaration of the parties\u2019 rights consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-17\">Ivan Tcherepnin was a highly regarded musician and composer, and served on the faculty of Harvard University for twenty-five years, where he was head of the electronic music studio.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\">According to the petitioner, Stefan lived in the house after 1995 pursuant to a contract that defined his obligations to seek work, perform household chores, and abide by appropriate standards of behavior.

As we conclude that the bequest did not provide the petitioner with a life estate, we need not resolve the issue whether a petition for partition by the holder of a life estate defeasible by the termination of the recipient\u2019s desire to occupy the property is defeased by the filing of the petition to partition itself. The parties have provided us with very little guidance on this issue in their briefing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
