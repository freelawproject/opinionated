L. c. 266, \u00a7 127,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of use of a motor vehicle without authority in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(a). Following a jury-waived trial in the Juvenile Court, the trial judge found the juvenile delinquent as to all charges and sentenced him to six months\u2019 probation. After an eviden-tiary hearing on another date before a different judge, the juvenile was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $2,649. On appeal, the juvenile raises the following claims: (1) the evidence supporting the malicious destruction of property charges was insufficient, where the Commonwealth failed to prove that he acted with malice; (2) the evidence supporting the use of a motor vehicle without authority charge was insufficient, where the Commonwealth failed to prove that he operated on a public way; (3) the Commonwealth failed to prove that he did not act out of necessity; (4) the restitution judge improperly admitted an exhibit at his restitution hearing; and (5) the restitution judge failed to consider the juvenile\u2019s ability to pay the ordered restitution. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">1. <em>Facts, </em>a. <em>The crimes. </em>On December 31, 2003, Susan Beau-din permitted her son Ryan to use her 1989 Jeep Cherokee (Jeep) to attend a New Year\u2019s Eve party. Ryan was the only person authorized to use the Jeep. Just after midnight, Ryan left the party with some friends, including the juvenile, to go home. After he dropped off one of the passengers at her home, Ryan and the others learned, as a result of some cellular telephone calls, that an individual named Sean was looking for the juvenile. Sean had a history of problems with the juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">To avoid bringing any problems to the juvenile\u2019s house, Ryan drove to the Whirlaway Golf Center on Route 110 in Methuen, which was near the juvenile\u2019s house. Approximately one minute after Ryan pulled the Jeep into the parking lot, another car pulled in next to the Jeep. This car contained five youths, including Sean, who requested that the Jeep\u2019s doors be unlocked to allow them entry and access to the juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">When Sean gained entry through a back door, the juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>began swinging around an \u201ceightball\u201d he had wrapped inside a handkerchief. In the course of this action, the juvenile \u201csmashed\u201d out the Jeep\u2019s back left window with the makeshift weapon. Alarmed by the damage, Ryan and another boy jumped out of the Jeep, but Ryan\u2019s girlfriend, Melanie, remained in the front seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The juvenile then moved into the driver\u2019s seat, \u201chit the gas,\u201d drove across the parking lot, and crashed through a chain link fence onto the driving range grass. The juvenile continued driving on the driving range while Melanie and Sean screamed at him to stop. In her own effort to stop the Jeep, Melanie pulled the emergency brake, which stopped the Jeep long enough for her to jump out. The juvenile continued to drive in circles until he collided with a utility pole in the middle of the driving range. Upon colliding with the pole, the juvenile left the Jeep and ran to his nearby home. The Jeep left behind was seriously damaged and inoperable. The front end was smashed in, the undercarriage was damaged, and it had to be towed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">b. <em>The restitution hearing. </em>At a separate restitution hearing, Beaudin testified as to the estimated cost for the repair to her Jeep. A damage estimate by her insurance company, which totaled $2,649, was admitted as an exhibit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Due to the expense, she had not insured the Jeep with collision coverage. There was too much damage to repair, and the Jeep was deemed a \u201ctotal loss.\u201d The Jeep was retired to the junkyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">At the hearing, the juvenile\u2019s father testified that he had seen Ryan driving the Jeep after the incident. The restitution judge made no inquiry relative to the juvenile\u2019s ability to pay the restitution. The matter was not argued and no evidence was offered on the subject. Payment of the restitution was made a condition of the juvenile\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The juvenile argues that his delinquency findings are not supported by sufficient evidence. When analyzing whether the record evidence is sufficient to support a delinquency determination, the relevant \u201cquestion is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt (emphasis in original).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting from <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">i. <em>Malicious destruction of personal property. </em>When evaluating sufficiency, the evidence must be reviewed with specific reference to the substantive elements of the offense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra </em>at 677-678. To prove a violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, as amended by St. 1994, c. 168, \u00a7 4, the Commonwealth must prove that the juvenile \u201cdestroyed] or injure[d] the personal property, dwelling house or building of another . . . .\u201d If the destruction or injury is \u201cwilful and malicious,\u201d the permissible penalty is greater than if it is merely \u201cwanton,\u201d which is a separate crime requiring different proof. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schuchardt, </em>408 Mass. 347, 352 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Here, the juvenile contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that his actions were \u201cwilful and malicious.\u201d We agree. The terms \u201cwilful\u201d and \u201cmalicious\u201d represent two distinct elements of the crime, both of which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 443 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 4 (2001); Nolan &amp; Sartorio, Criminal Law \u00a7 427, at 438 (2001). \u201cThe word \u2018wilful\u2019 means intentional and by design in contrast to that which is thoughtless or accidental. Malice, on the other hand, refers to a state of mind of cruelty, hostility or revenge.\u201d Nolan &amp; Sartorio, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence that the juvenile acted wilfully was more than sufficient. He intentionally swung the makeshift eightball weapon inside the Jeep (resulting in the broken window), he took control of the Jeep by design, and he intentionally drove the Jeep through the fence and onto the driving range, damaging them both. Ordinarily, malice may be inferred from the wilful commission of an unlawful act without excuse. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mezzanotti, </em>26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 522, 528 (1988). However, the wilful doing of an unlawful act does not, by itself, suffice to prove malice under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, supra </em>at 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, the evidence does not support the inference \u2014 there was no direct evidence of malice \u2014 that these intentional acts were done out of cruelty, hostility, or revenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, the evidence of the juvenile\u2019s hostile acts toward Sean, and his conduct in avoidance of Sean and the others, do not equate to destructive acts that were by design hostile to the owner (even if unknown) of the property. <em>Id. </em>at 5. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hosman, </em>257 Mass. 379, 384-385 (1926). Rather, the evidence demonstrated that the juvenile\u2019s conduct was wanton, i.e., the acts he committed were \u201cdone heedlessly and in reckless disregard of the rights of others.\u201d Nolan &amp; Sartorio, <em>supra </em>at 440. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Byard, </em>200 Mass. 175, 177-178 (1908). However, the juvenile was not charged with wanton destruction of personal property, and it is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schuchardt, supra </em>at 352; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, supra </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cimino, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 925 (1993), is misplaced. In <em>Cimino, </em>the defendant was convicted of malicious destruction of personal property based on his shooting car windows with a BB gun. <em>Id. </em>at 926. What made the shootings malicious and not wanton conduct was the fact that he aimed the gun at the car windows and acted with the principal purpose of causing damage to the windows, i.e., his intended targets. The car windows were not damaged as a result of the defendant\u2019s casual or reckless firing of the BB gun. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, however, it is not a reasonable inference from the evidence that the juvenile\u2019s intended target was the Jeep. Nor may it be reasonably inferred that by design he purposefully destroyed the fence and turf motivated by hostility, cruelty, or vengeance toward their owner as opposed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>resulting damage being occasioned by, or incidental to, his desire to escape his circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, supra </em>at 4-5 (evidence of malicious destruction was insufficient where the destruction of the property was not designed to intimidate or overpower its owner, but rather was an incidental means to carry out the defendant\u2019s goal of theft). There being insufficient evidence of malice, the two delinquency findings based on the juvenile\u2019s violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, must be vacated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">ii. <em>Use of a motor vehicle without authority. </em>The juvenile further claims that the delinquency finding based on his unauthorized use of the Jeep, which he drove onto the driving range, is invalid where the Commonwealth failed to prove that the driving range was a \u201cpublic way.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commonwealth maintains that \u201cpublic way\u201d is not an element of the crime of use of a motor vehicle without authority. A plain reading of the statute supports the Commonwealth\u2019s position. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 152, 154 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conaghan, </em>433 Mass. 105, 110 (2000) (a \u201cstatute is to be interpreted according to the plain and ordinary meaning of its words\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandell, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 528 (2004), quoting from <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. 283, 285 (1996) (\u201c[wjhere the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>The question we answer today has not been squarely addressed in the past, but the slate on which we write is not entirely blank either. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giannino, </em>371 Mass. 700, 703-704 (1977), the Supreme Judicial Court determined that the crime of use of a motor vehicle without authority does not require the prompt delivery of a citation as required by G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2. In the course of its decision, but not necessary to the holding, the court listed \u201cpublic way\u201d among the elements constituting use without authority. <em>Id. </em>at 702. The following year, in <em>Costarelli </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 677, 684 n.4 (1978), the court noted that its statement on this issue in the <em>Gi-annino </em>decision was dicta, and specifically left the question open. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 730, 734 (2001), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giannino, supra, </em>this court also set forth \u201cpublic way\u201d as an element of use without authority. However, as in <em>Giannino, </em>this too was dicta, as it was not necessary to our decision, which concluded that the defendant was not authorized to use the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 734-735.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The relevant portions of \u00a7 24(2)(a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are separated into two parts through the use of a semicolon. The first portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>section specifies \u201cpublic way\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as necessary to the proof of operating a motor vehicle recklessly or negligently so as to endanger.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Set off by the semicolon is the second portion of the section, which penalizes the use of a motor vehicle without authority. This portion of the section is neither preceded by nor grammatically connected to any requirement that the offense occur on a \u201cpublic way.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The use of a semicolon reflects the independent nature of this separated clause, which may be read as a complete sentence ending with less of a pause than a period would indicate. See <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Brookline Rent Control Bd., </em>385 Mass. 228, 231-232 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George, </em>430 Mass. 276, 280 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Therefore, the \u201cpublic way\u201d language found in the first por-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>tian of the section, which ends in a semicolon, does not modify the crime of use without authority found in the next, independent clause of the section. Indeed, the Supreme Judicial Court noted as much in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costarelli, </em>374 Mass. at 684 n.4, where it stated that the three parts of \u00a7 24(2)(a) constitute independent clauses that are separated from each other by semicolons. \u201cThe two clauses that define the prohibited conduct other than use without authority expressly require that the conduct take place on a public way. The use without authority provision, however, contains no such language.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See Nolan &amp; Sartorio, Criminal Law \u00a7 578, at 582-583 (questioning whether public way is actually an element of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle). We conclude that public way is not an element of the crime of use of a motor vehicle without authority.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">iii. <em>Necessity defense. </em>The juvenile also claims that his motion for required findings of not delinquent should have been allowed as to all the charges because the Commonwealth failed to prove that he did not act out of necessity. Given the outcome of the juvenile\u2019s malicious destruction delinquency findings discussed above, we confine our discussion of the necessity defense to the delinquency finding based on his use of a motor vehicle without authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The availability of the defense of necessity has been limited to the following circumstances: \u201c(1) the defendant is faced with a clear and imminent danger, not one which is debatable or speculative; (2) the defendant can reasonably expect that his [or her] action will be effective as the direct cause of abating the danger; (3) there is [no] legal alternative which will be effective in abating the danger; and (4) the Legislature has not acted to preclude the defense by a clear and deliberate choice regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the values at issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 400 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>389 Mass. 581, 591 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In the juvenile\u2019s case, the evidence could have fostered a debate as to the first two elements, but those were conceded by the Commonwealth at trial. The third element stands on a different footing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As the trial judge found, the juvenile had legal alternatives to abate the danger, but he did not pursue them. In particular, the trial judge found that the juvenile could have exited the Jeep and run the short distance to his house to seek help. There was also evidence that cellular telephones were available either to the juvenile or to his friends, any one of whom could have notified the police about the circumstances. Either of these alternatives would have effectively abated the danger the juvenile perceived, and there was no evidence that either was futile. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra </em>at 401, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brugmann, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 380 (1982) (\u201cit is up to the defendant to make himself aware of any available lawful alternatives, \u2018or show them to be futile in the circumstances\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">b. Restitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The juvenile raises two claims relative to the restitution hearing, neither of which was preserved by an objection. First, he alleges error in the admission of the insurance company\u2019s estimate of damage to the Jeep in the amount of $2,649. Specifically, the juvenile takes issue with the hearsay nature of the evidence. The short answer is that the strict rules of evidence do not apply at restitution hearings, and reliable hearsay is admissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casanova, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 750, 755-756 (2006). There was no error, let alone any miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Second, the juvenile claims that the restitution judge failed to consider his ability to pay the ordered restitution. This claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>made for the first time on appeal and was not raised at a time when the restitution judge could have done something about it. To further frustrate any resolution of the matter, the juvenile did not present any evidence as to his ability to pay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stout, </em>356 Mass. 237, 243 (1969) (appellate review should be based on what occurred at trial, not what might have been). We note that the restitution order merely set forth the amount for which the juvenile was being held accountable as a result of his criminal conduct. The restitution judge did not order the juvenile to pay the amount forthwith or in installments, either of which would have some bearing on his present ability to pay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nawn, </em>394 Mass. 1, 8-9 (1985). In the end, we determine that there was no risk that justice miscarried because the payment of restitution was a condition of the juvenile\u2019s probation, and he may raise his ability to pay at any future probation revocation hearing that should take place based on his nonpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The delinquency findings based on the juvenile\u2019s violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, are vacated, and the complaint is dismissed as to those counts. The delinquency finding based on the juvenile\u2019s violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(a), and the restitution order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The first count referenced a \u201c1989 Jeep Cherokee,\u201d and the second count referenced \u201cfence and turf.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Beaudin had testified at trial to the same estimated amount for the repairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Because the juvenile did not renew his motion for a required finding of not guilty after he presented his defense, \u201cwe limit our sufficiency analysis to the state of the evidence at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sudderth, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 317, 318 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\">This special variety of malice developed at common law because the wilful doing of an unlawful act without excuse, if applied to injuries to property, would permit an otherwise civil trespass to be punished criminally. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>122 Mass. 19, 35 (1877); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, supra </em>at 441; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 512 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The second count of malicious destruction, i.e., for the damage done to the \u201cfence and turf,\u201d suffers from a separate infirmity not raised by the juvenile. The crimes set out in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127, only extend to \u201cpersonal property, dwelling housefs] or building[s].\u201d The turf on a driving range is real, not personal, property and its destruction is not subject to punishment under \u00a7 127. Rather, the wilful and malicious or wanton destruction of real property (among other things) is punishable under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 126A. It was therefore impossible as matter of law for the juvenile to be found delinquent for violating \u00a7 127 for damaging the turf. Because a finding of delinquency on the second count required conjunctive proof of malicious destruction of the \u201cfence and turf,\u201d and the latter was not legally possible, the delinquency finding on this count is invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">For the purposes of our discussion of this issue, we use \u201cpublic way\u201d as shorthand .for \u201cany way or in any place to which the public has a right of access, or any place to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees,\u201d which is the actual language found in G.

For example, \u201cpublic way\u201d is not an element of the crime of making a false statement in an application for a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b719-9\">The last portion of the section, also set off by a semicolon, but not relevant here, contains additional punishments for third and subsequent unauthorized use offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\">We note that there was evidence that prior to driving through the fence and onto the driving range, the juvenile first drove the Jeep across the parking lot of Whirlaway Golf Center, which may well have been a \u201cplace to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees.\u201d However, the record before us is insufficient to reach that conclusion. Given that it was after midnight when these events occurred, it is likely that both the driving range and the adjoining used car lot were closed. Also, the record contains no indication whether the parking lot contained any amenities available to the general public after the businesses\u2019 closing hours, such as an automated teller machine, pay telephones, or newspaper distribution boxes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiss, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 247, 250 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The juvenile makes no mention of the fourth element in his brief, and there is no record evidence relevant to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Even though we vacate the findings of delinquency on the malicious destruction counts, the restitution award is sufficiently connected to the delinquency finding on the use of a motor vehicle without authority to be maintained. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>436 Mass. 829, 833 n.2 (2002). In addition, the only evidence of damage that was admitted related to the Jeep, and none was offered relative to the fence and turf.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
