After a Superior Court bench trial, he was convicted on the first five indictments and on a lesser included offense on Count VI (malicious destruction of property under $250). The defendant now appeals. He contends that the motion judge\u2019s denial of his motion to subpoena a witness\u2019s testimony, based on the witness\u2019s privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, was error, and asserts, for the first time, that the judge should have independently granted the witness immunity. He also claims that the convictions of armed robbery and armed assault with intent to rob are duplicative. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><em>Background. </em>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the judge, as fact finder, could have found the following. On the evening of June 14, 2002, James Rock and Jenna Dudley drove to Malden to see Rock\u2019s friend, Christopher Noble. Rock and Noble had spoken earlier in the afternoon and Noble had told Rock to park down the street from Noble\u2019s house. Upon arriving at Noble\u2019s residence, Rock ignored Noble\u2019s request and parked across the street from the house. After visiting Noble, Rock intended to make a car payment via Western Union at a local supermarket.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Upon Rock\u2019s arrival, Noble left his residence and approached the car. Noble was aware of Rock\u2019s intended destination and that he usually carried the car payment in cash. Noble suggested that Rock drive the car down the street and park. Rock did not move the car. While Noble was speaking with Rock and Dudley, a male assailant approached the vehicle, pulled a shotgun from his coat, and stated to Noble, \u201cChris, get down on the ground.\u201d The assailant then pointed the shotgun at Rock and demanded his jewelry and money. When Rock gave the assailant his neck chain and ten dollars, the assailant demanded more money and ordered Rock out of the vehicle. As Rock left the vehicle, the assailant hit Rock in the jaw with the butt end of the gun and told Rock to lie on the ground. The assailant then placed the shotgun to Rock\u2019s head and frisked him. The assailant again demanded Rock\u2019s money. Failing to obtain more money, the assailant approached the driver\u2019s side door and demanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the keys to the vehicle. Rock refused to provide the keys and instead removed them from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Frustrated again, the assailant cocked the shotgun and pointed it at Dudley, ordering her out of the car. The assailant threatened to shoot either Rock, Dudley, or Noble. He then used the butt of the shotgun to smash the rear windshield of Rock\u2019s vehicle. Dudley escaped from the vehicle and ran for help. Noble also ran away. The assailant proceeded to smash the front windshield, in the process breaking the stock end of the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">While these events were transpiring, Rock kept yelling at the assailant, \u201cI know who you are. Get out of here, and I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d The assailant eventually left. When police arrived, Rock identified the assailant as the defendant. He subsequently identified the defendant in a photographic array. Dudley was unable to make an identification. Identification of the assailant was the primary issue at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">On July 5, 2002, Noble\u2019s parents granted police permission to search Noble\u2019s bedroom in relation to a separate offense. The search turned up a loaded shotgun with a missing stock end. The stock end recovered at the scene of the June robbery matched that shotgun.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Prospective witness\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege and immunity. </em>Noble pleaded guilty to six charges arising from his involvement in the June 14, 2002, armed robbery as well as to charges relating to the possession of the shotgun discovered during the search in July, 2002. Prior to trial, the defendant sought a subpoena summoning Noble as a trial witness. A Superior Court judge allowed the motion without objection, with the notation that \u201c[n]o thing in this motion speaks to the issue of whether Mr. Noble shall invoke or lawfully may invoke his Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d A month later a hearing on Noble\u2019s assertion of his Fifth Amendment rights was held before another Superior Court judge. At this pretrial hearing, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel described the line of questioning he wished to pursue, repeatedly insisting that how Noble obtained the shotgun found in July, 2002, was crucial to the defendant\u2019s exculpation. With the focus squarely on this incident, the motion judge then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>allowed the Commonwealth as well as Noble\u2019s counsel, to establish a basis for Noble\u2019s assertion of a Fifth Amendment privilege in relation to the July search. After considering the arguments, the motion judge asked Noble if he intended to \u201ctake the Fifth Amendment if called to trial in this matter.\u201d Noble responded affirmatively. The motion judge then found that Noble had a \u201cFifth Amendment right to the events of July [, 2002,]\u201d and therefore that \u201che will not be compelled to testify against himself.\u201d Defense counsel objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">While the June robbery hung on the periphery of the arguments presented during the hearing, neither the parties nor the judge clearly addressed the issue whether Noble also had an independent and valid Fifth Amendment privilege in relation to the robbery or whether this was even an issue. To this extent, we note that defense counsel never clearly sought to inquire as to Noble\u2019s version of the June armed robbery. It is also of note that defense counsel, after learning that Noble had a valid Fifth Amendment privilege, did not seek immunity for Noble, either from the Commonwealth, pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 20C-20E, or from the judge, to allow Noble\u2019s testimony about either the June robbery or July search. See generally Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 810-821 (2d ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Noble did not testify at trial. Furthermore, there is no indication in the record that, during the trial, defense counsel sought immunity for Noble. At trial and over objection, as has been noted, the Commonwealth introduced in evidence the shotgun with the missing stock end seized from Noble\u2019s house and the stock end recovered at the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The defendant argues that it was error for the motion judge to deny the motion to subpoena Noble\u2019s testimony. He asserts that allowing Noble\u2019s testimony, which would arguably have both cast further doubt on the identification made by Rock<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the inference that the gun was used by the defendant in the robbery, was prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s case. In the alternative, the defendant argues that the motion judge erred by not granting Noble immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u201cBoth the Sixth Amendment [to the United States Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>tian] and art. 12 [of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights] guarantee a criminal defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him through cross-examination,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>443 Mass. 740, 748 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>420 Mass. 67, 71 (1995), and a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense by calling witnesses on his own behalf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>442 Mass. 779, 784 (2004). This right is \u201cnot absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>375 Mass. 211, 214, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 872 (1978). \u201cWhen properly invoked, the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination clearly is one of those interests.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">As the standards are \u201chighly protective of the constitutionally guaranteed right against self-incrimination,\u201d we construe a claim of privilege broadly in determining whether its invocation was justified. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cWe have long held that a \u2018witness\u2019s decision not to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds must be honored unless it is <em>perfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer[s] <em>cannot possibly </em>have such tendency to incriminate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 784-785, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pennellatore, </em>392 Mass. 382, 389 (1984). As such, we must determine whether a witness\u2019s claim of privilege is \u201cpredicated on a \u2018real risk\u2019 of incrimination, not just \u2018a mere imaginary, remote or speculative possibility of prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>443 Mass. at 749, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagenais, </em>437 Mass. 832, 839 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In determining that Noble could invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege in relation to prospective questions about the shotgun, the motion judge did not abuse her discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, 397 </em>Mass. 65, 70 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degrenier, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 215 (1996). Here, the motion judge recognized that if Noble were required to testify, he could be subjected to further criminal prosecution in relation to how he obtained the weapon and why he had it in his possession. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 785. This included prosecution for conspiracy stemming from the June robbery and July search.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Here, the only other testimony that Noble might have provided concerned the identity of the assailant in the June 14, 2002, robbery. Defense counsel, however, did not clearly raise this issue at the hearing. Moreover, there may very well have been a strategic reason that this question was not presented at the pretrial hearing, as Noble\u2019s testimony on this point was arguably just as likely to implicate Wooden in the June 14, 2002, robbery as it was to exculpate him. Indeed, it is instructive that after the motion judge\u2019s ruling that Noble had a valid Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to the July search, counsel did not press the issue of the privilege with respect to the June robbery, further suggesting that this was testimony that would not have advanced the defendant\u2019s cause. Lastly, even if the answer to this initial question regarding the identity of the assailant was not necessarily incriminatory, subsequent questions relating to Noble\u2019s reason for being at the scene could have exposed him to further criminal liability, including possible involvement in a conspiracy with the assailant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"AEX\">Once the motion judge denied the motion to compel testimony, the defendant\u2019s counsel retained the option to request that the judge grant Noble immunity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel did not make such a request, nor was a judicial grant of immunity even mentioned. For the first time on appeal, the defendant asserts that \u201cunique circumstances\u201d of due process and fundamental fairness require a grant of immunity to Noble as a constitutional right.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The Supreme Judicial Court has \u201cdeclined to recognize a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a judicial grant of immunity to defense witnesses,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>394 Mass. 341, 344 (1985), stating that \u201c[t]he decision whether to grant immunity generally lies in the hands of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[Wjithout precluding the possibility that in some unique circumstances . . . due process may require the granting by a judge of a limited form of immunity, we decline to hold that the compulsory process provisions of the Federal Constitution applicable to the States through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, or the cognate provisions of our State Constitution, mandate a grant of immunity to the prospective defense witness . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>388 Mass. 637, 646 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grimshaw, </em>412 Mass. 505, 512 (1992) (unique circumstances not shown). See generally Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">By failing to present the issue of immunity to the motion judge, defendant\u2019s counsel did not provide an occasion for the judge to consider the appropriateness of granting judicial immunity to Noble. As such, the motion judge had no opportunity to evaluate whether the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in preventing Noble\u2019s testimony was valid or whether Noble\u2019s testimony would actually exculpate the defendant. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>394 Mass. at 346 (where \u201cjudge\u2019s factual findings [after a hearing] do not support the defendant\u2019s claim of \u2018unique circumstances\u2019 which would warrant [the witness\u2019s] immunization, the judge properly declined to order immunity outside the prescribed statutory scheme\u201d). Absent such a request, the defendant cannot now argue for the first time on appeal that the judge, independently, should have granted Noble immunity. To suggest otherwise would encourage inappropriate gamesmanship. <em>Government of the Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>615 F.2d 964, 971 (3d Cir. 1980), citing <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 82 (1970) (trial should not be turned \u201cinto a mere \u2018poker game\u2019 to be won by the most skilled tactician\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Moreover, we note that even if defense counsel had made the request for a judicial grant of immunity, it appears that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>would not have abused her discretion if she had denied the request. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>429 Mass. 388, 400 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>447 Mass. 635, 645 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>394 Mass. at 345 (\u201cJudicial immunity is not available if the prospective witness is an actual or potential target of prosecution\u201d or if the testimony \u201cis found to be ambiguous, not clearly exculpatory, cumulative or . . . relate[s] only to the credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses\u201d). Although the Commonwealth may have virtually exhausted the charges against Noble in relation to the June robbery, Noble\u2019s testimony could have been incriminating. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 785 (\u201c [Privilege extends not only to answers that would in themselves support a conviction, but also to those that would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the witness\u201d). Even if Noble testified that he did not obtain the shotgun from the defendant, this does not foreclose the possibility that the shotgun was passed from the defendant to a third party and then to Noble. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, supra </em>at 345 (permissible to deny immunity if proffered statement not clearly exculpatory). Similarly, given Noble\u2019s guilty pleas to multiple charges stemming from the June robbery (including joint venture), it is distinctly possible that Noble might have testified that the defendant was his coventurer. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">2. <em>Duplicative convictions. </em>The defendant contends that the convictions on Count I (armed robbery) and Count II (armed assault with intent to rob) are duplicative. This argument, however, ignores that the judge \u2014 in this case the fact finder \u2014 could have determined that the two charges arose from separate and distinct acts during the June robbery. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>429 Mass. 502, 509 (1999). Our own review of the testimony indicates that the judge could have found that the taking of Rock\u2019s money and jewelry at gunpoint constituted a separate and distinct act from the defendant\u2019s unsuccessful later attempt to steal the car from Rock and Dudley while he held them at gunpoint. Moreover, the judge could have concluded that the defendant approached as a coventurer with the intent to steal the money Rock intended to use for his car payment. Based on the evidence, the judge could have further deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>mined that once the defendant was unable to obtain the money, the defendant developed a separate intent to steal the car, apart from his earlier agreement with Noble. This involved distinct offenses against both Rock and Dudley. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gallant, 65 Mass. App. Ct. 409, 415 (2006) (\u201cWhere convictions are based on <em>distinct </em>acts, it is unnecessary even to consider whether the offenses contain mutually exclusive elements; multiple punishments are authorized in any event\u201d). These instances were therefore not so closely related in fact as to constitute a single crime. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The Commonwealth did not find the defendant\u2019s fingerprints or other identifying physical evidence on the shotgun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-9\">In a statement to police made in the aftermath of the incident but before his arrest, Noble had told police that he did not know the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\">As defense counsel presented only one clear issue to the motion judge (the July search), the defendant\u2019s appellate argument regarding Noble\u2019s blanket assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege is inapposite. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>423 Mass. 496, 502 (1996) (\u201cA witness also is not entitled to make a blanket assertion of the privilege.
