Redstone against the trustees of three inter vivas trusts and the executors of his mother\u2019s estate claiming that a gift made under one of the trusts had lapsed for lack of a beneficiary, and that it must revert back to his mother\u2019s estate, of which he is a residual legatee. He claimed further that he was entitled to reimbursement from all three trusts for the support he provided to the trust beneficiaries as well as for administrative services provided. Edward\u2019s son Michael Redstone intervened in the action, asserting that he was an intended beneficiary of the trust in issue and opposing Edward\u2019s claim for reimbursement for support and administrative services. Based upon her reading of the trust instrument, the judge concluded that Michael was an intended beneficiary of the trust and granted his motion for summary judgment. She also denied Edward\u2019s claims for reimbursement from all three trusts. We conclude that the trust instrument does not support the determination that Michael was an intended beneficiary, and leave intact the ruling that the trustees were not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the dismissal of Edward\u2019s claims for reimbursement from the trusts, and remand the matter to the Probate and Family Court for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">1. <em>The facts.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Edward is the son of Mickey and Belle Red-stone and the father of Ruth Ann and Michael. In 1959, Belle established the 1959 Belle Redstone Trust, the trust in issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>(referred to throughout this opinion as the 1959 trust), for the benefit of her granddaughter, Ruth Ann.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Under the terms of the 1959 trust, one-half of the trust principal and accumulated income was to be distributed to Ruth Ann upon her attainment of thirty years of age, with the remainder to be distributed to her at age thirty-five, whereupon the trust would terminate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Sections 11(E) and 11(F) of the 1959 trust respectively provide for the disposition of trust income and principal in the event that Ruth Ann died before full distribution of the trust property, either with or without issue. Should Ruth Ann leave issue, \u00a7 11(E) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201cIn the event that . . . Ruth Ann should die before the full distribution of the trust property, <em>leaving issue, </em>then [the remaining] trust property shall . . . continue^ to be held in trust in equal shares for the benefit of her issue with. . . [discretion] ... in the Trustees to . . . expend . . . part or all of the net income or principal of each such share ... to assist in the maintenance, support, health, welfare and education of the person entitled to such share. Said trust shall continue for a period of twenty years after the death of Ruth Ann .... Upon the expiration of said twenty-year period, the Trustees shall distribute the then remaining principal and accumulated income ... to each such issue . . . and the trust shall terminate. If any of such issue shall die before the expiration of said twenty-year period, his or her share shall be divided equally between the remaining issue living at the time of distribution.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The terms of \u00a7 11(F) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">\u201cIn the event that . . . Ruth Ann should die before the full distribution of the trust property <em>without leaving issue, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the balance of the trust property . . . shall be added to [a] <em>trust for the benefit of Michael Redstone </em>[Ruth Ann\u2019s brother] ... or shall be distributed free of trust[], depending upon whether said trust shall have been terminated .... And if Michael . . . shall then be deceased without [leaving issue], then the balance of the trust property shall be . . . distributed in accordance with [Ruth Ann\u2019s] Last Will and Testament[, or] if she . . . died intestate ... to [her] heirs-at-law . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Like the 1959 trust, the trust established simultaneously by Belle for Michael provided for discretionary payments from net income until he attained the age of thirty years and then for the distribution of the corpus of the trust to him at ages thirty and thirty-five. In the event he died before full distribution without leaving issue, the balance of that trust property was, in the first instance, to be added to the 1959 trust.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">As it happened, Ruth Ann died intestate in 1987 at age thirty-three, leaving one son, Gabriel Adam Redstone (Adam), then three years of age.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Following Ruth Ann\u2019s death, Edward raised his grandchild, Adam. About fifteen years later, in November, 2002, Edward and his then wife, Madeline, adopted Adam,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> who died intestate and without issue in May, 2004, that is, before the time (twenty years) set by \u00a7 11(E) of the 1959 trust for the distribution of trust assets to Ruth Ann\u2019s issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Ruth Ann and Adam were also the beneficiaries of the Ruth Ann Redstone Trust which was settled by Edward on June 30, 1972 (1972 trust). The trustees of the 1968 Mickey Redstone Trust (1968 trust) and 1972 trust had discretionary authority to make expenditures from trust principal and income for what we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>shall generally refer to as Adam\u2019s support.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">About two months after Adam\u2019s death, Edward brought this action, alleging that the 1959 trust lapsed with Adam\u2019s death, and the corpus of the trust reverted to Belle\u2019s estate, of which he, Edward, is a residuary legatee. Edward also sought reimbursement from the 1959, 1968, and 1972 trusts for expenses incurred in raising Ruth Ann and Adam as well as for administrative services rendered to the trusts. Michael intervened in the suit individually and as next friend of his children. He and the defendant trustees also sought attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">2. <em>Edward\u2019s appeal, </em>a. <em>The 1959 trust. </em>None of the contingencies expressed in \u00a7 11(E) or \u00a7 11(F) of the 1959 trust occurred. Rather, Ruth Ann died prior to the full distribution of the trust assets while leaving issue, her son Adam, who died subsequent to Ruth Ann but prior to a full distribution of the 1959 trust assets. This circumstance brings us to Edward and Michael\u2019s competing arguments on the question whether the gift lapsed for lack of a beneficiary, as Edward claims, or whether Belle intended to make a gift to Michael. Edward contends that the judge erred when she impermissibly \u201cread in[to]\u201d the 1959 trust instrument executed by Belle an intended gift to Michael in the circumstances presented.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">While acknowledging that \u201cthe [1959 tjrust does not expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>provide for the circumstances here [presented],\u201d Michael contends that a literal interpretation of the language of the 1959 trust would frustrate Belle\u2019s intention as indicated by the clear language of \u00a7 11(F), that is, to pass to him the assets of the trust in the event that Ruth Ann\u2019s rights under the trust failed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The 1972 trust grants the trustee of that trust:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">\u201cfull discretionary powers ... to use, apply and expend whatever part or all of the net income or principal of [a share of the trust] ... to assist in the maintenance, support, health, welfare and education of [Ruth Ann\u2019s issue, should Ruth Ann die before full distribution of the trust property].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The judge deemed Edward\u2019s reading of the 1959 trust \u201ctoo narrow.\u201d She reasoned that \u00a7\u00a7 11(E) and 11(F), read together with the trust as a whole, demonstrated Belle\u2019s intention that the trust corpus remain with both Ruth Ann and Michael or their issue and that the corpus pass to Belle\u2019s heirs at law only in the event that neither Ruth Ann nor Michael nor their issue survived. From that reading, the judge concluded, as matter of law, that Michael was entitled to receive Ruth Ann\u2019s, and later Adam\u2019s share, of the 1959 trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Our analysis of the competing claims before us begins with the determination that there is no ambiguity in the terms of the 1959 trust. Cf. <em>Flannery </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>432 Mass. 665, 669 (2000) (\u201cNeither the fact that [the object of bounty] predeceased the decedent [and thus the gift failed], nor the absence of a residuary clause or a contingent beneficiary provision, makes [a] will ambiguous\u201d). Neither Edward nor Michael contends otherwise.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, it appears from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision that her analysis proceeded on the same basis, that the trust instrument was unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Notwithstanding the absence of ambiguity in the terms of the 1959 trust, neither we nor the trial judge are bound to adhere to the language in that instrument when we are convinced that a reading of the instrument as a whole would frustrate the sett-lor\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bourke, </em>209 Mass. 481, 486 (1911), quoting from <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>First Parish in Framingham, </em>128 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>370, 374 (1880); <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Schmitt, </em>349 Mass. 669, 672 (1965). As stated in <em>Schroeder </em>v. <em>Danielson, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 450, 453 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\u201cThe interpretation of a written trust is a matter of law to be resolved by the court. <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>363 Mass. 625, 633 (1973). <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Gring, </em>374 Mass. 109, 113 (1977). A trust should be construed \u2018to give effect to the intention of the settlor as ascertained from the language of the whole instrument considered in the light of the attendant circumstances.\u2019 <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Marcus, </em>396 Mass. 424, 429 (1985). We are in as good a position as the motion judge to do this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We do not agree with Michael\u2019s contention that \u00a7 11(F)\u2019s proviso that the gift to Ruth Ann should inure to his benefit in the event that she die without issue bespeaks a more general intent on Belle\u2019s part, more specifically, that if the gift intended for Ruth Ann and her issue should fail, then it should pass to him. We think Michael\u2019s argument is not dissimilar to that advanced by the disappointed legatees but rejected by the court in <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Benttinen, </em>352 Mass. 495, 496 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In <em>Wright, </em>the testator bequeathed the residue of his estate to his wife. He also provided that \u201c[i]n the event that [he and his wife] should perish as the result of the same common disaster within sixty days of each other, then . . . whatever was left to her . . . shall ... be equally divided between [the testator\u2019s] grandchildren then living.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although the testator\u2019s wife predeceased him, her death was not under circumstances involving a common disaster. Nonetheless, the grandchildren argued that the will in controversy evidenced the testator\u2019s intention that the residuary should pass directly to them. <em>Id. </em>at 496-497. The court rejected the legatees\u2019 contention that a donor\u2019s intention to make a gift to an identified individual based upon one contingency was an adequate basis upon which to conclude what the donor would have intended had he foreseen the events that in fact occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 497. Rather, the court concluded that there was no manifestation of an intent by the testator in his will to dispose of the residuary of his estate on the contingency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>that came to pass. <em>Ibid. Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Schmitt, </em>349 Mass. at 671-673, is to similar effect. The fact that property may ultimately pass by Belle\u2019s will to one not benefited by the terms of the 1959 trust begs the question to whom she would have wanted the corpus distributed. Cf. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Benttinen, </em>352 Mass. at 497-498.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In support of his claim, Michael relies upon what he perceives to be the applicability of the presumption that a will should be construed to result in intestacy only if required. We think this proposition is inapplicable in the present case. In the first instance, this presumption applies only when the court cannot ascertain from the face of the will how the testator intended the property in controversy to be distributed. See <em>Flannery </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>432 Mass. at 670 &amp; n.5. In any event, the matter before us does not involve a scheme of testamentary disposition. Rather, we are concerned with the terms of an inter vivas trust that does not threaten any intestate succession. Belle died testate, and any reversion will pass in accordance with the terms of her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">There are additional reasons why we do not accept Michael\u2019s arguments concerning Belle\u2019s intentions in respect to the 1959 trust. Contrary to Michael\u2019s argument, Belle\u2019s intent to have trust property remain with her grandchildren and their issue cannot reasonably be ascertained from an over-all plan of the trust. Contrast, e.g., <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>152 Mass. 95, 101 (1890) (court could infer testator\u2019s intent through his like treatment of classes of beneficiaries); <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bourke, </em>209 Mass. at 486-487 (same); <em>Renwick </em>v. <em>Macomber, </em>225 Mass. 380, 384 (1917) (testatrix\u2019s will manifests her \u201cintended equality of participation\u201d by children of her husband or their issue as class); <em>New England Merchs. Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>350 Mass. 265, 266 &amp; n.2 (1966) (testator\u2019s intent to show generosity toward his son). Nor does the 1959 trust set out an overarching intent to treat classes of beneficiaries equally. Contrast, e.g., <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>152 Mass. at 101; <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bourke, </em>209 Mass. at 485-486. Further, the cases relied upon by Michael involve a testamentary disposition allowing for a presumption that the testator intended to dispose of the whole residuary by dividing it equally among branches of a family. In the present case, there is no need to construe the 1959 trust language to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>avoid violating the settlor\u2019s intent, where Ruth Ann and Michael were treated the same by the express terms of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In further support of his \u201cgeneral scheme\u201d argument, Michael points to the terms of the trust Belle created for his benefit, referred to in \u00a7 11(F) of the 1959 trust, simultaneously with the trust for Ruth Ann\u2019s benefit. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>He argues that the terms of those two simultaneously created trusts show that Belle intended that if the gift for the benefit of one grandchild and his or her issue failed, then that gift should vest, in the first instance, in his or her sibling.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Assuming that it is appropriate to look to extrinsic evidence, i.e., the trust established simultaneously by Belle for the benefit of Michael, in the absence of any ambiguity in the terms of the 1959 trust, we think Michael\u2019s argument is not without some modicum of force upon first reading. However, we conclude that this is not a case in which a gift was in fact intended but inartfully or imperfectly expressed. Rather, it is a gift Belle might have made had she contemplated the events that in fact occurred. As stated in <em>Schena </em>v. <em>Pagliuca, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 449, 452 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cWhile intent is the lodestar of testamentary construction, it cannot be used ... to supply a missing clause or to permit speculation as to what the testatrix might have intended had she foreseen or contemplated events as they actually turned out, but for which she had made no provision. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>220 Mass. 360, 363 (1915). <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>256 Mass. 273, 278 (1926). <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Schmitt, </em>349 Mass. [at] 671-673 .... <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Benttinen, </em>352 Mass. at 497-498 .... 4 Bowe &amp; Parker, Page on Wills \u00a7 30.7, and Massachusetts cases cited in n.8, at 41-42 (1961).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Michael has not pointed to anything in \u00a7\u00a7 11(E) and 11(F) of the 1959 trust that supports the construction he places on those clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">b. <em>The claims for reimbursement. </em>Edward also appeals from so much of the judgment as dismissed his claims seeking reimbursement from the 1959, 1968, and 1972 trusts. See note 12, <em>supra. </em>His claims for reimbursement fall into two categories: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>those for expenses incurred in raising Adam and those as payment for services rendered in connection with the administration of the trusts during calendar years 2001 and 2002.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For the reasons set out below, we conclude that Edward has failed to demonstrate an adequate basis for disturbing the judgment dismissing his claims. See <em>Kunen </em>v. <em>First Agric. Natl. Bank, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 689 (1978); <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Placontrol, Inc., </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 298, 303 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">i. <em>Edward\u2019s administrative services. </em>Edward sought reimbursement from the trusts on the bases of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment. The judge concluded that Edward had no reasonable expectation of proving the necessary elements to sustain his theories of liability and that he had failed to bring his claims within the two-year limitation period set out in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 11. On appeal he addresses only the issue of his claims being barred by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Edward has failed to present an argument within the meaning of Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), demonstrating with citations to legal authorities and references to the materials in the summary judgment record that the judge was in error. Consequently, we do not consider the propriety of the judge\u2019s determination that his claim was time barred. See <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Carelli, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 85-86 (1995), and cases therein cited. Even assuming that Edward\u2019s claim was not time barred, we nonetheless would conclude that he has failed to sustain his burden of demonstrating an adequate basis for disturbance of the dismissal of this claim. See <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Placon-trol, Inc., </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">ii. <em>Edward\u2019s support of Adam. </em>Edward also sought reimbursement from the 1959, 1968, and 1972 trusts for the expenses he incurred in raising Adam. The judge allowed Michael\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that: (1) Edward\u2019s claim alleging a breach of the trustees\u2019 fiduciary obligation to inquire about and provide for Adam\u2019s support was time barred by the three-year limitation period set out in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A; and (2) there was insufficient evidence in the summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>record to sustain Edward\u2019s claim for reimbursement based on a theory of unjust enrichment resulting from his support of Adam.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">As found by the judge on the undisputed facts, Edward has served as settlor or trustee for all three of the trusts from which he seeks reimbursement. He was also Adam\u2019s legal guardian and was in contact with the trustees at all times. The judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u201cTo suggest that [Edward] did not know of a breach of fiduciary duty by the Trustees against Adam until after July 2, 2001 (three years prior to when [Edward] filed the claim), asks this Court to abandon reason and is beyond inference. The statute of limitations has run on this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We need say no more on this point other than that we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Even were Edward\u2019s claim not time barred, he would not be entitled to a trial on his claim for breach of fiduciary duty. As a trustee, he knew or should have known that a trustee has the discretionary power, exercised with \u201c[p]rudence and reasonableness,\u201d <em>Marsman </em>v. <em>Nasca, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 789, 796 (1991) (citation omitted), to make payments from trust funds for the support and maintenance of a trust beneficiary as well as to make reasonable inquiry into the financial or support needs of the beneficiary. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Rodd, </em>356 Mass. 584, 589-590 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">These duties, however, are owed to the beneficiaries of a trust. Consequently, any amounts wrongfully withheld from Adam by the trustees were, in the first instance, his property, title to which vested in the administrator of his estate upon his death. See <em>Marsman </em>v. <em>Nasca, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 798 (remedy for failure to make payments of trust principal is imposition of constructive trust in favor of beneficiary\u2019s estate). Cf. <em>Stuck </em>v. <em>Schumm, </em>290 Mass. 159, 163-164 (1935) (title to intestate\u2019s personal property vested in administrator of her estate who alone had right to bring action for its recovery). Edward, however, brought this action in his individual capacity rather than as Adam\u2019s next friend or administrator of his estate. Consequently, Edward\u2019s position on this matter is that of a claimant against the trusts to which Adam\u2019s estate might have a claim. A breach of the fiduciary duty owed to Adam does not, without more, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>provide an adequate basis to compel reimbursement to Edward for Adam\u2019s support.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">3. <em>Request for attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The trustees sought attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 45.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The motion apparently rested on the ground that the action was brought in bad faith, motivated by Edward\u2019s personal animosity toward Michael.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In ruling on the motion, the judge found that Edward had not acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d as that term is discussed in <em>Massachusetts Adventura Travel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 293, 296 (1989), citing to and quoting from <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Beacon Participations, Inc., </em>297 Mass. 398, 416-417 (1937).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The judge further found that some of Edward\u2019s claims reflected poor judgment rather than bad faith and that any bad faith that might be imputed to Edward by reason of the claim he abandoned, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>did not \u201cpermeate\u201d the complaint as a whole. See <em>Datacomm Interface, Inc. </em>v. <em>Computerworld, Inc., 396 </em>Mass. 760, 782 (1986). As also determined by the judge, the remaining claims set out in Edward\u2019s complaint presented valid questions of law that required her to construe the language of the 1959 trust. On this matter, see part 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Concluding that Edward did not act with a \u201cmalevolent purpose and design, i.e., with bad faith,\u201d in bringing this action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the judge declined to exercise her discretion to award the trustees attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 45. See <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 635 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201c \u2018Bad faith\u2019 is a general and somewhat indefinite term. It has no constricted meaning. It cannot be defined with exactness. It is not simply bad judgment. It is not merely negligence. It imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity. It implies conscious doing of wrong. It means a breach of a known duty through some motive of interest or ill will. It partakes of the nature of fraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Based upon the reasons given by the judge in denying the motion for attorney\u2019s fees, our discussion concerning the merits of the controversy between Edward and Michael, see part 2 of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>and the absence of any helpful argument on the claimed error concerning the denial of the request for attorney\u2019s fees, we see no basis for disturbing the judge\u2019s rulings on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The final judgment dated April 6,2005, dismissing all counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is affirmed in part and reversed in part. Judgment dismissing count II of the amended complaint dated September 1, 2004, is vacated, and judgment is to enter for the plaintiff on that count. The remainder of the judgment is affirmed. The case is remanded to the Probate and Family Court Department of the Trial Court for entry of judgment as so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The judgment dated February 11, 2005, on the defendants\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b518-12\">We summarize the facts viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Edward. See <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Group Health, Inc., </em>444 Mass. 668, 672 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\">In 1968, Mickey created the 1968 Mickey Redstone Trust for the benefit of the four children of his and Belle\u2019s sons, Edward and Sumner. Two of the four grandchildren are Edward\u2019s children, Ruth Ann and Michael.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Under the terms of the 1959 trust, the trustees were empowered to advance or delay the distribution of all or part of the trust estate under certain conditions. Edward initially asserted a claim against the trustees of the 1959 trust for breach of fiduciary duty based on their failure to distribute one-half the trust principal and accumulated income to Ruth Ann when she attained thirty years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>of age. However, this claim was subsequently abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Unlike the 1959 trust, the trust established for Michael\u2019s benefit provided that if he died leaving issue before full distribution of the trust property, one-third of the remaining trust property was to be held in trust for his surviving wife, if any, and the balance held in trust for his issue and the remainder distributed at the end of twenty years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\">It appears from what is before us that the trustees did not make a distribution of one-half the trust property to Ruth Ann when she attained the age of thirty. See note 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Edward and Madeline married after Ruth Ann\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The 1968 trust provides in part: \u201c[T]he Trustees shall use, apply and expend whatever part [of a share of the trust] principal or income ... as [they] in their discretion shall deem necessary and advisable for the welfare and benefit of [Ruth Ann\u2019s] issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\">In further support of his argument, Edward suggests that there is another reasonable interpretation of the 1959 trust language, viz., that Adam\u2019s beneficial interest was not subject to a condition of survivorship and that the remainder interest in the 1959 trust vested in Adam\u2019s estate upon his death. In making this suggestion, Edward makes clear that he is <em>not </em>arguing that we should conclude that the interest in question vested in Adam\u2019s estate. Rather, he is pointing out that where the language of the 1959 trust instrument is reasonably susceptible to various interpretations, one cannot infer with any degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>certainty that Belle intended for the trust assets to pass to Michael.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Our conclusion that the terms of the trust are unambiguous makes it unnecessary for us to consider Michael\u2019s alternative argument that even if the terms of the trust were determined to be ambiguous, there is extrinsic evidence to support his position, and Edward\u2019s contention that any extrinsic evidence is not persuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b522-10\">As stated in <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Schmitt, </em>349 Mass. 669, 672 (1965): \u201dIn appropriate cases, this court has supplied by implication an omission in the terms of a will.\u201d In determining Belle\u2019s intent in respect to the 1959 trust, we construe the trust instrument in the same manner as if the instrument were a will. See <em>Groden </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>382 Mass. 333, 336 n.4 (1981) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>(requirement to construe instrument to give effect to intention of donor essentially identical in both trusts and wills).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">We note that in respect to the 1968 trust, Edward appeals from the dismissal of his claims only insofar as they pertain to those amounts which might be apportioned to and charged against Michael\u2019s \u201cshare\u201d of the 1959 trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Michael and the trustees also sought fees pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. The judge denied their motions, and the Probate and Family Court docket does not reflect that notices of appeal were filed. Had timely notices of appeal been filed, jurisdiction over such appeals would lie with a single justice of this court. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G; <em>Danger Records, Inc. </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>444 Mass. 1, 8-9 (2005); <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Shriberg, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 277, 282-284 (1991). This court, therefore, cannot consider the propriety of the judge\u2019s ruling under G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\">The trustees\u2019 assertion on this point is not supported by their citations to the record appendix.
