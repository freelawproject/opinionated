We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), the following facts could have been found by the jury. On October 17, 2002, the defendant, wearing a scarf covering his mouth, a baseball cap, and black glasses, approached a teller\u2019s window <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>of the Fleet Bank located at Roche Brothers supermarket in Natick. From \u201cwhat [the defendant] was wearing,\u201d the teller, William MaCakathi, knew what the defendant \u201cwas there for,\u201d and closed a previously opened drawer in which money was kept. The defendant told MaCakathi to open his drawer, and the latter slid some money under the glass window. The defendant said, \u201cIs this what you got? I\u2019m not going to go away for only this.\u201d MaCakathi tried to show him what was in the drawer. The defendant patted his sweatshirt and MaCakathi thought \u201cthere was something in his jacket but I didn\u2019t see what it was. And I didn\u2019t want to see what it was.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MaCakathi was \u201cshocked when the process was going on. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing but just trying to follow the basics, what we are taught by Fleet Bank, what you should do when something like this occurs.\u201d When asked whether he recalled being scared, he answered, \u201cI was not that much scared at him because the glasses which were covering us were bulletproof but there was somebody\u201d \u2014 another customer, a woman \u25a0\u2014 \u201cnext to him in the bank which made me scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The statute governing unarmed robbery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>19(b), </em>in relevant part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cWhoever, not being armed with a dangerous weapon, by force and violence, or by assault and putting in fear, robs, steals or takes from the person of another, or from his immediate control, money or other property which may be the subject of larceny, shall be punished . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The defendant concedes that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novicki, </em>324 Mass. 461, 466 (1949), indicates that if \u201cacts of violence\u201d are committed on others and the victim was aware of them and thereby put in fear for them, the victim need not fear for himself. The defendant\u2019s argument is that here, however, there was no assault on anyone. He claims that because the jury did not find the defendant armed, the Commonwealth cannot assert that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>sweatshirt-patting motion was an \u201cassault.\u201d This argument is without merit; it is enough that the jury could find that MaCaka-thi, based on the defendant\u2019s masked appearance, conduct, and gestures, reasonably feared that the defendant would use force unless MaCakathi complied with his demands. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. 299, 304 (1973). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>110 Mass. 407, 409 (1872); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Musgrave, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 523 n.5 (1995), and cases cited. We also reject the defendant\u2019s additional argument that MaCakathi\u2019s fear that a customer might be hurt is insufficient and that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novicki, supra, </em>requires that there be an actual assault on the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>19(b), </em>permits a conviction for unarmed robbery in either of two ways: \u201cby force applied to the person, with intent to steal, or by an assault putting the person in fear, with the same intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. at 302. There is no requirement that the fear be for MaCakathi himself. The jury could find: (1) objectively menacing conduct by the defendant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>110 Mass. at 409, undertaken with the intent to put MaCakathi in fear for the purpose of stealing the bank\u2019s money; and (2) this conduct resulted in reasonable fear or apprehension on MaCakathi\u2019s part and thereby facilitated the theft. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. at 304. They were also warranted in concluding that MaCakathi turned over the money because he feared that if he did not comply with the defendant\u2019s request, a customer standing near the defendant might get hurt. Even if the threatening gestures against MaCakathi did not cause him to fear for himself,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> they induced him to hand over the money because they reasonably caused him to fear for the customer\u2019s safety. We see no reason to limit the rationale of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novicki, </em>324 Mass. at 466, as the defendant contends, to the situation where acts of violence are committed on third persons. See <em>Magnotti </em>v. <em>State, </em>842 So. 2d 963, 966 n.2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>(Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2003). MaCakathi\u2019s reasonable fear for the customer was sufficient to satisfy the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-15\">The defendant was also convicted of an attempt to commit a crime (an attempt to hold up a different bank on a different date). He does not challenge that conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\">MaCakathi\u2019s testimony did not indicate whether the defendant patted his sweatshirt and held what MaCakathi thought was something in his jacket prior to MaCakathi giving the money to the defendant. His recollection of those gestures and of his belief was elicited after he was shown a police report. Neither party mentions the timing of the gestures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The jury could also have disbelieved MaCakathi\u2019s statement that he was not frightened for himself. He may have been testifying from false bravado in presuming bullet-proof glass would protect him from a gun. Cf. <em>Magnotti </em>v. <em>State, </em>842 So. 2d 963, 965-966 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
