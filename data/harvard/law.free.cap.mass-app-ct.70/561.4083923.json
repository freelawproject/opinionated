Claiming that their subdivision plans had been constructively approved and that the town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>clerk had improperly refused to tender certificates pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81V,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> documenting the constructive approval, the plaintiffs, prior to bringing the present action, brought a mandamus action to compel production of such certificates. On appeal, in an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to our rule 1:28, we denied the plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief because of their unreasonable delay in bringing the mandamus action; the plaintiffs remain without the aforesaid certificates. <em>Kitras </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Aquinnah, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 1121 (2004) <em>(Kitras </em>v. <em>Town Clerk).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The plaintiffs separately brought the instant action seeking, among other things, a judgment declaring that, due to town inaction, their subdivision plans had been constructively and \u201cfinally approved,\u201d and that the subject lands are accordingly entitled to the benefit of a zoning freeze pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> even absent certificates from the town clerk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81V. The defendants moved successfully for summary judgment on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs take the position that their acknowledged inability to secure the G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81V, certificates necessary to record the subdivisions under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8IV,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> presents no impediment to their enjoyment of the eight-year zoning freeze provided by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. They contend that the town\u2019s inaction on their subdivision plans itself means that their plans were \u201cfinally approved\u201d for purposes of the c. 40A, \u00a7 6, freeze. Because the motion judge ruled that the zoning freeze could not be triggered absent the c. 41, \u00a7 81V, certificates, the plaintiffs claim error. We conclude that the judge did not err in his determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, final approval as contemplated by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, is achieved only with receipt of an endorsement or certificate pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81V; constructive approval pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, is not \u201cfinal.\u201d The plaintiffs here have only \u00a7 81U constructive approvals. It is readily apparent that such approvals are not \u201cfinal\u201d within the meaning of c. 40A, \u00a7 6. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par. (providing for process freeze during pendency of appeal, and eight-year freeze from date of endorsement of plan that is \u201cfinally approved\u201d). While the plaintiffs\u2019 mandamus action was pending, they had the benefit of a process freeze. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Broken Stone Co. </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>430 Mass. 637 (2000); <em>Kindercare Learning Centers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westford, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 924 (2004). Having failed in their mandamus action, however, the plaintiffs have not achieved, nor can they ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>achieve, the final approval required to trigger the eight-year freeze provided by c. 40A, \u00a7 6, for subdivision plans that are \u201cfinally approved.\u201d See <em>Krafchuk </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Ipswich, ante </em>484, 490 &amp; n.12 (2007) (even assuming constructive approval pursuant to c. 41, \u00a7 81U, absent final approval, \u201cno zoning freeze had been secured\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The plaintiffs contend that final approval takes effect automatically, absent an appeal within twenty days of the date of constructive approval. We disagree. See <em>Krafchuk </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Ipswich, supra </em>at 489 (\u201c[constructive approval is not self-actuating\u201d). For example, unlike c. 41, \u00a7 81U,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> where failure of the planning board to act in a timely fashion results in the automatic constructive approval of a definitive subdivision plan,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> see, e.g., <em>Kay-Vee Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Ludlow, </em>355 Mass. 165, 168 (1969) (concluding that planning board\u2019s failure to comply with requirements of \u00a7 81U \u201cresulted in a constructive approval of the plan\u201d), under \u00a7 81V, final approval of such a plan is not automatic. Section 81V provides that the town clerk shall issue a certificate stating that approval resulting from the planning board\u2019s failure to act \u201chas become final\u201d; if the clerk fails to do so, final approval does not automatically take effect. Rather, the applicant must pursue a remedy in mandamus. See <em>id. </em>at 169. \u201cWhen the meaning of a statute is brought into question, a court properly should read other sections and should construe them together . . . .\u201d <em>LeClair </em>v. <em>Norwell, </em>430 Mass. 328, 333 (1999), quoting <em>from-Pentucket Manor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>Chronic Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>394 Mass. 233, 240 (1985). If the Legislature had intended to make final approval under \u00a7 81V automatic, it could have done so, employing language similar to that in \u00a7 81U.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The filing of the clerk\u2019s certificate pursuant to c. 41, \u00a7 81V, is no mere formality. The subdivision control scheme establishes \u201can orderly procedure for definitive action within stated times, and for notice of that action in offices of record within stated times, so that all concerned may rely upon recorded action or the absence thereof.\u201d <em>Selectmen of Pembroke </em>v. <em>R. &amp; P. Realty Corp., </em>348 Mass. 120, 125 (1964). Compliance with statutory procedures as they concern documentation evidencing action or inaction is vital insofar as such documentation provides assurance to interested parties that an act has or has not been done. See <em>Kay-Vee Realty </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Ludlow, </em>355 Mass. at 168 (even if planning board had taken \u201cfinal action\u201d to disapprove plan pursuant to c. 41, \u00a7 81U, plan must be considered constructively approved because board failed to file \u201ccertificate of such action\u201d as required by that section; court ordered town clerk to issue certificate pursuant to \u00a7 81V).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Moreover, under c. 40A, \u00a7 6, no eight-year freeze can commence absent an endorsement or certificate pursuant to c. 41, \u00a7 81V. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par., reflects legislative reliance on the statutory scheme set forth in the subdivision control laws. See, e.g., <em>Falcone </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Stoughton, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 950, 950 (1982) (zoning freeze pursuant to c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par., \u201cif the words of the statute are to be taken literally, would run not from the date of approval but \u2018from the date of the endorsement of such approval\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>Vazza </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brockton, </em>359 Mass. 256, 263-264 (1971) (reciting history of amendments to zoning freeze provision). Compare note 6, <em>supra </em>(under current version of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, if definitive plan is \u201cfinally approved,\u201d zoning freeze runs \u201cfor eight years <em>from the date of the endorsement </em>of such approval\u201d), with St. 1961, c. 435, \u00a7 2 (if definitive plan \u201cbecomes approved,\u201d zoning freeze runs \u201cfor a period of five years <em>from the date of such </em>approval\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The \u201cendorsement\u201d of final approval, required by c. 40A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u00a7 6, fifth par., to trigger the eight-year zoning freeze, refers to either type of official documentation provided by c. 41, \u00a7 81V, i.e., an endorsement from the planning board or a certificate attesting to final approval from the town clerk. General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 81V, treats a planning board \u201cendorsement\u201d under the first sentence, and a clerk\u2019s \u201ccertificate\u201d under the second sentence, as alternative means of achieving final approval of a plan. See, e.g., the third sentence of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81V: \u201cThe plan bearing such endorsement or the plan and such certificate, as the case may be, shall be delivered . . . .\u201d Moreover, \u201c[t]he Subdivision Control Law is a \u2018comprehensive statutory scheme,\u2019 \u201d <em>Nantucket Land Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 208 (1977), quoting from <em>Costanza &amp; Bertolino, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of N. Reading, </em>360 Mass. 677, 679 (1971), within which the endorsement of a plan by the planning board and a certificate from the town clerk attesting to constructive approval are functional equivalents: each evidences final approval, triggers the eight-year zoning freeze, entitles the party to record the plan, and triggers definite time periods for appeals. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81V, 81V, 81BB; G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In the matter before us, we have already determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 mandamus action has failed because it was not timely brought. See <em>Kitras </em>v. <em>Town Clerk, supra. </em>There is, therefore, no further opportunity for the plaintiffs to secure final approval of their subdivision plans, and it is time to bring this matter to a close. Cf. <em>Chiuccariello </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Boston, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 482, 489 (1990) (time limits for appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, indicate Legislature\u2019s \u201cconcern and intention, that there be both a beginning and an end to th[e appeals] process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Because the plaintiffs are unable to obtain certificates of final approval pursuant to c. 41, \u00a7 81V, the eight-year zoning freeze pursuant to c. 40A, \u00a7 6, cannot be triggered as matter of law. Compare <em>Falcone </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Stoughton, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 950 (planning board correctly declined to endorse plan, and hence, zoning freeze would not apply); <em>Krafchuk </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Ipswich, supra </em>at 490 n.12. There was therefore no error in the judge\u2019s allowance of the defendants\u2019 motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>summary judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThis being an action for declaratory relief, however, the judgment should have declared the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Watertown Hous. Authy., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 995, 996 (1988), citing <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>373 Mass. 819, 829 (1977). The judgment shall be modified to declare that the plaintiffs are entitled to neither the eight-year zoning freeze provided by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par., nor the three-year freeze provided by G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 127P.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\">General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 81V, inserted by St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201cIn case of approval of a plan by action of the planning board, after the expiration of twenty days without notice of appeal. . . or if appeal has been taken after the entry of a final decree of the court sustaining the approval of such plan, the planning board shall cause to be made upon the plan a written endorsement of its approval.
