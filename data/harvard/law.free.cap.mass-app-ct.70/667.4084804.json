L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>c. 272, \u00a7 4B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, acting on the defendant\u2019s posttrial motion under Mass.R.Crim.P. 25(b)(2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), the trial judge denied her motion to set aside the verdict and enter a finding of not guilty or, in the alternative, order a new trial. The defendant appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence corroborating the immunized witness\u2019s testimony and the judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that they could not convict solely on the testimony of the immunized witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>While Belmont police Officer Michael Logan was on patrol in the area of 43 Burnham Street on December 4, 2001, at about 2:00 a.m., his attention was drawn to a Boston taxicab idling in front of an apartment building at that address. He had a brief conversation with the driver of the taxicab, and then moved his cruiser a little distance away to observe the scene. He saw a very young woman leave the building and enter the taxicab. She was wearing a coat, very tight jeans, and stiletto heels. As the taxicab drove away, Officer Logan followed it. He soon observed the commission of a motor vehicle infraction and stopped the taxicab. Approaching the driver, he saw that the meter was not running and that the young woman was sitting in the front passenger seat not wearing a seat belt. On inquiry, she identified herself to Officer Logan as Jennifer Poupart. In checking the identities of the driver and the young woman in a computer database maintained by the Commonwealth and the United States, he determined there was no information on the name given by the young woman. She agreed to talk to the officer, however, and the two, along with Belmont police Officer Kristine Kennedy, had a twenty- to thirty-minute conversation at the rear of the taxicab. During that time, she gave the officers an identification card with her picture and a different name, three keys, two hotel room keys, and a notebook. Toward the end of the conversation, the young woman\u2019s cellular telephone rang; Officer Logan instructed her to answer it, and she briefly spoke with the defendant. The young woman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>agreed to go the police station, where she talked to the police for about forty-five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Unknown to the police at that time, Jennifer Poupart was a false name, and the young woman was under eighteen years old and a runaway who had been in the custody of the Department of Social Services (DSS). Scared and wanting to get away from the police, she also gave the police a false address and telephone number. She eventually was released to a man she identified at trial as her \u201cgodfather,\u201d and they then traveled to Alabama and Georgia. While in Georgia, she spoke with her attorney and requested that DSS be contacted so that she could return to Massachusetts. Escorted by a DSS case worker, she flew back to Boston on December 17, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">After her true identity was determined, Darcy\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> refusal to testify to a Superior Court grand jury was overcome in April, 2002, when she received a grant of immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\"><em>The trial. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case principally was presented through Darcy\u2019s testimony. The jury heard the following. Growing up in Boston, Darcy had been in the custody of DSS from the age of six. On her sixteenth birthday, June 15, 2001, she ran away from her foster home, and ended up working as a prostitute for a pimp in Boston\u2019s \u201ccombat zone.\u201d Dissatisfied with what she was doing, she asked to return to the custody of DSS, but after being placed in her former foster home, she ran away a day later. Finding a recently made friend, Maritsa Vasquez, also known as Maritsa Gonzalves, who ran an escort and prostitution service called \u201cInternational Tropical Girls\u201d in the Dorchester section of Boston, Darcy \u201cworked\u201d for her for a short time.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Darcy soon was introduced by Vasquez to the defendant and two others at apartment B-3 at 43 Burnham Street in Belmont. Vasquez explained to them that Darcy was a runaway from DSS, was sixteen years old, and needed a place to stay. It was arranged that Darcy would \u201cwork\u201d in the escort and prostitution services run from apartment B-3 at 43 Burnham Street on nights and weekends and that she could sleep there. The defendant and Vasquez instructed her never to reveal her true name, age, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>or Social Security number to anyone, in order to avoid being returned to DSS custody. Vasquez also provided her with a false identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Darcy described her work as a prostitute. She worked for two \u201cescort services\u201d operating from the apartment: \u201cUtopia,\u201d run by the defendant and Keith Scher; and \u201cLatin Princesses,\u201d run by Jonathan Ace.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The services were promoted through newspaper advertisements and distribution of business cards. Telephone calls to different numbers for the escort services were answered at apartment B-3, and the caller would ask for either a strip tease or massage. The caller would provide a name and telephone number and state a preference for the \u201ctype of girl.\u201d One of the women, sometimes Darcy, would call back, confirm her physical attributes, and arrange a time and place to meet. The escort services rented area hotel and motel rooms that the women could use, if needed. In addition, the escort services made drivers available to transport the women and to protect them if \u201csomething went wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Darcy was instructed to first collect a $100 fee for one-half hour and $200 for one hour when meeting a \u201cclient,\u201d before performing a strip tease or massage. After that, \u201cextras\u201d such as oral and vaginal sex could be discussed. Both Vasquez and the defendant instructed Darcy on performing \u201cextras.\u201d The defendant and Scher instructed Darcy that the fees would be eighty-five dollars for the former and $185 for the latter. Darcy would call the escort service at the conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">When Darcy first began working for the escort services, she went on calls with the defendant, who instructed her on how to perform \u201cextras\u201d and the need to obtain the fees before performing such \u201cextras.\u201d The defendant stopped going on calls in about November, 2001, to operate the telephones for the escort services. The defendant and Vasquez instructed Darcy to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>names and telephone numbers of clients in a notebook. Darcy made various notations in her notebook that served to remind her of a client in case the client called a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Darcy further testified that her financial arrangement with the escort services was to give one-half of her fees to the owner of the service, as well as twenty-five dollars to the driver, and to keep the rest. She gave the money either to Scher or, if he was not there, to the defendant. Darcy paid for her own clothing, food, and the prepaid telephone cards she used to communicate with the escort services.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Corroboration of testimony of immunized witness. </em>The defendant invokes G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 201,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to claim that there was no evidence of the commission of the crime with which she was charged, apart from Darcy\u2019s testimony. While Darcy\u2019s testimony provides a comprehensive and coherent narrative of her participation in the prostitution enterprise, there was other evidence introduced by the Commonwealth, which we examine both for its sufficiency under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979), and for its value as corroboration of Darcy\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">\u201cThe purpose of [G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 201,] is to require support for the credibility of the immunized witness. That support may come as much in the form of corroboration of evidence of the commission of the crime as it does from proof that the defendant was a participant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeBrosky, </em>363 Mass. 718, 730 (1973). It is \u201crequire[d] that there be some evidence in support of the testimony of an immunized witness on at least one element of proof essential to convict the defendant.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe policy basis of evaluating credibility remains the most important factor behind [G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 201]. Cases from other States support this view.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>425 Mass. 357, 359 (1997) (footnote omitted). \u201c \u2018[E]vidence corroborating accomplice testimony \u201cneed not prove the commission of the crime\u201d \u2019; all that is necessary is that the evidence \u2018satisfies the jury that the accomplice is telling the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>at 359-360, quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>48 N.Y.2d 938, 940 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The charged crime under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4B,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) Darcy was engaged in prostitution (2) as a minor<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; (3) the defendant knew Darcy was a prostitute; and (4) the defendant derived support or shared in the monetary proceeds of prostitution, knowing that such proceeds were from the prostitution of Darcy. The judge so instructed the jury. Those instructions are not contested in this appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The Commonwealth elicited the following evidence which supports the corroboration requirements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">a. Officer Logan\u2019s observations of Darcy entering a Boston taxicab in Belmont at an early morning hour, and the hotel keys, notebook, and false identification card she gave him, support her testimony describing how she set out on a \u201ccall.\u201d It is significant that this evidence was given voluntarily by Darcy to the police before she was granted immunity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">b. Most of the defendant\u2019s argument is focused on an assertion that there was inadequate corroboration of Darcy\u2019s age. There was ample evidence that she was a minor. Darcy was competent to testify to her age, stating that her birthday was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>June 15, 1985, and that she was sixteen on December 4, 2001. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>162 Mass. 504, 505 (1895) (\u201cSuch testimony has been repeatedly held competent\u201d). Aside from the testimony of Darcy\u2019s case manager, Maria Gomes-Cruz, that DSS custody of a child ends at age eighteen, Gomes-Cruz testified, unchallenged, that she met Darcy when Darcy was eleven years old, that she had been Darcy\u2019s case manager since 1996, and that Darcy was in DSS custody on December 17, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">c. In addition to other evidence of the defendant\u2019s direct involvement in Darcy\u2019s activities, the defendant interrupted Darcy\u2019s conversation with Officers Logan and Kennedy after the taxi had been stopped, by making a call to Darcy\u2019s cellular telephone. It is a reasonable inference that the defendant was monitoring Darcy\u2019s whereabouts after she left 43 Burnham Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">d. The defendant did not testify at trial. Belmont police Sergeant Richard Santangelo, however, testified that in an unrecorded, Mirandized statement made to the police, the defendant stated that Utopia was her business and she received $100 for setting up assignments of girls at bachelor parties, but if they arranged to receive cash for sex, they did so on their own, and she knew nothing about it. On appeal, the defendant asserts that the evidence minimally may have been sufficient to show that an escort service was being operated at 43 Burnham Street, but such a service is legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">There were several exhibits, however, from which the jury reasonably could infer that the escort services were organized for the recruitment and assignment of prostitutes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> An electronic mail message written by the owner of Utopia to a number of addressees at \u201cadultfriendfinder.com\u201d outlined a plan for a \u201ctraveling family of women\u201d to attract men to a party at a hotel, stating that \u201call of the men are tricks.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That term is used in another exhibit titled \u201cDaily Routine,\u201d apparently a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>schedule for the women to be involved in a plan to find \u201ctricks\u201d at clubs, lounges, and bars, and take them to a hotel. Two pages of handwritten notes contain what appear to be questions for interviews, including \u201cHow far will go 4 $.\u201d There are several references to \u201cho,\u201d the street slang for prostitute. What appears to be a copy of a Web site page, ostensibly recruiting women for escort services, also states, \u201clooking for weomin <em>[sic] </em>for great sex,\u201d and that the \u201cideal person\u201d includes a \u201csexy female who is adventurous[,] . . . driven by money, and know[s] how to seduce and hustle men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Finally, the defendant asserts that because so little cash was found in apartment B-3 at 43 Burnham Street, that small amount of money corroborates nothing with respect to any amount of proceeds shared from prostitution. In this case, there was evidence that newspaper advertisements and the rent of the apartment were paid in cash. In any event, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4B, is silent on any requirement for proof of the number of times that \u201cearnings,\u201d \u201cproceeds,\u201d or \u201cmonies\u201d are shared or their amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">We conclude that the evidence amply corroborated Darcy\u2019s testimony. We also conclude that the evidence, viewed according to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. at 677-678, was adequate on each element of the charged crime. All questions of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the testimony were for the jury to decide. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruci, </em>409 Mass. 94, 97 (1991); <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>432 Mass. 623, 625 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">2. <em>Claimed error in failure to give specific instruction on corroboration. </em>The defendant claims that the judge failed to give a requested instruction that the jury \u201ccan\u2019t convict solely on the testimony [of an immunized witness].\u201d The defendant asserts that the corroboration was \u201cslim at best,\u201d and that if the jury did not believe the corroborating evidence, they convicted her solely on the testimony of the immunized witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">In addressing this issue as raised in the defendant\u2019s posttrial motion, the judge stated in his memorandum of decision and order that the \u201cjury were never informed that [Darcy\u2019s] immunity for past crimes was contingent on her truthful testimony.\u201d Accordingly, he also stated that \u201c[s]pecial instructions concerning the credibility of an immunized witness are not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>where the details of the immunity agreement are not entered in[] evidence and the requirement of truthful testimony as a condition of immunity is not highlighted.\u201d \u201cWhere it is unlikely that the jury were misled into accepting the veracity of the witnesses solely because of their immunization, we have not required special instructions concerning the credibility of immunized witnesses.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>421 Mass. 400,413 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The instruction given by the judge was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">\u201cIn this case you heard the testimony of [Darcy,] who testified under an agreement with the prosecution that in exchange for her truthful testimony the prosecution would grant her immunity from any crimes that she has committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">\u201cYou should examine that witness\u2019s credibility with particular care. You may consider that agreement in any hopes the witness may have as to future advantages from the prosecution in evaluating that witness\u2019s credibility along with all other factors I have already mentioned regarding credibility. You should also consider the fact that the Commonwealth does not know whether the witness is telling the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">This instruction conforms substantially with the Superior Court model jury instruction for immunized witnesses. See Massachusetts Superior Court Criminal Practice Jury Instruction \u00a7 4.21 (Mass. Continuing Legal Educ. Supp. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">\u201cWe have ruled that \u2018[t]he judge is not required to grant a particular instruction so long as the charge, as a whole, adequately covers the issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 739 (1992), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>396 Mass. 306, 316 (1985). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 881, 882 (1977). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The defendant was also charged with inducing a minor to become a prostitute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4A. At the close of evidence, the trial judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty as to the \u00a7 4A charge, essentially on the ground that one cannot induce a minor who already is a prostitute to become a prostitute. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion as to the \u00a7 4B charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b693-9\"><em>A </em>pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Without the immunity, Darcy might have been subject to delinquency proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">While Jonathan Ace and Keith Scher are mentioned in this decision and were tried with the defendant, their cases have been disposed of, and nothing in this decision concerns those dispositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">As to the charges of deriving support from the proceeds of prostitution committed by a minor, the jury found Ace not guilty and Scher guilty. The jury also found Scher guilty of possession of cocaine. Scher appealed to this court and his convictions were affirmed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scher, </em>69 Mass.

Darcy testified that Ace once asked her age in the presence of the defendant, and when she replied eighteen or nineteen, he asked her to tell the truth.
