We thus affirm the conviction of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\"><em>Background. A </em>jury in the Dorchester Division of the Boston Municipal Court Department convicted the defendant, David Casiano, of intimidation of a witness in violation of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appeals, claiming that the trial judge erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>by (1) not granting his motion for a required finding of not guilty; (2) misapplying G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79J, and denying his request to introduce business records from the cellular telephone (cell phone) service provider; and (3) permitting a leading question to the complainant regarding his perception of the defendant\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>Facts. </em>At trial, the following testimony was offered. On December 1, 2004, the defendant was present in the court house awaiting his trial for drug-related offenses. Several times over the course of the day, the defendant saw an undercover police officer who was also present in the court house to testify against him. At some point, the defendant left the court room, removed a cell phone with an apparent picture-taking component from his pocket, and pointed it at the undercover officer and other officers who were sitting in the court house corridor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant began pressing buttons as if he were taking photographs of the officers. The incident was reported to the judge, who ordered the immediate confiscation of the cell phone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the phone was taken, the defendant said to the undercover officer, \u201cWhat do you think I am, fucking stupid? I already emailed the pictures to my house before you took the phone!\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Upon inspection of the cell phone, a court officer could not find photographs of either the undercover officer or any of the other police officers who were present in the corridor at the time the incident occurred. Nor was he able to ascertain whether the defendant\u2019s cell phone was capable of connecting to the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The undercover officer testified that he was concerned that someone involved in drug dealing would recognize him if his picture were posted to the Internet, which could pose a serious threat to his safety and the safety of his family.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>checked the Internet in the days following the incident to ascertain whether his photo had been posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">During the trial on the witness intimidation charge, the defendant attempted to introduce phone records from the cell phone service provider T-Mobile, which he alleged indicated that his cell phone was not operational on the day of the incident. Although the records were certified by an affidavit and faxed to the court by a T-Mobile representative, no one from the company was present at trial to testify about the information contained therein. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s request to admit the records, ruling that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 791, would be violated absent the testimony of a representative from the company.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He further ruled that the information was not relevant. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the judge erred by not granting his motion because there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to support the jury\u2019s verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant also claims that the judge improperly denied his request to introduce relevant business records and that the prosecutor asked the complainant a leading question, which prejudiced the defendant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>We review the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty to determine \u201cwhether the evidence received, viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient so that the jury \u2018might properly draw inferences, not too remote in the ordinary course of events, or forbidden by any rule of law, and conclude upon all the established circumstances and warranted inferences that the guilt of the defendant was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>406 Mass. 581, 584 (1990), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 588 (1983). \u201cCircumstantial evidence is competent to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>monwealth v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 533 (1989). \u201cAn inference drawn from circumstantial evidence \u2018need only be reasonable and possible; it need not be necessary or inescapable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>373 Mass. 329, 341 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Under the version of the law in effect when the defendant was convicted, the charge of witness intimidation required the Commonwealth to establish that (1) the target of the alleged intimidation was a witness against the defendant in some stage of a criminal proceeding; (2) the defendant wilfully tried to influence or interfere with the witness; (3) the defendant did so by means of \u201cmisrepresentation, intimidation, force or express or implied threats of force\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; and (4) the defendant did so with the purpose of influencing the complainant as a witness. See G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, as amended through St. 1996, c. 393, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conley, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 50, 53 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">It is not disputed that the complainant was a witness against the defendant in a criminal trial and that the defendant made a physical gesture consistent with taking a photograph of the witness. The defendant maintains, however, that there is no evidence that he used, in his words, \u201cintimidation, force, or threats of force,\u201d arguing that he did not show any hostility toward the witness prior to the action taken; that the witness\u2019s purported concern did not prompt him to take any additional precautions as an undercover officer; and that a reasonable police officer in the complainant\u2019s position would not have been intimidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">An action does not need to be overtly threatening to fall within the meaning of \u201cintimidation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 233, 235-236 (1998).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the defendant did not expressly threaten the officer\u2019s person, his ac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>tian threatened the undercover officer\u2019s continuing safety. That the defendant did not exhibit hostility toward the officer prior to his actions is inconsequential, as a single act by a defendant is sufficient to satisfy the intimidation statute. <em>Id. </em>at 235-236.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Further, it is irrelevant whether a victim takes precautions<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in response to the defendant\u2019s behavior, as \u201c[t]he statute punishes anyone who \u2018willfully endeavors,[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] to intimidate a witness; it does not require that the intimidation be successful.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>444 Mass. 102, 109 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Finally, even if, as the defendant suggests, a reasonable police officer standard were to be applied instead of a reasonable person standard, the trier of fact could infer that a similarly situated police officer anticipating future undercover activities on the street would reasonably be intimidated by a criminal defendant taking his picture. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The defendant also maintains that even if his actions did rise to the level of intimidation, the prosecutor did not prove that they were intended to influence the complainant\u2019s testimony. Assuming arguendo that in this case an obvious connection between the defendant\u2019s actions and his intent is lacking, one can make an inference based upon \u201c[t]he place, time, and circumstances [of the incident].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCreary, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 797, 800 (1998). Although the defendant did not make any statement indicating that his action was taken to influence the officer\u2019s testimony, he did make a threatening statement to the complainant suggesting that he had already sent the photographs to his home computer. The logical import of the statement is that the photographs were irretrievable and could be exploited at a later time. Considering the \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cplace\u201d of both his action and statement,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see <em>ibid., </em>the jury could readily infer that the defendant intended to influence the complainant\u2019s impending testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>The defendant next claims that there is no evidence that any photographs were ever taken, affecting the \u201ccircumstances\u201d aspect of the inference. See <em>ibid. </em>It is irrelevant whether any photographs were taken, as the police officer was made to believe that the defendant was taking pictures of him and could disseminate his likeness, an act intended to intimidate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In sum, the jury had adequate evidence from which to infer that the defendant intended to influence the officer\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-15\">The defendant was convicted under an earlier version of the statute, G.

The objection was overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b731-11\">After reviewing the records, we are unable to discern whether the cell phone was deactivated at the time the incident occurred, and as observed by the judge, a portion of the records was blacked out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The new statute uses \u201charasses\u201d in place of \u201cforce or express or implied threats of force.\u201d See St. 2006, c. 48, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\">\u201cWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1184 (3d ed. 1993) defines intimidate as \u2018to make timid or fearful: inspire or affect with fear.\u2019 Within the context of G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, our Supreme Judicial Court has similarly defined the concept of intimidation as \u2018putting in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct.\u2019 <em>Planned Parenthood League, Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>417 Mass. 467, 474, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 868 (1994).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 235.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the complainant here did take precautions by checking the Internet after the incident to discover if his image had been disseminated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b733-9\">The word \u201cendeavors\u201d was deleted in the 2006 version of the statute.
