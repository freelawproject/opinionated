When the defendants sought to terminate the lease, Bradston filed suit in Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon cross motions for summary judgment, a judge granted the defendants\u2019 motion, determining that the lease is unenforceable because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>lacked the city auditor\u2019s certification<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as to available appropriation or citation to an appropriate authorizing statute, as required by St. 1998, c. 262, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Chapter 262 provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-6\">\u201cAll contracts made by . . . any officer, board or official of the county of Suffolk having power to incur obligations on behalf of said county in cases where said obligations are to be paid for wholly from the treasury of said city [of Boston], shall, when the amount involved is $10,000 or more, . . . be in writing; and no such contract shall be deemed to have been made or executed until . . . the auditor of said city has certified thereon that an appropriation is available therefor or has cited thereon the statute under authority of which the contract is being executed without an appropriation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The lease provides that it \u201cbecomes effective only upon execution and delivery thereof by [Bradston] and [the defendants], and upon execution of the City of Boston Standard Contract\u201d (standard contract). Although such a standard contract was signed by the parties, it has a certification by the city auditor that states \u201cAPPROVED AS TO AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATION OR PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 12.2 OF THE GENERAL CONDITIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $0.00.\u201d In addition, the standard contract, under article 12.3 of its general conditions, provides that \u201c[w]hen the amount of the City Auditor\u2019s certification of available funds is less than the face amount of the Contract, the City shall not be liable for any claims or requests for payment by the Contractor which would cause total claims or payments under this Contract to exceed the amount so certified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Relying upon the language of c. 262 the defendants argue, in essence, that because the city auditor had not certified an appropriation for the lease, and because the standard contract recites that the defendants will not be liable for any claims exceeding the auditor\u2019s certified appropriation, the lease is unenforceable under c. 262. Bradston, in turn, essentially argues that because the standard contract shows the internal code \u201cSUF02056\u201d on its face<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 an admitted reference to the defendants\u2019 2002 fiscal year operating budget under line item 8910-0000, see St. 2001, c. 177, \u00a7 2 \u2014 and because the standard contract has an \u201cexecuted\u201d stamp signed by a member of the city auditor\u2019s department, the auditor in practical effect certified that an amount equal to the face amount of the contract (slightly under $7 million) had been made available from the defendants\u2019 budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The parties agree that c. 262 applies to the standard contract. Their dispute is whether the city auditor certified an available appropriation or has cited a statute making such an appropriation unnecessary. The question therefore becomes, as Bradston argues, whether the reference to the defendants\u2019 unallocated 2002 budget \u2014 through the internal code \u201cSUF02056\u201d \u2014 combined with an \u201cexecuted\u201d stamp appearing on the face of the standard contract satisfies the available appropriation requirement of c. 262. Bradston\u2019s argument essentially reduces to the proposition that an \u201cexecuted\u201d stamp can substitute for an auditor\u2019s certification of available funds. Chapter 262, however, makes a clear distinction between those two events or concepts. Bradston never addresses how c. 262 can be said to have resolved the evil it presumably was enacted to remedy \u2014 preventing a municipality from spending money beyond its means \u2014 if an auditor\u2019s \u201c$0.00\u201d appropriation can be overridden simply by affixing an \u201cexecuted\u201d stamp on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">In the alternative, Bradston argues that the reference to \u201cSUF02056\u201d constitutes, within the meaning of c. 262, the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>auditor\u2019s \u201ccitation\u201d to the statute under which the contract is being executed \u201cwithout an appropriation.\u201d The judge decided otherwise, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-5\">\u201cSUF02056 does not appear to be a reference to a law passed by a legislative body. And even if it can be stretched to refer to the Fiscal 2002 state budget, it certainly does not refer to any authority on which the Standard Contract in issue is being executed. At most, it refers to a legislative enactment to appropriate an unallocated aggregate amount of money to the Sheriff\u2019s Department to be spent as the Sheriff properly allocates. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the purported ten-year lease agreement between Brad-ston and the Sheriffs Department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Bradston responds on appeal by raising a host of semantic arguments regarding the meaning of certain terms, including \u201cexecuted\u201d and \u201csigned,\u201d by invoking agency theory<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and by citing <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. 18, 25 (1980), for the general proposition that c. 262 does not require perfect compliance with its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">We are not persuaded that <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano </em>is helpful to Bradston here. The issue in <em>Lawrence </em>was whether G. L. c. 44, \u00a7 31C, which contains language similar to c. 262, invalidated a contract where the city auditor failed to certify an appropriation. <em>Id. </em>at 24. The Supreme Judicial Court held that the contract was valid and the certification requirements were met because a specific appropriation for the contract had been made by the city council. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25. Here, by contrast, there was no evidence of any such targeted appropriation. Also, unlike in <em>Lawrence, </em>the city auditor\u2019s certification here is not a mere formality and its absence is not an incidental omission. The city auditor did make a certification on the standard contract, although that certification, \u201cin the amount of $0.00,\u201d functionally attested that no funds were available to fulfill the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Accordingly, summary judgment dismissing Bradston\u2019s complaint was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b846-16\">Upon earlier consideration of this lease, we remanded the case for reasons unrelated to this appeal. See <em>Bradston Assocs., LLC </em>v. <em>Cabral, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 1116 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Unlike any other county sheriff\u2019s department, which is supported and controlled by the communities located in the county, the city of Boston alone controls the Suffolk County sheriff\u2019s department and pays for its operations from the city\u2019s treasury. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>212 Mass. 127, 128-129 (1912). This is a result of the city of Boston having purview over financial matters pertaining to the operation of the county of Suffolk. See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>358 Mass. 1, 6-7 (1970). See also G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 1 (city of Boston treasurer is also the Suffolk County treasurer); G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 42 (\u201cThe auditor of Boston shall be the auditor of Suffolk county. No bill against said county shall be paid until audited and allowed by him\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The parties and motion judge refer to St. 1998, c. 262, \u00a7 1, as \u201cc. 262.\u201d We do likewise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">This reference does not appear in the city auditor\u2019s certification, but instead appears in a separate code line under the heading \u201cProject/Grant\u201d located above the city auditor\u2019s certification.
