L. c. 149, \u00a7 185 (count I), and failure to pay overtime wages, in violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148 and 150 (count II). For the reasons set forth below, the summary judgment is reversed in part and affirmed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>1. <em>Facts. </em>Viewed in the light most favorable to Quazi, the nonmoving party, the materials in the record established the following. See <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>447 Mass. 791, 793 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In May, 2003, George Heufelder, the director of the county\u2019s department of health and the environment (department), hired Quazi to serve as the director of the county laboratory (laboratory). Set at grade STP-7, step 3, the position was full-time, with an annual salary of $56,545.34. Heufelder was Quazi\u2019s immediate supervisor. When Quazi was hired, he was not informed that his position had a mandatory six-month probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The laboratory was responsible for testing water quality throughout the county. The laboratory personnel looked for specific inorganic and organic compounds in water samples. If these compounds were detected, the laboratory personnel would quantify the levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Quazi, who holds undergraduate and graduate degrees in chemistry, had extensive experience with inorganic and organic molecular analysis as well as the maintenance of diversified instruments and computer systems. He was also familiar with both mandatory State and Federal environmental methods and protocols. The technical aspects of his job, Quazi indicated, were in the \u201c[sjpecialized field of chemistry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">When Quazi first started working, the laboratory lacked discipline and structure; Quazi claimed that nobody had listened to Heufelder or to the previous laboratory director. Brought in to make changes, Quazi claimed that during the course of his employment, he worked continuously to improve these problems as well as the work habits of the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">As the director of the laboratory, Quazi was responsible for managing the \u201cparamount\u201d technical tasks such as buying and running the instruments and troubleshooting. Quazi also managed seven employees within the laboratory. According to Quazi, Heufelder \u201cmassively interfered\u201d with Quazi\u2019s position, including Quazi\u2019s hiring authority, because of Heufelder\u2019s desire to \u201cbring in people of his own choice.\u201d When Quazi was working, Heufelder would come up to the laboratory twenty to twenty-five times per day. Quazi mentioned Heufelder\u2019s \u201ctoo frequent[]\u201d visits \u201cto the [county] commission [and the county] administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>In June, 2003, Heufelder told Quazi to keep track of all his overtime hours. In July, 2003, Quazi first learned about the probationary period. At that time, he asked the secretary for a copy of the employee handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">While serving as the director of the department, Heufelder, according to Quazi, continued to manage the Alternative Septic Systems Test Center (center), a private customer that owed a significant amount of money to the laboratory in unpaid bills. The center\u2019s statement of account dated September 18, 2003, showed that the center owed the laboratory $19,044.50. When Quazi realized that the laboratory management report of the same date showed that a credit of $8,658.51 had been given to the center on July 8, 2002, he asked Heufelder for an explanation. Heufelder never provided Quazi with an appropriate explanation for the credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Several times between June and September, 2003, Heufelder asked Quazi to credit the center\u2019s account in order to bring the balance owed to zero. Believing that Heufelder\u2019s requests were illegal, Quazi refused to alter the data in the laboratory\u2019s computer system. When Quazi refused to comply, Heufelder hired Elena Hughes, a friend of Heufelder\u2019s secretary, to perform the task. Heufelder did not advertise or post the position as required by the employee handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">In October, 2003, Quazi reported the illegal request and other alleged misbehavior by Heufelder to Margaret Downey, the assistant county administrator. Downey stated to Quazi that she did not know whether the center was a county account. Although Downey promised Quazi that she would speak with Heufelder and get back to Quazi, she never did. In November and December, 2003, Quazi also spoke with Mark Zielinski, the county administrator, about these issues, to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">On November 7, 2003, Heufelder asked Downey to extend Quazi\u2019s probationary period for another three months. Soon thereafter, at Heufelder\u2019s request, Quazi met with Kathleen Gilligan, a social worker, as part of an evaluation of personnel issues within the laboratory. On December 8, 2003, Quazi was terminated by Heufelder and Zielinski.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">In January, 2004, Quazi sent Zielinski a letter asking to be paid for \u201c[u]nofficial [o]vertime [h]ours.\u201d After receiving no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>response, Quazi filed a complaint about the unpaid overtime with the Attorney General\u2019s office. In August, 2004, Quazi was given leave to pursue a civil claim against the county for the unpaid compensation. Quazi\u2019s two-count complaint followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Retaliatory discharge in violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 185, the whistleblower statute. </em>The judge dismissed count I of Quazi\u2019s complaint on the ground that Quazi had failed to provide the county with prior written notice of his claim. Although the judge was correct that no such notice was given, the dismissal was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Quazi\u2019s action was brought only under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 185(b)(3), which, unlike G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 185(b)(1), is not subject to the written notice requirement of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 185(c)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number><em>Mailloux </em>v. <em>Littleton, </em>473 F. Supp. 2d 177, 184-185 (D. Mass. 2007). By its terms, \u00a7 185(c)(1) relates only to an employee\u2019s protection under \u00a7 185(A)(1). Quazi\u2019s complaint specifically alleges that his employer extended his probationary period and ultimately fired him because he refused to participate in Heufelder\u2019s illegal acts, i.e., falsely crediting an overdue account of one of the laboratory\u2019s private customers. As such, Quazi\u2019s claim falls squarely within \u00a7 185(b)(3). Quazi does not make any \u00a7 185(b)(1) allegation that he suffered retaliation because of his disclosures to superiors (or to a public body).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, this case is distinguishable on its facts from <em>Dirrane </em>v. <em>Brookline Police Dept., </em>315 F.3d 65, 73 (1st Cir. 2002), upon which the county relies. <em>Dirrane </em>essentially held that a police officer\u2019s filing of his whistleblower claim in court constituted \u201ca disclosure\u201d to a \u201cpublic body\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 185(c)(1), thereby triggering the written notice requirement. <em>Ibid. </em>The officer\u2019s claim in <em>Dirrane, </em>however, alleged violations only of \u00a7 185(b)(1) (retaliation due to officer\u2019s reporting to superiors of abuses in police force), not \u00a7 185(b)(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Dirrane </em>v. <em>Brookline Police Dept., supra </em>at 67-68, 72. Because no written notice was required of Quazi under the circumstances, so much of the summary judgment as dismisses count I of the complaint must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">b. <em>Failure to pay wages in violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number><em>the weekly payment of wages statute. </em>An employer violates the weekly payment of wages statute by failing to pay an employee all wages due on the date of his discharge. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. Here, Quazi claimed that the county violated the statute by failing to pay him for a significant amount of overtime wages. We agree with the judge that as a matter of law, there was no violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Under the overtime pay statute, an employer must pay an employee at least time and one-half for any hours worked in excess of forty in the course of one week. See G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A; <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. 165, 174 (2000). Twenty categories of employees, however, are expressly exempted from the provisions of the overtime pay statute. See G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A(1)-(20).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">As herein relevant, the overtime pay statute does not apply to any person employed \u201cas a bona fide executive, or administrative or professional person or qualified trainee for such position earning more than eighty dollars per week.\u201d G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A(3), as appearing in St. 1961, c. 431. The Legislature provided no further clarification regarding the meanings of these terms. See <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. at 170. The Supreme Judicial Court, however, has ruled that in interpreting the State statute, the courts should look for guidance to analogous Federal law and to the common meaning of these words.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 170-173.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Here, Quazi\u2019s high-level job position, comfortable grade of salary, and job duties established his exempt status as a \u201cbona fide executive, or administrative or professional person.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 171-173, and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 541.0 et seq. (2003), the interpretative regulations promulgated under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">As the county laboratory director, Quazi\u2019s primary duties were divided between his \u201cparamount\u201d technical functions and his managerial tasks. The water analysis process, which Quazi oversaw, required advanced knowledge in a field of science or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 541.3(a)(1), 541.301 (2003) (learned professions); <em>Reich </em>v. <em>Newspapers of New England, Inc., </em>44 F.3d 1060, 1070, 1077-1078 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Quazi\u2019s managerial tasks included purchasing and maintaining laboratory equipment, troubleshooting, directing the work of seven employees, and improving the over-all structure and discipline of the laboratory, a policy-making task involving a significant level of discretion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. at 172-173. It matters not that there was no evidence in the record whether Quazi performed his \u201cprofessional\u201d technical tasks or his \u201cexecutive\u201d managerial tasks more frequently.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both categories of tasks were covered by the exemption specified in \u00a7 1A(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In sum, Quazi was employed as a \u201cbona fide executive\u201d or a \u201cprofessional person\u201d and was, thus, exempt from the overtime provisions of \u00a7 1A. Contrast <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. at 172-173. As such, no overtime compensation was due him on his last day of work. Accordingly, the judge properly dismissed count II of the complaint, Quazi\u2019s claim under the weekly payment of wages statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>So much of the judgment as dismisses count I of the complaint is reversed, and the judgment is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Our conclusion is based on the statutory language, which reads in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">\u201c(b) An employer shall not take any retaliatory action against an employee because the employee does any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">\u201c(1) Discloses, or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy or practice of the employer. . . that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">\u201c(3) Objects to, or refuses to participate in any activity, policy or practice which the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\">\u201c(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), <em>the protection against retaliatory action provided by subsection (b)(1) shall not apply </em>to an employee who makes a disclosure to a public body unless the employee has brought the activity, policy or practice in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law ... to the attention of a supervisor of the employee by written notice and has afforded the employer a reasonable opportunity to correct the activity, policy or practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-12\">\u201c(2) An employee is not required to comply with paragraph (1) if he: (A) is reasonably certain that the activity, policy or practice is known to one or more supervisors of the employer and the situation is emergency in nature; (B) reasonably fears physical harm as a result of the disclosure provided; or (C) makes the disclosure to a public body as defined in clause (B) or (D) of the definition for \u2018public body\u2019 in subsection (a) for the purpose of providing evidence of what the employee reasonably believes to be a crime.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">G.

L. c. 149, \u00a7 185(c)(2), to the \u00a7 185(c)(1) requirement of written notice. Thus, Quazi, the county, and the motion judge all assumed that Quazi\u2019s claim was subject to \u00a7 185(c)(1). We have chosen in our discretion to examine and rule on that assumption; although we hesitate to consider any matter not previously raised, here the issue has been fully briefed by the parties (in supplemental memoranda of law) and argued orally, the question is unanswered in the Commonwealth, the matter is likely to arise again, and as it concerns the whistleblower statute, it carries public importance. See <em>Cottam </em>v. <em>CVS Pharmacy, </em>436 Mass. 316, 320 (2002), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\">We find no merit in the county\u2019s argument that by bringing his \u00a7 185(b)(3) claim to the court (a public body), Quazi necessarily \u201cchannelled]\u201d that claim through \u00a7 185(b)(1), thus making \u00a7 185(c)(1) applicable. The county\u2019s contention ignores the relevant language of \u00a7 185(b): \u201cAn employer shall not take any retaliatory action against an employee <em>because </em>the employee ... (1) discloses. . . to a public body...\u201d (emphasis added). Quazi alleges \u00a7 185(b)(3) retaliation that preceded, and did not result from, his court filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b808-9\">We thus have no occasion to opine on the correctness of the <em>Dirrane </em>court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 185(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The Supreme Judicial Court recognized that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1), the cognate exemption under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, was \u201cnearly identical\u201d to \u00a7 1A(3). <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. at 171.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b810-9\">To the extent that Quazi argues in his brief that he could not be considered a bona fide executive because he had no power to hire or fire employees as required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.1(c) (2003), see <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. at 171 n.5, Quazi mischaracterizes his deposition testimony.
