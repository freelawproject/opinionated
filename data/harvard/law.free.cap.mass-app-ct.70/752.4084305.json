On the Commonwealth\u2019s interlocutory appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\"><em>Facts. </em>We summarize the findings of the motion judge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 18, 2006, at approximately 2:30 p.m., Boston police Officers Cutroneo, McCarthy, and Joyce, and Boston police Detective Collins, were on patrol in an unmarked cruiser near the Le-nox Street public housing development in Boston\u2019s South End neighborhood. The officers are members of the Boston police department\u2019s youth violence strike force. The area where they were on patrol is a high crime area, in which the officers previously had made numerous arrests for drug and firearms offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">While on patrol, the officers observed two cars, side by side, at the stoplight at Columbus Avenue. When the traffic signal turned green, the cars accelerated to a high rate of speed and emitted loud noises from their mufflers. Officer Cutroneo drove alongside the cars and activated the lights and siren on his cruiser, pulling the cars over to the side of the road. When the cars had stopped, Officer Cutroneo parked his cruiser in front of them. The officers got out of the cmiser and instructed both drivers to turn off their cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The defendant was a front seat passenger in one of the two cars. Officer McCarthy approached the driver\u2019s side of that vehicle, and Officer Cutroneo approached the passenger\u2019s side.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Officer McCarthy reached the driver\u2019s side while Officer Cutro-neo was still making his approach. As Officer Cutroneo reached the passenger\u2019s side, Officer McCarthy told him to \u201cwatch out for the passenger \u2014 watch his hands.\u201d Officer Cutroneo told the defendant \u201cnot to do anything stupid, not to make any sudden movements, and to place his hands in view\u201d of the officer. The defendant, who had his hand in his pocket at the time, removed his hand so that Officer Cutroneo could see it. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>the defendant then immediately placed his hand back in his pocket. The defendant began breathing heavily at that point, causing Officer Cutroneo to believe that the defendant was nervous.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Officer Cutroneo again directed the defendant to remove his hand from his pocket. When the defendant again complied with that request, Officer Cutroneo instructed him to step out of the car. As the defendant did so, Officer Cutroneo saw a partially smoked marijuana cigarette on the floor of the car and asked the defendant if the cigarette was his; the defendant responded that it was. Officer Cutroneo then conducted a patfrisk of the defendant and found a firearm in the right front pocket of the defendant\u2019s pants. The officer then placed the defendant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The sole question before us is the propriety of Officer Cutroneo\u2019s order to the defendant to step out of the vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cUnder art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, \u2018a police officer must, at least, have a reasonable suspicion of danger before compelling a driver to leave his motor vehicle.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 662 (1999). However, \u2018[wjhile a mere hunch is not enough ... it does not take much for a police officer to establish a reasonable basis to justify an exit order or search based on safety concerns, and, if the basis is there, a court will uphold the order.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 664.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>445 Mass. 72, 75-76 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1187 (2006). To determine whether it is reasonable for an officer to believe that danger is present, we consider \u201cwhether a reasonably prudent man in the policeman\u2019s position would be warranted\u201d in such a belief. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vazquez, </em>426 Mass. 99, 103 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 212-213 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>In the present case, several factors contributed to Officer Cu-troneo\u2019s suspicion of danger. The stop occurred in a high crime area, and the defendant exhibited signs of nervousness. Neither factor is alone sufficient, of course, to create reasonable suspicion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>413 Mass. 492, 496-497 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 158-159 (1997). However, such factors may contribute to reasonable suspicion when considered in the totality of the circumstances of the encounter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 44-45 (2002). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. 367, 372 (2007). Of particular significance in the present case was the defendant\u2019s action in putting his hand back into his pocket after Officer Cutroneo had directed him to keep his hands in view.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the circumstances, the safety risk posed by the possibility of a weapon in the defendant\u2019s pocket was evident, and Officer Cutroneo\u2019s concern was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The defendant argues that any legitimate safety concern subsided when he complied with Officer Cutroneo\u2019s second command to remove his hand from his pocket. However, \u201cthe justification for an exit order does not depend on the presence of an \u2018immediate threat\u2019 at the precise moment of the order, but rather on the safety concerns raised by the entire circumstances of the encounter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stampley, </em>437 Mass. 323, 328 (2002). In the present case, as in <em>Stampley, </em>the encounter was ongoing, and the safety concerns prompted by the defendant\u2019s return of his hand to his pocket after being directed not to do so could not be avoided merely by terminating the stop. See <em>Stampley, supra </em>at 329. \u201cThe Constitution does not require officers \u2018to gamble with their personal safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haskell, </em>438 Mass. 790, 794 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>407 Mass. 147, 152 (1990). Officer Cutroneo could well have believed that he could monitor the defendant\u2019s movements more effectively by removing him from the car, rather than having him remain seated in the car. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>limited intrusion posed by Officer Cutroneo\u2019s exit order was proportionate to the safety risk presented in the circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The exit order was justified, and it was error to allow the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The order allowing that motion is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-15\">No issue is raised concerning the propriety of the stop.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\"><em>A </em>single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application for leave to appeal the order. Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(a)(2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). The single justice reported the case to the Appeals Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b777-9\">The findings of the motion judge are particularly clear, thorough, and detailed, and neither party asserts any error in them. Though we reach a different conclusion concerning the application of constitutional principles to the facts as found, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 369 (1996), we acknowledge and appreciate the care evident in the judge\u2019s findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Officer Joyce and Detective Collins approached the other vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">As noted above, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>no issue has been raised concerning the propriety of the stop. In addition, upon Officer Cutroneo\u2019s observation of the marijuana cigarette on the floor of the car and the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment that the cigarette was his, the officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant, and the ensuing patfrisk was justified as a search incident to an arrest. Officer Cutroneo\u2019s observation of the marijuana cigarette, however, occurred during the defendant\u2019s compliance with the exit order and, accordingly, cannot support the subsequent search if the exit order was unjustified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The judge\u2019s findings do not describe the basis for Officer McCarthy\u2019s initial warning to \u201cwatch out\u201d for the passenger\u2019s hands. Without an indication in the findings that the warning had a reasonable basis in fact, we place no reliance on it in assessing the reasonableness of Officer Cutroneo\u2019s fear for his safety. However, Officer McCarthy\u2019s warning at a minimum explains how Officer Cutroneo\u2019s attention was drawn to the defendant\u2019s hands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The defendant attempts to minimize the significance of his violation of Officer Cutroneo\u2019s direction to keep his hands in view, suggesting that Officer Cutroneo\u2019s initial directive (not to move and to keep his hands in view) was internally inconsistent and could have confused the defendant. The argument is unpersuasive. If the defendant believed he was to remain motionless, he would not have removed his hand from his pocket initially, and we see nothing particularly confusing or ambiguous about the officer\u2019s instruction to the defendant to keep his hands in view. In any event, the question is not whether the defendant could reasonably have believed he was permitted to return his hands to his pockets, but whether Officer Cutroneo could reasonably have believed the defendant\u2019s actions in doing so posed a risk of danger.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
