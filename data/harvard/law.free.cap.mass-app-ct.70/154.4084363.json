L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17 (the zoning appeal). A Superior Court judge concluded that although the Burkes had standing to challenge the board\u2019s decision, their substantive claim of insufficient frontage failed. De-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Piero then brought the present unverified complaint, also in Superior Court, against the Burkes for abuse of process. The Burkes responded with a special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, the anti-SLAPP statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Another Superior Court judge denied the \u00a7 59H motion on the basis of the first judge\u2019s decision in the Burkes\u2019 zoning appeal. On the Burkes\u2019 appeal from the denial of the special motion, see <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 521-522 (2002), we conclude that DePiero failed to meet the burden of proof required of her by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, and reverse the order denying the special motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">1. <em>The procedural </em>history.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> DePiero is the owner of a lot situated on Spofford Street, which she sought to subdivide to create two single-family residential lots. Her subdivision plan proposed that the two lots would have access to Spofford Street by way of a road to be constructed and named Clark Road. Lot 1 would remain known as 3 Spofford Street and lot 2 would be known as 1 Clark Road. The Burkes\u2019 property abuts lot 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Hearings before the city\u2019s planning board on DePiero\u2019s proposal began on August 15, 2001. On August 22, 2001, the Burkes took an appeal to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The basis of that appeal was that the city\u2019s conservation commission had approved DePiero\u2019s plan without notice to the Burkes and that they believed DePiero\u2019s project did not \u201cprotect the interests of the Wetland Protection Act.\u201d The planning board, on October 17, 2001, after consideration of a traffic impact and access study, as well as the recommendations of the police and fire departments, approved the subdivision with numerous specified conditions, waivers, and requirements, some of which pertained to the proposed construction of Clark Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, the Burkes filed a timely notice of appeal from the planning board\u2019s decision with the Land Court on November 13, 2001, alleging that the planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>board\u2019s approval of DePiero\u2019s subdivision plan was based upon the proposed construction of 1 Clark Road and that the proposed road would fail to provide the lot with the frontage required under the city\u2019s zoning ordinance. About three and one-half months later, DePiero and the Burkes entered into a stipulation of dismissal, without prejudice, of all claims and counterclaims pending in the Land Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> DePiero then requested and received a foundation permit from the city\u2019s building inspector so that she could build a single-family dwelling on lot 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The Burkes responded to the issuance of the permit by requesting the building inspector to enforce the frontage requirement of the zoning ordinance. Their request was denied on the stated basis that the planning board had approved the construction pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U. The Burkes then turned to the board, asking that it overturn the building inspector\u2019s issuance of a foundation permit to DePiero. When the board denied the Burkes\u2019 request, they filed their zoning appeal with the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. That appeal was based upon the Burkes\u2019 assertion of insufficient frontage, that is, because of areas of trees and grass between the property line of lot 2 and the proposed Clark Road, lot 2 had only twenty feet of frontage, whereas the zoning ordinance required 125 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The ordinance provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">\u201cFrontage is the length of the lot along the property line on a public or planning board approved subdivision street on which the lot has legal <em>and physical access </em>for pedestrians and four wheeled vehicles ...\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Based on this provision, and citing <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Milton, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 572 (1987), the judge in the zoning appeal concluded that <em>twenty feet of access </em>along Clark Road was sufficient to allow for \u201cphysical access for pedestrians and four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>wheeled vehicles\u201d and that the areas of grass and trees along the remainder of the property line and Clark Road did \u201cnot render the frontage inadequate,\u201d and she granted DePiero\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">There then followed DePiero\u2019s unverified abuse of process complaint against the Burkes, which forms the basis of the instant appeal. The gist of the abuse of process complaint is set out in paragraphs 29 and 31, which read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">\u201c29. At the time the [Burkes] brought [their G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, appeal], they knew that the Planning Board, the Land Court case, the Building Inspector and the Zoning Board of Appeals had all addressed the same safety and frontage issues raised by [them] regarding the subdivision at 3 Spofford Street and that all these involved parties had subsequently determined that [the Burkes\u2019] concerns were adequately and legally satisfied with the approved subdivision plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">\u201c31. Upon information and belief, [DePiero] contends that the [\u00a7 17 appeal] was brought falsely and maliciously, with the sole intent and purpose of hindering, delaying and potentially preventing construction at the approved subdivision lot now known as 1 Clark Road and the subsequent sale of 3 Spofford Street to disinterested parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">DePiero also alleges in the abuse of process complaint that the Burkes\u2019 actions cost her lost income and damages in the amount of $439,004.37. In an affidavit filed in support of her ex parte motion seeking an attachment on the Burkes\u2019 real property located at 1 Spofford Street, DePiero stated that it was her \u201copinion and belief\u201d that the Burkes\u2019 zoning appeal was brought \u201cto accomplish an ulterior purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">In response to DePiero\u2019s abuse of process complaint, the Burkes filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, in which they essentially track the language of the statute, that is, they state that all their complained-of actions were \u201cpetitioning activities\u201d which \u201cwere not devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law\u201d and which \u201ccaused no actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>harm\u201d to DePiero. The sole reason given by the judge in denying the Burkes\u2019 special motion to dismiss is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">\u201cIndubitably this action [for abuse of process] is based upon the [Burkes\u2019] petition[ing] activity, to wit, the initiation of the prior Superior Court action [brought pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17]. Although the fact that [the Burkes] failed to obtain a favorable outcome in that action does not, in [and] of itself, mean that the action was devoid of legal and factual support, the decision of [the judge in the zoning appeal] makes clear that indeed, it was lacking such support, moreover [DePiero was] harmed by the filing of the action, at least to the extent of the legal expenses which they incurred in defending.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The procedure to be followed in ruling on a G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, motion is set out in <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prod. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 167-168 (1998). See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 850, 852-853 (2005). That procedure requires that we first decide whether the Burkes made a \u201cthreshold showing through pleadings and affidavits that [their] claim [was] \u2018based on\u2019 [their] protected petitioning activities alone and has no other \u2018substantial basis\u2019 \u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Our reading of DePiero\u2019s abuse of process complaint, as well as all the exhibits attached thereto, leads us to conclude, as did the judge below, that the Burkes made the showing necessary to satisfy their burden under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. DePiero has made no argument to the contrary, that is to say, she does not challenge the sufficiency of the Burkes\u2019 showing that their actions were based on protected petitioning activities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The next issue to resolve is whether DePiero preserved her abuse of process claim by showing \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence, based on the pleadings and affidavits, that the petitioning activity is \u2018devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law,\u2019 and that \u2018the [Burkes\u2019] acts caused actual injury\u2019 to [her]\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. at 853, quoting from <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. at 520. While DePiero describes in her brief the numerous actions taken by the Burkes in objecting to her proposed construction that culminated in the filing of their complaint in the zoning appeal, she also states, with emphasis, that she does not argue that <em>\u201c\u2019all of </em>the Burkes\u2019 activities outlined in her Complaint were an abuse of process, but only the instituting of\u201d the zoning appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Based upon that acknowledgment and the fact that the Superior Court judge apparently relied solely on the first judge\u2019s memorandum of decision in the zoning appeal as sufficient basis for denying the Burkes\u2019 special motion, we look to all that was before the judge in the zoning appeal as well as her memorandum of decision in that case, to determine whether DePiero sustained the burden of proof required of her by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. We do so while keeping in mind that our determination does not turn on whether the zoning appeal judge was correct in granting summary judgment to DePiero. See <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 595, 599-601 (2000); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. at 856-858. Rather, we look to these materials for the sole purpose of determining whether it was \u201cclear\u201d from the judge\u2019s memorandum in the zoning appeal that DePiero had sustained her burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the Burkes\u2019 appeal in that case was lacking in legal and factual support.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">At the hearing before the board on their appeal from the building inspector\u2019s grant of a building permit to DePiero, the Burkes\u2019 attorney stated that the planning board did not have the right to \u201cvary the zoning ordinance and that is what they did.\u201d That was also the argument the Burkes made to the judge in their zoning appeal, i.e., the zoning ordinance required linear frontage of 125 feet on Clark Road so as to provide \u201clegal <em>and </em>physical access for pedestrians and four wheeled vehicles\u201d (emphasis added), but because of grass and trees on the property line between lot 2 and Clark Road, there was, in fact, only twenty feet of physical access from Clark Road to lot 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The judge in the zoning appeal determined that while planning boards were authorized by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81R, to waive \u201cstrict compliance with [their subdivision] regulations and rules,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>that right was valid only for purposes of subdivision control and that any deviation from the frontage requirement of the zoning ordinance required the approval of the board. Because the planning board\u2019s approval of the construction on lot 2 of Clark Road was controlling for subdivision purposes only, the judge next took up the question whether twenty feet of actual physical access was sufficient to satisfy the zoning ordinance without the need for a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">It does not appear from the materials before us that the Burkes, in their zoning appeal, disputed that Clark Road was a planning board approved street. Rather, and as previously stated, their position before the board and the zoning appeal judge was that the access from Clark Road to lot 2 was insufficient to satisfy the zoning ordinance, a question that the board did not consider in denying the Burkes\u2019 appeal from the building inspector\u2019s grant of a building permit to DePiero.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Before us, the Burkes argue that in concluding that twenty feet of access <em>to </em>lot 2 from the planning board\u2019s approved Clark Road was sufficient to satisfy the zoning ordinance\u2019s requirement for access by \u201cpedestrians and four wheeled vehicles,\u201d the judge in the zoning appeal never addressed this issue. Instead, they contend, she relied on cases they deem inapposite because of plausible distinctions. See, e.g., <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Lee, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 343, 351-352 &amp; n.8 (1986); <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Milton, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 574; <em>Karet </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Worcester, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 439, 441 (1989). Moreover, there is nothing in DePiero\u2019s unverified complaint or affidavit in support of her ex parte request for a writ of attachment that is probative of her allegations that the Burkes acted \u201cmaliciously, with the sole intent and purpose of hindering, delaying and potentially preventing construction,\u201d rather than in an unsuccessful assertion of their rights of petition. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. at 858. See also <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 599-601.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">It follows from all that we have said that DePiero failed to meet her burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the Burkes\u2019 unsuccessful zoning appeal was devoid of legal and factual support. Because DePiero did not satisfy her burden of proof on that issue, we need not consider whether she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>injured by the Burkes\u2019 filing of that zoning appeal. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order denying the special motion to dismiss is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a new order consistent with this opinion and including an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. Within fifteen days of the date of the issuance of the rescript in this matter, the Burkes may also apply to the panel deciding this appeal for an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u201cSLAPP is an acronym for \u2018strategic litigation against public participation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>Schlichtmann, </em>448 Mass. 242, 242 n.2 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\">We take the facts of the procedural history of the dispute between the parties from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision in the Burkes\u2019 unsuccessful zoning appeal, DePiero\u2019s abuse of process complaint and its attached exhibits, and her accompanying motion for a writ of attachment with its attached exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">DePeiro alleges in her abuse of process complaint that the Burkes\u2019 motivation in entering into the stipulation of dismissal was based upon the requirement that they post a surety bond.
