(employer), appeals from a judgment of the District Court affirming a decision of the board of review (board) of the Division of Unemployment Assistance (division), awarding to Robert Hickey, Jr. (employee), unemployment benefits. The employer argues a single proposition, specifically, that the board lacked jurisdiction with respect to the case because the employee\u2019s appeal to the board from an earlier adverse determination by a review examiner had been filed late. Relying on <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>447 Mass. 814, 815 (2006) <em>(Falmouth), </em>the division asserts that the employee\u2019s appeal was not late because the envelope transmit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ting the appeal to the board was postmarked within the allowable appeal period and thus, despite its receipt by the board after that period, was timely pursuant to the so-called \u201cpostmark rule\u201d applicable to adjudicatory proceedings of administrative agencies of the Commonwealth. See 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(4)(b) (1998). We conclude that the court in the <em>Fal-mouth </em>case interpreted a statute containing language that differs considerably from that of the statute that governs the present case; that the employee\u2019s appeal to the board was not governed by the postmark rule; and that his appeal was therefore late. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court, and a new judgment shall enter dismissing the employee\u2019s appeal to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The case turns on a ruling of law, and we recite the underlying facts only for context. At the relevant time, the employer owned a restaurant called the Center Stage Caf\u00e9 in Dennis. The employee, a chef at the restaurant, was discharged because of an alleged theft. He applied for unemployment benefits and received initial approval from the division. The employer requested and received a hearing before a division review examiner. On March 16, 2005, the review examiner denied the employee\u2019s application for benefits on the ground that his discharge was for \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(2), as amended through St. 1992, c. 26, \u00a7 19. A memorandum that accompanied the decision stated that the last date on which to file an appeal was April 15, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">On April 15, 2005, the employee, through counsel, mailed an appeal to the board. The mailing was received by the board on April 19, 2005 (thirty-four days after the date of the review examiner\u2019s decision). After two remands and additional findings by the review examiner, the board concluded that the employer had not established the existence of deliberate misconduct on the part of the employee, and determined consequently that the employee was entitled to benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The employer filed a timely complaint for judicial review in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the District Court. See G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42; G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). It asserted for the first time that the employee\u2019s appeal to the board was not timely. The judge rejected the defense, concluding that the effective date of the employee\u2019s appeal was April 15, 2005, the date of the postmark on the notice of appeal. He affirmed the decision of the board in the employee\u2019s favor, and the employer\u2019s appeal therefrom brings the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The timeliness of the employee\u2019s attempt to obtain relief from the adverse decision of the review examiner is governed, at least initially, by G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 40, as amended through St. 1990, c. 154, \u00a7 29, which provides simply that \u201c[a] claimant or interested party may, within thirty days after mailing to him of notice of the decision, file an application for a review of such decision by the board of review.\u201d In determining when the filing took place for purposes of the statute, the District Court judge stated that \u201cthe effective date of the appeal was April 15, 2005, the date of the postmark.\u201d While not referring expressly to it, he appears to have been applying the so-called \u201cpostmark rule\u201d set forth in the standard adjudicatory rules of practice and procedure. Those rules apply to the board proceeding in question in this case. The rule at issue provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ll papers filed by U.S. mail shall be deemed filed on the date contained in the U.S. postal cancellation stamp or U.S. postmark.\u201d 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(4)(b). If the rule applies, the employee\u2019s appeal to the board was timely because the envelope in which it was mailed was postmarked with the date of April 15, 2005, thirty days after the mailing of notice of the review examiner\u2019s adverse decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The question is whether an agency may, by adoption of a procedural rule, define when a filing occurs for purposes of a statutory limitations period, and do so in such a way that the filing is deemed to have taken place even though the agency has not physically received the document. The division relies on <em>Falmouth, supra, </em>for the principle that courts will defer to the procedural rule, particularly where it reflects long-standing ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>ministrative practice that is based on a plausible interpretation of the statutory language. <em>Id. </em>at 820-821. That may be so with respect to the civil service statute, which invites such an administrative construction. In our view, it is not so in the case of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 40, and application of the postmark rule would confer on the board jurisdiction that the Legislature did not intend that it have.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We examine the <em>Falmouth </em>decision. There, a police officer aggrieved by a suspension of which he was notified on December 7, 1998, mailed an appeal to the Civil Service Commission (commission) on December 17, 1998. <em>Falmouth, supra </em>at 816. The appeal was received by the commission on December 23, 1998. <em>Ibid. </em>General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 43, as amended through St. 1981, c. 767, \u00a7 20, provides in relevant part that, \u201c[i]f a person aggrieved by a decision of an appointing authority made pursuant to [\u00a7 41] shall, within ten days after receiving notice of such decision, appeal in writing to the commission, he shall be given a hearing.\u201d General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 <em>2(g), </em>as amended through St. 1981, c. 767, \u00a7 11, authorizes the commission \u201c[t]o adopt such rules of procedure as necessary for the conduct of its proceedings.\u201d See <em>Falmouth, supra </em>at 818. Pursuant thereto, the commission adopted its rule 2.4(a)(3), which states: \u201cPapers placed in the U.S. mail shall be deemed filed on the date so postmarked.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 817. Application of this rule rendered the officer\u2019s appeal timely because the postmark showed that it had been mailed on the tenth day following receipt of the appointing authority\u2019s decision. The Supreme Judicial Court concluded that the rule was a permissible interpretation of a statute that the agency was charged with enforcing. <em>Id. </em>at 821-822.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">It is important, however, to focus on the reasoning by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the court arrived at its decision. Specifically, the court fixed on the language of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43, that authorizes an aggrieved party to \u201cappeal in writing\u201d within ten days of receipt of a decision, and determined that the phrase was ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>at 818. The court rejected the town\u2019s contention that the phrase required receipt of the appeal by the commission within ten days, stating that \u201c[sjection 43 does not specify any particular act required to perfect an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819. It followed, therefore, that the commission could adopt the \u201cplausible view that an appeal is deemed to have been perfected on the day of the postmark.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819-820.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">At the same time, the court took pains to observe, with reference to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43, that \u201c[t]he statute\u2019s plain language does not state that the appeal must be \u2018filed\u2019 in a particular place within ten days.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819. The absence of a reference in the statute to a \u201cfiling\u201d was plainly critical to the outcome. \u201cThis court has recognized the particular significance of the word \u2018filed\u2019 in the context of an appeal. Generally, it connotes the \u2018receipt\u2019 of the appeal, absent an express intent to the contrary. . . . The absence of the word \u2018filed\u2019 in the relevant sentence of \u00a7 43 is persuasive evidence of a legislative intent that an appeal need not be actually received (filed) within the ten-day appeal period.\u201d (Citation omitted). <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Applying this reasoning, it is our view that the language of the unemployment compensation statute requires a different result. In contrast to the reference in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43, to an \u201cappeal in writing,\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 40, provides that a party may \u201cfile an application for a review ... by the board of review.\u201d As noted in the <em>Falmouth </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>the authorization to \u201cfile\u201d means that the application must physically be at the agency within the time allotted. It has been held, with respect to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42, under which a petition for judicial review of an administrative decision in any unemployment compensation case may be \u201cfiled\u201d within thirty days, that the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>requires actual receipt by the court within the prescribed period. See <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>394 Mass. 417, 420 (1985) (\u201c[I]t is difficult to assimilate the act of mailing to the act of filing. . . . [F]iling and mailing are two distinct concepts\u201d). While the court in <em>Garrett </em>construed a section of G. L. c. 151A that governs appeals to the District Court, whereas the present case is concerned with a section applicable to appeals to the board, we see no logical reason why the meaning of \u201cfiled\u201d or \u201cfiling\u201d would differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In further support, in <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Division of Water Pollution Control, </em>412 Mass. 464, 465-466 (1992), the court considered G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(1), which does not even use the term \u201cfile,\u201d but instead states that a proceeding for judicial review of an agency decision \u201cshall ... be commenced in the court within thirty days after receipt of notice of the final decision of the agency.\u201d The court rejected the proposition that commencement in court should be construed in accordance with the provisions of Mass.R.Civ.P. 3, as amended, 385 Mass. 1215 (1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Equating \u201ccommencement in court\u201d with filing, notwithstanding the thrust of rule 3 that commencement may be brought about by a mailing, the court stated: \u201cWe are concerned with a statutory appeal period. A rule of court cannot override a contrary statutory provision concerning the manner and time for the effective taking of an appeal from an administrative agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The statute considered in <em>Falmouth, </em>see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43, authorizes an \u201cappeal in writing,\u201d thereby leaving the agency discretion to decide how the appeal shall be deemed to commence. In contrast, the relevant statute here, G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 40, authorizes a claimant or interested party to \u201cfile\u201d an application for review. The authorities, including those cited in the <em>Falmouth </em>decision, accept that \u201cfile\u201d generally requires that the document in question be physically received by the court or agency to which it is directed. See <em>Falmouth, </em>447 Mass. at 819. The statutory requirement cannot be varied by a judicial or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>administrative rule of procedure. To the extent that an agency is empowered to adopt procedural rules, that authorization cannot be construed as a subtle indicator that the Legislature has delegated to the agency the right to amend the statute. Should the Legislature wish to alter the filing requirement, it is of course both free to do so and knowledgeable as to how to effectuate the change.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We do not suggest that, across the broad spectrum of appeals to various courts and administrative agencies, the principle that filing means physical deposit with the tribunal is uniformly applied. An example is the treatment given prisoners whose incarceration and security requirements often conflict with their ability to make timely submissions of legal documents. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartsgrove, </em>407 Mass. 441, 444-445 (1990). In administrative practice, the standard adjudicatory rules include the postmarkrule, see 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(4)(b) (1998). Some agencies that have promulgated their own procedural rules use the postmark rule, at least in certain circumstances. See, for example, 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02 (1997) (filings in workers\u2019 compensation cases under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 10A and 11C, governed by postmark rule). We make no comment on the validity of such provisions; the parties have not brought to our attention express challenges to such rules that have been adjudicated in circumstances similar to the present case (i.e., where statutes expressly require a \u201cfiling\u201d). Here, we hold only that, given the language of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 40, the postmark rule codified at 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(4)(b) cannot be applied to extend the period in which the appeal to the board should have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">3. <em>Disposition. </em>The judgment is reversed. The case is remanded to the District Court for the entry of judgment dismissing the employee\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The reasons for discharge advanced by the employer were that the employee had attempted to steal plastic storage bags from the restaurant and had served the remains of a leg of lamb as an employee meal for himself and a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>employee. The board adopted a finding of the review examiner that credited the employee\u2019s testimony that he intended to pay for the bags. The board relied also on a finding that the employee was authorized to decide which food should not be served to patrons but could be served to employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">We acknowledge that the employer did not assert that the employee\u2019s appeal to the board was not timely until the case reached the District Court. However, we consider that the timeliness of a notice of appeal implicates subject matter jurisdiction, which may be challenged at any stage of the proceeding. See <em>General Acc. Ins. Co. of Am. </em>v. <em>Bank of New England-West, N.A., </em>403 Mass. 473, 474 (1988); <em>Bonfatti </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Holliston, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 46, 49 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The commission subsequently replaced its own rules of practice and procedure with the standard adjudicatory rules. Section 1.01(4)(b) of 801 Code Mass.

App. Ct. 606, 610 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Rule 3 states, in relevant part, that \u201c[a] civil action is commenced by (1) mailing to the clerk of the proper court by certified or registered mail a complaint and an entry fee prescribed by law, or (2) filing such complaint and an entry fee with such clerk.\u201d At least for the purposes of this rule, mailing and filing are obviously not the same thing.
