The father asserts that, given the judge\u2019s finding that he is not an unfit parent, he is entitled to outright custody of the child without the limitations inherent in the vesting of guardianship authority in others. In support of the judgment, the uncle and aunt argue that they had parented the child for seven years by the time of trial; she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>is happy, well adjusted and developing normally; she visits regularly with her father; and a precipitous transfer of custody would be harmful to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We credit the judge with a sensitive attempt to sort out the complexities of the case and arrive at a compromise that was in the child\u2019s best interests. His solution, however, cannot stand as a matter of law because the father is correct that, absent a finding of unfitness on his part, the judge is without authority to require that he share parenting decisions with others. We remand for further findings in accordance with the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The facts and prior proceedings are not disputed. The child was born to the mother and father in December, 1997. By that time, the relationship between the mother and father had ended. The mother died in April, 1998. The mother\u2019s brother and his wife immediately assumed care of the child and, on May 6, 1998, were appointed the child\u2019s temporary guardians. Since that time, the uncle and aunt have provided the child\u2019s primary physical care, and the child has developed a close relationship with the uncle and aunt and their two biological children. The uncle and aunt have performed all of the normal parental functions, including providing health insurance for the child; seeing to her religious education; participating in her academic and extracurricular activities; and taking her on family vacations. The child refers to the uncle and aunt as \u201cDad\u201d and \u201cMom,\u201d although she knows that they are not her biological parents. She has thrived in the course of their parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The father had, at the time of trial, played a far less significant role in the child\u2019s life. The child did visit with the father on a regular basis and refers to him as \u201cDaddy Sam.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Despite a recommendation by a guardian ad litem that he attend parenting classes, the father did not do so. On March 9, 1999, a probate judge ordered that the father pay $50 weekly to the uncle and aunt in child support. The father\u2019s first five support checks were returned for insufficient funds, and it was not until he was found in contempt that he began to comply with the support orders. The judge found that the father \u201chas not made the effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>necessary to be the Child\u2019s primary parent\u201d and that he has \u201cfailed to take an active enough role in the Child\u2019s life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">While the father was apparently perfectly willing to have the child raised in large part by the uncle and aunt, he was not content that they be vested with legal authority in the matter, and on July 24,1998, he filed a motion to terminate the guardianship. On March 9, 1999, a guardian ad litem was appointed. This ushered in an inexplicable period of an additional six and one-half years during which the case was \u201cinvestigated.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case was finally tried on September 19 and 20, 2005. The judge found \u201cthat totally separating the Child from [the uncle\u2019s and aunt\u2019s] home would be damaging,\u201d and that a \u201ccontinued role of all the adults in her life would be in the child\u2019s best interest until she was older and better able to cope with more significant change.\u201d At the same time, he concluded that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to establish that the [father] was completely unfit as a parent in order to prevent him from having continuing contact with the Child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In accordance with these findings and rulings, the judge created a coguardianship and relieved the father of the obligation to make child support payments. He provided in the judgment for a specific schedule with respect to the sharing of the child by the coguardians and ordered the father to perform all of the recommendations of the guardian ad litem. He concluded the judgment by stating: \u201cIn balancing the best interests] of this child and the fitness of the Father, the Court finds that complete termination of this guardianship would have severe and drastic effects on this child who all agree is presently very well adjusted and happy sharing both homes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">2. <em>Fitness of the father. </em>The judge attempted to maintain the conditions in which the child had thrived from the time of her infancy, while still permitting the child\u2019s surviving biological parent both to have a present role in her life and to expand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>scope of that role if appropriate. While that may well have been a desirable objective, his findings did not permit its adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Custody of a child belongs to a parent unless that parent is unfit. See <em>Bezio </em>v. <em>Patenaude, </em>381 Mass. 563, 576 (1980); <em>Care &amp; Protection of Zelda, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 869, 871 (1989); <em>Guardianship of Yushiko, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 157,159-160 (2000); <em>Care &amp; Protection of Lillith, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 143 (2004). Here, the relationship of the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings regarding the father\u2019s fitness and his ultimate finding on that subject are ambiguous. The subsidiary findings are generally negative with respect to the father\u2019s parenting. Thus, following the child\u2019s birth, the child and her mother lived with the child\u2019s maternal grandmother until the death of the mother, after which the child was cared for by her maternal uncle and his wife. A contempt finding was required before the father paid child support. Neither the father nor members of the father\u2019s family had called the child at her residence. The father had not involved himself in the child\u2019s school life or extracurricular activities. He had never taken the child on a vacation. He had failed to attend recommended parenting classes. Despite the uncle\u2019s and aunt\u2019s practice of never denying him visits with the child, the father had, in the judge\u2019s words, \u201cfailed to take an active enough role in the Child\u2019s life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The negative subsidiary findings are not offset by any findings that are positive in character. They leave an over-all impression that the father, while not abusive or neglectful when the child was with him, was indifferent regarding his role as a parent and, as noted <em>supra, </em>had been perfectly willing to have the uncle and aunt shoulder the greater share of the child\u2019s upbringing. That there was some uncertainty in the judge\u2019s mind is reflected in his apparently carefully worded ultimate conclusion that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to establish that the [father] was completely unfit as a parent in order to prevent him from having contact with the Child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">As suggested above, the judge attempted to steer to a middle ground between fitness and lack of fitness on the part of the father, to the end that he could maintain some degree of control of the situation without jeopardizing the father\u2019s ability to develop a relationship with the child. The problem with that approach is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>that our law only recognizes two possibilities: in given circumstances, a parent is either fit or unfit. While the judgment may be on occasion difficult to make, it must be made. We assume without more that a parent is fit to raise his or her child, and if, as the judge decided here, the evidence is insufficient to establish the contrary, a parent\u2019s right to the custody of his child must be acknowledged. See <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>389 Mass. 755, 765 (1983); <em>Guardianship of Yushiko, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 159-160.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We believe that, in the circumstances, a remand is appropriate so that the judge, with or without additional evidence as he deems desirable,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> may reconsider his subsidiary findings; make additional subsidiary findings if necessary; and come to a conclusion whether the father is fit or unfit. We remand because of the apparent ambivalence of the judge on the subject, and for the reason we express <em>infra. </em>We do not seek to dictate an outcome. The judge who hears the evidence, observes the parties, and is most familiar with the circumstances remains in the best position to make the judgment. See <em>Petition of the New Bedford Child &amp; Family Serv. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>385 Mass. 482, 488-489 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The decision should be informed by a recognition that the fitness of a parent cannot be considered in the abstract. Fitness is not merely the absence of abuse or neglect; nor is it a set of abilities or characteristics that are the same in all circumstances. On the one hand, we defend the right of a parent to the custody of his or her child, yet we recognize that the right will not be enforced if it results in harm to the child, in other words, if the parent is \u201cunfit.\u201d See <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>367 Mass. 631, 642 (1975). The \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d in such cases is finding parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Adoption of Nancy, </em>443 Mass. 512, 515 (2005). See <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>389 Mass. at 766; <em>Care &amp; Protection of Erin, </em>443 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Mass. 567, 570 (2005). At the same time, the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d is the touchstone of the analysis. See, e.g., <em>Adoption of Nancy, supra. </em>An earlier decision went so far as to state that, \u201c[i]n determining whether [a parent is] unfit, the most important consideration is whether the welfare of the child would be served by custody in [the parent] or in a guardian.\u201d <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>324 Mass. 261, 262 (1949). But subsequent cases have established that this is not literally correct, for we do not transfer a child from his or her parent to other custodians merely because the latter may provide a more advantageous environment for the child\u2019s upbringing. See <em>Custody of a Minor, supra </em>at 765 (\u201cCustody is not to be transferred from the [biological] parent simply because another prospective custodian is thought to be better qualified. A comparison of the advantage the prospective custodian may offer to the child with those that may be offered by the [biological] parent[] is inappropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The question, then, is how to balance a parent\u2019s capacity to care adequately for a child (i.e., his or her \u201cfitness\u201d) with that child\u2019s \u201cbest interests,\u201d given the child\u2019s current circumstances. It has been stated that \u201cthe tests \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 in the adoption statute and \u2018unfitness of the parent\u2019 in the guardianship statute reflect different degrees of emphasis on the same factors, that the tests are not separate and distinct but cognate and connected.\u201d <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>367 Mass. at 641. \u201cNeither the \u2018parental fitness\u2019 test nor the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 test is properly applied to the exclusion of the other.\u201d <em>Bezio </em>v. <em>Patenaude, </em>381 Mass. at 576-577. \u201cThe term [\u2018unfitness\u2019] is a standard by which we measure the circumstances within the family as they affect the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>Petition of the Dept. of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 589 (1981).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Because we do not deal with a subject that is susceptible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201cmathematical precision,\u201d criteria of necessity must be stated in general terms, and the principles may be difficult to apply in individual cases. <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to </em>Adoption, 367 Mass. at 646. At a minimum, the fitness of a particular parent cannot be judged without a consideration of that parent\u2019s willingness and ability to care for the child, as well as the effect on a child of being placed in the custody of that parent. One who is fit to parent in some circumstances may not be fit if the circumstances are otherwise. A parent may be fit to raise one child but not another. See <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>278 Mass. 547, 553 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Here, a key factual question for resolution is whether the father is fit to parent this particular child in light of the lengthy period during which she has been raised by, and has bonded with, the uncle and aunt, and in which the father has had a significantly lesser role in the child\u2019s life. The judge did not address this question directly, preferring the solution of a co-guardianship. As we have stated, that solution is not available if the father is found to be fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\u201cAlthough the bonding of a child with foster or adoptive parents is not a dispositive consideration, it is a factor that has weight in the ultimate balance.\u201d <em>Adoption of Nicole, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 262-263 (1996). While such bonding cannot be decisive per se, the Legislature has directed, at least where there is the potential of dispensation of the requirement of parental consent to a child\u2019s adoption, that a judge consider whether the child has formed \u201ca strong, positive bond\u201d with a caretaker, and whether \u201cthe forced removal of the child from the caretaker would likely cause serious psychological harm to the child and the parent lacks the capacity to meet the special needs of the child upon removal.\u201d G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3(c)(vii). See <em>Adoption of Katharine, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 30-31 (1997); <em>Adoption of Daniel, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 195, 202-203 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Thus, there must be attention to the effect on this child of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>whatever separation from the uncle and aunt would come about if there is a transfer to the father, including whether the father is prepared and able to cope adequately with the child\u2019s trauma that would inevitably accompany her separation from the uncle and aunt. See <em>Adoption of Katharine, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 30-31. These considerations may have a direct effect on whether the father is fit to parent <em>this </em>child in <em>these </em>circumstances at <em>this </em>time. Though the importance and parameters of an attachment to a foster parent or guardian have varied, the validity of considering the effect of a transfer of custody on the child as an element of the fitness of the transferee has been upheld consistently. <em>Id. </em>at 29-31. See <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>324 Mass. at 263-264; <em>Guardianship of Clyde, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 767, 772-775 (1998). \u201cA parent cannot be deprived [of custody] unless some affirmative reason is shown for doing so such as a finding . . . of a separation so long as to permit very strong bonds to develop between the child and the prospective adoptive parents.\u201d <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>367 Mass. at 642. \u201c[I]f returning custody to the [biological] parent[] would be seriously detrimental to the welfare of the child, then the parent[] could be considered to be unfit.\u201d <em>Bezio </em>v. <em>Patenaude, </em>381 Mass. at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The judge plainly recognized the issue, and touched on it in his findings. Thus, the judge noted that the child \u201chas experienced some reservation about visiting the [father and] becomes sad when visits with the [father] near.\u201d She also \u201cacts out after returning from visits with the [father].\u201d The judge concluded that \u201csufficient evidence showed that totally separating the child from [the uncle and aunt\u2019s] home would be damaging to the Child.\u201d On remand, after whatever augmentation of the record is appropriate, the judge must decide, along with ordinary questions of fitness, specifically whether the effect on the child of a transfer of custody to the father would be sufficiently negative that the father would be unable to address the child\u2019s special needs and must therefore be deemed unfit in the circumstances. See <em>Duclos </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>344 Mass. 544, 546 (1962) (order removing guardian and returning child to father perhaps distressing, but important that child be reared with her own next of kin and in companionship with her own sisters). Should such further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>consideration result in a finding that the father is unfit in the circumstances, it follows that there would not be a transfer of custody and that a guardianship (presumably with the uncle and aunt) might lawfully be maintained.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Should it be determined that the father is fit, he would be entitled to custody, though the uncle and aunt might have continuing rights as \u201cde facto parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">3. <em>The uncle and aunt as de facto parents. </em>It does not appear that the judge gave much, if any, attention to the possible status of the uncle and aunt as \u201cde facto parents.\u201d See <em>Youmans </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>429 Mass. 774, 782-784 (1999). The judge and the parties focused only on whether the existing guardianship was to be continued. The uncle and aunt refer to the issue in this court. It is naturally of no moment in the event that the judge finds the father unfit and rules that the uncle and aunt should continue as the child\u2019s guardians. Should the judge find otherwise, i.e., that the father is fit, he may consider whether the uncle and aunt have performed as de facto parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\u201cA de facto parent is one who has no biological relation to the child, but has participated in the child\u2019s life as a member of the child\u2019s family. The de facto parent resides with the child and, with the consent and encouragement of the legal parent, performs a share of caretaking functions at least as great as the legal parent.\u201d <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., </em>429 Mass. 824, 829, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1005 (1999). \u201cCaretaking functions\u201d are considered to be that part of the parenting process \u201cthat involve[s] interaction with the child or that direct[s], arrange[s], and supervise^] the interaction and care provided by others,\u201d and that \u201cinvolve[s] the direct delivery of day-to-day care and supervision of the child.\u201d <em>A.H. </em>v. <em>M.P., </em>447 Mass. 828, 839 (2006), quoting from American Law Institute, Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution \u00a7 2.03(5) &amp; comment g (2002). The caretaker has no rights independent of those of the child; it is the interests of the child, not those of the caretaker, that determine whether a de facto parent relationship should be recognized. \u201c[Pjotential harm to the child is, of course, the criterion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tips the balance in favor of continuing contact with a de facto parent against the wishes of the fit legal parent.\u201d <em>A.H. </em>v. <em>M.P., </em>447 Mass. at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Here, the judge could find that the uncle and aunt provided the lion\u2019s share of caretaking services, and did so with the consent of the father. That the father objects to a continued guardianship and seeks custody on the ground that he is a fit parent does not alter the fact that he agreed that the child should be raised by the uncle and aunt. If the judge determines that the father is fit and therefore entitled to custody, he should consider whether the uncle and aunt qualify as de facto parents and whether the child\u2019s welfare would be enhanced by continued access to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">4. <em>Disposition. </em>The judgment is vacated. The case is remanded to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">We do not know what contributed to the delay.
