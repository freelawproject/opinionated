He informed the defendant that he could file a motion for a new trial and suggested that both parties brief the issue. Following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>briefing and argument, the judge, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ptomey, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 494 (1988), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>417 Mass. 498, 507 (1994), determined that absent a finding on the record that special or exceptional circumstances existed, he could not require the parties to exercise their respective peremptory challenges after each prospective juror was individually questioned and before the jury box was filled with the requisite number of indifferent jurors. Accordingly, without sentencing the defendant, he allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The Commonwealth appeals from that determination and claims that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 308 n.19 (1992), is dispositive and requires reversal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree and reverse the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\"><em>Procedure followed. </em>Prior to empanelment of the jury, the defendant filed a motion seeking individual voir dire of the venire. The motion was allowed, and the judge, after posing general voir dire questions to the jury pool, asked each prospective juror individually at sidebar the questions requested by the defendant and those requested by the Commonwealth. Subsequent to finding a juror indifferent, the judge required the Commonwealth, and then the defendant, to decide whether to exercise a peremptory challenge after each individual voir dire. Neither party objected to this procedure at this time, although the defendant had previously objected before the empanelment of the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Before discussing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. at 308 n.19, it is helpful to review the prior cases and the 1974 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>1989 versions of the rule. Rule 6 of the Superior Court (1989), set forth in the margin, 4 prescribes the general procedure in the Superior Court \u201cfor the exercise of peremptory challenges to prospective jurors. It provides that the box be filled with the requisite number of indifferent jurors before any peremptory challenges are exercised, and that the defendant is not required to exercise any of his peremptory challenges until the prosecutor has made his challenges.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ptomey, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 494. There are, however, exceptions contained in the first sentence of the rule. When <em>Ptomey </em>was decided in 1988, Rule 6 of the Superior Court (1974) allowed \u201can exception only in a trial of an indictment for a capital crime or in [a] case in which a judge \u2018specially otherwise ordered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>397 Mass. 718, 724 (1986), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrows, </em>391 Mass. 781, 784 (1984).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ptomey, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 494, at a time when the rule provided <em>no </em>exception for cases where an individual voir dire was conducted, the failure of the trial judge to follow the general mie was held to be reversible error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Writing for the court, then Chief Justice Greaney noted that the rule is to be strictly enforced, and pointed out that the role \u201cis designed to protect the parties\u2019 right to full comparative choice in the selection of a jury by allowing them to exercise their peremptory challenges against the prospective jury viewed and evaluated as a whole.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>397 Mass. at 725-726, the Supreme Judicial Court explained the reason for the exception in role 6 for death penalty cases. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>After pointing out that it had previously construed special procedures and protections applicable in death penalty cases to apply to cases of murder in the first degree despite the elimination of the death penalty, the Supreme Judicial Court held that the exception in role 6 for trials on indictments punishable by death governs trials for murder in the first degree. The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\u201cBecause of the many more peremptory challenges in a capital case, seating the jury will be a lengthier process. To help streamline the process, the juror-by-juror method of challenge may be adopted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\"><em>Ibid. </em>This rationale was reiterated and used to counter an equal protection challenge to the death penalty exception in rule 6 in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiberg, </em>405 Mass. 282, 292-293, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 940 (1989). The justification for the exception constituted a rational basis for upholding the disparate treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>between capital defendants and other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In March, 1989, a few months after the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ptomey, supra, </em>rule 6 was amended, effective April 1, 1989, by eliminating the exception for indictments for a crime punishable by death, and inserting a new exception, namely, \u201cwhen an individual voir dire is conducted.\u201d See note 4, <em>supra. </em>The drafters of the new exception no doubt considered the explanation for the previous exception set forth in the <em>Barry </em>and <em>Freiberg </em>cases applicable because the added protection of individual voir dire results in a \u201clengthier process,\u201d and amended the rule so that, in his or her discretion, the judge could adopt the juror-by-juror method of challenge \u201c[t]o help streamline the process.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>397 Mass. at 725-726.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">We now turn to footnote 19 of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. at 308,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">\u201cThe defendant argues that there was a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because the judge required the defendant to exercise his peremptory challenges after the individual voir dires of each juror. This practice is not in violation of Rule 6 of the Rules of Superior Court (amended, effective April 1, 1989). The subject was within the discretion of the judge, and he did not abuse that discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">We agree with the Commonwealth that the footnote is dispositive. We have reviewed the prior rule and the cases to give context to the footnote and arguments advanced in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">\n<em>Order allowing motion for new trial reversed.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-14\">The defendant was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape, kidnapping, indecent assault and battery on a person who has attained the age of fourteen, assault and battery, threat to commit a crime, and intimidation of a witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\">A joint motion by the Commonwealth and the defendant was filed in this court seeking to \u201csplit\u201d the appeal from the order granting a new trial from the defendant\u2019s appeal from his convictions. Although he denied the motion, the single justice stayed the defendant\u2019s appeal from his convictions pending the outcome of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal from the allowance of the motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Unfortunately, the transcript does not contain the portion of the proceedings in which the judge informed counsel of the method to be followed or the portion in which counsel objected. In his memorandum (and his amended memorandum) granting a new trial the judge stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-9\">\u201cBefore the empanelment of the jury . . . counsel for the defendant objected to the court\u2019s order that peremptory challenges would be exercised at side bar after each juror was found to be indifferent. Counsel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFrO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>did not cite any authority other than he was not use[d] to such a procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">At the hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the allowance of the motion for a new trial, the judge, addressing the defendant\u2019s counsel, stated, \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that you objected to the way that the [ejmpan-elment process was . . . done.\u201d In view of the judge\u2019s comments and our construction of rule 6, we decline to address the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the defendant waived any objection to the empanelment process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The rule is entitled \u201cPeremptory Challenges of Jurors.\u201d It is stated to be \u201cApplicable to all cases\u201d and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">\u201cThe procedure in the matter of peremptory challenges of jurors, except when an individual voir dire is conducted, shall be as follows, unless specially otherwise ordered in a particular case. The jurors shall first be called until the full number is obtained. If any examination on oath of the jurors is required, it shall be made, and any challenge for cause shall be acted on, and if any jurors shall be excused others shall be called to take their places. When it has been determined that all the jurors stand indifferent in the case, each plaintiff shall at one time exercise his right of peremptory challenge as to such jurors, and after others have been called to take the places of those challenged, and it has been determined that they stand indifferent in the case, shall at one time exercise his right of challenge of such others, and so on until he has exhausted his right of peremptory challenge or has ceased to challenge. Each defendant shall then exercise his right in the same manner. Each plaintiff, if his right of peremptory challenge has not been exhausted, shall then again exercise his right in the same manner, but only as to jurors whom he has not already had opportunity to challenge; and the parties shall likewise exercise the right in turn, until the right of peremptory challenge shall be exhausted or the parties shall cease to challenge. No other challenging, except for cause shown, shall be allowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The first sentence of the 1974 version, applicable at the time of <em>Ptomey, </em>read: \u201cThe procedure in the matter of peremptory challenges of jurors, except in an indictment for a crime punishable by death, shall be as follows, unless specially otherwise ordered in a particular case.\u201d In all other respects the rule was identical to the 1989 version.
