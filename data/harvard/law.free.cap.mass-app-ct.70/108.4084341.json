L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, and carrying a dangerous weapon in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(A). The judge sentenced the defendant to one year in a house of correction on the weapons charge. The disorderly conduct conviction was placed on file. The defendant now appeals on two grounds: (1) that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of disorderly conduct; and (2) that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant was carrying a dangerous weapon. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>Background. </em>The sole witness at the bench trial was Officer Anthony Fenlon of the Lowell police department. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we summarize Officer Fenlon\u2019s testimony below. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lati-more, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">At approximately 2:30 a.m. on November 11, 2005, Officer Fenlon was on patrol in a marked cruiser on Central Street in Lowell. At that time, a pedestrian, who appeared anxious, alerted Fenlon to suspicious activity \u2014 a man holding a knife \u2014 further down Central Street. The statements caused Fenlon to drive in that general direction. Upon approaching the location, he observed a man, later identified as the defendant, standing on the comer of Central Street and Wright Street. The defendant appeared to be holding a knife in his right hand. Fenlon further observed that the defendant was located in an area of moderate pedestrian traffic with most persons exiting the surrounding bars and after-hours eating establishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Fenlon then approached the defendant, advising him to stop. The defendant instead ran in front of the cruiser, almost causing Fenlon to hit him, and then across the street and down a nearby street. Fenlon shouted at the defendant to stop, and then pursued him. During the pursuit, Fenlon observed the defendant attempting to put what appeared to be a knife in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">After a short chase, Fenlon got out of the cruiser, approached the defendant, and ordered him to put his hands up. The defendant did not obey Fenlon\u2019s command and appeared to be shuffling an indiscernible object in the front area of his person. As a result, Fenlon drew his weapon and repeated the order. The defendant surrendered. Fenlon handcuffed the defendant and proceeded to search him. The search revealed a knife in his front right pocket. The knife was admitted in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendant raises an issue of the sufficiency of the evidence on the disorderly conduct charge affecting his convictions for both disorderly conduct and carrying of a dangerous weapon. \u201cAbsent exceptional circumstances, we do not consider appeals on assignment of error on indictments placed on file since no appeal may come before us until after judgment, which in criminal cases is the sentence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 438 (1975). \u201cHowever, that general rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>subject to a qualification in cases that present exceptional circumstances, such as where the legal error affects all charges and there is a commonality of effect flowing from the error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prashaw, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 19, 27 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>431 Mass. 21, 28 (2000) (improper exercise of peremptory challenge infected entire trial process); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 297, 298 n.1 (1979) (challenged issues were common to all indictments, including those placed on file); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 807, 807 n.1 (1991) (holding invalid search warrant pertained to both indictments).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Under the present circumstances, there is not necessarily a \u201ccommonality of effect\u201d flowing from the alleged error on the disorderly conduct conviction placed on file, such as to affect the conviction of carrying a dangerous weapon, because, as we note <em>infra, </em>G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 <em>10(b), </em>requires in relevant part only that the defendant be \u201carrested while committing a breach or disturbance of the public peace.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As such, where as here there was no warrant, the Commonwealth need only prove, at a minimum, that the arrest was valid, or more particularly, that there was beyond a reasonable doubt probable cause to arrest the defendant for a breach or disturbance of the public peace. G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(\u00bf&gt;). We thus review the evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s disorderly conduct conviction only to determine whether the validity of the arrest was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u201cThe statute authorizing prosecutions for disorderly conduct, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, has been saved from constitutional infirmity by incorporating the definition of \u2018disorderly\u2019 contained in \u00a7 205.2(l)(a) and (c) of the Model Penal Code (1980)\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulvey, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 579, 582 (2003). Thus, the definition of \u201cdisorderly\u201d as set forth in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> includes only those individuals who, \u201cwith purpose to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>creating a risk thereof . . . : (a) engage[] in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior; or . . . (c) create[] a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholley, </em>432 Mass. 721, 727 n.7 (2000), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Sholley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>532 U.S. 980 (2001), quoting from \u00a7 250.2 of the Model Penal Code; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. 229, 232 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulvey, supra </em>at 582. The \u201cpublic\u201d aspect of the conduct is defined as \u201caffecting or likely to affect persons in a place to which the public or a substantial group has access.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulvey, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 586 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Here, Officer Fenlon observed the defendant standing on a public street, at approximately 2:30 a.m., holding a knife in his hand. Fenlon was aware that the defendant\u2019s conduct had frightened at least one passerby and that the knife-wielding defendant was positioned in a well-traveled area. Fenlon\u2019s additional investigation was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">On the basis of these facts, the defendant\u2019s conduct \u2014 openly carrying a knife on a public street with pedestrian traffic, refusing Fenlon\u2019s order, and fleeing across a public street and down a side street \u2014 created a hazardous or physically offensive condition affecting the public.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feigenbaum, </em>404 Mass. 471, 475 (1989) (defendant\u2019s conscious disregard of police request to move created hazardous condition); <em>Commonwealth </em>v.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>Zettel, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 471, 475 (1999) (failure to move illegally parked car at officer\u2019s request potentially created hazardous or physically offensive condition). See also <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Nagle, </em>116 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting Massachusetts cases where refusal to obey police orders created safety threat). Moreover, the defendant\u2019s carrying of the knife in a public area caused at least one passerby to become apprehensive and Fenlon to become concerned enough to ask the defendant to stop. This evidence supported an inference that the defendant\u2019s activity was causing public alarm. Lastly, the defendant\u2019s carrying of a knife on a public street and his flight at Fenlon\u2019s request support an inference that his actions had no legitimate purpose. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulvey, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. at 582. His conduct contrasts sharply with those instances where our courts have determined that the defendant did have a legitimate purpose for his actions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feigenbaum, supra </em>at 475 (defendant was participating in political protest); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zettel, supra </em>at 475 (\u201c[w]hile the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that the defendant did not heed the officer\u2019s warning, failed to move her car, and illegally parked in a private driveway, warranted, perhaps, a finding that the defendant created \u2018a hazardous or physically offensive condition,\u2019 \u201d defendant had legitimate purpose in picking up her young son when he was released from school). The witness thus provided sufficient basis for probable cause to arrest. As the defendant\u2019s conviction on this count was placed on file, we need not go further.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The defendant also asserts that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the conviction of possession of a dangerous weapon in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(6). In order to establish a violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(b), the Commonwealth must prove that (1) the defendant was arrested for committing a breach of the peace; (2) the defendant had the weapon in his control at the time of his arrest; (3) the defendant was aware that he was carrying the weapon; and (4) the weapon was dangerous. G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(b). To the extent that the defendant asserts insufficient evidence on the breach of the peace element, the argument is misplaced. Those facts described above also establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>that the defendant controlled the knife prior to and at the time of his arrest and that he was aware of its presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The only remaining issue is whether the knife that the defendant was carrying was a dangerous weapon. Here, the weapon was identified as a nine-inch steak knife with a four-inch straight blade.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such a knife, although not specifically enumerated in the statute, falls within the general definition of a dangerous weapon as set out in the case law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 825, 828 (2003) (\u201cStraight knives ... are regarded as dangerous per se\u201d). We therefore conclude that the judge did not err in determining that the steak knife did indeed constitute a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">General Laws c. 269, \u00a7 10(b), as amended by St. 1974, c. 649, \u00a7 2, provides in pertinent part: \u201c[W]hoever, when arrested upon a warrant for an alleged crime, or when arrested while committing a breach or disturbance of the public peace, is armed with or has on his person or under his control in a vehicle a . . . dangerous weapon . . . shall be punished . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The statute reads: \u201cCommon night walkers, common street walkers, both male and female, common railers and brawlers, persons who with offensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex, lewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior, idle and disorderly persons, disturbers of the peace, keepers of noisy and disorderly houses, and persons guilty of indecent exposure may be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than six months, or by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, as amended through St. 1983, c. 66, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The judge found that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201clikely to affect the public,\u201d that it \u201crecklessly created a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm,\u201d and that it \u201ccreated [a] hazardous or physically offensive condition.\u201d The defendant asserts that the judge solely relied on the knife possession as the basis of the disorderly conduct charge. We disagree with this characterization of the judge\u2019s findings or reasoning. In any event, the totality of the conduct, as discussed, created a hazardous or physically offensive condition with no legitimate purpose. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 499, 503 n.7 (1996), <em>S.C., </em>425 Mass. 99 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We note, however, that the evidence as set forth above was sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The defendant filed a motion to have the knife transmitted to this court. The panel denied the motion but ruled that the defendant could submit a photograph of the knife, with its dimensions \u201ccalibrated via the use of a ruler in the photograph.\u201d To date we have received nothing from the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Moreover, even if the knife were not treated as a dangerous weapon per se, the defendant\u2019s open carrying of the knife on a public street, at 2:30 a.m., in the presence of pedestrians, supports an inference that he was handling the knife in a manner that made it a dangerous weapon and therefore was not carrying it for an innocent purpose. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, supra </em>at 829. Further support of this inference is provided by the defendant\u2019s attempt to conceal the weapon only after he was approached by police and the fact that his possession of the knife had made at least one passerby apprehensive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
