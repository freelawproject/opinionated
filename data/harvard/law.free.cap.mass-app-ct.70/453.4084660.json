See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. The judge doubled the damages pursuant to G. L. c. 93A and awarded the tenant attorney\u2019s fees. The landlord does not appeal from other portions of the judgment. It presses a single point on appeal, specifically, that the judge\u2019s finding of intentional infliction of emotional distress is not warranted in the absence of the kind of evidence required under <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140, 144-145 (1976). We think the argument misconceives the nature of damages for interference with quiet enjoyment. We conclude in addition that, even were the criteria of <em>Agis </em>applicable, the judge\u2019s findings were supported on this record. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Many of the underlying facts are not disputed. The landlord owned Greenfield Gardens, a housing complex that received so-called section 8 Federal rental subsidies<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for a portion of the units. Maloney Properties, Inc., managed the property pursuant to a contract with the landlord. Between June, 1999, and March 1, 2002, the tenant, with her children, resided in an apartment at Greenfield Gardens with the assistance of a section 8 rental subsidy. In 2001, the tenant\u2019s annual income was $26,135, which she earned by working as a receptionist for an agency that serves victims of domestic violence. Based on that income, she was required to pay rent of $593 per month, with the remainder of her rent (forty-nine dollars) covered by the section 8 subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">On March 1, 2002, the landlord, without notice to the tenant, terminated the tenant\u2019s section 8 subsidy and transferred that subsidy to another apartment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At approximately the same time, the landlord conducted the tenant\u2019s annual recertification. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>cause a section 8 subsidy was no longer available, the landlord recertified the tenant under the section 236 program.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This had no immediate effect on the tenant, whose monthly rent remained at $593.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">However, in April, 2002, the tenant took an unpaid leave of absence from her employment because of depression. She began receiving public assistance, thereby reducing her annual income from $26,135 to $8,292. She accordingly sought a rent reduction to which she would plainly have been entitled had a section 8 subsidy been in place.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She was not informed until May, 2002, that her section 8 subsidy had been eliminated. On or about May 17, 2002, the landlord, calculating the tenant\u2019s rent at a continuing rate of $593 per month, served a notice to quit for nonpayment of rent of $889.50 for the period of April 1, 2002, through May 31, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">On or about June 3, 2002, the tenant, by counsel, informed the landlord that she had not been notified of the termination of the section 8 subsidy, and requested that it be reinstated. On June 11, 2002, the landlord reduced the tenant\u2019s monthly rent from $593 to $575, which was the minimum section 236 rent available. Had the section 8 subsidy not been terminated, the tenant\u2019s share of the rent, given her reduced income, would have been $147 per month. Despite the fact that rent of $575 per month constituted eighty-three percent of the tenant\u2019s income, the landlord neither reinstated the section 8 subsidy<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> nor otherwise reduced her rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>In August, 2002, the landlord commenced the present proceeding seeking possession of the premises and unpaid rent of $2,039.50. The tenant, by counsel, again informed the landlord that her section 8 subsidy had been terminated wrongfully, and requested that the rent be adjusted accordingly. When this again produced no constructive response, the tenant asserted the illegality of the section 8 subsidy removal in an answer and counterclaim in the summary process case. The judge found that, \u201c[ujpon receiving the notice to quit and summary process complaint, the tenant experienced severe emotional distress. She was anxious, fearful, [and] irritable, had difficulty sleeping, and had suicidal thoughts.\u201d The judge found also that the landlord knew, or should have known, that applicable Federal policies and procedures precluded the termination of the tenant\u2019s section 8 subsidy in the circumstances; that the tenant could not pay a rent of $575 per month once she stopped working; \u201cand that charging a rent which amounted to 83% of her monthly income was likely to cause emotional distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">At about the time that the present proceeding commenced, the tenant returned to work, her income increased, and the landlord established a new rent for her unit of $627 per month. Trial was scheduled for December 6, 2002. One day prior thereto, the landlord offered to recalculate the claimed rent arrearage by applying the tenant\u2019s section 8 share of $147 per month for the period of May through September, 2002, rather than the section 236 minimum rent of $575 per month, thus reducing the claimed arrearage to $444.50. On the day of trial, the landlord offered in addition to give the tenant the next section 8 subsidy that became available at Greenfield Gardens, and to collect from her during the interim only an amount equal to what she would have paid had the subsidy already been in place. The offers effectively settled those portions of the case that related to possession of the unit, restoration of the section 8 subsidy, and calculation of the rent arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">After trial, the judge found that the landlord\u2019s actions had wrongfully eliminated an essential feature of the tenancy and thus constituted interference with the tenant\u2019s right of quiet enjoyment in violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. Apparently applying the criteria of <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>144-145, the judge determined that the landlord\u2019s violation had caused the tenant emotional distress; awarded $5,000 in emotional distress damages; and doubled the award under G. L. c. 93A. In addition, she awarded statutory damages of twenty-five dollars, see G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, on the basis of her finding that the language of the landlord\u2019s notice to quit had been unfair and deceptive; credited the landlord with $444.50 in unpaid rent; and awarded attorney\u2019s fees (subsequently determined to be $7,036.63).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">2. <em>General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 14: emotional distress. </em>At the outset, the landlord\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate the intentional infliction of emotional distress is misplaced. The counterclaim on which the tenant prevailed was not one for intentional infliction of emotional distress, but rather one alleging interference with quiet enjoyment, a statutory violation. See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, as amended by St. 1974, c. 192, \u00a7 1 (\u201cany lessor or landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant . . . shall... be hable for actual and consequential damages or three month\u2019s rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d). Having found that the landlord violated the statute by wrongfully transferring the tenant\u2019s section 8 rent subsidy and then subjecting the tenant to eviction proceedings for failure to pay a new, unlawfully calculated rent, a finding not challenged by the landlord, the judge determined that the landlord\u2019s violation caused the tenant emotional distress, and that such emotional distress was com-pensable as reasonably foreseeable consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Whether damages for emotional distress may be awarded as consequential damages for a violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, has not been decided expressly. Both the Supreme Judicial Court and this court have assumed, without saying so directly, that such damages are available. In <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 107-111 (1982), the court determined that an award of damages of $10,000 for a violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, was redundant in light of a separate award of $35,000 for reckless infliction of emotional distress, but did not question the trial judge\u2019s instruction that actual and consequential damages under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, could include any damage resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>emotional distress. See <em>Dorgan </em>v. <em>Loukas, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 959, 960 (1985), wherein we affirmed without comment a finding of $2,000 in emotional distress damages as a consequence of the defendants\u2019 violations of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We see no reason in law or policy why emotional distress, where foreseeable, should not be viewed as a consequence of interference with quiet enjoyment. Nor do we believe that the requirements of the <em>Agis </em>decision relative to common-law claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress must be imported into an analysis of emotional distress as a consequence of a statutory violation under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. Negligent conduct, as opposed to wilful or reckless behavior, is all that is required for a violation of the quiet enjoyment statute. See <em>Cruz, Mgmt. Co. </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>417 Mass. 782, 789 (1994); <em>Al-Ziab </em>v. <em>Mourgis, </em>424 Mass. 847, 850-851 (1997). If foreseeable harm follows causally from the negligence, there is no basis for elevating the burden of proof of a single kind of harm (i.e., emotional distress) to that required with respect to a common-law tort where either intentional or reckless behavior must be present. Such an interpretation is inconsistent with the objectives of those remedial landlord-tenant statutes of which G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, is an example.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">With the requirements of <em>Agis </em>out of the way, the judge\u2019s finding that the landlord\u2019s actions caused the tenant emotional distress is unassailable. It takes little imagination to understand that a woman with children living in a subsidized apartment might find anxiety-provoking a threat to put her on the street for failure to pay an unreasonable, erroneously determined rent well beyond her limited financial capacity. The landlord\u2019s contention that the tenant\u2019s emotional distress preceded the \u00a7 14 violation is unpersuasive. The judge\u2019s finding that the tenant experienced severe emotional distress when she received the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>notice to quit is warranted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge could also find that the landlord\u2019s actions were wilful and, thus, per the Attorney General\u2019s regulations, a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. See 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.17(6)(f) (1993) (\u201cIt shall be an unfair and deceptive practice for an owner ... [f] To violate willfully any provisions of [G. L.] c. 186, \u00a7 14\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">3. <em>Intentional infliction of emotional distress. </em>While we have held that proof of the <em>Agis </em>factors is not a prerequisite for the recovery of emotional distress damages for violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14 (see part 2, <em>supra), </em>we conclude that the evidence here is sufficient to sustain a finding of intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress even if the <em>Agis </em>factors are applied. \u201c[Ojne who, by extreme and outrageous conduct and without privilege, causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress even though no bodily harm may result.\u201d <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. at 144. To recover on this common-law claim, \u201c[i]t must be shown (1) that the actor intended to inflict emotional distress or that he knew or should have known that emotional distress was the likely result of his conduct . . . ; (2) that the conduct was \u2018extreme and outrageous,\u2019 was \u2018beyond all possible bounds of decency\u2019 and was \u2018utterly intolerable in a civilized community\u2019 . . . ; (3) that the actions of the defendant were the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s distress . . . ; and (4) that the emotional distress sustained by the plaintiff was so \u2018severe\u2019 and of a nature \u2018that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 144-145. The definitions thus focus on particularly reprehensible conduct combined with an intense effect on the victim of the defendant\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>On this record, there is no basis for a finding that the landlord or its manager <em>intended </em>to inflict emotional distress; but there is certainly evidence that they knew or should have known that their actions were likely to cause emotional distress to one in the tenant\u2019s situation. Certainly following correspondence from the tenant\u2019s counsel on June 3, 2002, the landlord was on notice that the tenant\u2019s subsidy had been wrongfully terminated; that the tenant could not pay monthly rent of $575 on monthly income from public assistance of $691; and that the landlord\u2019s threat to evict her in these circumstances would be terrifying and intolerable. Indeed, the manager\u2019s employee in charge of the project testified that the situation \u201cwould definitely put stress on somebody,\u201d especially given that the tenant had young children.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The landlord argues that it was not foreseeable that its improper termination of the section 8 subsidy would cause the tenant emotional distress, in part because prior eviction proceedings between the parties had been resolved amicably.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The manager\u2019s transfer of the subsidy to a tenant who could derive a greater benefit from it may or may not by itself have been sufficient to make out a case of reckless infliction of emotional distress (although it did place the tenant in jeopardy if, as happened, her income was reduced), but this fails to take into account the landlord\u2019s contumacious refusal to correct the mistake, notwithstanding two written communications from the tenant\u2019s counsel and the tenant\u2019s counterclaims, until just before the case was called for trial. The judge could permissibly find that the outcome of the landlord\u2019s earlier dispute with the tenant could not reasonably have convinced it that its threat to evict in the quite different circumstances of the present case could not be the cause of significant distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The judge\u2019s finding that the landlord\u2019s actions were extreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>and outrageous is warranted. The conduct occurred in total disregard of applicable substantive and procedural guidelines; it continued notwithstanding the tenant\u2019s efforts to obtain a correction; the landlord remained obdurate until confronted by an actual trial; and the actions subjected the tenant to potentially disastrous consequences. Contrary to the landlord\u2019s characterization, these were not merely \u201cuninformed choices.\u201d The facts underlying <em>Beecy </em>v. <em>Pucciarelli, </em>387 Mass. 589, 596 (1982), and <em>Rahman </em>v. <em>Federal Mgmt. Co., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 701, 705-707 (1987), on which the landlord relies, which cases held that the mere filing of a lawsuit is not extreme and outrageous conduct, fell far short of the level to which the behavior of the landlord sank in the present case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The evidence also supports findings that the landlord\u2019s actions caused the tenant\u2019s emotional distress,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that the distress was severe. There was evidence that, while the tenant\u2019s depression had stabilized prior to her receipt of the notice to quit, her symptoms worsened markedly after the notice was served; she became anxious, frightened, irritable, extremely worried for the welfare of her children, was unable to sleep, and had thoughts of suicide. Severe emotional distress lasted about a month, with the effects subsiding somewhat thereafter. As we have stated, this occurred upon the tenant\u2019s receipt of the notice to quit, and the aftermath of the later service of the summary process summons and complaint is of little relevance. That unlawful elimination of her subsidy and imposition of a rent that she could not pay; likely eviction; and the absence of any apparent solution would cause emotional distress that was severe can hardly be doubted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">4. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The tenant has requested an award of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>pellate attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. Castro, 406 Mass. 17, 19 (1989). She is entitled to such an award pursuant both to G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, and G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. The tenant shall have fifteen days from the date of this decision to file her application with appropriate support. The landlord may file an opposition within fifteen days of service of the tenant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\">See <em>Wojcik </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Authy., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 103 n.2 (2006), for a description of the Housing <em>Choice Voucher </em>(section 8) program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The landlord did so ostensibly because the section 8 benefit that the tenant was receiving was minimal, and the subsidy would be of greater value to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>different tenant with lower income (and thus a higher subsidy rate). A specific number of units were eligible for section 8 subsidies, and no such subsidies were available after this transfer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The section 236 program provides a subsidy to mortgage lenders so that they will extend financing at a below-market rate to private developers to construct or rehabilitate apartments for low income use. Rents are established at below-market levels because the landlord can pass through to the tenants their reduced financing costs. See <em>Tedford </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hous. Fin. Agency, </em>390 Mass. 688, 690 (1984); <em>Volpe Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 249, 260 n.15 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Even this figure ($593) was excessive. The correct monthly rent for section 236 purposes should have been $575.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b479-11\">The section 236 program operates differently and the rent is not affected by the tenant\u2019s reduction in income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b479-12\">This presumably resulted from the fact that no other section 8 subsidies were then available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">It is not clear whether the judge actually viewed the <em>Agis </em>standards as establishing the burden of proof with respect to emotional distress damages under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. She did not cite <em>Agis </em>in her findings and rulings, and may only have employed certain of its terms (\u201cextreme and outrageous,\u201d \u201csevere emotional distress\u201d) as a way of characterizing the actions of the landlord or the effect on the tenant. If the judge did intend to rule that the tenant was required to prove the <em>Agis </em>elements, we disagree, but her result was correct and we may affirm, albeit on different grounds. See <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>Natural Prods. Co., </em>292 Mass. 455, 458 (1935).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The judge\u2019s conflation of the tenant\u2019s receipt of the notice to quit and her receipt of the summary process complaint, events that obviously occurred at different times, and with the latter coming when the tenant had largely recovered from her earlier depression, provides no basis for disturbing her finding of causation. The evidence supports a finding that the notice to quit caused the tenant emotional distress. While service of the summary process complaint came later, it may reasonably be inferred that it did not help the tenant\u2019s frame of mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The same finding of wilfulness in turn justified the double damages award. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The operative words in the inner quotes were drawn from several sources in which the issue had previously been considered, including the Restatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>(Second) of Torts and decisions of courts of Arizona, California, Utah, and Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The prior dispute was precipitated by a failure by the tenant to pay rent. The landlord commenced summary process proceedings; there was agreement by the parties on a payment plan; and the eviction action was dismissed. The tenant was not deprived of her section 8 subsidy and was never obligated to pay more than thirty percent of her income in rent or arrearages. The circumstances differed considerably from the secret, wrongful termination by the landlord of the section 8 subsidy that took place in the present case, followed by an attempt to enforce an unlawful rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">To the extent that the landlord argues that the tenant did not pay the section 8 amount as of May 17, 2002, the date of the notice to quit, there was no evidence that (1) the amount was actually calculated for her by the landlord, or (2) the landlord offered to accept that amount of payment by her to dismiss the eviction proceedings. The amount due claimed in the notice to quit ($889.50) was based upon the incorrect rental amount. As the judge noted, a substantial part of the unpaid rent claimed in the summary process summons and complaint ($2,039.50) was also attributable to the overcharging.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\">While the judge did not make an explicit finding that the landlord\u2019s actions caused the tenant\u2019s distress, the finding is implicit in her decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b485-9\">In light of our conclusions above, we need not address the tenant\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>that the record also supports an action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
