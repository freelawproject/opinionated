The judge dismissed the action on the basis that it was time-barred by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29. That section requires that any action by a subcontractor claiming on the general contractor\u2019s surety bond must be filed \u201cwithin one year after the day on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>which such claimant last perforated the labor or furnished the labor, materials, equipment, appliances or transportation included in the claim . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">It was not National Union, but rather Ipswich, the third-party defendant, that raised the time bar in its motion for summary judgment. Between the time Kenney filed its action in April, 2001, and the time National Union filed its third-party complaint against Ipswich in March, 2004, National Union had resolved with Kenney all the various claims included in Kenney\u2019s complaint except for a claim based on change order request number 89, otherwise known as the \u201caddendum 2\u201d changes. The \u201caddendum 2\u201d changes, which totaled $111,294 (National Union\u2019s estimate), had their origin in allegedly misleading contract bidding documents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> National Union took the position that if Kenney prevailed on its claim that the addendum 2 changes should be treated as extra work, the added cost should pass through to Ipswich as the party whose architect drafted the misleading documents. Ipswich moved for summary judgment, arguing among other things that the claim against it concerned only the addendum 2 work, and that Kenney, through the deposition of its vice-president of construction, Robert B. Nims, had acknowledged that Kenney completed the addendum 2 work in February or March, 2000, more than one year before it filed its complaint. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 14(a), as amended, 385 Mass. 1211 (1982) (\u201cThe third-party defendant may assert against the plaintiff any defenses which the third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff\u2019s claim\u201d). Ipswich argued that it could raise the time bar because National Union\u2019s claim against it was derivative.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The judge agreed with Ipswich, discounting the affidavit of Nims, filed in response to Ipswich\u2019s motion, to the effect that Kenney was still doing subcontractor work in August, 2000, and later, within the one-year period. The judge ruled that the affidavit was to be disregarded (even though it was supported by invoices) because it contradicted Nims\u2019s earlier sworn testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>many fixing the completion date as February or March, 2000, and was offered in a last-minute effort to avoid summary judgment. While citing no authority for the ruling, the judge presumably had in mind such cases as <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Analog Devices, Inc., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 905, 906 (1993), and <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Leeds, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 54, 58-59 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The ruling was in error. There was no contradiction between the addendum 2 work finishing in February or March, 2000, as Nims conceded in the deposition, and Kenney\u2019s work on the subcontract finishing sometime after August, 2000, as Nims asserted in his affidavit. The addendum 2 changes affected only a portion of Kenney\u2019s subcontract work. Moreover, even if there were an aura of contradiction, the less-than-definitive character of the deposition testimony would probably \u201cpresentQ a question of credibility, which is not to be resolved by the judge on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Junkins </em>v. <em>Slender Woman, Inc., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 878, 878 (1979). See <em>Guenard </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>387 Mass. 802, 812 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Ipswich argues that the judge\u2019s conclusion was nevertheless correct because Kenney\u2019s claim was limited to the addendum 2 work, and the period of February through March, 2000, included (in the words of \u00a7 29) \u201cthe day on which such claimant last performed the labor or furnished the labor, materials, equipment, appliances or transportation included in the claim . . . .\u201d That may have been true of the third-party complaint of National Union, which was served on Ipswich after all Kenney\u2019s claims other than its addendum 2 claim had been settled; but the timeliness of Kenney\u2019s complaint turned on the point when it completed the subcontract work in its entirety. See <em>General Fire Extinguisher Co. </em>v. <em>Chaplin, </em>183 Mass. 375, 376 (1903); <em>Peerless Unit Ventilation Co. </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amore Constr. Co., </em>283 Mass. 121, 124 (1933); <em>Worcester Air Conditioning Co. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 352, 354-356 (1982). There is no basis in the record for surmising that the work billed in the October 27, 2000, invoice was under a new and independent contract, as discussed in the <em>Peerless Unit Ventilation Co., supra </em>at 125, and in <em>International Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Corp. </em>v. <em>Rich Construction Co., </em>372 Mass. 134, 137-138 (1977), and as was the case in the <em>Worcester Air Conditioning Co., supra </em>at 356. Nor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>there any suggestion in the record, or by the parties, that the subcontract price can be apportioned, with a separate and discrete part of the total applicable to the addendum 2 work, so that the completion of that work might start the statutory year running despite the fact that other subcontract work remained to be done. See <em>General Fire Extinguisher Co. </em>v. <em>Chaplin, supra </em>at 378; <em>Otis Elevator Co. </em>v. <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 712, 713-714 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Kenney\u2019s action was therefore timely, and it was error to dismiss its action on that ground. We have considered whether the order of dismissal might nevertheless be correct based on the other theories propounded by Ipswich and National Union, and our conclusion is that they all involve disputed issues of fact that have not been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\">\u201cAddendum 2\u201d referred to a pre-bid revision by the architect in the drawings that included some revisions in the HVAC work.
