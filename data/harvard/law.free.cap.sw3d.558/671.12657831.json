Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Based on an intake received by the of Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (the Department) of possible methamphetamine use by Mother and Father, a lack of utilities in the home, the home's allegedly filthy condition, and D.W.G.K.'s repeated absences from school, the Department instituted these proceedings, ultimately leading to a petition to terminate Mother's and Father's parental rights. After a jury trial, the trial court terminated Mother's parental rights pursuant to grounds (D), (E), (J), (N), (O), and (P) of Section 161.001 the Texas Family Code. The trial court also terminated Father's parental rights pursuant to grounds (D), (E), (F), (J), (N), (O), and (P) of Section 161.001 of the Texas Family Code. The trial court found that termination was in the children's best interests as to both parents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 161.001(b)(1)(D), (E), (F), (J), (N), (O), (P), (b)(2) (West Supp. 2017). Neither parent challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting these findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this accelerated appeal, Father complains that D.W.G.K. received ineffective assistance of counsel, requiring a new trial at which the children should be appointed separate counsel. Because Father lacks standing to assert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on behalf of D.W.G.K., we affirm the trial court's judgment as to Father. In her sole point of error, Mother claims that the trial court's refusal to strike the Department's witnesses resulted in a denial of due process of law, requiring reversal of the termination order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we find that the Department failed to establish that Mother was not unfairly surprised or unfairly prejudiced by its failure to answer Mother's discovery requests before trial, we find that the trial court erred in overruling Mother's motion to strike the Department's witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6. However, because we find that the testimony of the untimely disclosed witnesses is cumulative of the testimony of witnesses to whom Mother makes no objection, we find that the trial court's error was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment as to Mother as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The following morning, the children's attorney ad litem determined to continue to advocate for termination based on \"all of [her] interactions and conversations with [her] clients throughout th[e] case, as well [as] D.K.'s testimony that he said he wanted to live where he [was] permanently.\" Further, counsel took into consideration that only the question of termination was before the court. Father claims this decision rendered counsel's representation of the children ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Department contends that, under the doctrine of virtual representation, Father does not have standing to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on behalf of D.W.G.K.

Given the constitutional mandate that termination of parental rights be carried out only where there is clear and convincing evidence justifying that result, as well as the requirement that termination proceedings and termination statutes be strictly construed in favor of the parent, it follows that-in parental-rights termination cases- Rule 193.6(a)'s exceptions should also be strictly construed in favor of the parents and against the Department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the purposes for\n   that rule must be interpreted in light of the unique character of parental-rights termination cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

However, at the hearing on that motion, Mother's counsel argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Your Honor, my issue with this is the Department did not timely -- they didn't respond at all to my request for disclosures. And with regard to their witness list, I would represent to the Court that they didn't timely file any information with regard to an expert in general.

So I would ask they be precluded from calling any witnesses in general, as they did not properly disclose their witnesses in response to discovery in regard to Rule 197.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In response, the trial court stated, \"Your objection is overruled. If you have any\n   specific surprise by a specific witness, you can bring that to my attention at the time that the witness is called.\" The trial court further stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Okay. I'm going to deny that. If there's something that's a surprise or anything else you want to have specifically brought to my attention, otherwise your point is preserved by the Court's ruling on this.... Otherwise, you need to bring it to my attention if you think it's something that was not included in the discovery that you say was not done in compliance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On the other hand, during the course of the hearing on Mother's motion, the trial court also stated, \"If they call an expert, I'll hear your objection, the request for a hearing outside the presence of the jury at that time.\" The trial court also stated that it intended \"to hear the objections to the witness at the time, as opposed to ... addressing a limine at this time.\" Based on these statements from the trial court, the Department argues that the trial court merely made a ruling on a motion in limine-which does not preserve error-and that Mother waived her objections by failing to object to the witnesses at the time they were called. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   At trial, the Department called the following witnesses, in addition to Mother and Father: (1) Joseph Stephens, (2) Christopher Kitts, (3) Crystal Wrape, (4) Tracy Howell, (5) Andrea Scoggins, (6) Amanda McDonald, and (7) J.K. Mother did not object to Father, Stephens, Wrape, and McDonald at the time they were called to testify. She did object, however, when Kitts, Howell, Scoggins, and J.K. were called to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court permitted those four aforementioned witnesses to testify over Mother's objection. Accordingly, as to Kitts, Howell, Scoggins, and J.K., Mother did preserve error. Under Rule 193.6(a) Mother could not object to her own testimony or to the testimony of Father or Wrape.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6(a), (holding that nonresponding party may not introduce \"the testimony of a witness (other than a named party) who was not timely identified\"). Thus, the question remaining is whether Mother preserved error as to Stephens' and McDonald's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   It is true that a trial court's ruling on a motion in limine does not preserve error, and Mother's objections were raised in a motion entitled \"motion in limine.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huckaby v.

Namely, the Department argued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Again, Your Honor, we did submit production over to both parties, over 500 pages. Everything that was asked for was in there.

Your Honor, I think that also goes to 196 -- I'm sorry -- 193.6 (a) 2. That discovery was given to the Respondent and that the 584 pages are discoverable. They had all of the information necessary. Not every expert is in the care and control of the Department, so we did provide for our experts. And, further, I did not receive those requests personally. They were sent over. I was not the attorney of record at the time, so I did send over based on what I was missing at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court overruled Mother's objections after hearing the arguments from both parties, including the Department's attempt to establish the lack of unfair surprise or prejudice as contemplated by Rule 193.6(b). Considering (1) the substance of her motion, (2) Mother's verbal request that \"[the Department] be precluded from calling any witnesses,\" (3) the Department's information attempting to establish the lack of unfair surprise or prejudice, (4) the manner in which the hearing was conducted, and (5) the trial court's ruling, Mother's specific request to strike the witnesses was a motion to exclude the Department's witnesses rather than a motion in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It is true that the trial court told Mother, \"If you have any specific surprise by a specific witness, you can bring that to my attention at the time that the witness is called\" and that it intended \"to hear the objections to the witness at the time, as opposed to ... addressing a limine at [that] time.\" The trial court also stated, \"I'll hear the objections at the time and see witness by witness, but I'm not going to grant anything at this time.\" Yet, these statements do not change the result. For one thing, that procedure would impermissibly shift the burden of proof from the Department to Mother. As noted above, the exclusion under Rule 193.6 is automatic, and the Department had the burden to establish an exception to the Rule, not Mother.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9967902\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/714/297/#p297\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TEX.

R. EVID. 103(b). Accordingly, having overruled Mother's objections and having indicated that her objections were preserved by the ruling, no further objections were required to preserve Mother's objections. Consequently, we find that Mother did not waive her objections to the Department's witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Did the Department Establish the Absence of Unfair Surprise or the Absence of Unfair Prejudice?\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Did the Department Establish the Absence of Unfair Surprise?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In the present case, the Department argued that Mother was not unfairly surprised or prejudiced by its untimely discovery answers by pointing out that it provided more than 500 pages of its file to Mother and that the witnesses it called at trial were identified in those documents. Essentially, the Department treated discovery in this case as if it were a criminal case-it gave Mother a copy of its file and a list of witnesses more than ten days prior to trial. Yet, this was not an instance where the Department timely answered Mother's discovery, but inadvertently failed to identify one or two witnesses. Nor did the Department fail to answer the discovery within thirty days, but then later answer it. Rather, in this case, the Department\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   answered Mother's requests for disclosure or requests for production, and it\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   provided verified answers to her interrogatories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The exception contemplated by Rule 193.6(a) necessarily implies a good-faith\n   effort on the responding party to attempt to answer discovery. Otherwise, a party could completely ignore the other party's discovery requests and then argue that the lack of surprise allows them to call their witnesses and introduce other evidence. In that instance, the limited exception provided by Rule 193.6(a) would swallow the other discovery rules in the rules of civil procedure. Given the fundamental liberty interests at stake in a parental-rights termination case, a good-faith effort to answer discovery must especially be implied to Rule 193.6(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   It is true that we and our sister courts have found that parents in parental-rights termination cases were not unfairly surprised by the Department's failure to timely disclose evidence, but those cases are distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    In re H.A.C.\n   </em>\n   , we held that the Father was not unfairly surprised by the Department's failure to timely identify its expert witness because Father had submitted to a psychological examination by the expert, the Department told the voir dire panel that it might call psychologists to testify, and Father admitted during his testimony \"that he had received and reviewed the results of [the expert's] examination.\"\n   <em>\n    In re H.A.C.\n   </em>\n   , No. 06-16-00063-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20604064\">\n    2017 WL 604064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Tex.

Yet, in that case, as in\n   <em>\n    H.A.C.\n   </em>\n   , the Department identified the expert in response to the mother's and grandparents' discovery, but merely failed to disclose the substance of his mental impressions. Also, in\n   <em>\n    In re E.A.G.\n   </em>\n   , the San Antonio Court of Appeals held that the Department's failure to provide the curriculum vitae and expert reports for one of its expert witnesses did not unfairly surprise mother and father where the expert witness had been identified in the Department's discovery responses.\n   <em>\n    In re E.A.G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7122615\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/373/129/#p145\">\n    373 S.W.3d 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145 (Tex.

We first noted the difference between the best-interest standards applicable to the two types of cases:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   To begin with, the best-interest issue in Section 153.002 is different from the best-interest issue in Section 161.001(2). Section 153.002 states that \"[t]he best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.\" TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 153.002 (West. 2014). By contrast, Section 161.001(2) states that \"[t]he court may order termination of the parent-child relationship if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence: ... (2) that termination is in the best interest of the child.\" Thus, while best interest is an element of the moving parties' proof regardless of whether the suit is brought under Chapter 153 or Chapter 161, different standards of review are applied to a trial court's best-interest finding under each chapter.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re J.F.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9359530\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/96/256/#p261\">\n    96 S.W.3d 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261, 263 (Tex. 2002) (\"[T]here are two prerequisites for termination of parental rights under section 161.001....

Spratlan\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Involuntary termination of parental rights rests upon [ Section 161.001 of the Texas Family Code ]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Suits for conservatorship, possession, and support are governed by Chapter [153] of the Family Code[,] and those matters are determined by the \"best interest\" test. Section [153.002]. Those proceedings are different and have different purposes from termination cases. Decrees under Chapter [153] may be modified or changed from time to time, but the parent still retains some rights in and control over a child. A termination decree, on the other hand, is complete, final, irrevocable. It divests for all time the parent and child of all legal rights, privileges, duties, and powers with respect to each other except for the child's right to inherit. ... The difference in the proceedings justifies the caution with which courts have characteristically considered termination cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091853\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/405/406/#p410\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wiley v.

Namely, in a custody dispute between the biological parents, the State acts in only one capacity-as a neutral arbiter acting through its judicial power to resolve the custody question based on what is deemed by it to be in the child's best interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 169-70. By contrast, in a parental-rights termination case, the State acts in a second capacity-as the moving party through its executive power seeking the permanent termination of the parents' rights to their children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, in a\n   custody case between the biological parents, the State's concern for the best interests of the child is paramount. In a parental-rights termination case, however, the State must be concerned with both the child's best interest and with guaranteeing the parents' rights to due process that \"exists to prevent potential governmental overreach in cases involving fundamental liberty interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 170 (citing\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   , 530 U.S. at 65,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Consequently, given the fundamental liberty interests at stake in a parental-rights termination case, we do not believe that a parent's right to discovery under the rules of civil procedure can be disregarded simply because it is in the best interest of the child that the fact-finder have all of the information before it to make a decision. This is particularly so where the nonresponding party is the State. To hold otherwise would allow the State to impede a parent's defense of her fundamental liberty interests by ignoring her discovery requests and then arguing that the information should nevertheless be admitted because, \"[c]ompared to the best interest of the child, technical rules of pleading and practice are of little importance....\"\n   <em>\n    Spurck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093068\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/396/205/\">\n    396 S.W.3d at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Did the Department Establish the Absence of Unfair Prejudice?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In her brief on appeal, Mother argues, \"[A]llowing the Department to call witnesses that were not parties to the case (i.e. Officer Kitts) or any other witnesses, other than [the] ongoing Conservatorship worker, required [Mother's] attorney to blindly prepare for the testimony of parties not designated.\" A distinctive feature of civil cases not found in criminal cases is the broad right to discovery, including the right to depose witnesses. Therefore, a parent in a termination case does not just have the right to see the Department's evidence in advance, she has the right to test that evidence prior to trial through the discovery tools provided by the rules of civil procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For example, unlike a defendant in a criminal case, a defendant in a parental-rights termination case has the right to take depositions of witnesses and experts without leave of court after establishing good cause.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   TEX.

Considering that termination of a parent's rights to his or her child is \"complete, final, irrevocable and divests for all time that natural right as well as all legal rights, privileges, duties and powers with respect to each other except for the child's right to inherit,\" the parent's right to test the Department's evidence through discovery-including the right to depose witnesses-is not insignificant.\n   <em>\n    Holick v.

Rather, it merely established that Mother was aware of the evidence prior to trial. Accordingly, the Department did not establish the absence of unfair prejudice as required by Rule 193.6(b). Consequently, the trial court erred in overruling Mother's objection to the Department's witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Was The Trial Court's Error Harmful?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Introduction and Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Mother does not identify a particular witness whose testimony she claims should have been excluded. Instead, she claims that the trial court erred in allowing \"the Department to call witnesses that were not parties to the case which were not timely and properly disclosed.\" She further claims that, by \"allowing the Department to call witnesses that were not parties to the case (i.e. Officer Kitts) or any other witnesses, other than the ongoing Conservatorship worker,\" she was \"required ... to blindly prepare for the testimony of parties not designated.\" Finally, she prays that the case be reversed and remanded for a new trial and that the trial court be ordered \"to preclude the Department from calling any witness other than the conservatorship worker in this matter.\" It is undisputed that Wrape was the Department's conservatorship case worker in charge of this case. Accordingly, Mother only complains that the trial court erred in allowing any witness other than herself, Father, and Wrape to testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Texas Supreme Court has held that the test for determining whether the introduction of improperly disclosed or undisclosed witness testimony is harmless \"is not whether the party propounding the interrogatory had available to it information from pretrial discovery that corroborates the undesignated witness' testimony; rather, the testimony or evidence in question must be cumulative of other testimony or evidence that has been properly admitted at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Jamail v.

Yet, merely establishing the presence of non-cumulative evidence from an undisclosed witness does not automatically render the trial court's error in admitting the evidence harmful: the opposing party must also demonstrate that the noncumulative evidence was consequential.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9977964\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/809/221/#p223\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (holding that admission of noncumulative testimony from undisclosed\n   witness regarding punitive damages was not harmful in the absence of jury finding necessary to establish plaintiffs' right to recover punitive damages). Finally, in making this evaluation, \"a reviewing court must examine 'the entire record to determine whether the judgment was controlled by the testimony that should have been excluded.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9977964\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/809/221/#p223\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gee v.

If the testimony of all of the Department's witnesses was cumulative of the testimony from Mother, Father and Wrape, then the trial court's error in admitting the witness testimony was harmless. On the other hand, if the testimony of any Department witness is in excess of the testimony of Mother, Father, and Wrape, then we must decide if the noncumulative evidence was consequential. If we determine that the noncumulative evidence was consequential, then the trial court's error in admitting the witness testimony was harmful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Was the Testimony of the Undisclosed Witnesses Cumulative of the Testimony of Mother, Father, and the Department's Case Worker?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   We have reviewed the record in this case and have compared the testimony of the untimely disclosed witnesses to the testimony of the witnesses to whom Mother does not challenge. Based on our review of the record, we find that the testimony of the untimely disclosed witnesses is merely cumulative of the other testimony. Mother, Father, and Wrape testified in detail about the first CPS case, the reasons leading to the present case, the history of the present case, and the history of Mother's and Father's drug usage. Also, they testified about D.W.G.K.'s absence from school and the fact that the children had moved around several times after the first case was concluded. Their testimony covered all of the subjects testified to by the untimely disclosed witnesses. Also, while there may have been differences in the testimony, they were differences of detail and interpretation rather than differences of substance. Thus, to the extent that any additional, noncumulative information was provided by the untimely disclosed witnesses, we find that the additional information was not consequential to the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Accordingly, although we find that the trial court erred in failing to grant Mother's motion to strike the Department's witnesses, we also find that the trial court's error was harmless. Consequently, we overrule Mother's sole point of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
