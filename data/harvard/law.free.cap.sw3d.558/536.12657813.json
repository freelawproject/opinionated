Genevieve County on Appellant's claim for damages under an insurance contract with Cornerstone National Insurance Company (\"Respondent\") for underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") coverage. Appellant's sole point of error is the trial court erred by failing to determine she was entitled to the full UIM coverage under her policy. Appellant asserts the UIM limit of liability section of her policy was ambiguous, and therefore should be construed in favor of coverage. We agree with Appellant that due to an ambiguity under Respondent's interpretation of the policy, Appellant is entitled to full UIM coverage. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties stipulated to the following facts. Appellant was walking on Basler Drive in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, when she was struck by a vehicle driven by Donna Bullard (\"Tortfeasor\"). As a direct result of the negligence of Tortfeasor, Appellant\n   sustained injuries to her head, lower back, right knee, and left elbow. Consequently, Appellant suffered pain, disability, and anxiety, and incurred medical charges in excess of $100,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant was personally insured under an insurance policy (the \"Policy\") with Respondent at the time of the accident. The Policy included $100,000 of UIM coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant recovered a settlement from Tortfeasor's insurance carrier for $50,000 dollars, which represented the limits of liability of Tortfeasor's insurance policy. Appellant then sought recovery from Respondent under the UIM coverage in the Policy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Respondent determined that it was entitled to a $50,000 reduction in its policy limit of UIM coverage because Tortfeasor's insurance carrier already paid Appellant $50,000. This would mean Appellant could only recover $50,000 under the Policy's UIM coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant filed a vexatious refusal to pay claim against Respondent. The parties reached a compromise agreement, wherein Appellant agreed to dismiss her vexatious refusal claim, and Respondent agreed to stipulate both that Tortfeasor was an underinsured motorist under the Policy, and Appellant's damages were in excess of $150,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The parties agreed the only issue presented was whether Appellant is entitled to UIM Policy limit proceeds of $100,000, or whether Respondent is entitled to a $50,000 reduction, resulting in a judgment against Respondent of $50,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following oral arguments on the parties' motions, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Respondent and ordered Respondent to pay $50,000 to Appellant. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Relevant Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   An appellate court reviews the trial court's grant of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    ITT Comm'l Fin.

Specifically, Appellant argues the UIM limit of liability section of the Policy was ambiguous and therefore should be construed in her favor. Respondent contends the limit of liability section unambiguously informed Appellant the limit of liability for UIM coverage was subject to a reduction by any and all sums paid by a liable tortfeasor to Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The limit of liability section states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   B. When two limits of liability are shown in the Declarations for Underinsured Motorist Coverage:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The limit of liability shown in the Declarations\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for each person for this coverage is our\n   <em>\n    maximum limit of liability\n   </em>\n   for all damages, including damages for care, loss of services or death, arising out of bodily injury sustained by any one person in any one accident. Subject to this limit for each person, the limit of liability shown in the Declarations for each accident for this coverage is\n   <em>\n    our maximum limit of liability\n   </em>\n   for all damages for bodily injury resulting from any one accident.\n   <em>\n    This is the most we will pay\n   </em>\n   regardless of the number of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1.

This includes all sums paid under Part A of this policy.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Appellant argues the above-referenced language is ambiguous because it states the Policy's $100,000 UIM per person limit is the most Respondent will pay, but then seeks to reduce that limit of liability by all sums paid by or on behalf of the underinsured motorist. Appellant asserts this guarantees that Respondent will never pay the $100,000 limit, because an underinsured motorist will necessarily, by definition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   have an insurance policy that will pay some amount on behalf of the underinsured motorist. Appellant argues the ambiguity created in the limit of liability section should be construed in her favor, and therefore she is entitled to the full $100,000 per person UIM limit without any reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Appellant cites to\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The ambiguity arises from the fact that both statements cannot be true; either the insurer will sometimes pay up to the declarations listed limit, or the amount it will pay always will be limited by the amount paid by the underinsured motorist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Analyzing the present case under\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , we first note the express\n   language in the Policy's Limit of Liability provision indicates that Respondent will pay up to the Declarations' listed amount:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The limit of liability shown in the Declarations for each person for this coverage is our\n   <em>\n    maximum limit of liability\n   </em>\n   for all damages ....

Accordingly, as the Court held in\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   Respondent's interpretation is \"at best, in conflict ... and is, at worst, misleading.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7302288\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/287/687/#p690\">\n    287 S.W.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiff's own insurer, Allied Property and Casualty Insurance Company (\"Allied\"), provided UIM coverage which it listed in its declarations page as $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident.

In such a case, the mere fact that [the declarations'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   listed limit amount] will never be paid out is not misleading, for the policy never suggests that this is its liability limit and never implies that it may pay out that amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Ritchie v.

Instead,\n   <em>\n    Ritchie\n   </em>\n   strongly supports Appellant's position due to the similarity in the relevant policy language between\n   <em>\n    Ritchie\n   </em>\n   and the present case. As already discussed, the Policy here states that it will pay up to $100,000 in UIM coverage, but under Respondent's interpretation of the Policy, it will never pay that amount. Under the holdings in\n   <em>\n    Jones, Ritchie,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Craig,\n   </em>\n   this interpretation creates an ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The existence of an ambiguity, however, does not automatically mandate a decision on behalf of the insured.\n   <em>\n    Golden Rule\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315297\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/368/327/#p334\">\n    368 S.W.3d at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In order for the insured to prevail, an ambiguous clause in an insurance policy must allow for an alternative reasonable reading which supports the coverage the insured seeks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315297\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/368/327/#p334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, such an alternative reasonable reading exists if we interpret the challenged Policy language as the Missouri Supreme Court did with similar language in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ritchie.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, we will interpret the language in the UIM limit of liability section which states that \"[t]he limit of liability shall be reduced by all sums paid because of the bodily injury by or on behalf of persons or organizations who may be legally responsible,\" to mean that in determining the\n   <em>\n    total damages\n   </em>\n   to which the UIM coverage will be applied, the amount of money already received from a tortfeasor must first be deducted. Because Appellant suffered at least $150,000 in total damages, deducting the $50,000 received from Tortfeasor will still meet or exceed the Policy's limit of $100,000. Accordingly, Respondent must pay Appellant the Policy's full UIM limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Lisa P.

In\n    <em>\n     Craig,\n    </em>\n    however, the Court did not find the UIM limit of liability provision at issue was ambiguous. This was because the first sentence of the limit of liability section provided: \"The Limits of Liability stated in the Declarations for Underinsured Motorist Coverage\n    <em>\n     are for reference purposes only\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Under no circumstances\n    </em>\n    do we have a duty to pay you or any person entitled to Underinsured Motorist Coverage under this policy the entire Limits of Liability stated in the Declarations for this coverage.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12375924\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/514/614/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (Emphasis added).
