App. S.D. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State charged Movant in case number 1431-CR01909-01 with the class C felony of forgery, the class A misdemeanor of fraudulent use of a debit device, and the class A misdemeanor of stealing. In a separate case, 1431-CR01954-01, the State charged Movant with the class C felony of stealing property with a value of at least $500. Each charging document alleged that Movant was a prior and persistent felony offender. The State and Movant entered written plea agreements involving both cases wherein Movant would receive a 12-year sentence (concurrent on the felonies), the State would oppose probation, and the State would dismiss the misdemeanor charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2015, a plea hearing was held for both cases. With regard to each felony charge, the forgery and the stealing, the court advised Movant that, because of his prior convictions, he was facing a sentence of up to 15 years on each case and a potential fine of $5,000 on each felony-a total of 30 years. The court accepted Movant's guilty pleas, found him guilty, and set the cases for sentencing after the receipt of a sentencing assessment report. In October 2015, the court sentenced Movant to two concurrent terms of 12 years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Movant timely filed a pro se Rule 24.035 motion in December 2015. After\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was decided in August 2016, Movant timely amended that motion with the assistance of appointed counsel to claim, among other things, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in his forgery case because plea counsel had \"misinformed Movant of the range of punishment in his companion stealing case, in that [plea counsel] told him that, after being found prior and persistent, he could be sentenced to fifteen years in both cases, for a total of thirty years, instead of a maximum of sixteen years.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Movant claimed that, but for the incorrect information as to the maximum sentence that he could have received, he would have continued to trial. After an evidentiary hearing, the motion court overruled Movant's amended motion. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Movant's point on appeal claims clear error in the motion court's denial of his amended motion. Movant claims plea counsel was ineffective for failing \"to recognize that under the plain language of Section 570.030 at the time of [Movant]'s guilty plea, [Movant]'s stealing charge should have only been a misdemeanor[.]\" Movant claims he \"was therefore facing only sixteen years of incarceration instead of thirty, and but for this erroneous advice, [Movant] would not have pleaded guilty to the forgery charge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plea counsel and Movant provided the only testimony at the evidentiary hearing on the amended motion. Both men testified that plea counsel told Movant that, based on the governing interpretation of Section 570.030 at the time and Movant's\n   status as a prior and persistent felony offender, Movant could receive consecutive 15-year terms if found guilty of both felony stealing and felony forgery. Plea counsel explained at the evidentiary hearing, however, that at the time of the guilty plea,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   had not been decided, and he had no way of knowing that the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   decision would be issued almost a year later. In plea counsel's ten years of practicing law, the stealing charge Movant faced had \"always been treated as a felony[.]\" The motion court found that Movant was properly advised of the sentencing ranges in effect for both felony charges at the time the guilty plea was taken and that Movant could not claim that counsel was ineffective based on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   because\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   did not apply retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We discern no clear error in the motion court's finding. \"To prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the movant must show his attorney did not demonstrate the customary skill and diligence of a reasonably competent attorney in the same or similar circumstances and the defense was prejudiced by that substandard performance.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carden\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092170\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/404/386/#p387\">\n    404 S.W.3d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Strickland v.

Our aim is \"to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p689\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis added).

Thus, counsel's conduct is measured by the law in effect at the time, and we do not generally require counsel to anticipate changes in the law. See\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Glass v.
