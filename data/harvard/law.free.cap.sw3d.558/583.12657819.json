We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 5, 1998, Appellant purchased a home at 44 Hillvale Drive in Clayton. Appellant also purchased an Owner's Policy of Title Insurance (the Policy). The Policy was underwritten by Respondent. The Policy states it is meant to protect the insured from defects, encumbrances, or liens in title, unmarketability of title, and lack of right to access to and from land. The Policy also states Respondent would pay costs, attorney's fees, and expenses incurred in defense of title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July 2003, Appellant's back yard neighbor, Michael Polinsky (Polinsky), replaced the fence between Polinsky's and Appellant's homes. Appellant believed the fence encroached onto his property. On July 24, 2008, Appellant filed a lawsuit against Polinsky, demanding he remove the fence. On December 16, 2009, Appellant dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. On December 10, 2010, Appellant filed a second lawsuit against Polinsky, demanding he remove the fence. On June 29, 2012, Appellant dismissed the second lawsuit without prejudice. The parties then privately settled without judicial determination of Appellant's claims. However, Appellant incurred $68,740.25 in attorney's fees from initiating and pursuing his lawsuits against Polinsky. In 2015, Appellant\n   sought reimbursement of that expenditure from Respondent under the Policy's coverage of third-party challenges to title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondent first became aware of Appellant's claims against Polinsky on August 25, 2015, when Appellant sued Respondent, alleging Breach of Contract in Count I of his petition; in Count II, Unjust Enrichment; and in Count III, Vexatious Refusal to Pay. During the pendency of Appellant's lawsuit against Respondent, the parties agreed Appellant would submit a claim under the Policy. On March 1, 2016, Appellant submitted a claim to Respondent for his attorney's fees incurred in his 2008 and 2010 lawsuits. On July 6, 2016, Respondent denied the claim because Appellant failed to timely notify Respondent of the lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both Appellant and Respondent moved for summary judgment and the trial court heard oral argument. The trial court granted summary judgment in Respondent's favor on all three counts of Appellant's petition based on Appellant's unexcused failure to provide Respondent timely notice of his claims, which prejudiced Respondent, thereby relieving Respondent of all liability under the Policy. This appeal follows. Additional facts will be adduced later in this opinion as necessary to resolve the issues raised in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Points on Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his first point, Appellant claims the trial court erred in granting Respondent's motion for summary judgment because Appellant met his burden of proof to establish compliance with the notification of claim requirements as set forth in the insurance policy and Respondent did not meet its burden of proof to establish actual prejudice from any claimed failure of Appellant to comply with the notification of claim requirements in the insurance policy, in that the requirement of prompt notice in the insurance policy is vague, undefined, and unenforceable, and Respondent was unable to establish any nonspeculative evidence to show actual prejudice from any claimed failure to notify by Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his second point, Appellant maintains the trial court erred in granting Respondent's motion for summary judgment because there are controverted issues of material fact which are in dispute, in that (1) there was a valid contract between Appellant and Respondent which was fully performed by Appellant, which Respondent breached, and for which Appellant suffered damages in an amount of at least $68,740.25; (2) there is a valid claim for unjust enrichment as Respondent received a benefit when Appellant paid for his own defense of his boundary dispute with Polinsky, and it would be unjust for Respondent not to pay this claim for which it is otherwise liable; and (3) there is a valid claim for vexatious refusal to pay as Respondent's denial of Appellant's claim was without reasonable cause or excuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment is reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and affirmed only where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Clayborne v.

Appellant offered no evidence of incapacity or substantial compliance with the timely notice provision to excuse his failure to give prompt notice. Respondent was prejudiced because it was deprived of its specifically expressed contractual rights under the Policy to direct the litigation, pursue a settlement, and most importantly in this case, select the counsel of its choice. Without notifying Respondent, Appellant independently initiated and pursued two lawsuits against Polinsky that he later dismissed, with his choice of counsel, who billed Appellant more than $68,000. Appellant then sought reimbursement from Respondent for Appellant's independently selected private counsel's fees in contravention of the Policy's specific and express provision that Respondent has the right to choose counsel and \"shall not be liable for and will not pay the fees of any other counsel.\" A specific provision within an insurance agreement prevails over more general provisions.\n   <em>\n    H.B.
