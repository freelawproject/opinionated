Co., Inc. (Priefert), a Texas-based manufacturer. Priefert Logistics, LP (Priefert),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   leased a truck from Aulsbrook &amp; Son Truck Lines LLC (Aulsbrook), a Texas company, to take the fulfilled order from Priefert's facilities in Texas to Wilco's facility in Mount Angel, Oregon. Michael Carter, an employee of Aulsbrook, drove the truck to Oregon. While the cargo was being unloaded in Mount Angel, Carter sustained fatal injuries when some of the cargo fell on him. Consequently, Carter's widow and children filed this lawsuit in Hopkins County, Texas, against Wilco, Priefert, and Aulsbrook, alleging that their negligence caused Carter's injuries and death. In response, Wilco filed a special appearance and asserted that it was not subject to personal jurisdiction in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court denied the special appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this interlocutory appeal, Wilco contends that the trial court erred in denying its special appearance because its contacts with Texas are not sufficient to confer either general or specific personal jurisdiction over Wilco in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Wilco is an Oregon corporation with its principal place of business in Mount Angel, Oregon. It has eighteen farm supply retail stores in Oregon and Washington. Wilco has had a business relationship with Priefert for approximately twenty years, in which Wilco sells cattle squeeze chutes and corral panels supplied by Priefert. The relationship began when a sales representative of Priefert contacted Wilco by telephone and convinced Wilco to stock Priefert's products. Since that time, a Priefert salesperson came to Wilco stores in Oregon and Washington quarterly to make sales calls, to train Wilco's salespeople on the use of Priefert's products, and to instruct how to properly unload its merchandise upon delivery. In addition, almost every year Wilco sends certain of its employees to Priefert's facilities in Texas for additional training in the manufacture and use of Priefert's products. During these trips, no purchases are made by Wilco, and Priefert does not train Wilco employees on unloading its merchandise. Upon selling enough of Priefert's products, Wilco places an order by notification to Priefert, whereupon Priefert delivers the products from Texas to Oregon. Priefert determines the time and mode of delivery of the products. Priefert includes a brochure on how to unload its merchandise with the packing slip accompanying the delivered merchandise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Wilco only advertises in Oregon and Washington. Although it advertises its merchandise (including some of the merchandise supplied by Priefert) on its website, its merchandise may only be purchased through one of its retail outlets. Wilco does not have any place of business in Texas, is not registered to do business in Texas, and does not have a bank account in Texas. None of its employees, officers, or directors reside in Texas. It does not own property or pay taxes in Texas. Priefert is Wilco's only Texas supplier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February 2017, Wilco sent a purchase order to Priefert for gates and other items. Pursuant to a contractor lease agreement with Priefert, Aulsbrook supplied the truck and driver, Carter, used to deliver the shipment to Wilco in Oregon. While the cargo was being unloaded in Mount Angel, Carter sustained fatal injuries when some of the cargo fell on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellees filed this suit in Texas against Priefert, Aulsbrook, and Wilco, alleging that the defendant's negligence caused Carter's death. Its claim against Wilco includes allegations that Wilco was negligent in failing to unload the truck in a safe and secure manner, in failing to train its employees on how to safely unload cargo, and in failing to supervise its employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Druggs reviewed the brochures and Moki Mac's website, and after corresponding with Moki Mac's representatives from their home in Texas, decided to send Andy on the rafting trip. After an application and payment were submitted, Moki Mac sent the Druggs an acknowledgment-of-risk and release form, which both Andy and his mother signed and returned.

The court accepted as true that the Druggs would not have sent Andy on the trip were it not for Moki Mac's representations about safety. However, the court noted that \"the operative facts of the Druggs' suit concern[ed] principally the guides' conduct of the hiking expedition and whether they exercised reasonable care in supervising Andy\" and that the focus of the trial and most of the evidence would be \"[t]he events on the trail and the guides' supervision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9971165\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/815/223/#p226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, the court held, \"[T]he injuries for which the Druggs seek recovery are based on Andy's death on the hiking trail in Arizona, and the relationship between the operative facts of the litigation and Moki Mac's promotional activities in Texas are simply too attenuated to satisfy specific jurisdiction's due-process concerns.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 588.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Appellees argue that because of Wilco's longstanding relationship with Priefert, the allegations of unsafe loading/unloading, the allegations of inadequate safety training lodged against both Wilco and Priefert, and because Carter allegedly died \"performing\" a Texas contract, there is a substantial connection to its claim's operative facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, in considering specific jurisdiction, we are only concerned with the non-resident's contacts\n   with the forum and the relationship between those contacts and the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 575-76. Therefore, Appellees' allegations of unsafe loading and inadequate safety training lodged against Priefert are not relevant considerations. In addition, even assuming the contract between Wilco and Priefert required Priefert to deliver the goods to Oregon, the undisputed testimony was that the manner and means of delivering the goods was solely in the control of Priefert. Further, the evidence showed that Priefert chose to deliver the goods by entering into a contract with Aulsbrook to perform the task and that Aulsbrook supplied Carter to drive the truck. Thus, it appears that the contract that Carter was performing at the time of the incident was between Priefert and Aulsbrook. The unilateral actions of another party, or of a third person, are not relevant considerations when analyzing specific jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Old Republic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656790\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/549/550/#p558\">\n    549 S.W.3d. at 558-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202449360\">\n    2018 WL 2449360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Moki Mac\n   </em>\n   , the operative facts of the Appellees' claims against Wilco in this case concern principally whether Wilco's employees exercised reasonable care in unloading the truck and whether Wilco exercised reasonable care in training and supervising its employees, all of which took place in Oregon. Likewise, the focus of the trial and evidence concerning Appellees' claims against Wilco will be the events surrounding the unloading of the truck and Wilco's supervision of its employees. Wilco's contacts with Texas, consisting of its longstanding buyer-supplier relationship with Priefert and the mutual efforts of these parties to maintain and improve their relationship, cannot be said to be substantially connected to the operative facts of Appellees' claims against Wilco.

In\n    <em>\n     Spir Star AG\n    </em>\n    , a Texas resident was injured in Texas when a high-pressure hose manufactured by Spir Star, a German company, ruptured.\n    <em>\n     Spir Star AG\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7327868\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/310/868/#p874\">\n     310 S.W.3d at 871\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Spir Star marketed its products through a Texas distributor. The Supreme Court held that since Spir Star specifically targeted Texas as a market for its products, it was subject to a products liability suit in Texas based on a product sold in Texas, even if the sale was through a distributor.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7327868\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/310/868/#p874\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7327868\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/310/868/#p874\">\n     at 874\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, because the sales were through a distributor, specific jurisdiction was limited to claims arising from those sales under the substantial connection test.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7327868\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/310/868/#p874\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In this case, Wilco has never targeted Texas as a market, and the claim does not arise out of a sale of its products in Texas.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Although ultimately Carter would not have been injured had not Wilco been in a relationship with Priefert and had it not ordered the goods, this kind of \"but for\" standard has been rejected by the Texas Supreme Court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Moki Mac\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311340\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/569/#p574\">\n     221 S.W.3d at 580-81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
