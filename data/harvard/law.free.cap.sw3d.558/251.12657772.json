Cleveland responded with a counterclaim against SGB, and a third-party claim against SGB's principal, appellant Sam Seidel. SGB and Seidel both moved to compel arbitration, which the trial court denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a consolidated, accelerated, interlocutory appeal, SGB and Seidel argue the trial court erred in denying arbitration. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a residential construction dispute. On September 30, 2015, Seidel, on behalf of SGB, entered in to a Residential Construction Contract (the \"contract\") to build for Cleveland the residence at 3424 Sunset Boulevard, Houston, Harris County, Texas, at an agreed price of $1,680,340.39. The contract contained the following language regarding arbitration of disputes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   17.\n   <em>\n    RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES\n   </em>\n   . The Parties desire prompt, inexpensive and efficient dispute resolution procedures and therefore agree that their disputes shall be governed by the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    Mediation-Binding Arbitration/Waiver of Jury Trial\n   </em>\n   . The Owner and Builder agree that all controversies, claims (and any related settlements), or matters in question arising out of or relating to (i) this Contract, (ii) any breach or termination of this Contract, (iii) the construction of the Home and/or its repairs, (iv) any acts or omissions by the Builder (and its officers, directors or\n   agents), and/or (v) any actual or purported representations or warranties, express or implied, relating to the Property and/or the Home (herein referred to collectively as a \"Dispute\") may be submitted to binding arbitration, but both parties shall also have the right to seek other legal remedies as they see fit and the law allows.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   25.\n   <em>\n    ENTIRE AGREEMENT\n   </em>\n   . This Contract, together with all attachments, contains the entire understanding between Builder and Owner with respect to the construction of the Home, and replaces all prior agreements or understandings, if any. BUILDER IS NOT BOUND BY ANY STATEMENT, PROMISE, CONDITION OR STIPULATION NOT SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS CONTRACT. No representative of Builder has authority to make any oral statements that modify or change the terms and conditions of this Contract. OWNER REPRESENTS THAT OWNER HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS THIS ENTIRE CONTRACT, INCLUDING THE AGREEMENT FOR BINDING ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS CONTRACT (AS AMENDED). OWNER ALSO REPRESENTS THAT NO VERBAL STATEMENT, PROMISE OR CONDITION NOT SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS CONTRACT IS BEING RELIED UPON BY OWNER. IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT BUILDER IS RELYING ON THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THIS CONTRACT WITHOUT THIS UNDERSTANDING.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During the construction of the residence, a dispute arose between the parties regarding payment and performance under the contract. On February 27, 2017, SGB filed a demand for arbitration of its rights as well as an original petition in the trial court, which was made subject to SGB's right to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response, the Cleveland's asserted a counterclaim against SGB for fraud, Deceptive Trade Practices Act violations, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of implied warranty, and a request for declaratory relief wherein they request the trial court to declare the arbitration language in the contract is permissive and does not compel Cleveland to arbitrate. Cleveland also added a third-party petition against appellant Sam Seidel, SGB's principal, for fraud, DTPA violations, and negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   SGB voluntarily dismissed the arbitration proceeding without prejudice and moved the trial court to compel arbitration under the contract. On May 19, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on SGB's motion to compel and, after taking it under advisement, denied the motion on June 7, 2017. Seidel also filed a motion to compel, requesting the trial court to compel arbitration of all claims under the contract. The trial court denied Seidel's motion without a hearing on July 6, 2017. SGB and Seidel timely filed their respective notices of appeal, which were consolidated by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The central focus of this appeal is whether the trial court erred in denying SGB and Seidel's motions to compel arbitration. Appellants raise three issues: (1) is arbitration required when requested under this contract; (2) Does Cleveland's extrinsic evidence alter the express terms of the contract; and (3) do the parties' claims fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of review and substantive law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 171.098 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code permits the interlocutory appeal of an order denying a motion to compel arbitration.

Here, appellants challenge the trial court's\n   rulings on both motions to compel arbitration. We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The trial court erred by denying appellants' motions to compel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   SGB and Seidel, as the parties seeking to compel arbitration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   argue that the trial court erred in denying their motions to compel because they met their burden by demonstrating (1) the existence of a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement and (2) that the claims asserted against them fall within the scope of that agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rachal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093447\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/403/840/#p843\">\n    403 S.W.3d at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, it is undisputed that the Residential Construction Contract contains an agreement to arbitrate. Section 17c lists categories of claims and provides those claims \"may be submitted to binding arbitration.\" It also is undisputed that the claims at issue between the parties arise out of the contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   SGB alleges breach of contract and prompt payment claims. Cleveland alleges issues against SGB and Seidel, in his official capacity, stemming from performance of the contract. Thus, the claims fall directly within the arbitration clause. The only matter in dispute is whether the arbitration clause is enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   SGB and Seidel argue that arbitration is required if requested. They maintain that the arbitration provision in Section 17(c)-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that any dispute \"may be submitted to binding arbitration, but both parties shall also have the right to seek other legal remedies as they see fit and the law allows\"-constitutes a binding promise to arbitrate if either party requested it. They maintain to give meaning to all the terms of 17(c) it must be read as providing the scope of claims subject to arbitration, stating that those claims are subject to arbitration upon request, and confirming that, if arbitration not requested, the parties are free to pursue other forms of dispute resolution. In their motions, SGB and Seidel cite to a Texas Supreme Court decision that they contend is controlling and demands arbitration under these circumstances.\n   <em>\n    In re U.S. Home Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8367953\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/236/761/\">\n    236 S.W.3d 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. 2007) (per curiam) (\"may\" submit language requires arbitration when requested). Additionally, SGB and Seidel contend that requiring arbitration when requested is consistent\n   with the rest of the contract. Under Section 25, which is entitled \"Entire Agreement,\" the contract references an agreement for binding arbitration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   OWNER REPRESENTS THAT OWNER HAS READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS ENTIRE CONTRACT, INCLUDING THE AGREEMENT FOR BINDING ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS CONTRACT (AS AMENDED).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Further, Section 25, provides the builder is \"NOT BOUND BY ANY STATEMENT, PROMISE, CONDITION OR STIPULATION NOT SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS CONTRACT.\" Similarly, Cleveland represented that \"NO VERBAL STATEMENT, PROMISE OR CONDITION NOT SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS CONTRACT IS BEING RELIED UPON BY OWNER.\" Moreover, Section 20 of the contract references reimbursement of arbitration fees by the successful party. Finally, SGB and Seidel maintain that Cleveland accepted the contract, along with its terms and conditions, as evidenced by his signature on the final page of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Cleveland argues that the contract does not empower SGB and Seidel to unilaterally compel arbitration. Cleveland contends that he cannot be compelled to arbitrate because the arbitration clause in the contract uses permissive wording, stating that the parties \"may\" submit disputes to arbitration. Cleveland asserts that the parties were \"permitted\" but not \"required\" to agree mutually at some point in the future to pursue arbitration. According to Cleveland, this interpretation is evidenced by the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract. In support of his argument, Cleveland submitted the parties' redlined draft of the contract, negotiating the replacement of \"shall\" with \"may\" in Section 17(c). Cleveland also maintains that\n   <em>\n    U.S. Home Corp.\n   </em>\n   , is inapposite because it involved two agreements, one of which contained a mandatory arbitration clause. Cleveland distinguishes\n   <em>\n    U.S. Home Corp\n   </em>\n   . by asserting that the contract in this case requires the parties to subsequently agree to arbitrate. Finally, Cleveland contends that Section 25 of the contract does not dictate arbitration, but \"only identifies a procedural structure (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"binding\" versus \"non-binding\") for a means of resolving existing disputes,\" and is considered after the question of arbitrability is resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We agree with SGB and Seidel that arbitration was required. The plain language of Section 17(c) creates a valid and enforceable mandatory arbitration clause that unambiguously provides that either party may request arbitration. Nothing in the contract suggests arbitration was optional if either side requested it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hence, as interpreted by this court's precedent, this clause constitutes a binding promise to arbitrate if either party requested it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman/Matz Interests, LLP v.

Because the claims against Seidel are in substance claims against SGB, our analysis of the trial court's denial of SGB's and Seidel's motions to compel is the same.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Cleveland does not squarely address whether claims between himself and SGB fall within the scope of the arbitration provision of the contract; instead, he asserts that scope need not be addressed because no agreement to arbitrate exists. With respect to Seidel, Cleveland asserts a potential lack of standing to compel arbitration and again asserts that scope is irrelevant because no agreement to arbitrate exists. As set forth,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , we disagree with Cleveland's interpretation of the arbitration clause and its enforceability. And, as stated,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    at n.2, Seidel has standing to compel arbitration. By virtue of Cleveland's failure to address scope, it is undisputed that the claims in dispute fall within the scope of the arbitration clause of the contract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The cases relied upon by Cleveland expressly require the parties to commit to arbitration and allow one party to reject such a request.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tex.
