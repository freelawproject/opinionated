The State of Texas appealed the trial court's order dismissing with prejudice four indictments against Albert G. Hill III. In our original opinion, we held the trial court erred in conducting a pretrial evidentiary hearing on Hill's motion to quash and dismiss the indictments because Hill did not establish a prima facie case of alleged constitutional violations. We vacated the dismissal order and remanded with instructions to reinstate the indictments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Crim. App. 2016). The court of criminal appeals disagreed and held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in conducting an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    State v. Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179334\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/499/853/\">\n    499 S.W.3d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871 (Tex. Crim. App. 2016). It remanded the case to us to address the State's two remaining issues challenging the dismissal of the indictments with prejudice. We allowed the parties to supplement their briefs, and we heard new oral\n   argument. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court's dismissal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of this case have been recounted at length in our original opinion, a dissenting opinion, and in the court of criminal appeals's opinion. We thus do not recite them again in detail. In March 2011, a grand jury returned four indictments against Hill. Three indictments charged him with making false statements to obtain property or credit. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 32.32 (West 2016). The fourth charged him with securing execution of a document by deception.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179334\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/499/853/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 32.46 (West 2016). Hill moved to quash and dismiss the indictments due to three types of alleged prosecutorial misconduct. First, he maintained that due to influence exercised upon then Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins, the State deprived him of his due process right to a disinterested prosecutor. Second, Hill asserted the State engaged in vindictive prosecution because he was being prosecuted in retaliation for unrelated civil litigation. Lastly, Hill contended the State engaged in selective prosecution because the conduct for which he was being prosecuted did not normally lead to prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In deciding the issues related to the court's decision to hold an evidentiary hearing on Hill's motion, we looked only at the motion and attached exhibits. We now also consider the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing, which took place over three days. Several assistant district attorneys testified, but Watkins, despite being ordered by the court to do so, did not. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court granted Hill's motion and dismissed the cases with prejudice. The court's order recites that Hill had been denied his right to a full and fair hearing on his motion due to Watkins's refusal to testify at the hearing. The court determined the district attorney's office denied Hill his due process rights under the United States and Texas constitutions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its third issue, the State contends the trial court abused its discretion by compelling Watkins's testimony and then dismissing the indictments based on his refusal to testify. In its original brief, the State contended Watkins was justified in refusing to answer questions about Hill's indictment under the work-product exemption. At oral argument after remand, however, the State withdrew this argument. We are left to consider whether the trial court was entitled to dismiss the indictments for the reasons asserted in Hill's motion to dismiss. The State maintains Hill did not establish he was entitled to dismissal for any of the three grounds in his motion-lack of a disinterested prosecutor, vindictive prosecution, or selective prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prosecutors have broad discretion in deciding which cases to prosecute.\n   <em>\n    Neal v.

Hill and his wife were both indicted in March 2011 for allegedly making false and misleading written statements to a bank in seeking a $500,000 home equity loan. The case was first brought to the attention of the district attorney's office in February 2010 via a complaint made by Hill's father, through his lawyer. At the time, Hill and his father were on opposing sides of litigation in federal court over a family trust. The complaint was made to the Chief of the Specialized Crime Division just four days after the judge in the trust case found that Hill's father had testified falsely and submitted evidence in bad faith. The essence of the complaint was that Hill and his wife claimed a 100% ownership interest in their home, when they instead owned only a 20% interest and the other 80% was owned by the Albert\n   Hill Trust. The bank did not complain of Hill's conduct. The loan was fully collateralized, and it is undisputed that the loan was repaid prior to Hill's indictment. The indictments against Hill's wife were dismissed within six months after they were returned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, after a settlement in the federal trust litigation, Hill was involved in a fee dispute with his former lawyer in that case. Hill's former lawyer testified by deposition about a phone call she received from Watkins shortly before Hill was indicted. Watkins said, \"[T]here could be an indictment or are you still interested in the indictments.\" The attorney stated she told Watkins she did not represent the Hills anymore and it would be inappropriate for her to talk about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the first day of the hearing on the motion to dismiss, Hill's former attorney took the stand and invoked the Fifth Amendment on all questions. On the second day of the hearing, when Hill called Watkins to testify, the State objected on grounds of attorney-client privilege. The trial judge disagreed and indicated she intended to limit his testimony to conversations he had with Hill's former attorney. The judge instructed prosecutors to \"bring Mr. Watkins down.\" An assistant district attorney confirmed that Watkins had been subpoenaed to be present that day. After a break, another assistant district attorney, who had been tasked with \"calling Mr. Watkins down,\" represented that Watkins was in the office, that she had spoken to him, and that he was \"not going to make himself available.\" Watkins told her it would be improper for him to \"discuss issues that are clearly within the purview of his discretion as the District Attorney.\" When the judge asked the assistant district attorney if she had informed Watkins that the scope of questions would be limited, the assistant district attorney stated that she knew Watkins to be ill and not in a condition to be able to testify. The judge granted a continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Watkins was present at proceedings on March 7, 2013. Over the State's work-product and attorney-client privilege objections, the trial court required Watkins to testify. Hill's counsel asked Watkins about phone calls between Watkins and Hill's former counsel related to Hill and the indictments. Watkins refused to answer any questions \"because of [his] right as an attorney to have the privilege and to protect [his] work product.\" The judge ordered Watkins to answer the questions. He refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The former first assistant district attorney, the highest ranking deputy in the office, testified about her participation in a pitch session at which a decision was made to indict Hill. Watkins was present at the pitch session. Long before the pitch session, two assistant district attorneys asked the former first assistant for permission to investigate the complaint against Hill made by his father. She approved the request, but because of the lawsuit between father and son, warned them to be \"very, very skeptical of whatever [Hill's father] may have told you.\" She also warned that Hill's father was \"using the office ... for his own purpose of getting an advantage over his son.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The assistant district attorney who presented this case to the grand jury testified that the case came to her attention in February 2010 when she was called into a meeting with Hill's father's attorneys. She received a copy of their complaint. Sometime later, possibly April 2010, she received another complaint in the case from David Pickett, trustee of the trust with an ownership interest in Hill's house. Several months later, Pickett wrote that assistant district attorney to urge her to pursue the case. She stated he was angry because it\n   had not been presented yet. She denied giving Pickett the impression she was not interested in pursuing the case. The assistant district attorney testified she could not use the documents Pickett gave her in trial and had to have her \"own set of documents under business records affidavit.\" She indicated that from the moment she got the complaint, in her mind, she had a good case and was \"always presenting it to the Grand Jury.\" No one implied that her supervisor would be upset if she did not present the case to the grand jury. She testified that this case was \"one of the easier cases [she] had.\" She also said she was certain at the \"outset of reading that complaint that there was evidence to support it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   That assistant district attorney invited Watkins to a pitch session about the case and testified she thought she had to do a pitch session with him because of the media attention the case would attract. She testified she spoke to Watkins about the case only on the day she did the pitch. If he had called someone before the pitch meeting to talk about the indictments, she did not have any knowledge of that. The assistant district attorney would not have put the case before the grand jury if Watkins had told her to let it go. But she was confident she had a good case; it never crossed her mind that Hill and his wife would not be indicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During her testimony, the assistant district attorney who presented the case to the grand jury was impeached with handwritten notes she made about her conversations with Pickett. On September 8, 2010, she wrote that Pickett \"calls all the time.\" She told him the investigation was going slowly. He wanted a definite timeline. She told him the bank was not interested in prosecuting. Pickett said the trust was the actual victim. The assistant district attorney told him that after doing research, she did not see how she could prove his criminal case at that time. She consulted with the former first assistant, who told her to go ahead with the investigation. The assistant district attorney testified she spoke to the bank's general counsel who told her the bank would not have filed a complaint because the loan was repaid. The judge noted that the witness appeared to contradict her previous testimony. The judge asked her, \"The bank is not interested in prosecuting, and your client is not a victim; that's what you told Mr. Pickett?\" She responded, \"Yes.\" In addition, the assistant district attorney later went back and added to her notes. She added that she had talked to Pickett multiple times since her original note and that he was okay with not indicting \"for the trust as a victim\" and going forward with indictments listing the bank as the victim. The assistant district attorney acknowledged she \"probably\" added that note sometime after Hill filed his motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Further, there was evidence a law partner of Hill's father's lawyer donated a total of $48,500 to Watkins's campaign. In June 2010, the partner made a $10,000 donation. On September 23, 2010, a couple of weeks after the assistant district attorney who presented the case to the grand jury noted the problems prosecuting the case against Hill, the law partner made a pledge of $33,500 to Watkins. Later, he donated another $5,000 to Watkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the issue of vindictive prosecution, the parties disagree about whether we apply the rebuttable presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness under the facts of this case. We need not decide whether there is a rebuttable presumption, however, because Hill presented evidence from which the trial court could have found actual vindictiveness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9186437\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/150/169/#p173\">\n    150 S.W.3d at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Watkins had the ultimate authority to\n   approve or refuse the presentation of Hill's case to the grand jury. The bank did not complain of Hill's conduct in connection with the loan. Hill's father raised the complaint after an adverse decision in his trust litigation against Hill. Also, around this same time, a law partner of Hill's father's attorney made donations or pledges to Watkins's campaign. Further, shortly before the indictments were handed down, Watkins called Hill's former attorney, who was engaged in fee dispute litigation against Hill, to talk about the indictments. Hill's allegations of prosecutorial misconduct centered on Watkins, but Watkins refused to testify. And the assistant district attorney who presented the case to the grand jury and testified about the decision to prosecute was impeached. Before she presented the case to the grand jury, she wrote that she did not see how she was going to prove the case. Yet after Hill raised the issue of prosecutorial misconduct, she added to her notes and testified that it was a good case and there was evidence to support it. This misconduct, by a career prosecutor, shows the depth of the taint in this case. In conjunction with the other evidence, the testimony of that assistant district attorney cast doubt on the whole process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We defer to the trial judge's determination of the credibility of the witnesses and her discretion to determine that a constitutional violation occurred under these facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9186437\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/150/169/#p173\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9186437\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/150/169/#p173\">\n    at 174-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court had discretion to determine that Hill not only overcame the presumption of regularity, but presented clear evidence he was indicted in retaliation for the civil litigation involving his father and/or his former attorney. In addition, for these same reasons, the court could have determined that Hill was denied his right to a disinterested prosecutor because Watkins was under the influence of Hill's father and/or Hill's former attorney and that this influence conflicted with Watkins's duty to seek justice. We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Hill's due process rights were violated.

It was Hill's father, not any victim or complainant, who submitted to the district attorney's office a letter accusing Hill and his wife of mortgage fraud. Further, there was evidence a law partner of Hill's father's counsel donated a total of $48,500 to Watkins's campaign. After Hill and his father settled their dispute, Hill became embroiled in a dispute with his former legal counsel, Lisa Blue, over more than $50 million in attorney's fees attributed to her representation of him. In the months leading up to Hill's indictments, Watkins called Blue to discuss \"the Hills\" and asked if she was \"still interested in the indictments,\" and Blue held a fundraiser for Watkins and made sizeable, lawful contributions to him as her fee dispute with Hill proceeded to trial. In his motion to quash or dismiss the indictments, Hill presented evidence, presumably credited by the trial judge sitting as finder of fact,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicating that Watkins pursued the indictments in retaliation for the civil litigations involving Hill's father and Blue, that a public servant made himself available to influence, and that the charges against him would not have been pursued other than as a political favor by the district attorney. When called to testify at the hearing on Hill's motion to dismiss, Blue invoked her Fifth Amendment right on all questions. Watkins first failed to appear and ultimately refused to answer any questions, invoking specious attorney-client privilege and work-product immunity objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Texas elects its district attorneys on a partisan basis and leaves them to finance their campaigns from members of the general public, a tiny percentage of whom decide, for their own reasons, to contribute. Barring the explicit quid pro quo to constitute a \"bilateral agreement\" at the\n   time the money changes hands, there is generally no offense in a citizen lawfully contributing to an official's political campaign or otherwise engendering good will.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McCallum v.

While the prospect of a compromised judge is worrying enough, a trial judge's discretionary judgments are subject to review and correction on appeal, and appellate panels are themselves comprised of multiple members, offering greater assurance of independent review. A prosecutor, on the other hand, stands alone with largely unfettered charging discretion that, but for the highly unusual circumstances of cases like this one, is necessarily beyond any generalized form of meaningful judicial scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McCleskey v.

While political contributions within statutory limits are both lawful and regular, the concern here is not with Hill's father's counsel and Blue's decisions to support Watkins's campaign or promote his career, which they had every right to do. Rather, the concern is with the prosecutor himself and his apparent eagerness to curry Blue's favor, even going so far as to explicitly suggest \"[t]here could be an indictment or are you still interested,\" while knowing of the ongoing $50 million fee dispute between Blue and Hill. Further, Watkins was alerted to the alleged mortgage fraud by Hill's father, rather than a crime victim, and the record contains the testimony of career prosecutors, whom the record does not reflect solicited or otherwise received improper influence, as to the tenuous nature of the case against Hill. From these facts, I agree with the majority that the trial judge could have readily based her decision on the grounds of vindictive prosecution and conflict of interest, given the competing interests of which Watkins appears to have been solicitous. But I believe that the due process violation as recognized in\n   <em>\n    Massey Coal\n   </em>\n   could serve as an independent and direct ground for dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massey Coal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653867\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/868/#p886\">\n    556 U.S. at 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653867\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/868/#p886\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As noted, the Court's opinion examines the issues largely through the lens of selective prosecution and conflict of interest jurisprudence developed before\n   <em>\n    Massey Coal\n   </em>\n   's due process holding.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653867\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/868/#p886\">\n    556 U.S. at 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653867\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/868/#p886\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I agree that those cases fit our situation, though less directly than\n   <em>\n    Massey Coal\n   </em>\n   's standard of objectivity. On this latter standard, with our own jurisdiction, I believe it to be useful to examine how the question of dismissal with or without prejudice has been addressed in other jurisdictions that have confronted prosecutorial misconduct in a variety of settings, including a denial of due process. As detailed below, those cases can be read to support dismissal with prejudice where the misconduct is so egregious by its nature that a meaningful remedy is necessary to deter like misconduct or where, but for the misconduct, there would be no case to pursue. As either of those circumstances could be found to obtain here, we have no occasion to choose between them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The highest court in Massachusetts faced somewhat similar circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

It permits trial courts to dismiss indictments with prejudice under one of two theories: (1) \"flagrant\" government conduct that amounts to a due process violation that presumably requires dismissal with prejudice as a systemic deterrent or (2) as an expression of the court's supervisory powers to remedy a violation of a recognized statutory or constitutional right, to preserve judicial integrity by ensuring that a conviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before the jury, and to deter future illegal conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

GOV'T CODE ANN. \u00a7 41.001 (requiring district attorneys to be licensed attorneys). Where, as here, the prosecutor's decision to seek an indictment still reflects the kind of egregious misconduct that would serve as a basis for dismissal, the benefits of the deterrent would seem to outweigh the costs, particularly where the evidence before the tribunal would support the conclusion that the case would not have been pursued but for that misconduct. Further, prosecutors have considerable power and discretion in deciding not only\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   to pursue any criminal charges against a target but how many charges might be pursued among the ever expanding panoply of criminal statutory prohibitions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Paul H.

Her notes reflect that she told Pickett that after doing research, she did not see how she could prove his criminal case at that time. The judge asked Martin, \"The bank is not interested in prosecuting, and your client is not a victim; that's what you told Mr. Pickett?\" Martin responded, \"Yes.\" In addition, Martin later went back and added to her notes the following: that she had talked to Pickett multiple times since her original note and that he was okay with not indicting \"for the trust as a victim\" and going forward with indictments listing the bank as the victim.

The trial judge could have inferred that, but for the relationship Watkins nurtured with Blue, no prosecution would have been pursued. Also, and separately, the trial judge here could have readily concluded that simply returning the State and the defendant to the natural\n   <em>\n    status quo ante\n   </em>\n   would have resulted in no prosecution at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was not a case in which\n   a crime victim or the police brought forward a charge that was thereafter mishandled by an overly aggressive or inept prosecutor.
