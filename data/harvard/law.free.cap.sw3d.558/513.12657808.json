Gaertner, Jr., Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   This case presents the issue of whether a trial court may constitutionally allow an unrepresented defendant to waive his right to counsel when the trial court at the same time has reason to doubt the defendant's competency to stand trial and has not yet resolved that issue. We conclude a trial court cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Darrell I. Bolden (Defendant) appeals the judgment entered upon his conviction of two counts of first-degree robbery and two counts of armed criminal action. His primary argument concerns the trial court's decision to allow him to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   in this case. We note at the outset the irony here: during the pendency of the present case, Defendant was convicted of multiple counts of first-degree robbery and armed criminal action in St. Louis County, after a trial at which he was represented by counsel because the trial court denied his request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant appealed his St. Louis County convictions to this Court, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and this Court affirmed. Now we address the opposite claim by Defendant: that the trial court here erred in\n   <em>\n    granting\n   </em>\n   his request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n   We consider the limited question of whether Defendant should have been permitted to waive counsel while unrepresented during the pendency of his competency determination, prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Due to the overriding importance of the right to counsel generally, and specifically as it relates to the determination of a defendant's competency, not only in this case but in every case, we cannot overlook the violation of Defendant's right to counsel during his competency determination, regardless of the fact that it was Defendant's desire to remain unrepresented and that the ultimate result of the competency determination confirmed his desire that he could proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n   However, we do not find that a new trial is necessary at this point, given that Defendant did undergo a competency examination at the time of the determination of whether he could proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n   We remand to the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the sufficiency of the competency report, with Defendant represented by counsel, and to make a new finding as to whether Defendant was competent to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   at the time of his trial in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State charged Defendant with two counts of first-degree robbery and two counts of armed criminal action based on an incident that took place on May 5, 2012. Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the evidence showed that Defendant entered a Check n' Go store in St. Peters holding a gun and wearing a heavy coat and a ski mask. There were two women inside, one was an employee and one was a customer. The customer had placed\n   $400 in cash on the counter to pay for a wire transfer transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant ordered the women to get behind the counter and forced them to kneel. He took the $400 on the counter and removed an additional $1500 in cash from the cash drawer. He demanded that the employee open the safe. She entered the code for the safe and informed Defendant that the safe had a delay and would not open for five minutes. Defendant left the store, and the employee pressed the panic button to summon the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Police were not initially able to determine Defendant's identity, but approximately four months after the robbery occurred, they received information implicating Defendant. At that time, Defendant was detained in the St. Louis County Jail on other charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After waiving his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, Defendant admitted to the robbery, gave a written statement, and made notations on still photographs from the store's surveillance video indicating that he was the man who committed the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While awaiting trial, it appears Defendant was not represented by an attorney, and nothing in the trial court's docket sheet indicated whether Defendant had appointed counsel during the several months before the trial court considered his request to waive counsel. The reason for this is unclear from the record, but Defendant filed several motions and letters with the court\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   over an approximately nine-month period between his indictment and a pretrial hearing on May 5, 2014. At that May 5, 2014 hearing, the trial court took up Defendant's request to waive counsel and represent himself. After informing Defendant of the ranges of punishment he faced for each offense if convicted, and after ensuring Defendant understood that he was entitled to appointment of a public defender as well as what the assistance of an attorney might provide to his defense, the trial court stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court finds the Defendant has made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to assistance of an attorney. The Court permits the Defendant to waive the right to representation and the Court considers whether to-whether or not to permit the [D]efendant to try without legal counsel depending on the current motion\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the State has filed. ... [T]he State has filed an order for psychiatric examination of [Defendant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court heard argument from both the State and Defendant on the State's motion, and proceeded to grant the State's motion, giving the following rationale;\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [T]his isn't to be demeaning to you[, b]ut because ... there[ are] four life terms hanging over your head, I don't find your behavior at this point to be particularly rational in denying the help that an attorney could give you. So I'm going to order a psychiatric examination, and the Department of Mental Health will prepare that and then report back to me the detailed findings as to whether or not you have a mental disease or defect and whether or not... you have or lack the capacity to understand the proceedings to assist in your defense. And a recommendation to me as to whether you have mental fitness to proceed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After receiving the report from this examination, the trial court followed the report's recommendation and found Defendant competent. The trial court allowed Defendant to proceed to trial without an attorney. The jury found Defendant guilty of all charges, and the trial court sentenced him as a prior and persistent offender to consecutive terms of life in prison for each count of first-degree robbery, and 25 years for each count of armed criminal action. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant raises two points on appeal. First, Defendant argues that the trial court erred in allowing him to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   before determining he was mentally competent to stand trial. In Point II, Defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the charges against him due to excessive delay by the State in bringing him to trial, thus violating federal and Missouri constitutional protections, as well as Missouri statute, Section 545.780, RSMo. (2000). We discuss each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Point I\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court violated his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 18(a) of the Missouri Constitution, by determining he had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel before ordering an examination under Section 552.020, RSMo. (Supp. 2011), to determine Defendant's mental fitness to proceed, which left him deprived of his right to counsel during his competency determination. On this point, we must remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As an initial matter, Defendant requests that we review his claim for plain error under Rule 30.20\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   because his error is unpreserved. \"A constitutional claim must be made at the first opportunity to be preserved for review.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   , however, the defendant had standby counsel, who included the claim that the trial court erred in allowing the defendant to represent himself in the motion for new trial; thus, this Court concluded the issue was raised at the first opportunity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845568\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/469/921/#p925\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845568\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/469/921/#p925\">\n    at 925-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the trial court eventually appointed standby counsel for Defendant's trial, but this issue was not included in his motion for new trial. Thus, we find it was not preserved in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Generally, our review of unpreserved error under Rule 30.20 is a two-step process.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We note the State's argument that the trial court did not order the examination to determine Defendant's threshold competency to stand trial or waive counsel, but rather did so out of concern for Defendant's ability to conduct a trial on his own, in other words, that the trial court was seeking to determine only the third type of competency we identified above, and had implicitly found Defendant to be competent to stand trial and waive counsel. However, the trial court also told Defendant that it would receive a report regarding whether \"you have or lack the capacity to understand the proceedings to assist in your defense.\" The trial court's order was for a report pursuant to Section 552.020, which relates to the threshold competency standard to stand trial and to waive counsel. Thus, even assuming part of the trial court's concern was Defendant's ability to conduct his own trial without an attorney, the trial court also expressed concern regarding Defendant's threshold competency. Thus, the issue remains whether Defendant was competent to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   at that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While we find no Missouri or United States Supreme Court case dealing with facts similar to those here, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit addressed a similar situation in\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

Thus, the trial court should have appointed counsel to represent Defendant at least until it had resolved the question of Defendant's competency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

But our case here is very unique in that Defendant was unrepresented. Defendants usually have or are appointed counsel before arraignment and certainly by the time a trial court is considering a waiver of counsel or determining the defendant's competency. Here, Defendant was unrepresented at the time he waived counsel and underwent a subsequent psychiatric examination, and therein lies the cardinal problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Turning to the remedy, Defendant argues he is entitled to a new trial due to the deprivation of counsel here. While this is often the appropriate remedy where a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is violated, we do not find such a remedy necessary under the circumstances here. This case is distinct from others where though it was clear the defendant's competency was in question, the trial court never ordered a competency evaluation. In such cases, courts rightly find that there are difficulties in determining competency retroactively and often a new trial is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pate v.

On September 13, 2013, Defendant filed his first request for a speedy trial. Thereafter, he filed a number of motions, including requests for discovery, motions to suppress, and motions to quash the indictment. Defendant also wrote several letters to the trial court during the pendency of his case. It also appears from the docket sheet that there was a problem in serving Defendant's warrant. The warrant was withdrawn in November of 2013 and eventually served on April 21, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On May 5, 2014, the court held a status hearing at which it considered Defendant's waiver of counsel and granted it. As discussed above, the trial court then ordered a psychiatric examination to determine Defendant's competency. The trial court also considered Defendant's motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial. The State argued that there had been other pending robbery charges against Defendant in St. Louis County that had been\n   disposed of in the meantime. The trial court denied Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On August 11, 2014, the trial court held a hearing on a motion for continuance filed by the State requesting additional time to complete the psychiatric examination. The State claimed that Defendant had asked the doctor conducting the examination to review additional records, which Defendant disputed, but Defendant consented to the continuance until September 15, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On September 15, 2014, the trial court issued an order noting that the State was contacted by the Missouri State Hospital, which said they needed additional time to complete their report of Defendant's psychiatric examination. The trial court continued the case for good cause shown until November 17, 2014. On that date, the trial court found the report had not yet been completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On January 23, 2015, the trial court held a hearing at which it determined that Defendant was competent to stand trial based on the report of Defendant's psychiatric evaluation. The case proceeded to trial as scheduled on March 3, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In weighing the reasons for delay here, it appears that between the indictment on August 23, 2013, and the trial court's ordering of the psychiatric examination on May 5, 2014, several things contributed to the delay. Defendant had other charges pending in St. Louis County, which were resolved during this time period. This is a justifiable reason for delay and is not weighed heavily against the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875080\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/458/304/#p313\">\n    458 S.W.3d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, Defendant filed a number of motions during this time. While he has a legal right to do so, the delay caused by adjudication of these motions is attributable to Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875080\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/458/304/#p313\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875080\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/458/304/#p313\">\n    at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, during this time period, it appears at least some of the delay is due to the State's inability to serve the arrest warrant. This delay is attributable to the State, but because there is no evidence the State did so deliberately to hamper the defense, it is weighed less heavily against the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Fleer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10009865\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/851/582/#p597\">\n    851 S.W.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 597 (Mo. App. E.D. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The further delay between May 5, 2014, and Defendant's trial on March 3, 2015, was entirely due to the psychiatric examination of Defendant. This is a justifiable reason for delay and, although weighed against the State, is weighed less heavily.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Owsley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11877342\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/959/789/#p794\">\n    959 S.W.2d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 794 (Mo. banc 1997) (noting only delay attributable to State was request for competency exam and extension of time for completion of exam).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Weighing all of these, some of the delay is due to Defendant's pretrial motions, but beyond that, the reasons for delay were largely neutral and justifiable. Though such delays are weighed against the State, we see no delay that should weigh heavily against the State due to any deliberate attempt to hamper the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The third factor is Defendant's assertion of his right to a speedy trial. Here, Defendant made multiple requests for a speedy trial, beginning on September 13, 2013. He asserted his right early in the proceedings, and this factor is therefore weighed in his favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The lack of evidence of prejudice weighs heavily in favor of the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8212372\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/256/210/#p216\">\n    256 S.W.3d at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Given all of the foregoing, particularly persuaded that Defendant was not prejudiced here by any delay, we find Defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated. The trial court did not err in failing to dismiss the charges against Defendant for this reason. Point denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The trial court did not err in failing to dismiss the charges against Defendant for any violation of Defendant's right to a speedy trial, and we affirm the trial court's judgment in this respect. However, the trial court plainly erred in permitting Defendant while unrepresented to waive his right to counsel while at the same time finding that his competency was at issue. This constitutes a denial of Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel during the resolution of the issue of Defendant's competency. However, because the trial court did order a psychiatric evaluation under Section 552.020 of Defendant at the time, we remand to the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the sufficiency of the competency report, with Defendant represented by counsel, and to enter an order consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   AFFIRMED IN PART; REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   James M.
