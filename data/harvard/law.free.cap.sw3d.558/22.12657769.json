Russell, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Board of Trustees of the Missouri Petroleum Storage Tank Insurance Fund, by and through the Missouri attorney general (collectively \"the State\"), appeals the circuit court's judgment dismissing its claims of breach of contract and, in the alternative, unjust enrichment. Respondent Pilot Travel Centers, LLC, argues the State's appeal is untimely and must be dismissed. In the alternative, it contends the circuit court correctly determined neither the Board nor the attorney general possessed standing to bring this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Court finds the appeal is timely and the attorney general has authority to file this action on behalf of the Board, which has standing to sue. The circuit court's judgment of dismissal is reversed and the case is remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The legislature established the Petroleum Storage Tank Insurance Fund to provide owners of underground storage tanks insurance against petroleum spills or leaks. Section 319.129,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   To manage the general administration of the Fund, section 319.129.4 establishes a Board of Trustees. The Board is responsible for \"the proper operation of the [F]und, including all decisions relating to payments from the [F]und.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Participation in the Fund is voluntary, section 319.131.1, and storage tank owners who seek coverage must apply for admission and pay participation fees before receiving Fund benefits. Section 319.131.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Williams TravelCenters, Inc., purchased insurance through the Fund for its service station in Higginsville. As a participant, Williams was subject to a participation agreement, which included a subrogation clause providing that if Williams ever incurred a claim arising out of a petroleum spill that the Fund helped remediate, Williams would assign any legal rights it had against the responsible party to the Board and assist the Board in pursuing the claim. Specifically, the subrogation clause stated Williams would \"cooperate with [the Board] in the investigation, settlement or defense\" of any claim and \"assist [the Board], upon [its] request, in the enforcement of any right\" against any third-party deemed to be at fault for the actionable petroleum spill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Williams later sold the Higginsville station to Pilot. Pilot assumed all duties under the participation agreement. It continued to annually renew its insurance coverage and reaffirm its participation in the Fund. When Pilot later discovered a petroleum spill at its service station, it filed 24 reimbursement requests, totaling\n   $732,932.30, for costs associated with remediation and cleanup. The Board honored these claims using Fund moneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   An investigation determined the spill was caused by a defective pipe manufactured by Environ Products, Inc., and the Board, in preparation for its anticipated lawsuit against the company, contacted Pilot for assistance. Pilot failed to respond to all communications from the Board. Having received no response from Pilot, the Board filed a products liability lawsuit against Environ just before the expiration of the statute of limitations. Pilot again failed to respond to the Board's continued requests for assistance and its request that Pilot sign a standstill agreement relinquishing any future legal right of action against Environ. Having no other choice, the Board dismissed its lawsuit against Environ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Board, by and through the attorney general, then sued Pilot, raising claims of breach of contract and, in the alternative, unjust enrichment, \"arising from Pilot's refusal to cooperate and assist in the lawsuit against Environ.\" Pilot filed two motions to dismiss the lawsuit, one alleging lack of standing and the other alleging failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 22, 2016, the circuit court sustained Pilot's motion to dismiss for lack of standing, determining neither the Board nor the attorney general had authority to bring the lawsuit. The circuit court found the Board lacked standing because there was no specific statutory authority, express or implied, empowering it to maintain the civil action against Pilot. Further, the circuit court ruled the attorney general could not sue on behalf of the Board because the Fund did not implicate \"the rights and interests of the state.\" Section 27.060.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State timely filed an authorized after-trial motion on July 22. It requested the court \"amend its judgment by vacating it\" in light of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Koster v. ConocoPhillips Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6783881\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/493/397/\">\n    493 S.W.3d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2016), which was decided days after the circuit court's dismissal. The State later argued that another recently decided case,\n   <em>\n    City of Harrisonville v. McCall Service Stations\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777270\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/495/738/\">\n    495 S.W.3d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2016), also supported its arguments. According to the State, these cases should have prompted the circuit court to vacate its judgment and allow the case to proceed on the merits. On October 11-81 days after dismissing the State's case-the circuit court vacated its order of dismissal with a docket entry labeled \"Order to Vacate/Set Aside.\" Specifically, the order stated: \"Judgment set aside. Revised judgment due 10/25/16. [Comments] by State 10 days later.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Several months later, on January 24, 2017, the circuit court entered a second judgment-an \"amended judgment of dismissal.\" In the second judgment, the court \"grant[ed] the State's Motion to Amend Judgment Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 78.04, in part, by setting aside its June 22, 2016 Judgment of Dismissal and amending it to address the\n   <em>\n    ConocoPhillips\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    City of Harrisonville\n   </em>\n   decisions.\" The second judgment reiterated the State's lack of standing to sue.

Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094661\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/392/446/#p452\">\n    392 S.W.3d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452 (Mo. banc 2013). To be timely, the notice of appeal must be filed within 10 days after the judgment becomes final. Section 512.050.

Truong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316028\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/361/400/#p403\">\n    361 S.W.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403 (Mo. banc 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Timeliness of the State's Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pilot argues the State failed to timely appeal the circuit court's June 22 judgment of dismissal. It contends that judgment became final pursuant to Rule 81.05 when the circuit court failed to rule on the State's after-trial motion within 90 days. And because the State failed to timely appeal the June 22 judgment, the argument follows, this case is not properly before this Court. The State, however, contends the June 22 judgment never became final or appealable as the circuit court ruled on its motion on October 11, within the 90-day required period. The October 11 docket entry was labeled \"Order to Vacate/Set Aside.\" A new judgment-entered on January 24-was the operative final judgment, which the State appealed in a timely fashion. For the reasons set forth below, the case is properly before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Governing Rules\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Two procedural rules, in particular, are at the heart of the parties' arguments: Rule 75.01 and Rule 81.05. Rule 75.01 allows trial courts to \"retain control[ ] over judgments during the [30]-day period after entry of judgment and may, after giving the parties an opportunity to be heard and for good cause, vacate, reopen, correct, amend, or modify its judgment within that time.\" Once the rule's 30-day window has expired, the judgment becomes final if neither party has filed an authorized after-trial motion. Rule 81.05(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   If any after-trial motions have been filed, the second rule-Rule 81.05-governs. In the event of a proper after-trial motion, the judgment will not become final until the earlier of \"(A) [90] days from the date the last timely motion was filed, on which date all motions not ruled shall be deemed overruled,\" or \"(B) If all motions have been ruled, then the date of ruling of the last motion to be ruled or [30] days after entry of judgment, whichever is later.\" Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A)-(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   These two rules, however, do not confer identical powers to the circuit court. Under Rule 75.01, a circuit court may-for\n   <em>\n    any reason\n   </em>\n   supported by \"good cause\"-amend or modify its previously entered judgment, regardless of whether a party requested such modification or amendment. Rule 81.05 is more restrictive. \"Once the thirty day period in Rule 75.01 expires, a trial court's authority to grant relief is constrained by and limited to the grounds raised in a timely filed, authorized after-trial motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Massman Constr.

The court of appeals in\n   <em>\n    Steiferman\n   </em>\n   erroneously declared this principle without the guidance of any supporting authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The State relies on\n   <em>\n    Steiferman\n   </em>\n   to support its argument that the circuit court had authority to vacate its June 22 judgment because \"Rule 81.05 only extends the length of the court's jurisdiction.\" Yet it does more-Rule 81.05 also restricts the circuit court's authority to change its judgment, in any way, by limiting the court's scope to those grounds raised in a timely filed after-trial motion.\n   <em>\n    Massman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020697\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/914/801/#p802\">\n    914 S.W.2d at 802-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As explained below, the procedural posture of this case leads this Court to find the appeal timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Legal Effect of the Circuit Court's Rulings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The circuit court entered its first judgment on June 22, dismissing the State's claims with prejudice for want of standing. One month later, on July 22, the State timely filed an authorized after-trial motion in which it requested the court \"amend its judgment by vacating it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A), the circuit court had 90 days to rule on the State's motion. Otherwise, it would be deemed overruled as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 11-81 days after the State filed its motion and nine days before a ruling was due under Rule 81.05-the circuit court ruled on the State's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court created a docket entry labeled \"Order to Vacate/Set Aside.\" The accompanying order specifically stated, \"Judgment set aside.\" To \"set aside\" means \"to annul or vacate.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1580 (10th ed. 2014). This action was a proper exercise of the circuit court's authority under Rule 81.05 as the court granted all and only the relief requested by the State, which was essentially to vacate the judgment and allow the case to proceed, and it did so within its 90-day limitation. As such, the State's motion was sustained by the October 11 order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 81.05(a)(2);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10020697\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/914/801/#p802\">\n    914 S.W.2d at 802-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to the dissent, the October 11 order did not grant the relief requested by the State but instead \"set[ ] a timetable for the parties to submit proposed amended judgments, with Respondent's proposal due on October 25 and the State's response due 10 days later.\" Op. at 34. Indeed, there\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   some future action to be\n   taken after the October 11 order, as the order indicated a \"revised judgment [was] due 10/25/16\" and scheduled a case status review weeks after that. And as the dissent acknowledges, the parties complied with that order. Pilot filed a proposed amended judgment on October 25, and the State responded to this proposal three days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With this continuing litigation, it is evident the parties understood the October 11 order constituted a ruling on the State's motion, as it vacated the June 22 judgment. Had the circuit court not done so, there would have been no further action for the parties or the court to take. The State's motion would have been overruled by operation of law on October 20, 90 days after the State's motion, and the June 22 judgment would have become the final judgment. To be sure, the Rule 81.05 window created by the State's motion did not expire because the October 11 order vacated the first judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that point, the 90-day time limit imposed by Rule 81.05 ceased to exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There was no further action to be taken on the June 22 judgment because, after the October 11 order, the June 22 judgment did not exist. In fact,\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   judgment existed until the circuit court entered its second judgment in January. Contrary to Pilot's suggestion, the June 22 judgment never became final, and the circuit court never lost jurisdiction over the matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Schierhoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"418663\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/103/47/\">\n    103 Mo. 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20S.W.%20151\">\n    15 S.W. 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 152 (Mo. 1891) (\"A court does not lose jurisdiction of a case till final judgment be rendered.\"). As such, the circuit court retained jurisdiction to enter the eventual January 24 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This is not to say, however, that the procedural posture of this case is without missteps. After the circuit court entered its first judgment on June 22, the State filed a motion to amend the judgment by vacating it. The circuit court timely ruled on the motion in its October 11 order, which granted the full relief requested by the State and provided the circuit court would later enter a revised judgment. When the circuit court entered the second, amended judgment of dismissal on January 24, it was 186 days after the State filed its after-trial motion. This attempted ruling was well outside the 90-day window set out in Rule 78.06.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Simply put, though the circuit court retained jurisdiction over the case, it was not authorized to \"rule on\" the State's after-trial motion when it entered its January 24 judgment. That judgment, therefore, is voidable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [When] the power of the court to act is subject to certain limitations, named, then the judgment of the court rendered in violation of the things stated, or contrary to the limitations named, then such order or judgment of the court is not\n   void for want of jurisdiction, but voidable only....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The Attorney General May Sue on Behalf of the Board\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The State and Pilot both present arguments as to whether the attorney general\n   <em>\n    himself\n   </em>\n   has standing to initiate a lawsuit against Pilot in this matter. The State argues the circuit court erred in finding the attorney general lacked standing to sue Pilot on the Board's behalf. The circuit court determined the attorney general possessed no power to bring a lawsuit because the legislature has not explicitly delegated any authority to the attorney general to bring such a case and because, according to the circuit court, the Fund implicates no \"rights and interests of the state.\" Section 27.060.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The parties' focus on whether the attorney general\n   <em>\n    himself\n   </em>\n   has standing independent of its authority to bring suit\n   <em>\n    on behalf of\n   </em>\n   the Board is a red herring.

The State claims entering into subrogation contracts with Fund participants is an \"inherent task[ ]\" in the general administration of the Fund. Pilot's arguments, meanwhile, are twofold. It first argues the Board lacks standing because no statute gives the Board the authority to sue other entities, such as the one at the heart of this case.

For ease and clarity, this Court addresses Pilot's second argument first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Pilot contends the Board lacks authority to enter into subrogation contracts because no statute provides such a right, expressly or impliedly.

Rather, it is logically vested with implicit contracting powers beyond those expressly listed in chapter 319.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   It is the Board's responsibility, as custodian of the Fund, to oversee its facilitation. \"[T]he Fund is merely an account and\n   <em>\n    only its Board of Trustees\n   </em>\n   is responsible for the administration and operation of the Fund.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777270\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/495/738/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777270\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/495/738/\">\n    at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Under\n   <em>\n    Massman\n   </em>\n   , the only action the circuit court was authorized to take on October 11 was to sustain (or overrule) the state's motion on the grounds set forth in that motion. The state's motion asked the circuit court to \"amend its judgment by vacating and allowing this case to proceed with respect to Count I and Count II of the second amended petition,\" and-at first glance-the circuit court's October 11 order appears to grant that relief in that it states the \"Judgment [dated June 22, 2016, is] set aside.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   But this interpretation is belied by the January 24, 2017, \"Amended Judgment.\" There, the circuit court-in multiple places-expressly states it is ruling on the state's motion dated July 22, 2016. It is certain that by January 24, 2017, the state's motion was no longer before the circuit court. Either the circuit court sustained that motion on October 11, 2016, or the motion was overruled by operation of law nine days later (i.e., on the 90th day after it was filed). Either way, on January 24, 2017, the circuit court could not have been ruling-as the amended judgment states it was-on the state's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   So, either this Court must give effect to the October 11 docket entry and treat the amended judgment as though it were entered\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   (notwithstanding the plain and repeated language of the amended judgment stating the circuit court was ruling on the state's motion), or this Court must take the October 11 docket entry for what it very plainly was, i.e., an attempt to extend the circuit court's time to rule on the state's motion beyond the 90-day window allowed by Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A). This latter approach is the more faithful to the language and actions of the circuit court, and a closer look at the October 11 order shows this is what the circuit court was attempting to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The October 11 order did not-and was never intended to-grant the relief sought by the state's motion on the grounds asserted therein, which is the only action (other than overruling the motion outright) the circuit court could take at that time under\n   <em>\n    Massman\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the October 11 order sets a timetable for the parties to submit proposed amended judgments, with Pilot's proposal due October 25 and the state's response due 10 days later. The parties complied. Pilot filed a proposed amended judgment on October 25. On October 28, the state informed the circuit court it disagreed with the proposed amended judgment but offered only minimal changes to it to \"provide accuracy and consistency in terminology.\" Thereafter, the docket sheet reveals no further actions until, nearly three months later, the circuit court signed and entered the amended judgment dated January 24, 2017, stating the circuit court was \"setting aside its June 22, 2016 Judgment of Dismissal and amending it to address the\n   <em>\n    ConocoPhillips\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    City of Harrisonville\n   </em>\n   decisions.\" Plainly, the circuit court's October 11 order improperly attempted to extend either its authority to act under Rule 75.01 (which had lapsed 81 days earlier, i.e., the day the state's motion was filed) or its authority to sustain the state's motion (which, under\n   <em>\n    Massman\n   </em>\n   and Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A), would lapse on October 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Massman\n   </em>\n   , there is no action a circuit court can take to extend its time for acting pursuant to Rule 75.01 beyond 30 days, or to extend its time for acting on an authorized post-trial motion beyond the 90-day period set forth in Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A). Accordingly, the circuit court's attempt to achieve one or the other (or both) with the October 11 order was for naught. Because the circuit court neither sustained the state's motion on the ground(s) presented nor overruled that motion outright, that motion was overruled by operation of Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A) on the 90th day after it was filed. The state then had 10 days from that date to file its notice of appeal challenging the June 22, 2016, judgment. Because it failed to do so, this appeal should be dismissed as untimely filed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    All statutory references are to RSMo 2000 unless otherwise specified.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to article V, section 10 of the Missouri Constitution.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Pilot does not argue the State's motion was not an authorized after-trial motion.

That the January 24 judgment incorrectly stated the circuit court was \"ruling on\" the previously disposed after-trial motion does not change the fact that a prior ruling occurred on that motion when the circuit court vacated the judgment in its October 11 order.
