Page, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We accepted this appeal to determine whether a notice that the State intended to seek enhanced sentencing in one case is sufficient to provide notice that the State intended to seek enhanced sentencing in a subsequent unrelated case involving the same defendant. The defendant, Jimmy Williams, was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced as a career offender to serve fifteen years in the Tennessee Department of Correction. At trial, the defendant unsuccessfully objected to his classification as a career offender based on the State's failure to file a timely notice of its intent to seek enhanced sentencing, and the Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with the trial court's ruling. He now appeals the sentencing issue and also argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. We hold that the State must file a timely and proper notice in each case for which it intends to seek enhanced punishment. Consequently, the defendant in this case did not receive proper notice of the State's intention, and therefore, the trial court should have sentenced him as a Range I, standard offender. However, the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction; therefore, we affirm the defendant's judgment of conviction for aggravated assault but modify his sentence and remand for entry of a corrected judgment form in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 27, 2008, Memphis police from the Airways precinct responding to a 9-1-1 call encountered a disheveled woman in a field behind a Kroger grocery store. She reported that she had been assaulted by a man who was then fleeing the area. Onlookers identified the man as the defendant, Jimmy Williams. The police chased the defendant on foot and took him into custody. However, the police, in consultation with the district attorney general's office, decided not to pursue charges against him. Several years later, the district attorney general's office sought charges in this case because of information that surfaced in an unrelated investigation. On August 26, 2014, the grand jury returned its indictment charging the defendant with two alternate counts of aggravated rape, and the case proceeded to trial on February 2, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At trial, the victim testified that she first encountered the defendant in the very early morning hours of July 27, 2008, at a Mapco gas station. He mentioned to her that he knew a shortcut she could use to get home, and when she saw him a second time later in the morning, she let him show her the shortcut. The victim testified that the shortcut was a well-traveled path through a field behind Kroger. She told the defendant that she did not want to go down the path with him, but he grabbed her and told her she was not going anywhere. The victim explained that she had torn ligaments in her knee and could not run away. The victim said that over the next two hours, the defendant beat her in the head with his closed fists, struck her with a box cutter handle, and forced her to perform fellatio twice. She recalled striking him with a glass bottle, and although she did not remember the glass breaking, she believed that she must have cut him because she later learned that spots of his blood were on her shirt. The victim testified that men passing by saw her and the defendant. The ordeal ended when the police arrived, causing the defendant to flee. Subsequently, the victim went to the hospital with head injuries and black eyes and then to the Rape Crisis Center for examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The victim admitted that she had pleaded guilty to theft of property more than thirty-five times. She also admitted that she had been selling drugs the night that the defendant assaulted her. She confirmed that the defendant did not vaginally or anally penetrate her, despite her statement to the police to the contrary. She blamed her lack of specific memories on her head trauma and the passage of time. The victim also made clear that she was not pleased with the way that the police handled her case or the way they treated her. She stated that she believed her statements to the police were not faithfully transcribed in the written statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Two passers-by, Billy Mukes and Horace Granger, testified about the events of the morning of July 27, 2008. Both men lived near the field behind Kroger, and they said they heard a woman screaming on the morning in question. They walked into the field and saw a man and woman sitting together. Mr. Mukes said that he saw \"a man and woman sitting on the ground. He had his arm around her neck. But after she [saw] us, she wasn't screaming and hollering. She quit.\" The men left the field, but when they heard the woman screaming again, Mr. Mukes called 9-1-1. Shortly thereafter, they saw the defendant, whom they both personally knew, running away from the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   One of the police officers who responded to Mr. Mukes' 9-1-1 call described the victim as \"shaken up ... real distressed and just real dirty, like she had been ... wrestling or something like that.\" She had abrasions on her skin and complained that she had a head injury. Crime scene investigator Charles Cathey testified that he found a box cutter in the field that might have had a spot of blood on it. Mr. Cathey also photographed the victim at Methodist Central Hospital and testified that the victim \"had bruising on her face, neck and arm.\" The nurse who examined the victim at the Rape Crisis Center stated that she had multiple injuries on her face, arms, and upper legs. The nurse collected swabs from the victim's mouth, anus, and vagina for later testing. The serology and DNA analysis expert testified that the swabs collected from the victim during the sexual assault examination were negative for semen and the spots of blood on the victim's shirt were consistent with the defendant's DNA. The expert further testified that she found DNA from two individuals on the box cutter recovered from the scene. She\n   was able to exclude the victim as a contributor to the DNA from the box cutter, but the results were inconclusive as to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the close of proof, the defendant requested that aggravated assault be included as a lesser charge in the jury instructions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in the discussion pertaining to that request, the trial court informed the defendant that if he were convicted of aggravated assault, he would be a career offender. The case was submitted to the jury, and the jury began its deliberations at 1:39 p.m. on February 4, 2016. The State filed its notice of intent to seek enhanced punishment at 1:45 p.m. that day. After continuing its deliberations on the morning of February 5, 2016, the jury acquitted the defendant of aggravated rape on both counts but found him guilty of aggravated assault as a lesser-included offense on Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the State submitted the presentence report as Exhibit A and certified copies of the defendant's felony convictions as Exhibits B and C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant submitted as Exhibit D the State's notice of intent to seek enhanced punishment, which was filed on February 4, 2016, after the jury began its deliberations. Sua sponte, the trial court submitted as Exhibit E the State's notice of intent to seek enhanced punishment filed in case number 12-06403 on January 27, 2014. The State contended that the defendant should be sentenced as a career offender, but the defendant countered that, because the State had not filed a pre-trial notice of intent to seek enhanced punishment, he should be sentenced as a Range I standard offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its oral sentencing findings, the trial court noted that the defendant had the requisite prior convictions to qualify as a career offender and stated that in a prior case, the court had discussed the defendant's offender classification with him and the State had filed a proper notice. The court further noted that the State's notice in the present case was not filed until after the jury had already begun deliberating, at which point the procedural remedy-a reasonable continuance pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.3 -was no longer viable. The trial court then determined that the defendant had sufficient notice of the State's intent to seek sentence enhancement because he had both actual and constructive notice via the notice filed in the other case and through knowing his own record and the court's informing him of his offender classification. The trial court also found that the defendant had not shown that he was prejudiced by the untimely filing of the State's notice. The trial court then sentenced the defendant as a career offender to fifteen years for the Class C felony of aggravated assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeals, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for aggravated assault and that the trial court erred by sentencing him as a\n   career offender.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , No. W2016-00946-CCA-R3-CD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204079514\">\n    2017 WL 4079514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-7 (Tenn. Crim. App. Sept. 13, 2017). The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed both his conviction and his sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. The defendant applied to this Court for permission to appeal, which we accepted to consider as an issue of first impression whether a notice to seek enhanced punishment filed in one case provided fair notice to the defendant that the trial court would sentence him as a career offender in a subsequent case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The first issue the defendant presented for our review was whether the evidence adduced at trial supported his conviction for aggravated assault. The standard for appellate review of a claim challenging the sufficiency of the State's evidence is \"whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Because a jury conviction removes the presumption of innocence that the defendant enjoyed at trial and replaces it with one of guilt at the appellate level, the burden of proof shifts from the State to the convicted defendant, who must demonstrate to this Court that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury's findings.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318056\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/354/718/#p729\">\n    354 S.W.3d at 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court determined that the defendant was not a favorable candidate for alternative sentencing and that confinement was necessary to avoid depreciating the seriousness of the offense. This determination is supported by the record. The State's notice of enhancement factors includes, among other factors, that the defendant \"has a previous history of criminal convictions or criminal behavior, in addition to those necessary to establish the appropriate range.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-114\">\n    Tenn.
