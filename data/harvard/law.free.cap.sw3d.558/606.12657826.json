Bivins, C.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This appeal represents the third time, each after a trial on the merits, that we have addressed the facial constitutionality of Tennessee's lethal injection protocol. In both prior appeals, we upheld the particular protocol at issue. In this most recent litigation, the death-sentenced inmates challenge Tennessee's current three-drug protocol, which calls for the administration of midazolam followed by vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. The trial court dismissed the inmates' complaint for declaratory judgment. This Court, upon its own motion, assumed jurisdiction over the appeal. After our review of the record and applicable authority, we conclude that the inmates failed to carry their burden of showing availability of their proposed alternative method of execution-a one-drug protocol using pentobarbital-as required under current federal and Tennessee law. For this reason, we hold that the inmates failed to establish that the three-drug protocol constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or article I, section 16 of the Tennessee Constitution. This holding renders moot the majority of the other issues before us. The expedited appellate procedure has not denied the inmates due process, and they are not entitled to relief on their remaining issues. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Historical and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Since 2000, lethal injection has been the default method of execution in Tennessee.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thereafter, responses were filed in this Court opposing the State's motion to set the expedited execution dates in the eight capital cases. We denied the State's motion on March 15, 2018. That same day, we\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   set execution dates for two other Plaintiffs: October 11, 2018, for Edmund Zagorski; and December 6, 2018, for David Earl Miller.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Two days later, on July 5, 2018, TDOC revised the lethal injection protocol to eliminate the one-drug protocol as an alternative so that the three-drug protocol became the exclusive method of execution by lethal injection in Tennessee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A ten-day trial commenced on July 9, 2018. The Plaintiffs presented testimony from four experts: Craig Stevens, Ph.D., a neuropharmacologist; Dr. David Greenblatt, a clinical pharmacologist with particular expertise concerning midazolam ; Dr. Mark Edgar, a pathologist; and Dr. David Lubarsky, an anesthesiologist. The Plaintiffs also introduced testimony from twelve attorneys who had witnessed their respective clients' executions in other states. The Plaintiffs made an oral motion at the close of their proof to amend the pleadings to assert removal of vecuronium bromide from the three-drug protocol as a known, feasible, and available alternative method of execution. After a hearing the next day, the trial court denied the Plaintiffs' motion. In addition, the trial court clarified that, by express consent of the parties, the pleadings were amended to limit the claims to facial challenges to the constitutionality of the July 5, 2018 revised protocol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn.

Regarding the claims that the protocol, on its face, amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, the trial court found that the Plaintiffs failed to prove an essential element-that an available alternative method of execution exists-and, on this basis alone, their claims must be dismissed. Though not necessary for its ruling, the trial court also found that the Plaintiffs failed to prove the other essential element-that the three-drug protocol creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain. In addition, the trial court denied relief as to the Plaintiffs' other constitutional claims that included substantive due process, procedural due process, and access to the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Four days after the trial court filed its judgment, twenty-nine Plaintiffs (all of the original Plaintiffs except Mr. Miller, Mr. Sutton, Mr. West, and Mr. McKay) filed a notice of appeal in the Tennessee Court of Appeals.

As a preliminary matter, we address several threshold issues and a related issue concerning the trial court's refusal to add as-applied claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, the Plaintiffs argue that the availability requirement should not apply to them because of discovery disputes and \"state secrecy laws related to executions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2010-7-504\">\n    Tenn.

We decline to do so. In any event, the trial court properly balanced the propriety of discovery requests with the confidentiality provisions protecting the identity of those involved in executions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West v. Schofield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869295\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/113/#p128\">\n    460 S.W.3d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128 (Tenn. 2015) (setting forth balancing test).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, the Plaintiffs assert that they were denied notice and an opportunity to be heard on availability of an alternative method of execution because TDOC revised the lethal injection protocol on the eve of trial. Four of the Plaintiffs-David Earl Miller, Nicholas Todd Sutton, Stephen Michael West, and Larry McKay-filed a motion to reconsider the trial court's order clarifying that, by express consent of the parties, the pleadings were amended to conform to the evidence limiting the claims to facial challenges to the constitutionality of the July 5, 2018 revised protocol. They contended that the revision to the protocol constituted a substantial change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In denying the motion to reconsider, the trial court found that eliminating the alternative one-drug protocol was not a substantial change to the lethal injection protocol for purposes of this facial challenge. We agree. From the time of the filing of the original complaint on February 20, 2018, the method-of-execution claim: (1) challenged the three-drug protocol and (2) alleged a one-drug protocol using pentobarbital as an alternative method of execution. Availability in theory of pentobarbital, based solely on its status as an option in the lethal injection protocol prior to the revision on July 5, 2018, would not have satisfied the Plaintiffs' burden of proof. Furthermore, the State's February 15, 2018 motion, asking this Court to set execution dates in eight capital cases before June 1, 2018, because of ongoing difficulty in obtaining the necessary lethal injection drugs, put the Plaintiffs on notice that the three-drug protocol likely would be used.

The trial court found that \"they proceeded reasonably as department heads to delegate the task of investigating supplies of pentobarbital to a member of their staff.\" A PowerPoint presentation, introduced as part of trial exhibit 105, detailed those unsuccessful efforts. The trial court found \"that trial exhibit 105 and the testimony of the TDOC officials establish that Tennessee does not have access to and is unable to obtain [pentobarbital] with ordinary transactional effort.\" Our review of this finding of fact is accompanied by a presumption of correctness, unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn.

They also contend that the Defendants have (1) a physician willing to write a prescription for pentobarbital, (2) a pharmacy and pharmacist with the proper licensing to obtain pentobarbital, and (3) two contracts with two different compounding pharmacists to compound pentobarbital for executions. None of this evidence is relevant, however, if pentobarbital is not now available. The Plaintiffs' argument-that the Defendants acted in bad faith by choosing not to obtain pentobarbital when it was feasible and readily available-is totally inconsistent with the trial court's credibility determinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   We\n   conclude that the evidence does not preponderate against the trial court's finding that Tennessee does not have access to and is unable to obtain pentobarbital with ordinary transactional effort for use in lethal injections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In summary, we agree with the trial court's finding that pentobarbital-the only alternative method of execution that the Plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded-is not available for use in executions in Tennessee. Therefore, the Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of showing availability of their proposed alternative method of execution, as required under the\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court and recently adopted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    West v.

As we noted earlier, this requirement is an independent requirement, separate and apart from the requirement to prove that the protocol creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain. Therefore, for this reason, we hold that the Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden to establish that Tennessee's current three-drug lethal injection protocol constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or article 1, section 16 of the Tennessee Constitution. As a result, we need not address the Plaintiffs' claim that the three-drug protocol creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain.

For this reason, we hold that the Plaintiffs failed to establish that Tennessee's current three-drug lethal injection protocol constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution or article I, section 16 of the Tennessee Constitution. This holding renders moot the majority of their other issues.

Lee, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Petitioners, who have been sentenced to death, contend that the State's recently adopted lethal injection protocol violates their federal and state constitutional rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. On this important issue, the Petitioners are entitled to a fair and meaningful opportunity to be heard at trial and on appeal without regard to 1) the constitutionality of other lethal injection protocols the State has no plans to use; 2) the execution dates previously set by this Court for Petitioners Billy Ray\n   Irick (already executed), Edmund Zagorksi, and David Earl Miller;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 3) the length of the Petitioners' briefs or the extra minutes granted for oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The constitutionality of the State's current lethal injection protocol is a complicated issue, involving extensive expert testimony. Several factors, over which the Petitioners had little or no control, combined to deprive them of a fundamentally fair process. One significant factor is the Court's unfortunate rush to execute based on the perceived need to end this case before the executions of Petitioners Irick, Zagorski, and Miller. With the stroke of a pen and in the interest of fairness and justice, the Court could have reset these executions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   By putting this case on a rocket docket, the Court denied the Petitioners a fair and meaningful opportunity to be heard and jeopardized the public's confidence and trust in the impartiality and integrity of the judicial system. Today, the Court meets its self-imposed deadline by deciding this case before Zagorski's October 11 execution and Miller's December 6 execution-but at great cost. I cannot go along with the Court's decision because these proceedings have not been fundamentally fair to the Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For many years, the State's lethal injection protocol has been a moving target, with the Tennessee Department of Correction frequently changing its lethal injection protocols. On January 8, 2018, the Department adopted a new lethal injection protocol consisting of two options: 1) Protocol A, using compounded pentobarbital ; 2) Protocol B, using midazolam, vecuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. Ten days after the Department announced these protocols, this Court set Irick's execution date for August 9, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On February 20, 2018, the Petitioners filed a declaratory judgment action in the trial court, challenging the constitutionality of Protocol B, the new midazolam-based protocol. The Petitioners claimed that the midazolam-based protocol would cause them to suffer intolerable pain and that execution by Protocol A, pentobarbital, was an available, less painful execution alternative. The Petitioners, at the close of proof, moved to amend their pleadings to conform to the evidence to allege that a two-drug cocktail of midazolam and potassium chloride was an alternative method of execution. The trial court denied this request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Petitioners faced a steep uphill battle in their efforts to have the midazolam-based protocol declared unconstitutional. Their obstacles, which ultimately proved insurmountable, included 1) inconsistent and unworkable requirements imposed by\n   <em>\n    Glossip v.

The Petitioners presented expert testimony that the State's execution protocol of midazolam, vecuronium bromide, and potassium chloride will cause the inmate being executed to feel severe pain and terror. This is because midazolam has no analgesic effects and will not render the inmate insensate to pain; vecuronium bromide causes great anxiety, noxious stimulus, paralysis, and the feeling of suffocation-all \"quite horrific\"-and potassium chloride, which stops the heart, causes the inmate to have very painful feelings of burning upon injection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Despite this evidence, the trial court dismissed the Petitioners' case because they failed to prove the second\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   prong of an available alternative execution method that would have reduced a substantial risk of severe pain. This\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   requirement has been aptly described as \"perverse\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it replaces the Eighth Amendment's categorical prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment with a conditional one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Glossip,\n   </em>\n   even if the Petitioners establish that the State's execution method will cause them to experience needless suffering or intolerable pain, the State may still carry out the execution\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the Petitioners also prove an available alternative method for their own executions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Considering the Eighth Amendment's clear prohibition on \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" the focus here should have been on whether the Petitioners proved that the State's execution method was likely to cause needless suffering and pain. Yet the Petitioners' claims and evidence of intolerable pain and torture were not the basis of the trial court's decision and thus not reviewed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Not only is\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   's available alternative requirement perverse, it is also unworkable. In Tennessee, executions are cloaked in secrecy, which makes it difficult-if not impossible-for the Petitioners to establish an available alternative to the State's method of execution. Tennessee Code Annotated section 10-7-504(h) (Supp. 2017) protects the identity of individuals or entities directly involved in the execution process. The trial court here prohibited identification of the Department's agents who were involved in procuring execution drugs, such as pentobarbital, and of its potential suppliers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In addition to the heavy burden imposed by\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   and the cloak of secrecy surrounding executions, the Petitioners were operating under extraordinary time constraints because of the Court's scheduling of Irick's execution on August 9. After the Petitioners filed their challenge, the starting pistol was fired and the race to execute\n   began. The trial court had to fast-track the case so that the parties could present their evidence and the trial court could prepare and file findings of fact, conclusions of law, and its decision before the August execution date. The trial court set the trial to begin on July 9, 2018, giving the parties less than five months to effectively conduct written discovery, litigate discovery disputes, take discovery depositions, locate and retain expert witnesses, research legal issues, file trial briefs, and prepare for trial. The discovery schedule was so compressed that the trial court eliminated summary judgment as an option because the Petitioners lacked the time to complete discovery\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   respond to a motion for summary judgment. Sufficient time for investigation, research, and discovery was out of the question because of the looming execution date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The rush to execute here is in stark contrast to the measured way previous challenges to the State's lethal injection protocols have been handled. This case was pending in the trial court only 156 days. Yet the 2002 challenge to the State's protocol using sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride took twice as long.

The parties took discovery depositions throughout June, with the Petitioners reasonably assuming that Protocol A (pentobarbital) was an available alternative execution method under\n   <em>\n    Glossip.\n   </em>\n   Just a few hours before the parties filed their trial briefs on July 5, 2018, the Department adopted a revised execution protocol that abandoned Protocol A, leaving only Protocol B. But the Department, according to testimony from its Commissioner, had known that pentobarbital was unavailable for executions for about two months before it retained pentobarbital as a lethal injection method in January 2018. Even so, the State failed to notify the Petitioners and failed to take a consistent position on the availability of pentobarbital until the eve of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For example, at the first pretrial hearing on April 11, 2018, counsel for the State dodged the trial court's questions about the availability of pentobarbital. The trial court, acutely aware of the time constraints, zeroed in on the problem and repeatedly questioned counsel about the availability of pentobarbital. The trial court emphasized that the availability of Protocol A was \"essential for the case,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   and if that question could not be answered, the trial court proceedings would be \"futile and useless,\" putting the court as well as the parties in an \"untenable position.\" The State's response to the trial court's direct question - \"will [Protocol A] be available for the August 9th execution?\" - was \"I can't answer that question, Your Honor.\" The trial court then correctly observed that \"if you can't answer [that question] then our proceedings here are really meaningless\" and that it created a \"Catch 22\" dilemma for the court and the litigants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Department's Commissioner testified on June 5, 2018, that the Department would \"search out all options to obtain pentobarbital,\" but the Department's records tell a different story. Those records show that the Department's designated drug procurer only looked for pentobarbital over a four-month period from March 2017 through July 2017, There appears to have been no activity after July 2017 until June 20, 2018, when the drug procurer emailed a potential supplier, stating that the Department was \"still searching for USP grade pentobarbital\" and \"circling back around with folks\" to check on availability for purchase. That said, Texas officials used pentobarbital on July 17, 2018, to execute Christopher Young; on June 27, 2018, to execute Danny Bible; on May 16, 2018, to execute Juan Castillo; on April 25, 2018, to execute Erick Daniel Davila; on March 27, 2018, to execute Rosendo Rodriguez III; on February 1, 2018, to execute John David Battaglia; on January 30, 2018, to execute William Rayford; and on January 18, 2018, to execute Anthony Shore.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in Georgia, officials used pentobarbital to execute Carlton Michael Gary on March 15, 2018, and Robert Butts, Jr., on May 4, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most recently, pentobarbital was used in Texas on September 26, 2018, to execute Troy Clark; and on September 27, 2018, to execute Daniel Acker.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The State's retention of pentobarbital as an execution protocol until July 5, 2018, and its refusal to take a firm position on the availability of pentobarbital for Irick's August execution refutes the State's argument that the Petitioners had actual notice as early as February 2018 that pentobarbital was not available. Petitioners could have reasonably inferred the availability of pentobarbital from the Department's adoption of it in January 2018, the Department's retention of it until July 5, 2018,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the State's representations in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As the trial court accurately observed, the availability of pentobarbital was essential to the case, and without the State answering the question as to the availability of pentobarbital, the trial court proceedings were meaningless. For the State to provide the answer on the eve of trial while effectively evading the question for months was patently unfair to the Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   For all these reasons, the Petitioners were denied due process in the form of a fundamentally fair process. \"At its core, the right to due process reflects a fundamental value in our American constitutional system.\"\n   <em>\n    Boddie v.

The Petitioners, faced with the prospect of suffering needlessly while being put to death by the State, deserve meaningful appellate review of the trial court's ruling. Meaningful review includes giving counsel adequate time to review trial testimony, research and brief the issues, and effectively advocate for their clients in their appellate briefs and at oral argument. Only then can the Court, after reviewing the record from the trial court, reading the parties' briefs, listening to the oral arguments, and studying applicable legal authorities, render its decision. The Court should not make its decision in haste, but after thoughtful and careful deliberation. The parties and the public deserve no less. Here, the super-expedited schedule imposed by the Court denied the Petitioners meaningful appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   To begin with, the Court unreasonably reduced the time for the Petitioners to file the record with the appellate court clerk from a minimum of 105 days (or more if an objection to the record is filed or if the record needs to be supplemented) to nine days (seven days excluding a weekend). This was rather extraordinary given that the trial lasted ten days, with twenty-three witnesses testifying and 139 exhibits admitted into evidence. The record filed with the appellate court clerk consisted of twenty-nine volumes of court filings, thirty-two volumes of trial transcripts, and nineteen volumes of trial exhibits, totaling well over 10,000 pages. In reducing the Petitioners' time for filing the record, the Court failed to consider that filing the record is a three-part process, involving the parties, the trial court clerk, and the trial court judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court had no opportunity to review and approve the record, and the\n   parties had no chance to point out any errors in the record. Not surprisingly, the record-prepared in great haste-is not completely accurate. The Lead Petitioners\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   noted that their counsel \"corrected apparent transcription errors,\" but that they did \"not have the physical ability to correct all of the errors in this record prior to September 6, 2018.\" Likewise, the Miller Petitioners pointed to specific \"transcription errors [that] change[d] the substance of testimony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Next, the Court cut in half the parties' briefing period from seventy-four days to thirty-seven days (twenty-six days, excluding weekends and Labor Day).\n   <em>\n    Abdur'Rahman v. Parker\n   </em>\n   , No. M2018-01385-SC-RDO-CV (Tenn. Aug 13, 2018) (Lee, J., dissenting). The Lead Petitioners had only fifteen days to review the record and to prepare and file their brief, while the Miller Petitioners had just ten days to review the record and to prepare and file their brief and the State had fifteen days to brief the case.\n   <em>\n    Abdur'Rahman v. Parker,\n   </em>\n   No. M2018-01385-SC-RDO-CV (Tenn. Aug 27, 2018) (Lee, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The detrimental effects of the limited briefing schedule are evident from the parties' briefs. The Miller Petitioners admitted in their brief that they did not have time to brief fully the trial court's errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Due to the \"compressed super-expedited\" briefing schedule, the Miller Plaintiffs primarily raise in this brief due process violations because those errors undermine the integrity of the entire proceeding below. Undersigned counsel acknowledges the rule on waiver that usually applies when an issue is not fully briefed on appeal, however,\n   <em>\n    counsel does not have the time or resources to brief all significant errors which occurred in the proceedings below and are reflected in the Chancery Court's final order.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   (Emphasis added). The Miller Petitioners also noted in their reply brief that it was \"prepared under an extreme time limitation and likely contains errors,\" and that it lacked an introduction, all relevant facts, legal authority, record cites and an exhaustive analysis. Predictably, given the time constraints, the Lead Petitioners had to late-file their brief's table of authorities. The State even had to file a substitute brief to correct erroneous page references in the table of contents, in the table of authorities, and in its response to the issues raised by the Miller Petitioners, as well as citation errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Previous appeals of constitutional challenges to the State's lethal injection protocols have not been rushed or decided hastily. This case was pending only fifty-six days from the time the Court reached down and assumed jurisdiction on August 13, 2018, until it released its opinion today.
