Michael Swiney, C.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal arises from a divorce case that was appealed and remanded and now once again is back before us. Melody Crunk Telfer (\"Wife\") filed for divorce\n   from husband George Curtiss Telfer (\"Husband\") in 2010. A final decree of divorce was entered in 2012. Husband appealed the finding that he lacked a marital interest in two of Wife's business entities. This Court found that the appreciation in value of the entities at issue was marital property subject to equitable division. On remand, the Chancery Court for Williamson County (\"the Remand Court\") valued the appreciation, divided the marital estate, and awarded Husband attorney's fees. Husband appeals to this Court. We find,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the approximately 84/16 division of the marital estate in favor of Wife rendered by the Remand Court is inequitable in light of the evidence and the relevant statutory factors. We vacate that portion of the Remand Court's order and remand for a fresh division of the marital estate on a 65/35 basis in favor of Wife. We otherwise affirm the Remand Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As this Court already has had occasion to lay out the factual background of this case in\n   <em>\n    Telfer I\n   </em>\n   , we quote heavily from our earlier opinion. In\n   <em>\n    Telfer I\n   </em>\n   , in which we remanded the case for the Remand Court to include the appreciation in value of two of Wife's business entities in the marital estate, this Court stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff/Appellee Melody Crunk Telfer (\"Wife\") and Defendant/Appellant George Curtiss Telfer (\"Husband\") were married in 1985. Until 2000, Husband worked in the automotive finance and banking industry and Wife worked in sales. During that time, both parties deposited their employment earnings into a joint checking account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Wife's father, John Crunk, was the chairman and owner of RJ Young Company. In 1995, Mr. Crunk decided to transfer ownership of some of his assets to Wife through the creation of business entities, in order to avoid the payment of gift and inheritance taxes upon his death. One of the entities Mr. Crunk set up was Crunk Connected Products (\"CCP\"), a partnership that owned the real estate upon which RJ Young was situated. Mr. Crunk began gifting Wife a percentage of the ownership interest in CCP. By October 1999, by virtue of Mr. Crunk's gifts, Wife owned a 74.8% interest in CCP, valued at $416,795.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in 2000, Wife began receiving distributions from CCP in the amount of $8,500 per month. These distributions were deposited into the parties' joint checking account and used to pay marital expenses. These distributions and other income from companies belonging to Wife's family were sufficient to enable Wife to cease working outside the home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsequently, Mr. Crunk decided to equalize the distribution of his assets between Wife and her brother. To do so, in May 1999, Mr. Crunk created another business entity, Young Leasing, LLC, for the purpose of transferring wealth to Wife. Neither Husband nor Wife was involved in setting up Young Leasing, and Wife was not present when the company was created. The sum of $900 was paid for Wife's 90% ownership interest in the company. Prior to the $900 payment, Young Leasing had no assets. Young Leasing did not immediately make any distributions to Wife, and in fact operated at a loss until 2005.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   As a result of the companies set up by Wife's family, the parties had significant tax liabilities. Income reflected on the K-1 statements from CCP and Young Leasing was included in the parties' joint income tax returns. However, from 1999-2006, the parties received no monies from CCP or Young Leasing to pay the increased tax liability incurred as a result of Wife's ownership interest in the\n   companies. Consequently, they paid the increased income taxes with marital funds. It appears from the record that the parties paid the taxes on all of the income generated by CCP and Young Leasing each year, regardless of whether the companies' income was retained or distributed to Wife.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2005, for the first time, Young Leasing did not operate at a loss. That year, it earned approximately $619,000; these earnings were retained by the company. This 2005 income was reported on the K-1 statements for Wife, even though the income was not distributed to her. As a result, in 2006, this \"phantom\" income attributed to Wife, in addition to the parties' other sources of income, generated a personal tax liability of approximately $331,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The financial issues and numerous other factors placed strain on the parties' marriage. In 2010, Wife filed a complaint for divorce in the Chancery Court for Williamson County, Tennessee, alleging irreconcilable differences. Contentious litigation ensued over numerous issues, most of which are not pertinent to this appeal. The litigation included sharp disputes over the primary issues in this appeal, namely, the classification of Wife's companies and their appreciation in value as either separate or marital property, for purposes of equitably dividing the marital estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In the oral ruling, the trial court first made the factual finding that Wife's father intended the two companies to be gifts to Wife and that \"she didn't earn it.\" Thus, the trial court concluded that Wife's ownership interests in the companies were her separate property. It then addressed whether the appreciation in the value of the companies during the marriage should be classified as marital property. The trial court explained its view of the evidence on the distributions made by Wife's companies and the parties' payment of their tax liability, and whether Husband had substantially contributed to the appreciation in value of the companies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Now, all we have from that cash flow that came out. And [Wife] chose to-I think appropriately, to put that into the joint funds that they had at the bank. They had a joint account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   But the payment of the money from that cash flow for taxes did nothing, in this Court's opinion, to meet the statutory obligation, which is that you must show that there has been by both parties a substantial contribution to the preservation and appreciation of the assets. It didn't do that, and I've listened carefully, and I appreciate the argument to the contrary, but I just respectfully disagree with that. It didn't do a thing to preserve either [CCP] or Young Leasing. It didn't do a thing to preserve that asset in any shape, form, or fashion that this Court can see....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   But the mere fact that the cash flows from these [companies] went into a joint account and were used to pay the taxes that naturally come from the income does not preserve the corpus, which is the leasing company and the partnership. Therefore, accordingly, the Court does find that this is not a marital asset, that [Husband] has no interest in, as a matter of law, in Young Leasing or in [CCP].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Thus, the trial court held that the fact that the checks from the companies were deposited into a joint account, and the fact that the payment of the parties' tax liabilities were paid from joint assets, did not amount to a substantial\n   contribution to the appreciation in value of the companies. For that reason, the trial court held that the appreciation in the value of the companies during the parties' marriage was also Wife's separate property, and thus would not be included in the trial court's equitable division of the marital property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In February 2012, the trial court's oral findings on these issues were incorporated by reference into the written order that adjudicated all of the issues in the divorce litigation. Pertinent to this appeal, the written order held that Wife's interest in both companies was \"her separate property when acquired by her and remain her separate property\" and that Husband \"has no marital interest in either property.\" Husband now appeals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   As to CCP, similar to\n   <em>\n    Schuett\n   </em>\n   , marital funds were used to pay the tax liabilities created by the income that was retained by CCP. Prior to 2006, the parties paid their income tax liabilities associated with CCP with their employment income. In 2006, their tax liabilities arising in part from income retained by CCP but attributed to Wife for tax purposes were paid with marital funds from the liquidated joint brokerage account. At the time, Husband testified, the parties explored the possibility of CCP distributing some of the retained income to Wife to cover the parties' suddenly large tax liabilities, but \"the bottom line was that there wasn't going to be a distribution to cover this tax liability.\" The parties' use of marital funds to cover their tax liabilities arising out of the CCP income that was attributed to Wife but not distributed to her allowed CCP to retain income that could have been utilized to pay the parties' income taxes. This helped preserve CCP and allowed it to grow and appreciate in value. Under these circumstances, we find a causal link between the use of the parties' marital funds and the preservation and appreciation in value of CCP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2006, Young Leasing retained income attributed to Wife, and the parties clearly utilized marital funds to pay the associated tax liability. While it was a one-time payment, the amount of the parties' overall tax liability was substantial, $331,000; as was the amount in the joint brokerage account, namely, $317,000 that was inherited by Husband. To be considered a substantial contribution to the preservation and appreciation of a spouse's separate property, the parties' contribution \"need not be monetarily commensurate to the appreciation in the separate property's value, nor must [it] relate directly to the separate property at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright-Miller v. Miller\n   </em>\n   , 984 S.W.2d [936] at 944 [ (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998) ] (citing\n   <em>\n    Brown [v. Brown]\n   </em>\n   , 913 S.W.2d [163] at 167 [ (Tenn. Ct. App. 1994) ] ). Under the circumstances, it is fair to find a causal link between the expenditure of these marital funds in 2006 and the preservation and appreciation in value of Young Leasing in 2006.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition, the proof showed that, during the parties' marriage, Husband served as the family's financial manager and Wife had little knowledge of or involvement in their financial matters. Under Section 36-4-121(b)(1)(D), quoted above, substantial contribution may include \"the direct or indirect contribution of a spouse as ... family financial manager, together with such other factors as the court having jurisdiction thereof may determine.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-4-121\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-4-121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(D). This is of particular significance with respect to the payment of the parties' 2006 tax liability, since the proof showed that the unexpected 2005\n   income attributed to the parties but not distributed to them necessitated hasty action by Husband to cover the parties' suddenly imminent tax liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Considering all of these circumstances, we must conclude that the evidence preponderates in favor of a finding that the parties made real and significant contributions to appreciation and preservation of both Young Leasing and CCP. Consequently, we must hold that the appreciation in value of both companies during the marriage is marital property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   This holding requires us to remand the case to the trial court. On remand, the trial court must, of course, equitably divide the appreciation in value of both CCP and Young Leasing during the marriage. In addition, however, adding the appreciation in these companies to the marital estate significantly affects the size of the overall marital estate. Consequently, on remand, the trial court may, in its discretion, reconsider its equitable division of the entire marital estate, in light of all factors it deems relevant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Husband seeks an award of attorney fees both at trial and on appeal. After reviewing Husband's arguments, we find no abuse of the trial court's discretion in its denial of Husband's request for attorneys fees below. We respectfully decline to award Husband attorney fees on appeal. The remaining issues raised on appeal are pretermitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Telfer v. Telfer\n   </em>\n   , No. M2012-00691-COA-R3-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203379370\">\n    2013 WL 3379370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2, 5-6, 11-13 (Tenn.

On November 18, 2015, the Remand Court entered an order revising the value attached to Wife's share. The Remand Court, among other things, excoriated Husband's financial stewardship during the marriage, stating as follows in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The trial court's division of the marital assets in 2011, resulted in distribution of $540,893 to Ms. Telfer and $510,928 to Mr. Telfer for a total marital estate of $1,051,821. Tbl. 3. This distribution allocated 51% of the marital estate to Ms. Telfer and 49% to Mr. Telfer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203379370\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203379370\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Additionally the trial court awarded Mr. Telfer $240,000 in transitional alimony, notwithstanding his admitted adultery.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .; Trial Tr. vol. III, 5, 55 Dec 2011. The alimony payments of $5000 a month for 4 years will be satisfied in December 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Telfer's conduct as the \"family's financial manager\" can hardly be deemed admirable. This Court cannot, and would not, disagree with the findings of the appellate court. Certainly he used what assets were readily available in 2006 to pay the parties' tax liability for 2005. However, Mr. Telfer lived as if the \"Crunk well\" would never run dry. He maxed out the line of credit secured by the parties' home, in part, to fund a business venture for which he had no qualifications or experience while pursuing construction of a lake home for his family, which at the time, the parties could ill afford. The trial record is devoid of any evidence showing that Mr. Telfer exercised prudence or caution.... His contribution as the family financial manager can only be described as reckless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Absent clear guidance and articulated policy considerations for the exclusion of\n   marketability discounts otherwise routinely applied in the field of business interest valuations, this Court defers to the judgment of the experts in this case, both of whom found they should apply a discount for lack of marketability to Ms. Telfer's partial interest in CCP and Young Leasing to fairly reflect fair market value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court agrees with Mr. Price's determination of a fair discount for lack of marketability for the two closely held business interests that takes into account the totality of the information gathered by the experts and establishes a value that reflects the \"fair market value.\" Applying a 7.7% discount to Ms. Telfer's interest in Crunk Connected Products and reducing the result of $4,709,466, by her discounted separate interest of $384,702, the resulting value of her marital interest is $4,324,764. Applying a 10% discount to her interest in Young Leasing, the value of her marital interest is $1,172,384.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   In the present case, Mr. Telfer's contribution to the acquisition of Ms. Telfer's interests in CCP and Young Leasing was not \"minimal,\" as in\n   <em>\n    Dalton\n   </em>\n   ; it was non-existent. Mr. Crunk, Ms. Telfer's father, established Ms. Telfer's interest in these companies as an early inheritance to allow her to be a stay at home parent. Mr. Telfer made no contribution to the acquisition of Ms. Telfer's interest in these companies whatsoever. Ms. Telfer received them through the generosity of Mr. Crunk, by virtue of his desire to share his net worth with his daughter in the form of an early inheritance. However, similar to\n   <em>\n    Dalton\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Telfer \"should receive some credit for the increase in value of Wife's separate property.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   What this Court is called upon to do in this case, is equitably divide the increase in value of Ms. Telfer's interests in CCP and Young Leasing, interests that Mr. Telfer did nothing to generate, except for the tax payment made in April 2006. Thus, as noted above when discussing the\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   case, the issue is how to quantify Mr. Telfer's entitlement to these marital assets. Mr. Telfer asks the Court to award him 50% of the marital interest in CCP and Young Leasing. To do so would be inequitable, and would inappropriately allow Mr. Telfer to continue to reap the benefit of the largess from the Crunk family without any justification other than his status as their son-in-law. Had the Crunk family intended to enrich Mr. Telfer, they could have done so directly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   In keeping with the Court's responsibility to divide the marital interest in CCP and Young Leasing and the overall marital estate in an equitable manner and based upon the facts and circumstances of this case, the Court finds it appropriate to recognize that Mr. Telfer used all of his inheritance from his aunt for the benefit of the parties' finances and estate. In that regard, the Court finds it necessary to consider Mr. Telfer's loss of his inheritance and subsequent investment returns on that inheritance in making an equitable distribution of the marital property. Mr. Telfer has benefitted throughout the marriage from the gifts and financial contributions of Ms. Telfer's family. Similarly, although in a lesser dollar amount, Ms. Telfer has benefitted from the inheritance from Mr. Telfer's aunt. Mr. Telfer's inheritance in the amount of approximately $450,000 was used to purchase the Rock Island lake house lot and to pay the parties' 2005 taxes in\n   April 2006. Ms. Telfer did nothing to generate these funds, just as Mr. Telfer did nothing to generate the early inheritance gifts to Ms. Telfer from her family. Thus, in making an equitable distribution of the Telfer marital property at issue here, the Court must take Mr. Telfer's loss of his inheritance and investment returns on that inheritance, along with all the facts of the case, into account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court has considered the facts established by the trial court in December 2011, the additional facts noted by the Court of Appeals, and other facts contained in the trial record which do not contradict or conflict with the findings of the trial court in December 2011, or the Court of Appeals. Based on all of the facts in this case and application of appropriate legal principles, the Court has reconsidered the equitable division of the overall marital estate including the increase in value during the marriage of Ms. Telfer's interest in CCP and Young Leasing. The Court acknowledges Mr. Telfer's position that the Court should equally divide the increase in value in CCP and Young Leasing or make an award to him which approximates an equal division. However, based upon careful consideration of all the applicable factors set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-4-121, the Court finds that such a division would be inequitable. Accordingly, the Court has determined that Ms. Telfer will retain her interest in Young Leasing and CCP, as well as the other assets awarded her at the trial of this case in December 2011; that Mr. Telfer will retain all of the assets awarded him at the trial of this case in December 2011; and that Ms. Telfer will pay Mr. Telfer an additional $600,000 as his equitable share of the marital estate, including the increase in value of CCP and Young Leasing. Payment shall be made by Ms. Telfer to Mr. Telfer in the amount of $10,000 per month for 60 months. The first payment shall be made on January 1, 2016, and subsequent payments shall be made on the first day of each month thereafter, until the entire $600,000 has been paid to Mr. Telfer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In April 2016, the Remand Court entered an order resolving all outstanding issues in the case save for whether Husband should be awarded attorney's fees. The Remand Court stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   This case is before the Court on remand from the Court of Appeals. The Court issued a\n   <em>\n    Memorandum and Order\n   </em>\n   on November 18, 2015, believing that all that remained to complete the mandate of the Court of Appeals was to allow Mr. Telfer to make an offer of proof concerning the value of real properties owned by Crunk Connected Products (hereinafter \"CCP\") as of December 7, 2011, the date of the original trial in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   After issuing its November 18, 2015\n   <em>\n    Memorandum and Order\n   </em>\n   , the Court determined that it had erred in excluding testimony Mr. Crunk desired to offer to rebut the testimony of Mr. Eric Boozer, the real estate appraisal expert called to testify on behalf of Ms. Telfer, concerning the value of the CCP real property holdings as of June 30, 2011. The Court determined that it should reopen the record to allow Mr. Telfer to offer this testimony. Accordingly, on December 9, 2015 the Court heard testimony from Mr. James E. Lamb, MAI. On February 19, 2016, the Court heard further testimony of Mr. Eric Boozer responding to the December 9, 2015, testimony of Mr. Lamb.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Mr. Telfer contracted Mr. Lamb to conduct his appraisal reviews in January or February 2014, long after the conclusion of the December 7, 2011 trial. He completed (1) the review of Mr. Boozer's appraisal of 805 Division Street on February 26, 2014; (2) the review of Mr. Boozer's appraisal of 810 Division Street on February 27, 2014; (3) the review of Mr. Boozer's appraisal of 809 Division Street on March 3, 2014; and (4) the review of Mr. Boozer's appraisal of 2919 Sidco Drive on March 7, 2014. In addition, Mr. Lamb was present in Court May 15, 2015 and heard Mr. Boozer's testimony concerning his June 30, 2011 appraisals. Mr. Lamb prepared reports reflecting the results of his reviews, which were offered and received into evidence as Exhibits 18-21 on December 9, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   On December 9, 2015, Mr. Lamb testified that he was prepared to offer testimony regarding his appraisal reviews on May 15, 2015 had the Court allowed him to do so. The Court erred in not allowing Mr. Lamb's testimony on May 15, 2015. To remedy this error, the Court heard testimony from Mr. Lamb on December 9, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   After issuing its November 18, 2015\n   <em>\n    Memorandum and Order\n   </em>\n   , however, the Court determined that it had erred in excluding Mr. James E. Lamb's testimony concerning the value of the CCP real property holdings as of June 30, 2011. The Court reopened the record for Mr. Telfer to offer Mr. Lamb's testimony. Following the Court's evaluation of the conflicting expert testimony, the Court has now rejected the testimony of Mr. Lamb and accepted the testimony of Mr. Boozer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Mr. Tom Price, CPA, also testified on February 19, 2016 as part of Mr. Telfer's offer of proof concerning the value of Ms. Telfer's interest in CCP based on post June 30, 2011 facts. Mr. Price corrected the Court and noted that the Court relied on Mr. Boozer's appraisal as of June 30, 2011 in its November 18, 2015\n   <em>\n    Memorandum and Order\n   </em>\n   and erroneously applied a 7.7% discount for lack of marketability to the entirety of CCP interests. Accordingly, the Court modifies its November 18, 2015\n   <em>\n    Memorandum and Order\n   </em>\n   to eliminate the 7.7% marketability discount as it pertains to the Division Street properties owned by CCP. As a result of this correction, the Court adjusts Mrs. Telfer's marital property interest in CCP to $4,659,19[1]. Ms. Telfer's previously stipulated to separate property interest in CCP remains $416,795.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court finds this modification of the value of Ms. Telfer's marital interest in CCP, though material, does not affect the Court's reasoning and conclusions set forth in the Court's November 18, 2015\n   <em>\n    Memorandum and Order.\n   </em>\n   The Court's decision regarding the equitable division of the overall marital estate, including the increase in value during the marriage of Ms. Telfer's interest in CCP and Young Leasing, remains unchanged. The Court reserves the issue of Mr. Telfer's request for attorney's fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (Footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In September 2016, the Remand Court entered an order granting Husband attorney's fees, stating, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Since the remand order from the Court of Appeals entered in June 2013, Mr. Telfer has incurred attorney's fees and expenses in the amount of $165,014.78.\n   <em>\n    Affidavit of James L. Weatherly, Jr.\n   </em>\n   , March 9, 2016. Mr. Telfer incurred these fees over a period of two and a half years which included\n   numerous motions and court appearances, consultation and work with expert witnesses, extensive trial court briefings, and five days of trial court proceedings on the remand hearings. Combined with expenses related to expert witnesses, the total cost of Mr. Telfer's success on remand totals approximately $235,000.00. The Court notes that this amount is only slightly less than $240,000.00-the amount awarded to Mr. Telfer as transitional alimony as a result of the initial proceedings. The Court based this award of transitional alimony on Mr. Telfer's need and Ms. Telfer's ability to pay, as shown by their respective incomes and expenses, as well as the value of Ms. Telfer's separate estate.\n   <em>\n    See Order\n   </em>\n   , February 1, 2012. The Court did not, however, make this award in anticipation of attorney's fees relating to future proceedings and Mr. Telfer's success in obtaining an equitable share of in the increase in value in Ms. Telfer's ownership interest in Crunk Connected Products and Young Leasing. Therefore, the Court now considers Mr. Telfer's request for attorney's fees in light the entirety of proceedings, the provisions set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-5-121\">\n    Tenn.

Ms. Telfer contested Mr. Telfer's efforts to be awarded any portion of her ownership interests at the divorce trial, on appeal, and in these remanded proceedings, resulting in protracted and expensive litigation. Mr. Telfer remains the economically disadvantaged spouse in this matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-5-121\">\n    Tenn.

To require Mr. Telfer to pay his attorney's fees and expenses from his additional award of $600,000 would seriously erode the value of the additional marital asset awarded Mr. Telfer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Mr. Telfer should be awarded attorney's fees and expenses as alimony in solido. The Court afforded Ms. Telfer the opportunity to contest the reasonableness of attorney's fees and expenses sought by Mr. Telfer. Ms. Telfer, however, declined to do so. Accordingly, the Court has reviewed Mr. Weatherly's affidavit and finds the amount of $165,014.78 to be reasonable, thoroughly documented, and adequately supported.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court in this matter, has extensively reviewed the record, including Mr. Telfer's March 9, 2016 and April 20, 2016 filings and Ms. Telfer's May 4, 2016 reply in opposition, complied with the requirements of the discretionary standard under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04, and determined that Mr. Telfer is entitled to discretionary costs. Mr. Telfer is the \"prevailing party.\" The Court therefore awards discretionary costs to the extent authorized under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.04.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stalsworth v.

Ct. App. Dec. 6, 2012) (finding lack of marketability discount applicable to husband's interest in one limited liability company but not to husband's interest in another limited liability company based on the facts). Under the facts of this case, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's application of a \"slight\" discount for lack of marketability for one general partnership but not applying a discount for the other two. \"Placing a value on a minority interest in a business is not an exact science.\"\n   <em>\n    Owens v.

This same logic applies to valuation of a minority interest in a general partnership. \"Since valuation evidence is inherently subjective, a trial court's valuation decisions need not coincide precisely with the valuation opinions offered into evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8318138\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/241/478/#p489\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Here, the trial court's determination of value is within the range of evidence offered by the parties.

The court also found Mr. Pritchett erroneously deducted cost of sale when appraising the subdivisions. Mr. Wallace agreed his final value would increase if the appraised values he used were artificially low. The court also had additional evidence in this record, including the testimony of Vernon Weakley and Husband's personal financial statements, that evidenced a value higher than the value found by Mr. Wallace.

Ct. App. May 12, 2016) (footnote omitted),\n   <em>\n    no appl. perm. appeal filed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   With respect to the valuation of the marital interests, the applicable standard of review is deferential. The Remand Court heard the evidence and concluded that a discount for lack of marketability was appropriate in regards to CCP and Young Leasing, LLC. As we determined in\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   , whether to use a discount for lack of marketability \"depends on the characteristics of the ownership interest being valued, not whether the owner of the interest actually intends to sell the interest\" and \"the decision is discretionary and dependent on the facts of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. From our review of the evidence relevant to the \"characteristics of the ownership interest being valued ...,\" we find no reversible error in the Remand Court's use of a discount for lack of marketability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Regarding the date of valuation, we note that the parties stipulated initially that June 30, 2011 would be the date that their retained experts would employ. Although the case since has dragged on considerably\n   past the final divorce hearing and decree, we see no reason to disregard the original stipulated date. Finally, in view of our resolution of this appeal, we find moot Husband's issue of whether post-judgment interest should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Having declined to disturb in any way the Remand Court's valuation of the marital interests, we move now to the overall division of the marital estate. Our review is hampered somewhat by the lack of clarity in the succession of orders below as to final values arrived upon. At oral arguments, the parties agreed generally that the marital estate is worth approximately $6.8 million-in any event, certainly north of six million dollars. The marital portion of the assets in dispute constitute around $5.8 million, of which Husband received $600,000. Husband's calculations reflect an 84/16 division of the entire marital estate in favor of Wife. Wife denies that the discrepancy is so dramatic, instead stating that the division merely is 80/20 in favor of Wife. While our own calculations indicate that Husband is nearer the mark, the resulting breakdown staggeringly favors Wife whichever proportion put forward by the parties is adopted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Remand Court focused a great deal on the relative financial contributions of the parties in dividing the marital estate. We believe that the Remand Court, in dividing the appreciation of the business entities this Court instructed be included in the marital estate, lost sight of the forest for the trees. This was a long-term marriage, in which Husband exercised a great deal of the financial decision-making. If Husband, like Wife, benefitted from Wife's family's largesse, that does not serve to undermine all the otherwise relevant statutory factors such as the economic circumstances of Husband and Wife when the division of the estate becomes effective and the duration of the marriage. We also note that if Husband had been successful rather than unsuccessful financially, there is little question that the fruits of his success would be fair game for equitable division. As long as it does not rise to the level of dissipation, spouses share the results not just in successful financial decisions but also in the unsuccessful ones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   We are very much disinclined to tinker with a lower court's decisions regarding the division of a marital estate. However, the 84/16 division of the marital estate in this case is extreme and inequitable resulting in an injustice to Husband. The factual basis for the Remand Court's division of the marital estate is not properly supported by evidence in the record. Further, the Remand Court did not properly identify and apply the most appropriate legal principles applicable to the equitable division of the marital estate. We vacate the Remand Court's division of the marital estate, and remand for a new division that will award 65% of the entire marital estate to Wife and 35% to Husband. To emphasize, it does not matter how the court below divides a particular marital asset because ultimately it is the overall division of the entire marital estate that must be equitable, a fact seemingly lost in this drawn-out case. We have determined a 65/35 division in favor of Wife is an equitable division in light of all the evidence applied to the relevant factors as discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   We next address Wife's issue regarding whether the Remand Court erred in awarding Husband attorney's fees. With respect to the award of attorney's fees in divorce cases, our Supreme Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   It is well-settled that an award of attorney's fees in a divorce case constitutes alimony in solido. The decision whether to award attorney's fees is within\n   the sound discretion of the trial court. As with any alimony award, in deciding whether to award attorney's fees as alimony in solido, the trial court should consider the factors enumerated in Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-121(i). A spouse with adequate property and income is not entitled to an award of alimony to pay attorney's fees and expenses. Such awards are appropriate only when the spouse seeking them lacks sufficient funds to pay his or her own legal expenses or the spouse would be required to deplete his or her resources in order to pay them. Thus, where the spouse seeking such an award has demonstrated that he or she is financially unable to procure counsel, and where the other spouse has the ability to pay, the court may properly grant an award of attorney's fees as alimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Gonsewski v. Gonsewski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317361\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/350/99/#p113\">\n    350 S.W.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113 (Tenn. 2011) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Remand Court, quoted above, detailed its rationale for awarding Husband his attorney's fees. We find no reversible error in the Remand Court's award of attorney's fees to Husband. We decline, however, to award any attorney's fees related to this appeal as Husband will, after this remand, have adequate property to pay his additional attorney's fees and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The judgment of the Remand Court is affirmed, in part, and vacated, in part, and this cause is remanded to the Remand Court for further proceedings as necessary and for entry of a final judgment dividing the already established marital estate consistent with this Opinion.
