Stucker (Father) appeals the trial court's judgment that dissolved his marriage to Karen E. Stucker (Mother). Father claims that the trial court erred by (1) denying his request for equal, alternating week-long periods of custodial time in the summer and (2) ordering that he pay Mother child support in the amount of $98 per month. We are unable to reach the merits of this appeal because Father waived his right to appeal by stipulating to\n   the entry of the judgment he now seeks to challenge. Appeal dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In Missouri, the right to appeal is purely statutory.\n   <em>\n    Henze v.

A review of the record supports our conclusion as to the intent of the stipulation. The court held a bench trial on the parties' cross-petitions for dissolution of marriage. Following the bench trial, the court entered a judgment and then, after Father filed a motion to amend, the court entered a first amended judgment that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , denied Father's request for equal, alternating summer custody and ordered that he pay child support in the amount of $98 per month. Mother filed a motion to reopen trial for additional evidence regarding certain tax consequences of the judgment, and at the hearing on that motion, Father filed a motion for new trial. The court denied Father's motion, granted Mother's, and scheduled a second bench trial exclusively to address the tax issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before the second bench trial could be held, however, the parties entered into and filed the stipulation, which provided\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   , \"Comes Now Petitioner, and Comes also Respondent, by their respective attorneys, and do stipulate and agree that all post-trial motions filed by either side are withdrawn and do pray that the Court enter its Second Amended Judgment, per the interlineations previously filed with the Court.\" The trial court cancelled the scheduled bench trial and entered the stipulated Second Amended Judgment, which like the previous judgment denied Father's requested custody and ordered that he pay $98 monthly in child support. Father's only subsequent filing was his notice of appeal, by which he now attempts to dispute the validity of the Second Amended Judgment's custody and child support determinations to which he stipulated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In light of these facts, we find that Father waived his right to appeal the Second Amended Judgment. He specifically \"pray[ed]\" for the entry of that judgment and consented to the withdrawal of all post-trial motions and thus cannot be held under \u00a7 512.020 to have been \"aggrieved by\" the Second Amended Judgment.\n   <em>\n    New Amsterdam Cas. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10144873\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/430/642/#p645\">\n    430 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   645 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Nations,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9406044\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/78/222/#p223\">\n    78 S.W.3d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223. If he wanted to dispute the validity of the Second Amended Judgment's custody and child support determinations, he should not have stipulated to them and to the withdrawal of all his post-trial motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We also reject Father's effort in violation of Rule 81.12\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to inject into this case non-record evidence that the stipulation was meant as an agreement only to proposed amendments to the judgment related to tax issues. Rule 81.12 requires that the record on appeal contain all of the record, proceedings and evidence necessary to the determination of all questions to be presented, by either appellant or respondent, to the appellate court for decision. And we consider only the record made before the trial court; the presentment of evidence extraneous to the record is not to be considered on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Sleater v. Sleater,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11108033\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/42/821/\">\n    42 S.W.3d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 822 n.1 (Mo.App.E.D. 2001) ;\n   <em>\n    8182 Maryland Assocs.

Thus, we conclude that this evidence Father presents for the first time on appeal, in opposition to Mother's motion to dismiss, is not properly before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because Missouri law clearly provides that Father may not appeal a judgment entered at his request, this appeal must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Gary M.
