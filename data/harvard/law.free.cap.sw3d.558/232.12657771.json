Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant the City of Westworth Village and its neighbor, Appellee the City of White Settlement, negotiated an economic development plan to locate a Wal-Mart and a Sam's Club on undeveloped property, 66% of which was located in Westworth Village, where the stores would be built, and 34% of which was located in White Settlement, where the parking lot would be built. This plan led to a contract between the two cities and a property developer that bore fruit when Wal-Mart and Sam's Club selected the proposed site, resulting in an increase in Westworth Village's retail sales tax revenue, some of which, under the parties' agreement, was payable to White Settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Twelve years later, when Westworth Village suffered buyer's remorse based on the \"inordinate amount of its police and EMS resources\" that it had to devote to the Wal-Mart and Sam's Club without assistance from White Settlement, Westworth Village notified White Settlement of its decision to terminate the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   White Settlement sued Westworth Village for breach of contract. Arguing immunity from suit, Westworth Village filed a plea to the jurisdiction, which the trial court denied. In a single issue in this interlocutory appeal, Westworth Village appeals that denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2051.014\">\n    Tex.

The Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pursuant to local government code chapter 380, on December 15, 2004, Westworth Village, White Settlement, and Allegiance Commercial Development LP entered a contract entitled, \"Economic Development Program Grant Agreement Between and Among The City of Westworth Village, the City of White Settlement, and Allegiance Commercial Development, LP.\" In the contract, Allegiance was listed as the grantee, Westworth Village was listed as \"the City,\" and White Settlement was listed as the assignee. One of the contract's stated purposes was \"to promote local economic development and to stimulate business\n   and commercial activity\" in Westworth Village.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the first section of the contract, \"Authorization and Purpose,\" Westworth Village specifically found and acknowledged that participation by Allegiance and White Settlement was essential to the success of the economic development program:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   that the economic benefit to be derived from the business operations on the Property, as defined below, could not have been achieved and will not continue without the cooperation, assistance, performance, and involvement of [Allegiance] and of [White Settlement]. The purpose of this Agreement is to document the terms and conditions under which [Allegiance] will provide land and cause Wal-Mart and Sam's Club retail stores (the \"Project\") to be developed and located in [Westworth Village,] which will generate more than the amount of financial incentives which [Westworth Village] has herein granted to make such development possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   White Settlement also specifically acknowledged that the economic benefit to be derived by it from the business operations on the property \"could not have been achieved and will not continue without the cooperation, assistance, performance and involvement of Westworth Village.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The essence of the contract is found beginning with the fourth section of the agreement, wherein Westworth Village agreed to make certain periodic payments to White Settlement, first through Allegiance by assignment and later directly. In that section, Westworth Village obligated itself to make monthly program grant payments to White Settlement within fifteen days after receiving its monthly tax payments from the State of Texas. Section five of the agreement covered how the program grant payments would be computed: For the first twelve years of the agreement, the program grant payment would be equal to 50% of Westworth Village's tax collections-defined as the 2% share of all gross sales taxes collected from sales made on the property. This amount would drop to 34% after the first twelve years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under the agreement, Allegiance assigned to White Settlement 34% of its 50% share of the applicable retail sales tax collection made by Westworth Village, payable directly to White Settlement. After the first twelve years of the agreement, when Allegiance's 50% share would drop to 34%, Allegiance's shares would be irrevocably assigned from Allegiance to White Settlement for the remainder of the agreement, with Allegiance having no further obligation to either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The contract listed the program term as \"a period of thirty years and thereafter for so long as there exists on the Property an entity paying city sales tax.\" By its terms, the agreement would otherwise terminate only upon mutual written agreement of all of the parties to the agreement, except that Allegiance's written agreement would not be required after the first twelve years. The agreement itself was contingent upon approval by both Westworth Village and White Settlement of all plats and the issuance of all permits necessary to build the stores on the property and upon the stores' opening within two years of the agreement's effective date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Both cities also agreed that if the portion of the property within White Settlement's boundary was ever further developed or redeveloped in such a way as to result in sales taxes being produced from it, they would revise the agreement to provide that White Settlement would receive 34% of all sales tax revenues payable to the two cities from the sales occurring on that portion of the property, and Westworth Village would receive 66% of those sales tax revenues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The agreement further provided that if any party defaulted on the agreement, within 30 days after delivery of written notice of default, the complaining party, \"by action or proceeding at law or in equity, may be awarded specific performance for such default.\" And it stated, \"There are no other agreements among the parties hereto.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Contract Termination and Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On March 14, 2016, Westworth Village gave approximately six months' advanced notice that it would stop making the agreed payments effective September 30, 2016. In its notice, Westworth Village described the agreement as \"unconscionably unfair to [its] citizens\" and the payments as \"egregious,\" and it stated that it believed the agreement to be void for inadequate consideration, terminable at will based on the agreement's perpetual term, and void as against public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   White Settlement sued Westworth Village for breach of contract and sought specific performance, with alternative relief in the form of actual damages, attorney's fees, and court costs. It alternatively claimed that injustice would occur if Westworth Village were not equitably estopped from denying the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Westworth Village answered with a general denial and, in addition to the grounds set out in its March 14, 2016 notice, Westworth Village raised lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on governmental immunity. In its subsequent plea to the jurisdiction, Westworth Village contended that it was immune from suit because it had acted in its governmental capacity based on the collection and distribution of sales taxes and redevelopment of property for economic development purposes. Westworth Village also cited to local government code section 271.152 to argue that the statutory waiver therein did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Local government code section 271.152 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A local governmental entity that is authorized by statute or the constitution to enter into a contract and that enters into a contract subject to this subchapter waives sovereign immunity to suit for the purpose of adjudicating a claim for breach of the contract, subject to the terms and conditions of this subchapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20271.152\">\n    Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 271.152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2016). A \"contract subject to this subchapter\" is one that is in writing and either (1) states the essential terms of the agreement for providing goods or services to the local governmental entity and is properly executed on the entity's behalf or (2) involves the sale or delivery of not less than 1,000 acre-feet of reclaimed water intended for industrial use.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20271.152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 271.151(2)(A)-(B) (West 2016). Because the contract was not for the provision of goods or services, Westworth Village argued that sovereign immunity was not waived under this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   White Settlement responded by arguing that Westworth Village had entered into the contract in its proprietary, not governmental, capacity, that the agreement was for \"goods and services,\" and that immunity did not apply (1) because the agreement was not about tax collection per se but rather about periodic payments for infrastructure construction, the calculations for which were based on the amount of sales tax and (2) because economic development is not generally considered a governmental function under the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20101.0215\">\n    Tex.

To its response, White Settlement attached the affidavit of its former mayor, James O. Ouzts, who averred that because Westworth Village could not provide Wal-Mart and Sam's Club with commercial infrastructure-water and sewer-and services that the stores demanded, Westworth Village sought the assistance of White Settlement so that the Wal-Mart and Sam's Club would relocate in the proposed site. Thus, Ouzts explained, under the 380 agreement, White Settlement agreed to provide those benefits. However, contrary to Ouzts's contention, the 380 agreement in evidence does not explicitly state that White Settlement was obligated to perform this function.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Great Am.

The minutes reflect that Ouzts had informed the council that the Westworth Village-White Settlement site was the location preferred by Wal-Mart and Sam's Club, but that \"they are also looking at a secondary site in Fort Worth, if we d[o] not come to some kind of agreement with Allegiance Development and West Worth Village then it would mean zero dollars for us as well as West Worth Village.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The trial court denied Westworth Village's plea to the jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Westworth Village argues in its single issue that the trial court erred by denying its plea to the jurisdiction when it showed as a matter of law that it was immune from suit under the doctrine of governmental immunity, that the local government code section 271.152 waiver did not apply, and that White Settlement's equitable estoppel argument was meaningless because it had never denied the agreement's existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
