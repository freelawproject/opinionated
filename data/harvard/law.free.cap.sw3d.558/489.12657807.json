Delahanty and Stephanie Pearce Burke, in their official capacities as Jefferson District Court Judges, bring this appeal challenging a writ of mandamus/prohibition entered by the Jefferson Circuit Court. Following a careful review of the record and applicable law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2012, the Kentucky General Assembly amended KRS 1 186.574 to authorize county attorneys to operate traffic safety programs for traffic offenders prior to the adjudication of their traffic offenses, for which the county attorneys are permitted to charge a \"reasonable fee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   KRS 186.574(6)(a)-(c)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Jefferson County Attorney implemented a program under KRS 186.574(6), known as Drive Safe Louisville (\"DSL\"), in 2013. In brief, upon a traffic offender's successful completion of the DSL program, the County Attorney moves the district court to dismiss the traffic violation charge with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, unlike state traffic school, traffic offenders who participate in the DSL program avoid having charges on their record and points added to their drivers' licenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly after implementation of the DSL program, a dispute arose as to whether the judges of the Jefferson District Court could require DSL program participants to pay court costs prior to dismissing their citations. The Jefferson Circuit Court entered a writ of prohibition and/or mandamus directing all Jefferson District Court judges to dismiss charges against DSL program participants without imposing court costs. The order granting the writ was appealed to this Court and was then transferred to the Kentucky Supreme Court. In 2015, while the matter was pending before the Kentucky Supreme Court, the General Assembly amended KRS 186.574(6) to include language requiring any participant in a county attorney operated traffic safety program to \"pay a thirty dollar ($30) fee to the county attorney in lieu of court costs.\" KRS 186.574(6)(e). As a result, by order entered June 11, 2015, the Kentucky Supreme Court dismissed the appeal as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the pendency of the appeal, some-but not all-of the Jefferson District Court judges held cases in which the County Attorney had moved for dismissal of traffic citations issued to DSL program participants in abeyance. At the time the Kentucky Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, approximately 2,300 DSL cases were being held in abeyance at the district court level. After the Kentucky Supreme Court entered its dismissal order, those cases were scheduled for disposition on the district court's November 17, 2015 docket; on September 22, 2015, Judge Delahanty issued an order prohibiting any of the 2,300 cases to be advanced to any other docket without his prior approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Two days later, Judge Delahanty emailed the Jefferson County Attorney to inform him that he had selected five pending DSL cases and moved them to the October 1, 2015 docket. Judge Delahanty stated that he believed the five listed cases were representative of the 2,300 cases previously held in abeyance and that any order issued on October 1, 2015, would apply\n   to all DSL cases. The County Attorney filed an objection to Judge Delahanty's \"email order\" on September 29, 2015. In addition to noting that the email communication did not comport with the requirements for an order, the County Attorney contended that it was unlawful for the district court to unilaterally select five cases and determine that they adequately represented all 2,300 DSL cases currently pending. Notwithstanding its objections, the County Attorney appeared at the October 1, 2015 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the outset of the hearing, Judge Delahanty indicated that he had advanced the five cases to discuss the effect of the recent Supreme Court order and how the court was going to proceed with the 2,300 DSL cases. For the remainder of the hearing-approximately an hour and twenty minutes-Judge Delahanty espoused his belief that KRS 186.574(6) was \"amateurish\" and poorly written, and he extensively questioned the County Attorney on various aspects of the DSL program. The County Attorney attempted to answer all questions and ended the hearing by requesting the district court to advance and dismiss all pending DSL cases. In the days that followed, Judge Delahanty sent several emails to the County Attorney requesting additional information on the DSL program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Delahanty also visited the County Attorney's office to participate in a demonstration of the DSL program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 23, 2015, Judge Delahanty issued a twenty-page order \"granting motions to dismiss in part, denying in part\" (the \"October 2015 Order\"). The first eighteen pages of the order addressed a myriad of issues, none of which had been raised by the parties; for example, the order discussed due process, separation of powers, potential ethical issues under the Kentucky Rules of Professional Conduct, equal protection, and the reasonableness of the DSL program's fees. Ultimately, the district court concluded that the DSL program and KRS 186.574(6) were unconstitutional, as written and applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Even though Judge Delahanty concluded that the DSL program was unconstitutional, he did not order the County Attorney to refund the fees he collected from the defendants for participation in the DSL program. To the contrary, Judge Delahanty granted the County Attorney's motions to dismiss in all but one of the 2,300 DSL program cases before him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   He reasoned that the County Attorney had entered into \"plea agreements\" with the traffic violators under which the County Attorney promised that the traffic charges would be dismissed upon successful completion of the DSL program. According to Judge Delahanty, the defendants had detrimentally relied on the County Attorney's offer making the agreements binding notwithstanding his conclusion that the DSL program and its authorizing statute were unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thereafter, Judge Delahanty and his colleague, Jefferson District Court Judge Stephanie Pearce Burke, began treating the portion of the October 2015 Order declaring the DSL program and KRS 186.574(6) unconstitutional as binding precedent. In reliance on the October 2015 Order, both judges began routinely: (1) advising counsel and persons appearing before them that the DSL program was no\n   longer available as an option; (2) no longer referring traffic offenders to the DSL program; (3) not continuing cases for the purpose of allowing would-be participants to take part in the DSL program; and/or (4) refusing to dismiss citations upon the attendees' completion of the DSL program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 2, 2015, Judge Delahanty entered an order directing that all DSL cases be continued on the court's docket until November 17, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 22, 2015, the County Attorney filed a petition for a writ of prohibition and/or mandamus with the Jefferson Circuit Court pursuant to Kentucky Rule of Civil Procedure (\"CR\") 81, Kentucky Supreme Court Rule (\"SCR\") 1.040(6), and KRS 32A.080. The County Attorney's petition alleged that Judges Delahanty and Burke were refusing to apply KRS 186.574(6) on the basis that it had been previously declared unconstitutional by Judge Delahanty. The petition went on to allege that Judges Delahanty and Burke had \"repeatedly declared and ruled that any citizen who successfully complete[s] the\n   <em>\n    Drive Safe Louisville\n   </em>\n   program and otherwise complies with the financial requirements of that statute will\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   have their cases dismissed when the Commonwealth, through the Jefferson County Attorney, makes motions to dismiss those respective traffic citations.\" (Emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The County Attorney requested the circuit court to grant his petition and prohibit Judges Delahanty and Burke from taking any action based on Judge Delahanty's prior opinion declaring KRS 186.574(6) unconstitutional. The County Attorney also requested a writ directing and mandating that Judges Delahanty and Burke give full force and effect to the provisions of KRS 186.574(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In their response, Judges Delahanty and Burke contended that a writ was an inappropriate remedy. They noted that, if the October 2015 Order had been adverse to the County Attorney, the County Attorney could have either appealed the Order to the circuit court or requested a certification of the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the October 2015 Order had granted the County Attorney's motions to dismiss, however, Judges Delahanty and Burke alleged that none of the parties affected by it had received an adverse result. Therefore, the judges contended that there could be no showing of irreparable injury sufficient to grant a writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 22, 2016, the County Attorney moved the circuit court to enter a stay in all DSL cases pending before Judges Delahanty and Burke until final adjudication of the County Attorney's petition for a writ of prohibition and/or mandamus. The County Attorney stated that he had not previously requested a stay because Judge Delahanty had continued all DSL cases until the coming November. However, Judge Delahanty had recently orally informed\n   an Assistant County Attorney that he wanted the County Attorney to appear in front of him because he wanted to advance five of the DSL cases he had previously continued. The County Attorney alleged that Judge Delahanty had not given his office any information concerning which five cases he wanted to advance, why he wanted to advance those cases, or what matters would be taken up at the hearing. Despite the County Attorney's objections, Judge Delahanty held a hearing on the five DSL cases, at which he ordered that the County Attorney's office to refund any fees paid by the DSL defendants and continued those cases until March 3, 2016. The circuit court granted the County Attorney's motion for a stay on March 2, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 29, 2016, the circuit court entered an order granting the County Attorney's petition for a writ and vacating the portion of the October 2015 Order that declared KRS 186.574(6) unconstitutional. In its order, the circuit court found that the only issue that had been properly before Judge Delahanty when he entered the October 2015 Order was the County Attorney's motions to dismiss. Accordingly, the circuit court found that Judge Delahanty had been acting outside of his jurisdiction when he\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   ruled that KRS 186.574(6) was unconstitutional. The circuit court further found that petitioning the court for a writ of prohibition and/or mandamus was the appropriate-and only-avenue of redress for the County Attorney. While the circuit court declined to address whether KRS 186.574(6) passed constitutional muster, it delineated the appropriate steps that should be taken when analyzing the issue, should it ever properly appear before the district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Neither Judge Burke nor Judge Delahanty recognizes the validity of the DSL program. Their position is that Judge Delahanty's October 2015 Order declaring KRS 186.574(6) unconstitutional rendered the DSL program, as well as any other similar program in the Commonwealth, invalid. As it stands currently, traffic offenders whose cases are assigned to either Judge Delahanty or Judge Burke are not able to reap the benefit of KRS 186.574(6) and the DSL program. Against this backdrop, we consider whether the County Attorney sufficiently demonstrated the necessity of a writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"A writ of prohibition is an 'extraordinary remedy and we have always been cautious and conservative both in entertaining petitions for and in granting such relief.' \"\n   <em>\n    Grange Mut.

Because of the great caution that must be afforded when determining whether to grant a writ of prohibition, appellate courts abide by a \"strict standard\" in analyzing petitions for such writs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205484\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/792/#p795\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205484\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/792/#p795\">\n    at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Writs of prohibition may only be granted upon the petitioner showing that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) the lower court is proceeding or is about to proceed outside of its jurisdiction and there is no remedy through an application to an intermediate court; or (2) that the lower court is acting or is about to act erroneously, although within its jurisdiction, and there exists no adequate remedy by appeal or otherwise and great injustice and irreparable injury will result if the petition is not granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Hoskins v.

In the second class of writs, where a court is acting within its jurisdiction but erroneously, our Supreme Court has recognized a sub-category of \"certain special cases\" that merit remedy by a writ where \"a substantial miscarriage of justice will result if the lower court is proceeding erroneously, and correction of the error is necessary and appropriate in the interest of orderly judicial administration.\"\n   <em>\n    Bender\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10160223\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/343/799/#p800\">\n    343 S.W.2d at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App. 2008). Thus, in assessing jurisdiction for the purpose of deciding whether a writ is appropriate, we ask whether the judge was vested with the authority to act in the particular category of case at issue. If the judge had the authority to act in the kind of case at issue, the judge had subject-matter jurisdiction, and a writ is not available under the first category of writs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sitar v.

Because the circuit court concluded that jurisdiction was lacking, it did not analyze the substance of the other errors alleged by the County Attorney before granting the requested writ. However, the cases before Judge Delahanty involved traffic offenses. Section 113(6) of the Constitution of Kentucky (\"Ky. Const.\") states that: \"The district court shall be a court of limited jurisdiction and shall exercise original jurisdiction as may be provided by the General Assembly.\" Ky. Const. 113 (6). The General Assembly vested the district courts with subject-matter jurisdiction over traffic offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRS 24A.110. Therefore, Judge Delahanty had subject-matter jurisdiction to act on the cases before him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The errors alleged by the County Attorney in his writ petition concern the manner in which Judge Delahanty raised and decided the constitutionality of KRS 186.574(6), and his and Judge Burke's continued refusal to recognize the validity of KRS 186.574(6) in the traffic-related cases assigned to them. The alleged errors implicate not subject-matter jurisdiction, but rather implicate particular-case jurisdiction, which describes the situation when a court has subject-matter jurisdiction over a particular type or class of action, but incorrectly exercises its authority.\n   <em>\n    Masters v.

Although the County Attorney ardently\n   disagreed with the conclusion that KRS 186.574(6) was unconstitutional, Judge Delahanty granted the ultimate relief the County Attorney sought, dismissal of the charges. This left the County Attorney without the ability to appeal Judge Delahanty's decision to the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newkirk v.

First, the\n   <em>\n    Elk Horn\n   </em>\n   case came before the Kentucky Supreme Court as a constitutional challenge on equal protection grounds, an issue that was raised and litigated by the parties at the lower court. From the inception of the case, the\n   <em>\n    Elk Horn\n   </em>\n   parties were actively litigating the constitutionality of KRS 26A.300. Only after the Kentucky Court decided the constitutional issue posed by the parties, that KRS 26A.300 was unconstitutional because it violated equal protection, did it take up the separation of powers issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In this case, no actual litigant ever raised an issue with respect to KRS 186.574 's constitutionality. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Elk Horn\n   </em>\n   , there was no developed record for Judge Delahanty to rely on. Instead of confining himself to the existing record, Judge Delahanty actually directed certain matters to be added to the record for the purpose of taking up the constitutional issue and conducted his own factual inquiry, even going so far as to visit to the County Attorney's office to view a demonstration of the DSL program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This goes far beyond the situation in\n   <em>\n    Elk Horn\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, the constitutional issue the Kentucky Supreme Court raised in\n   <em>\n    Elk Horn\n   </em>\n   was a unique one that only the Kentucky Supreme Court could properly address because it concerned a statute that encroached on the Court's exercise of its appellate jurisdiction as provided by its rules. In contrast, Judge Delahanty\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raised issues that are much broader\n   than the limited issue considered by the Kentucky Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Elk Horn\n   </em>\n   . He questioned the public policy rational behind the statute; he concluded the statute violated Section 59 of the Kentucky Constitution, which bars the General Assembly from passing \"local or special acts concerning\" a series of subjects; he considered and applied our Rules of Professional Conduct regarding how the County Attorney advertised the DSL program; and he considered whether the statute violated either federal or state principles of equal protection because it did not have an exception to allow indigent individuals to participate in the program. We do not agree with Appellants that\n   <em>\n    Elk Horn\n   </em>\n   sanctions this type of wholesale, unprompted judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In fact, subsequent decisions by our Supreme Court continue to recognize the importance of judicial restraint in considering constitutional challenges, even ones raised by parties. In\n   <em>\n    W.B. v. Commonwealth, Cabinet for Health and Family Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094204\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/388/108/#p117\">\n    388 S.W.3d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 117 (Ky. 2012), the Kentucky Supreme Court cautioned against taking up constitutional issues that had not yet ripened into actual disputes. It explained that \"ripeness [ ] prevents courts from interfering with legislative enactments until it is necessary to do so, and thus enhances the quality of judicial decision-making by ensuring that cases present courts an adequate record to permit effective review and decision-making.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Even though Judge Delahanty has subject-matter jurisdiction over traffic violations, his jurisdiction is limited by the same confines that bind the entire judiciary. When Judge Delahanty issued the October 2015 Order, the only issues before him were the County Attorney's motions to dismiss the 2,300 pending DSL cases. While the Order did dispose of those cases as requested, it needlessly delved into issues concerning the constitutionality and ethical administration of the DSL program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   A review of the record makes it clear that these issues were not actually before the district court because no\n   <em>\n    party\n   </em>\n   to the cases raised the issues, and they were not necessary to the ultimate outcome of the cases before Judge Delahanty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"A judge's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   declaration of unconstitutionality is a derogation of the strong presumption of constitutionality accorded legislative enactments.\" 16 Am.

We cannot accept that this duty allowed Judge Delahanty to question the General Assembly's actual authority to enact KRS 186.574(6). When a trial judge is faced with a motion to dismiss in a criminal case, the central inquiry is whether, in moving to dismiss charges, the prosecutor is acting in bad faith or with impropriety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rinaldi v.

To the contrary, the record was clear that the County Attorney was acting consistent with the authority the General Assembly authorized in KRS 186.574(6). The actions Judge Delahanty questioned were those of the General Assembly in deciding to enact KRS 186.574(6), not the County Attorney in carrying out the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nevertheless, according to Appellants, after having studied the DSL program in depth, Judge Delahanty concluded that it would be \"clearly contrary to manifest public interest\" for the court to facilitate the program's operation by granting the County Attorney's motions to dismiss. Appellants maintain that Judge Delahanty acted within his authority because the County Attorney's Office profits from administering the DSL program. To support this contention, Appellants rely on\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/\">\n    446 U.S. 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/\">\n    64 L.Ed.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). We do not believe\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   actually supports the proposition for which it has been cited to us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   actually upheld the validity of a civil penalty even though the enforcement agency was permitted to keep a portion of the penalty. The Court explained that: \"The constitutional interests in accurate finding of facts and application of law, and in preserving a fair and open process for decision, are not to the same degree implicated if it is the prosecutor, and not the judge, who is offered an incentive for securing civil penalties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/\">\n    at 248-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   did recognize that due process could be violated in certain cases, the Court seemed most concerned about instances where the prosecutor would\n   <em>\n    personally\n   </em>\n   benefit. It pointed out that those facts were not present in\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   because, regardless of what the agency might recoup, the salary of the administrator was fixed by law. The\n   Court was also not convinced that agency recoupment would taint the process to such a degree to render the penalty scheme unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , courts have generally rejected facial challenges to laws that allow prosecutors' offices to obtain a financial benefit as part of their enforcement. For example, in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. County of Cumberland v. One 1990 Ford Thunderbird\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1345392\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/371/228/\">\n    371 N.J. Super. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1345392\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/371/228/\">\n    852 A.2d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2004), a New Jersey appellate court upheld a forfeiture law from which local prosecutors' offices profited. The court concluded that the law's challengers failed \"to overcome the presumption that public officials, when following statutorily established procedures, are proceeding in good faith and in a proper exercise of the power and discretion reposed in them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1125. In acknowledging legislative and executive-branch judgments underlying the adoption and implementation of the forfeiture laws at issue, the New Jersey court suggested that, in light of separation-of-powers considerations, the constitutional presumption that prosecutors were acting disinterestedly would be hard to overcome. It also indicated that \"[s]pecific allegations of overreaching or otherwise impermissible conduct or motives\" should be addressed as part of particular cases, not through a wholesale attack on the entire statutory scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1124-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Judge Delahanty concluded impermissible factors were inherent in all county-attorney operated traffic safety programs, including the DSL program. He made this determination on a very scant record without the benefit of any formal discovery. What was in the record indicated that information about the DSL program is made available to traffic violators. The violators choose whether they want to participate in the program. The County Attorney does not decide who to cite for traffic offenses; those decisions are made by the police officers. And, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the County Attorney has actually pressured any traffic offenders into participating in the program. Judge Delahanty's reasoning hinged largely on his conclusion that the County Attorney's ability to apportion part of the DSL program fee for his own budgetary needs necessarily undermined the public's confidence in the court system. However,\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   certainly does not invalidate all laws that allow enforcement agencies, like the County Attorney's Office, to profit. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , none of the prosecutors stand to profit individually from vigorous enforcement, and the prospect for improper influence as a general matter appears quite remote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Lastly, we cannot overlook the logical fallacy in Appellants' contentions that Judge Delahanty was duty bound to consider the constitutionality of KRS 186.574(6) and the DSL program before deciding whether to grant the County Attorney's motions to dismiss. Even though Appellants maintain that Judge Delahanty had such duty, he did not actually apply his determinations to the cases before him. In fact, Judge Delahanty granted the County Attorney's motions to dismiss, and allowed the County Attorney's Office to retain the program fees it received from the DSL program participants. The only cases affected by Judge Delahanty's declaration of unconstitutionality were\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   cases that came before him and presumably Judge Burke. This is a textbook example of an advisory opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Veith v.

The issue of constitutionality was not essential to the motions before him, had not been raised by any of the parties, and had no effect on his final disposition of those cases. It constituted nothing more than an advisory opinion, which no judge, even one with subject-matter jurisdiction, has the authority to issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Failure to apply proper burden\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Even if we assume for the sake of argument that Judge Delahanty had the authority to interject the constitutional question into the litigation, the manner in which he did so was improper. Judge Delahanty failed to apply longstanding and well-established case law requiring that any analysis regarding a statute's constitutionality must begin with one basic presumption: the statute is constitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Util.

Judge Delahanty notified the County Attorney-via email-that he intended to advance five pre-selected DSL cases, which he believed were representative of all the DSL cases. Judge Delahanty did not explain why he believed those five cases were representative of the 2,300 DSL cases. Most importantly, he did not inform the County Attorney that he intended to question him on the merits, procedures, and constitutionality of the DSL program. The County Attorney came to the October 1, 2015 hearing expecting only to address undisputed motions to dismiss the DSL cases. The County Attorney could only anticipate a relatively simple, cut-and-dry proceeding. Instead, he arrived at the hearing to face a judge who expressed clear disdain for KRS 186.574(6) and the DSL program. He faced a barrage of questions regarding the statute and its implementation, development, and application in Jefferson County and the other 119 counties across the Commonwealth, and its financial costs. Judge Delahanty undertook his own investigation into the DSL program and its administration. All of this was done without warning, and without providing the County Attorney with a meaningful opportunity to develop a record of his own. This is an error of grave magnitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    d.\n    <em>\n     Failure to join the Attorney General\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The lack of notice and a fair opportunity to be heard was not limited to the County Attorney.

The actual litigants whose cases were decided as a part of the order issued by Judge Delahanty were not the movants. The movant was the Jefferson County Attorney, acting in his official capacity. This Court has previously held that a county attorney whose official statutory duties are impaired by a district court's order has standing to bring a writ action in his or her official capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delahanty v.

Without hesitation, we decline this invitation. If we accepted it, we would be committing many of the same errors we have condemned. The only issue properly before us is simply to determine whether the circuit court correctly granted a writ. If the constitutional issues surrounding KRS 186.574(6) are to be decided, they should be decided only after having been raised by a litigant with standing, and after notice has been given to the Attorney General. Once properly raised before a trial court, those issues can be explored through discovery and briefing. Thereafter, each party can build a factual record that allows for meaningful appellate review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Having carefully reviewed the record as well as the applicable legal authority, we are thoroughly convinced that the County Attorney met the requirements for the issuance of a writ. The Appellants' actions in refusing to recognize the validity of the DSL program are without current justification. To date, the constitutionality of the DSL program and its authorizing statute have not been challenged by any person with legal standing and have not been litigated in accordance with our notions of due process. The procedural posture created by Judge Delahanty left the County Attorney without an adequate remedy by appeal. In the absence of relief, the County Attorney will not be able to administer the DSL program in accordance with his authority as defined by our General Assembly and thousands of individuals will be deprived of the right to participate in a\n   traffic safety program that the General Assembly decided would serve the public interest. In the absence of relief, the County Attorney, the citizens of this Commonwealth, and our system of justice would suffer great harm and injustice. Thus, we are confident that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the writ of prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   We affirm the Jefferson Circuit Court's decision issuing a Writ of Prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   ALL CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The statute does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    mandate the establishment of traffic safety programs by county attorneys.

This statement represents a flawed understanding of our Civil Rules. CR 58 provides that a signed judgment or order becomes effective when entered by the circuit court clerk. There is no Civil Rule that automatically delays the effectiveness of a judgment or order for ten days. The Rule to which Judge Delahanty was likely referencing is CR 62.01. However, CR 62.01 is not self-executing. A motion must be filed before a CR 62.01 stay is triggered. At the time Judge Delahanty refused to give effect to the circuit court's order, no motion had been filed. Therefore, contrary to Judge Delahanty's beliefs otherwise, the order was immediately binding on him. We explained as much in a prior published opinion dealing with a similar issue: \"Although the December 16, 1977 filing of a motion for a new trial suspended the judgment prospectively from that point until the motion was overruled on March 20, 1978, it is noted that between December 7 and December 16, 1977, the judgment was in full effect and deemed final and conclusive. Appellees could have abridged this period of time had they chosen to file their motion immediately upon the entry of the circuit court's judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     Hocker v.

By referencing KRS Chapter 26A, we did not place the Court's imprimatur on KRS 26A.300.

Our Rules of Professional Conduct permit the KBA's Ethics Committee to issue both informal and formal ethics opinions to provide clarity to members of the bar regarding what conduct is permissible by a licensed attorney. The procedure for this is set out in SCR 3.530. Furthermore, attorney discipline matters are overseen exclusively by the Kentucky Supreme Court. Neither the district court nor this Court is vested with any authority whatsoever in matters of attorney discipline or conduct. That authority belongs exclusively to the KBA and the Kentucky Supreme Court. As such, we will not engage in any further discussion of the portions of Judge Delahanty's opinion that relate to our Rules of Professional Conduct.

There was no evidence presented that any other person sought a waiver. Moreover, there is nothing in the record concerning whether fee waivers are granted in the other counties that have similar programs. Important issues like equal protection and due process should not be decided based on the type of speculation and conjecture that the district court engaged in the cases that were before it. Additionally, while it might be unconstitutional for the County Attorney to refuse to grant a fee waiver to an indigent person, this type of challenge would be one to the statute and DSL program \"as applied.\" An indigent person who was denied a fee waiver could petition the district court for relief. The fact that no such person has done so to date is not a legally justifiable reason to strike the entire enabling statute and the DSL program on constitutional grounds. If an indigent person is denied access to the DSL program, he or she can petition the district court for relief. \"It should be no great burden for a court to make such indigency determinations in pretrial diversion cases, should a prosecutor not exercise his or her discretion independently to waive payment of any or all fees without court involvement.\"\n    <em>\n     Mueller v.
