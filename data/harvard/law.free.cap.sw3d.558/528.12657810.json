In Point I, Movant argues the motion court clearly erred in denying his motion for post-conviction relief due to a conflict of interest in which abandonment resulted, without an abandonment hearing. In Point II, Movant argues the motion court abused its discretion in denying his motion for change of judge due to an inherent conflict of interest and/or meeting of the minds between the judge and post-conviction counsel. We affirm the judgment as to Point I. We dismiss Point II for failure to comply with the mandatory briefing requirements of Rule 84.04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a jury trial, Movant was convicted of first-degree assault, in violation of Section 565.050;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   armed criminal action, in violation of Section 571.015; and victim tampering, in violation of Section 575.270.2. Movant was sentenced to consecutive terms of thirty years for the assault conviction, thirty years for the armed criminal action conviction, and seven years for the victim tampering conviction. This Court affirmed the convictions and sentences on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

One month later, post-conviction counsel timely filed a statement in lieu of filing an amended motion along with a request for an evidentiary hearing. The statement provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Undersigned counsel has reviewed the record in St. Louis City Cause Number 021-2396, including the transcript and legal file, as well as information supplied by Movant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Undersigned counsel has investigated all allegations raised by Movant, in addition to those in Movant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion, and concluded, prior to the date that Movant's amended motion would be due, that there are no additional cognizable grounds to raise before this Court;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Undersigned counsel has consulted Movant, and Movant wishes to proceed on his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The statement included Movant's signature. Thereafter, the motion court granted post-conviction counsel's request for an evidentiary hearing on the following claims: failure to call Movant's girlfriend as an alibi witness, failure to obtain discovery of prior convictions of witnesses for the State, and a purported conflict of interest regarding defense counsel and Movant's girlfriend. The motion court denied an evidentiary hearing as to Movant's remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the day of the evidentiary hearing, post-conviction counsel filed a memorandum\n   waiving the three claims for which the motion court granted the evidentiary hearing and submitting the Movant's remaining claims as pled in his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for post-conviction relief. Thereafter, the motion court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law, denying Movant's post-conviction relief motion.

App. E.D. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 8, 2017, Movant filed a motion for post-conviction relief due to abandonment pursuant to Rule 29.15 based on an actual conflict of interest in which abandonment resulted. Movant alleged post-conviction counsel, \"without movant's knowledge and voluntary consent filed a motion with this court waiving the exact claims that movant was subsequently granted a hearing on.\" Thus, Movant was abandoned by post-conviction counsel because he was deprived of a meaningful review of his claims. Movant alleged post-conviction counsel's actions were motivated by \"[m]aybe hatred of movant, numerous disagreements, the fact that [post-conviction counsel] didn't want to be on movant's case anymore, and even counsel's desire to leave the state.\" Additionally, Movant filed a motion for change of judge, arguing there was an \"[inherent] conflict of interest and meeting of the minds\" between post-conviction counsel and the motion court judge because the judge allowed post-conviction counsel to waive the claims without questioning counsel's actions or inquiring into Movant's knowledge of the waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The motion court subsequently entered the following judgment and order: \"Movant-defendant's successive motion for relief under Rule 29.15 on the ground of abandonment is denied and dismissed with prejudice. The Court file conclusively refutes the claim of abandonment based on counsel's submitting pro se claims without evidentiary hearing.\" The motion court also ordered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Movant Chatman has filed a motion to recuse the Court, apparently by way of attacking the statement in lieu of amended motion and waiver of evidentiary hearing on Chatman's motion under Rule 29.15, filed in 2005, heard and disposed by this Court in 2006, with affirmance by the Court of Appeals in 2008. There are no grounds whatever for recusal and movant is not entitled to an automatic change of judge. The Court's file reflects no abandonment by PCR counsel.

A narrow exception to this rule allows a post-conviction court to retain jurisdiction beyond the thirty days where facts are pleaded constituting a claim of abandonment by post-conviction counsel.\n   <em>\n    Sittner v.

App. E.D. 2013). Here, the motion court denied Movant's motion on the basis of Rule 29.15(l), which precludes it from entertaining successive motions. A valid claim of abandonment by post-conviction counsel creates an exception to Rule 29.15(l).\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

An argument should advise the appellate court how principles of law and the facts of the case interact. Rule 84.04(e);\n   <em>\n    Washington v. Zinn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303363\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/286/828/#p831\">\n    286 S.W.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 831 (Mo.

Here, Movant's argument contains only a bare conclusion that a conflict of interest existed without linking the conclusion to specific evidence in the record and without providing any rationale supporting the conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

App. E.D. 2009). An argument that fails to comply with Rule 84.04(e) preserves nothing for appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303288\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/286/818/#p821\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303288\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/286/818/#p821\">\n    at 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, even if a conflict of interest existed, there is no evidence that the conflict would constitute \"abandonment,\" as defined by our appellate courts. The record conclusively establishes that post-conviction counsel timely filed a statement in lieu of filing an amended motion, as permitted by Rule 29.15(e). On April 5, 2005, post-conviction counsel entered her appearance and requested additional time to file an amended motion. One month later, post-conviction counsel timely filed the statement in lieu of filing an amended motion. The statement provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Undersigned counsel has reviewed the record in St. Louis City Cause Number 021-2396, including the transcript and legal file, as well as information supplied by Movant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Undersigned counsel has investigated all allegations raised by Movant, in addition to those in Movant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion, and concluded, prior to the date that Movant's amended motion would be due, that there are no additional cognizable grounds to raise before this Court;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Undersigned counsel has consulted Movant, and Movant wishes to proceed on his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The statement included Movant's signature, indicating counsel presented it to Movant prior to filing. Because post-conviction counsel reviewed the record in the underlying case, investigated all allegations raised by Movant, determined there were no additional grounds to be raised, and presented the statement to Movant prior to filing, counsel complied with the requirements of Rule 29.15(e) and provided a meaningful review of Movant's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6853087\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/467/367/#p372\">\n    467 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   372 ;\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300103\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/302/739/#p742\">\n    302 S.W.3d at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding movant was not abandoned by post-conviction counsel because the statement in lieu of an amended motion stated counsel reviewed the record in the underlying case, investigated all allegations raised by the movant, and concluded there were no additional grounds to be raised). As such, the trial court did not err by failing to inquire,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , into post-conviction counsel's performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Movant contends post-conviction counsel \"fraudulently\" waived the claims for which he was granted an evidentiary hearing, and such actions were due to the alleged conflict between Movant and counsel.

Movant cannot escape the prohibition against successive Rule 29.15 motions by characterizing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as abandonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, we find the motion court did not err in denying Movant's motion for post-conviction relief due to abandonment because Movant failed to allege any facts supporting his argument that a conflict of interest existed between Movant and post-conviction counsel, in violation of Rule 84.04(e). Furthermore, the record conclusively refutes that post-conviction counsel failed to comply with Rule 29.15(e), and, thus, Movant was not abandoned.

App. W.D. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Movant's Point II violates Rule 84.04(e) because it fails to set forth the applicable standard of review, presents no legal argument, and contains no citations to relevant legal authority. Movant's argument does not provide the applicable standard of review for the denial of a motion for change of judge as required by Rule 84.04(e). Nor does the argument \"explain why, in the context of the case, the law supports the claim of reversible error.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Fritz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8396075\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/243/484/#p487\">\n    243 S.W.3d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 487 (Mo. App. E.D. 2007). As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he argument should develop the claim of error by showing the interaction between the relevant principles of law and the facts of the particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

App. E.D. 2009). If a party fails to support a contention with relevant authority or argument beyond conclusions, the point is considered abandoned.\n   <em>\n    Beck v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8470063\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/199/797/#p798\">\n    199 S.W.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 798 (Mo. App. E.D. 2006). Here, Movant merely concludes that because the judge never questioned post-conviction counsel's waiver of the claims, there was an \"[inherent] conflict of interest, a meeting of the minds [between the judge and post-conviction counsel], bias and prejudice on the part of\n   the judge,\" which rises to the level of a due process violation. However, Movant fails to point to any specific evidence or testimony in the record, other than the judge's failure to question the waiver, demonstrating a factual basis to support his claim that there was a conflict of interest, that the judge was biased, or that Movant was prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , 286 S.W.3d at 821.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Moreover, Movant's point contains no citations to relevant legal authority. \"Failure to cite relevant authority supporting the point or to explain the failure to do so preserves nothing for review.\"\n   <em>\n    Thornton v. City of Kirkwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8979036\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/161/916/#p920\">\n    161 S.W.3d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 920 (Mo. App. E.D. 2005). Here, Movant only cites to one case, which he relies on to explain the procedure of filing a motion to recuse. However, Movant fails to provide any authority advising this Court of the legal grounds that would support the disqualification of a judge. Nor does Movant provide any legal authority to support his argument that the judge should be disqualified for failing to question counsel's waiver of claims in his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion. We decline to address arguments that are not sufficiently developed as it would require this Court to \"assume the role of advocate for a party by attempting to develop an appellate argument the party has failed to set forth itself,\" which, in turn, \"would run the risk of creating poor precedent and manipulating the adversarial process.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodieck v.
