However, as the Court has determined that the dispositive issue on appeal is whether the record contains sufficient evidence to sustain the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law that T.P. is seriously developmentally disabled, we address only this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AB-\">\u00b63 T.P. is a developmentally disabled woman. In January 2006, the State of Montana\u2019s Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) petitioned for the involuntary commitment of T.P. to MDC. DPHHS and T.P. stipulated to her commitment to MDC for a period not to exceed ninety days. Based on this stipulation, on February 1, 2006, the District Court entered an order finding that T.P. had behaviors posing an imminent risk of serious harm to herself or others and that she could not be safely and effectively habilitated in community-based services at that time. The court concluded that T.P. was seriously developmentally disabled, and she was committed to MDC. Under \u00a7\u00a7 53-20-125(1)0\u00bb), 53-20-125(8), MCA (2005), the \u201cseriously developmentally disabled\u201d determination is a prerequisite for committing or recommitting a person to MDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u00b64 On May 1,2006, DPHHS petitioned for T.P.\u2019s recommitment. The petition stated that Larry LeRoux, the Qualified Mental Retardation Professional (QMRP) assigned to T.P., had requested the petition through QMRP Bobbie Janacaro (Janacaro). The petition alleged, among other things, that T.P. continued to be seriously developmentally disabled and in need of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\u00b65 Attached to the petition was an individual treatment plan from early March 2006 (March Plan) and a QMRP report written by Janacaro, dated April 27, 2006 (Janacaro\u2019s Report). The Janacaro Report stated T.P. \u201cis currently not able [sic] engaging in behaviors that are harmful to herself due to the limitations/supervision provided in her current living environment, along with medication adjustments.\u201d Under the heading \u201c[d]escribe behaviors that pose an imminent risk of serious harm to others,\u201d the report stated \u201c[n]one at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>this time due to environment, [sic] (structure and supervision).\u201d Under the heading of \u201cpotential for risk to self,\u201d it stated \u201c[n]one at this time. However, potential is high if given opportunity.\u201d Under the heading of potential for risk to others, the report stated \u201c[potential is high if given opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b66 As required by statute, the District Court referred the petition to the Residential Facility Screening Team (RFST). The RFST determined T.P. was seriously developmentally disabled and recommended her recommitment. The RFST Report stated that T.P. had forty-one incidents of verbal aggression, thirty-four incidents of environmental disruption, thirteen incidents of physical aggression and four incidents of deliberate self-harm while at MDC. The RFST Report was devoid of any description of the listed incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b67 The District Court held a hearing on the petition for T.P.\u2019s recommitment on September 6, 2006. Daphne Crosbie, DPHHS representative and RFST chairwoman, was the sole witness in support of T.P.\u2019s recommitment. Crosbie testified that \u201cthe document [the RFST] looked at was the ... treatment plan dated 5/2/06\u201d (May Plan). This May Plan had not been filed with the petition in District Court, nor was it admitted into evidence at the hearing. Thus, the District Court never saw the May Plan. Crosbie herself could not provide any information regarding the reported incidents involving T.P., other than a statement that the incidents all occurred in February, the month T.P. was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b68 T.P. was not present at the hearing. An advocacy specialist with the Montana Advocacy Program testified in opposition to T.P.\u2019s recommitment. Her testimony is not pertinent to the issue we address here.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b69 On October 2, 2006, the District Court entered its order recommitting T.P. for one year or until a suitable placement in a less restrictive environment could be obtained. Among other things, it determined T.P. has behaviors that pose an imminent risk of serious harm to herself or others and is seriously developmentally disabled. T.P. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u00b610 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s determination in a civil commitment, case to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct.\u201d <em>In re </em>T.S.D., 2005 MT 35, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 82, \u00b6 13,107 P.3d 481, \u00b6 13. To determine whether a finding is clearly erroneous, we apply the following three-part test: (1) we review the record to see if the findings are supported by substantial evidence; (2) if the findings are supported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>evidence, we determine if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; (3) if substantial evidence exists and the effect of the evidence was not misapprehended, we may determine that a finding is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made. <em>See In re G.M., </em>2008 MT 200, \u00b6 22, 344 Mont. 87, \u00b6 22,186 P.3d 229, \u00b6 22; <em>In re </em>T.S.D., \u00b6 13; <em>Matter of Mental Health of L.C.B., </em>253 Mont. 1, 6, 830 P.2d 1299, 1302 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b611 A district court may recommit a person to MDC only if the court determines he or she continues to be \u201cseriously developmentally disabled\u201d and in need of continued commitment to MDC. Section 53-20-128(8), MCA (2005). \u201cSeriously developmentally disabled\u201d means a person who \u201chas a developmental disability,\u201d is \u201cimpaired in cognitive functioning,\u201d and cannot be safely and effectively habilitated in community-based services because of \u201cbehaviors that pose an imminent risk of serious harm to self or others[.]\u201d Section 53-20-102(15), MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b612 No dispute exists that T.P. has a developmental disability and is impaired in her cognitive functioning. T.P. challenges the District Court\u2019s finding that she could not be safely or effectively habilitated in community-based services because she has behaviors posing an imminent risk of serious harm to herself or others. T.P. asserts the evidence does not support this finding and maintains that general statements regarding \u201cphysical aggression\u201d and \u201cdeliberate self harm,\u201d without more, do not support a finding of actual or potential serious harm. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b613 As set forth above, the first inquiry under the clearly erroneous testis whether substantial evidence supports a challenged finding. <em>See In re T.S.D., </em>\u00b6 13; <em>In re Mental Health ofL.C.B., </em>253 Mont, at 6, 830 P.2d at 1302. The District Court did not set forth in its findings of fact what evidence it considered in reaching the ultimate question of whether T.P. was seriously developmentally disabled. Nor did the District Court file an opinion or memorandum of decision explaining how it reached its decision that T.P. was seriously developmentally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b614 This Court has recently concluded that, given the district court\u2019s role in civil commitment proceedings, the district court may consider the contents of reports filed according to statute. As noted in <em>In re G.M., </em>\u00b6 32, the district court must view all potentially relevant information in order to determine the treatment and habilitation needs of the respondent, citing <em>In re Mental Health ofL.C.B., </em>253 Mont, at 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>830 P.2d at 1303; \u00a7 53-20-101, MCA (2005). Further, \u00a7 53-20-128(6), MCA, grants the court authority to order a recommitment based on the filed reports when the petitioner does not request a hearing. Although the March Plan, Janacaro\u2019s Report, and the RFST Report were not formally offered into evidence, these documents were filed with the District Court before the hearing as required by statute and were available to the court and both parties. Neither party objected to the court\u2019s considering them. These reports provided relevant information bearing on the issue at hand. Therefore, these documents could be considered by the District Court in making its findings of fact. <em>In re </em>G.M., <em>\u00b6 </em>34.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b615 Nevertheless, after a review of the reports and the testimony at the hearing, we conclude that DPHHS did not present to the District Court substantial evidence that T.P. posed an imminent risk of serious harm to herself or others. The March Plan contained mostly T.P.\u2019s history and one sentence stating that \u201c[sjince her admittance to MDC [T.P.] has engaged in behaviors of verbal and physical aggression, and property destruction.\u201d Janacaro\u2019s Report revealed that T.P. had not engaged in behaviors that posed an imminent risk of serious harm to herself or others. As for her potential to cause serious harm to others, Janacaro reported \u201c[potential is high if given opportunity.\u201d This statement alone does not constitute substantial evidence to recommit a person to a residential facility. The incident reports introduced into evidence at the hearing did not demonstrate T.P.\u2019s harmfulness to herself or others. These reports combined do not constitute substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b616  Crosbie merely stated that \u201cas of that time when [T.P.\u2019s treatment team] looked at her in May, she had-then had 13 incidences of physical aggression\u201d and four incidents of deliberate self-harm at MDC. Crosbie conceded that the RFST does not have operational definitions of the terms \u201cphysical aggression\u201d or \u201cserious harm.\u201d The substance of Crosbie\u2019s testimony was that she herself did not know what T.P. had done, and the RFST members had assumed she had some physical contact with someone. Crosbie suggested that the RFST merely accepted, without examination of the facts, the conclusions of T.P.\u2019s treatment planning team set forth in the May Plan. This cursory review is not sufficient to recommit a person to MDC, particularly when the supporting documentation is not all before the court and what is before the court is unsubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b617  The testimony at the hearing did not explain how T.P.\u2019s problems would disqualify her from a community placement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>reports before the District Court indicate that structure, supervision and medication provided to T.P. at MDC from late February to September 2006 assisted her to the point where she did not exhibit behaviors that posed imminent risk of serious harm to herself or others. No evidence was presented that community-based services lack structure, supervision and medication. Thus, neither the District Court nor this Court has any evidence upon which to base a finding of fact that T.P.\u2019s incidents of aggression or harm make her a threat to herself or anyone who lives with her in a community setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b618  The District Court\u2019s finding of fact that T.P. posed an imminent risk of serious harm to herself or others, such that she could not be habilitated in community-based services, is clearly erroneous as it is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>In re T.S.D., </em>\u00b6 13; <em>In re Mental Health ofL.C.B., </em>253 Mont, at 6,830 P.2d at 1302. The District Court erred in recommitting T.P. to MDC as a seriously developmentally disabled person.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b619 We reverse and remand with instructions to vacate the recommitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b620 Pursuant to M. R. App. P. 21(2), the Clerk of this Court shall issue remittitur immediately.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b179-8\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AAy\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">\u00b621 I joined Chief Justice Grays concurring Opinion in <em>In re G.M., </em>2008 MT 200, 344 Mont. 87, 186 P.3d 229, and I join her concurring Opinion in the instant case. I have grave concerns about any statutory scheme that allows the State to deprive a person of his or her liberty and dignity on the basis of oral and written hearsay; on documents not in evidence; on the testimony of persons who have no direct knowledge of matters and incidents about which they are testifying; on reports which contain undefined, confusing, inconsistently used, and purely subjective terminology; and where the person who is the subject of the proceeding may not even be present. That the persons who are subjected to this statutory scheme are among the least able to defend themselves-not to mention, for far too long, the least defended-exacerbates my anxiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">\u00b622 I urge the Legislature to revisit the entirety of Title 53, chapter 20, and to enact appropriate amendments and revisions to this statutory scheme so as to insure procedural and substantive due process to developmentally disabled persons who are involuntarily committed and recommitted. Indeed, it is fair to point out that we would not permit persons accused of crimes to be charged, tried and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>imprisoned on the sorts of procedures and evidence which the State routinely uses to commit and recommit persons whose only \u201coffense\u201d is their neurologically disabling condition. Developmentally disabled persons are entitled to no less protection of their fundamental constitutional rights to due process of law, to individual dignity, and to seek safety, health and happiness<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> than are persons who violate society\u2019s criminal laws. Our paternalistic attitude toward and manner of dealing with developmentally disabled persons simply must change. \u00b623 That said, unless and until such a legislative reexamination of Title 53, chapter 20, occurs, it will be up to defense counsel to aggressively challenge these statutes and the processes and procedures by which developmentally disabled persons are involuntarily institutionalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b624 With these observations, I concur in Chief Justice Gray\u2019s Concurrence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b180-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the Concurrence of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\"> These rights are protected under Article II, Sections 17, 4 and 3, respectively, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b180-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"ANe\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b625 I concur in the Court\u2019s resolution of this case, but only in limited portions of the Opinion. In my concurring opinion in <em>G.M., </em>\u00b6 74 (Gray, C.J., concurring), I observed that-contrary to certain statements by the Court and the Dissent in that cas <em>e-Mental Health ofL.C.B. </em>addressed the inapplicability of the \u201ccriminal law exclusionary rule\u201d to testimony and evidence admitted at a hearing, and did not state that a district court in an involuntary commitment proceeding may view all potentially relevant information in the universe. Here, I write separately to expand on my views that certain evidentiary requirements apply in a commitment or recommitment hearing, documents merely filed with a clerk of court are not \u201cevidence\u201d of their contents in the context of such a hearing, and a district court may not properly base its findings on filed documents that are not admitted into evidence at a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u00b626 The first inquiry under the clearly erroneous test is whether substantial evidence supports a challenged finding. <em>See In re T.S.D., </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Mental Health of L.C.B., </em>253 Mont, at 6, 830 P.2d at 1302. Section 26-1-101(2), MCA, defines \u201cevidence\u201d as \u201cthe means of ascertaining in a judicial proceeding the truth respecting a question of fact, including but not limited to witness testimony, writings, physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>objects, or other things presented to the senses.\u201d The initial burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is on the party who would be defeated if no evidence were given on either side. Section 26-1-401, MCA. Thus, the party asserting a claim for relief-here, the State-bears the burden of producing evidence in support of its claim that T.P. should be recommitted. <em>See Envir. Info. Center v. Dep. of Envir. Qual., </em>2005 MT 96, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 502, \u00b6 14,112 P.3d 964, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). Similarly, the burdens of persuasion and proof are on the party-here, the State-asserting the facts essential to the relief being claimed. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 26-1-402 and -403, MCA. \u201cProof\u2019 is the establishment of a fact by evidence. Section 26-1-101(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b627 With certain exceptions not relevant here, the Montana Rules of Evidence apply to all proceedings in Montana courts. M. R. Evid. 101(a); see <em>also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 53-20-112(1) and 53-21-115(7), MCA (2005). The Montana Rules of Evidence address such matters as relevance, hearsay, authentication and identification, and the contents of writings and recordings. <em>See </em>M. R. Evid. 401-403 and 801-1008. The court determines all preliminary questions concerning the admissibility of evidence. M. R. Evid. 104(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b628 <em>Mental Health ofL.C.B. </em>cited to a prior involuntary commitment case relying on \u00a7 53-20-101(1), MCA, and the Court likewise cites to that statute in \u00b6 14. <em>See Mental Health ofL.C.B., </em>253 Mont, at 7, 830 P.2d at 1303. Section 53-20-101(1), MCA, which has not changed substantively since its enactment in 1975, reads \u201c[t]he purpose of this part is to: (1) secure for each person who may be a person with developmental disabilities such treatment and habilitation as will be suited to the needs of the person and to assure that such treatment and habilitation are skillfully and humanely administered with full respect for the person\u2019s dignity and personal integrity.\u201d I have no quarrel with our reliance in <em>Mental Health ofL.C.B. </em>on \u00a7 53-20-101(1), MCA, in distinguishing involuntary commitment cases from criminal cases for purposes of determining the applicability of the exclusionary rule. I adamantly disagree, however, with the Court\u2019s apparent reasoning in \u00b6 14 that the statutory subsection has any bearing on whether, under the clearly erroneous test which the Court purports to apply, the <em>evidence </em>is sufficient to support a trial court\u2019s findings. <em>In re </em>T.S.D., \u00b6 13; <em>Mental Health ofL. C.B., </em>253 Mont, at 6,830 P.2d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"A-i_\">\u00b629 Further, while \u00a7 53-20-128(6), MCA (2005), contemplates the recommitment of a person without a hearing if no hearing is requested or held, the fact is that a hearing actually occurred here. In the context of a hearing where the Montana Rules of Evidence apply, as discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>above, I cannot conceive that the Legislature intended that a person could be involuntarily committed or recommitted to the MDC for a full year after a hearing at which he or she had no meaningful opportunity to challenge the evidentiary bases for the allegations supporting the petition for commitment or recommitment. Stated differently, my view is that an involuntary commitment hearing is not merely a procedural nicety, but the only chance for a person facing a loss of liberty to put the State to its proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b630 Based on the foregoing, I agree with the Court\u2019s observations in \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 16 that, the May Plan having not been offered into evidence nor even filed, Crosbie\u2019s testimony regarding the May Plan was insufficient to support findings necessary for T.P.\u2019s recommitment. I disagree with the Court\u2019s reasoning that the District Court could have properly based its findings on the March Plan, Janacaro\u2019s Report and the RFST Report, which were neither introduced nor admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b631 I concur in the Court\u2019s determination that the District Court erred in finding T.P. \u201cseriously developmental^ disabled\u201d and in the disposition of this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-6\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the foregoing special concurrence of CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
