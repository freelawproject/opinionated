We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-20\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-21\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court correctly grant Willis\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction*!</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b64 Trooper Darlene Lee of the Montana Highway Patrol responded on October 2, 2006, to an accident scene on Interstate 90 near the exit to Belgrade, Montana. A dispatcher had received a report of the accident at 3:15 a.m. Trooper Lee arrived at the site of the accident to find that a van pulling a trailer loaded with personal belongings had rolled over. The van sustained significant damage and the accident had left the trailer completely demolished. An ambulance had taken the van\u2019s driver to the Bozeman Deaconess Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b65 Deputies from the Gallatin County Sheriffs Office inspected the scene of the accident. The deputies found debris from a maroon vehicle at the site of the accident. The deputies also found a license plate in the area. A search of the license plate\u2019s number returned the plate to a maroon Volvo semi-truck registered in British Columbia, Canada. The officers placed a statewide \u201cAttempt to Locate\u201d on the semi-truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b66 Willis contacted the 911 dispatcher at approximately 12:40 p.m. on October 2, 2006, and reported that he had been involved in a wreck earlier that morning. Willis spoke over the phone with Trooper Lee, but refused to provide Lee with his last name or his location. Willis hung up after a brief exchange with Trooper Lee. Willis called again ten minutes later and spoke with another officer. Willis told the officer that he had hit debris in the roadway, but Willis denied any involvement in an accident. Willis told the officer that he was at a rest stop on Interstate 90 just east of Big Timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b67 Trooper J.V. Moody found Willis and Willis\u2019s semi-truck at the rest stop. Trooper Moody investigated Willis\u2019s semi-truck. The semi-truck had paint marks on it that appeared to match the paint from the trailer involved in the accident. Another officer searched the semi-truck with a canine. Trooper Moody questioned Willis concerning the accident. Trooper Moody did not provide Willis with <em>Miranda </em>warnings before asking him questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\u00b68 Officers took Willis to the Sweetgrass County Sheriffs Office at approximately 3:00 p.m. on October 2, 2006. Trooper Moody conducted a taped interrogation of Willis at 3:15 p.m. Trooper Moody advised Willis of his rights before asking him questions about the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">\u00b69 The State charged Willis with failing to stop at an injury accident, failing to give aid, and driving while his driver\u2019s license was suspended. The State filed its complaint alleging these three misdemeanors in the Justice Court for Gallatin County. Willis filed a motion to suppress any statements made by Willis to Trooper Lee or Trooper Moody. Willis asserted that Trooper Moody effectively had arrested him at the rest stop near Big Timber. Willis alleged that Trooper Moody and Trooper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Lee illegally had obtained his statements during the questioning at the rest stop and the subsequent questioning at the Sweetgrass County Sheriffs office. The Justice Court granted Willis\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b610 The State appealed the Justice Court\u2019s ruling to the District Court. Willis filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the District Court lacked jurisdiction. The District Court granted Willis\u2019s motion to dismiss. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b611 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case. <em>State v. Rensvold, </em>2006 MT 146, \u00b6 14, 332 Mont. 392, \u00b6 14,139 P.3d 154, \u00b6 14. A district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to dismiss is based on a conclusion of law that we review for correctness. <em>State v. Strizich, </em>286 Mont. 1, 5, 952 P.2d 1365, 1367 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b612 <em>Did the District Court correctly grant Willis\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction!</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">\u00b613 The State argues on appeal that the District Court precluded the State from exercising its statutory right to appeal from an adverse ruling on a suppression motion. The State asserts that the District Court\u2019s determination that the State first had to pursue Willis to trial in Justice Court forces the State to risk an acquittal and lose the right to appeal. Willis argues that the State attempted to have the District Court conduct an appellate review of the Justice Court\u2019s order suppressing Willis\u2019s statements. Willis contends that the District Court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the Justice Court\u2019s order and correctly dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">\u00b614 We have held that \u201ca district court does not have <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction to review a justice court order suppressing evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Kesler, </em>228 Mont. 242, 246, 741 P.2d 791, 794 (1987) (emphasis added). We confirmed in <em>Kesler, </em>however, that the State has a statutory right to appeal an adverse ruling in justice court regarding the suppression of evidence to a district court. <em>Kesler, </em>228 Mont, at 245,741 P.2d at 793. We noted that \u00a7 46-20-103(2), MCA, sets forth the orders or judgments in a criminal case from which the State may appeal from a lower court to a higher court. <em>Kesler, </em>228 Mont, at 244-45, 741 P.2d at 793. Section 46-20-103(2), MCA, includes orders suppressing evidence. We determined in <em>Kesler </em>that the clear intent of the statute that governs appeals from justice court, \u00a7 46-17-311, MCA, requires simply that all appeals from justice court to district court proceed as trials de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>novo. <em>Kesler, </em>228 Mont, at 245, 741 P.2d at 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b615 The District Court determined that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rensvold </em>provides that a defendant has an absolute right to two trials de novo. The District Court determined that the State\u2019s right to appeal as set forth in \u00a7 46-20-103, MCA, applies only in those cases where a justice court\u2019s suppression order \u201ccauses the destruction\u201d of the State\u2019s case. The court reached this conclusion based upon the Commission Comment to \u00a7 46-20-103, MCA. The comment states that \u201c[t]he dismissing of a warrant, suppressing evidence or suppressing an admission or confession, as well as changing the venue of the trial, may result in the destruction of the state\u2019s case and should be made the basis of an appeal by the state.\u201d The District Court determined that in the absence of this \u201cdestruction\u201d the State had to proceed to trial in the Justice Court before the District Court could acquire jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b616 We faced in <em>Rensvold </em>a situation where the State had failed to appear at an omnibus hearing scheduled in justice court. <em>Rensvold, </em>\u00b6 5. The justice court dismissed the charge against Rensvold without prejudice. <em>Rensvold, </em>\u00b6 5. The State did not attempt to re-file the charge injustice court, but instead filed a notice of appeal to the district court. <em>Rensvold, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The district court dismissed the State\u2019s appeal, and the State appealed to this Court. <em>Rensvold, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13. We upheld the district court\u2019s ruling on the basis that the State\u2019s failure to prosecute the case injustice court violated Rensvold\u2019s statutory and constitutional right to two jury trials. <em>Rensvold, </em>\u00b6 32. We concluded, \u201con the facts ...\u201d particular to Rensvold\u2019s case, that the district court did not err when it dismissed the State\u2019s appeal. <em>Rensvold, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31, 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b617 We similarly determined that the State could not appeal a justice court\u2019s ruling in <em>Strizich. </em>Our decision in <em>Strizich </em>considered whether the State could appeal a justice court\u2019s ruling on a State-filed motion in limine that sought to secure the admission at trial of results from a preliminary breath test (PBT) for alcohol. <em>Strizich, </em>286 Mont, at 3, 952 P.2d at 1366. We concluded in <em>Strizich </em>that the State\u2019s statutory right to appeal a justice court\u2019s ruling did not extend to an order \u201cdetermining that PBT results are not substantive evidence ....\u201d <em>Strizich, </em>286 Mont, at 11,13, 952 P.2d at 1371-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u00b618 We clarified that orders \u201csuppressing evidence\u201d consist of orders that exclude evidence on the grounds that the State illegally has obtained the evidence. We stated that orders \u201csuppressing evidence\u201d do not include pretrial orders that exclude evidence based on the Rules of Evidence, such as relevancy, probative value, or statutory inadmissibility. <em>Strizich, </em>286 Mont, at 11, 952 P.2d at 1371. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>recognized that to allow the State to appeal from any adverse ruling on the admissibility of evidence injustice court would empower the State to avoid justice court jurisdiction \u201canytime it decides it would be tactically advantageous to do so.\u201d <em>Strizich, </em>286 Mont, at 10,952 P.2d at 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b619 The District Court\u2019s determination that the State could not appeal the Justice Court\u2019s ruling unless it resulted in the \u201cdestruction\u201d of the State\u2019s case presents this Court with an argument similar to the one we considered in <em>State v. Yarns, 252 </em>Mont. 45, 826 P.2d 543 (1992), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Strizich, </em>286 Mont, at 11, 952 P.2d at 1371. The district court in <em>Yams </em>denied an appeal by the State from the justice court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of a videotape. <em>Yarns, 252 </em>Mont, at 47-48, 826 P.2d at 544-45. The district court recognized that the justice court\u2019s ruling constituted an order \u201csuppressing evidence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 46-20-103(2), MCA. <em>Yams, </em>252 Mont, at 50,826 P.2d at 546. The district court concluded that the State could not appeal the ruling, however, because the ruling did not substantially impair or seriously impede the State\u2019s ability to prosecute the case. <em>Yarns, 252 </em>Mont, at 50, 826 P.2d at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b620 We confirmed in <em>Yarns </em>that a district court cannot condition the State\u2019s right to appeal upon a showing that a suppression order substantially impaired the ability to prosecute the case. <em>Yarns, 252 </em>Mont, at 51, 826 P.2d at 547. We later limited the extent of our holding in <em>Yarns </em>and made clear that orders \u201csuppressing evidence\u201d do not include orders that exclude evidence on such bases as relevancy or statutory inadmissibility. <em>Strizich, </em>286 Mont, at 11, 952 P.2d at 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"AqB9\">\u00b621 Our decision in <em>Strizich </em>stands for the proposition that the State may not deny a defendant a trial injustice court by appealing a ruling that arises from a State-filed motion in limine concerning non-substantive evidence. <em>Strizich, </em>286 Mont, at 10-11, 952 P.2d at 1371. <em>Rensvold </em>likewise provides that the State may not deny a defendant a justice court trial by failing to appear at a justice court proceeding and then appealing the subsequent dismissal of the case. <em>Rensvold, </em>\u00b6 33. <em>Strizich </em>and <em>Rensvold </em>reflect this Court\u2019s unwillingness to allow the State to circumvent a justice court\u2019s jurisdiction by appealing from rulings unrelated to the State\u2019s ability to prosecute the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b622 Our decisions in <em>Rensvold </em>and <em>Strizich </em>did not alter the State\u2019s ability, as provided in \u00a7 46-20-103(2), MCA, to appeal an adverse ruling of a justice court on a pretrial motion to suppress filed by a defendant. Likewise, neither decision authorizes a district court to require the State to demonstrate that an adverse ruling effectively resulted in the \u201cdestruction\u201d of the State\u2019s case before the State may appeal. <em>Yarns, 252 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Mont, at 51, 826 P.2d at 547. Indeed, such a condition would require district courts to assume appellate jurisdiction to review the ruling below in order to make the \u201cdestruction\u201d determination. A district court may not assume such jurisdiction. Kesler, 228 Mont, at 246, 741 P.2d at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b623 Willis filed a \u201cMotion to Suppress\u201d in Justice Court to preclude the State from presenting any statements made by Willis to Trooper Lee or Trooper Moody on the day of the accident. Willis\u2019s motion asserted that the State illegally had obtained his statements in violation of the federal and Montana constitutional protections against self-incrimination. The Justice Court granted Willis\u2019s motion. The substantive effect of the Justice Court\u2019s ruling resulted in the suppression of Willis\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b624  The Justice Court\u2019s order granting Willis\u2019s motion to suppress does not reveal definitively whether the order suppresses \u201cevidence,\u201d \u201ca confession or admission,\u201d or both, for purposes of \u00a7 46-20-103(2), MCA. The State similarly does not specify either in its \u201cNotice of Appeal,\u201d or in its brief before the District Court, whether the Justice Court\u2019s order suppressed evidence or whether the order suppressed a confession or admission. We conclude that under either characterization the State had a statutory right pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-103(2), MCA, to appeal the Justice Court\u2019s ruling. <em>Strizieh, </em>286 Mont, at 11, 952 P.2d at 1371. We further conclude that a trial de novo in District Court constitutes the proper proceeding for the State\u2019s appeal. <em>Kesler, </em>228 Mont, at 246, 741 P.2d at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u00b625 Reversed and remanded to the District Court for the initiation of new proceedings de novo.</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
