Runstrom (Ed), acting as personal representative of the Estate of Richard Runstrom, and Edward (Ed) and Nancy Runstrom, individually, appeal from the order entered by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, granting summary judgment to Jake Allen, M.D. (Dr. Allen) on the basis that the applicable statute of limitations had expired. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in concluding that minority tolling</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">under \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, does not apply to the limitations period for the survival claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in concluding that minority tolling under \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, does not apply to the limitations period for the wrongful death claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in concluding that the \u201cdiscovery\u201d provision of \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, does not delay the running of the limitations period?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">\u00b66 4. Does the \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision of \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, apply to the 3-year limitations period?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">\u00b67 On August 3, 2000, Ed and Nancy\u2019s son Richard sustained a broken femur in an all-terrain vehicle accident. An ambulance took him to the emergency room at Benefis Healthcare, Inc. (Benefis), where Dr. Allen was the trauma surgeon on call. Richard died the next day; he was sixteen years old. On the day Richard died, Ed requested an autopsy and confronted Dr. Allen. In the weeks following Richard\u2019s death, Ed obtained the autopsy report and Richard\u2019s medical records. He subsequently consulted with attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">\u00b68 On February 13, 2004, the Great Falls Tribune reported on an administrative proceeding regarding Dr. Allen, and referred to a peer reviewer\u2019s report and some of Dr. Allen\u2019s former patients whose names had not been released. Ed and Nancy believed Richard was one of the unnamed patients, and they obtained documents associated with the administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">\u00b69 On July 30, 2004, Ed and Nancy initiated a proceeding with the Montana Medical Legal Panel (MMLP), which ended in April of 2005. In May of 2005, Ed and Nancy sued Benefis and Dr. Allen, asserting wrongful death and survival medical malpractice claims. Benefis and Dr. Allen moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds. The District Court granted both defendants\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u00b610 Ed and Nancy appealed, and we subsequently granted their motion to dismiss Benefis. Consequently, this appeal is limited to the judgment in Dr. Allen\u2019s favor. We set forth additional facts as necessary below.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b611 Summary judgment is proper under M. R. Civ. P. 56(c) if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d We review a summary judgment ruling de novo. <em>Fabich v. PPL Montana, LLC, </em>2007 MT 258, \u00b6 9, 339 Mont. 289, \u00b6 9, 170 P.3d 943, \u00b6 9 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u00b612 This case involves a wrongful death claim and a survival claim. Only an estate\u2019s personal representative-here, Ed-may bring a wrongful death action. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-1-513, MCA; <em>Renville v. Fredrickson, </em>2004 MT 324, \u00b6\u00b6 20-25, 324 Mont. 86, \u00b6\u00b6 20-25, 101 P.3d 773, \u00b6\u00b6 20-25. Moreover, as discussed further below, only an estate\u2019s personal representative-again, Ed in this case-may bring a survival action. <em>See In re Estate of Lambert, </em>2006 MT 229, \u00b6 15, 333 Mont. 444, \u00b6 15, 143 P.3d 426, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted). The parties have not requested a determination of whether Ed and Nancy are properly acting in their individual capacities in bringing the wrongful death claim, and such a determination would not substantively affect the disposition of this case. Accordingly, we treat Ed as the plaintiff and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u00b613 1. Did the District Court err in concluding that minority tolling under \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, does not apply to the limitations period for the survival claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\u00b614 The statute of limitations for a medical malpractice claim is \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, which states, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">[ajction in tort or contract for injury or death against a physician or surgeon ... based upon alleged professional negligence ... or for an act, error, or omission, must, except as provided in subsection (2), be commenced within 3 years after the date of injury or within 3 years after the plaintiff discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury, whichever occurs last, but in no case may an action be commenced after 5 years from the date of injury. However, this time limitation is tolled for any period during which there has been a failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>disclose any act, error, or omission upon which an action is based and that is known to the defendant or through the use of reasonable diligence subsequent to the act, error, or omission would have been known to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Thus, except as discussed below, the statute of limitations for a medical malpractice claim generally is 3 years. Section 27-2-205(1), MCA. The parties do not dispute that, because \u00a7 27-6-702, MCA, tolls the limitations period during a MMLP proceeding and for 30 days thereafter, only the 4-year period between Richard\u2019s death in August of 2000 and the filing of the MMLP claim in July of 2004 is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AcY\">\u00b615 In the District Court, Ed asserted that minority tolling delayed the running of the 3-year statute of limitations for the estate\u2019s survival claim until November 3,2001, the date Richard would have turned 18 had he lived. Stated differently, Ed contended the limitations period did not expire until November 3, 2004, and the MMLP claim was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b616 The District Court rejected Ed\u2019s argument, relying on cases from other jurisdictions for the proposition that death ends a minor\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d-by which, as discussed further below, the court was referring to a minor\u2019s inability to sue or defend against suit without assistance. While Ed and Dr. Allen discuss out-of-state cases on appeal, we address this issue in light of Montana authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b617  A minor may enforce his or her rights by civil action or other legal proceedings in the same manner as a person of full age, except that a guardian must conduct the action or proceedings. Section 27-1-511, MCA. Stated differently, a minor is under a disability, insofar as he or she may not sue or defend against suit without the assistance of a person who has reached majority. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-1-511, MCA; M. R. Civ. P. 17(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b618 Section 27-2-401(1), MCA, provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">[i]f a person entitled to bring an action mentioned in part 2 [of Title 27, chapter 2, MCA] ... is, at the time the cause of action accrues ... a minor ... the time of the disability is not a part of the time limit for commencing the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Thus, \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, generally applies to wrongful death and medical malpractice actions because they are \u201cmentioned\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-204(2) and -205, MCA. Minority tolling applies, however, only \u201c[i]f a person entitled to bring an action ... is, at the time the cause of action accrues ... a minor[.]\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\u00b619  A survival action is a cause of action that arises during a person\u2019s lifetime; it survives his or her death. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-1-501(1), MCA; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>Estate of Lambert, </em>\u00b6 15. No survival action exists if the person dies instantaneously, and any damages suffered are personal to the decedent. <em>See Estate of Lambert, </em>\u00b6 15 (citations omitted). A survival action belongs to the decedent\u2019s estate, and only the estate\u2019s personal representative may bring the survival action. <em>Estate of Lambert, </em>\u00b6 15 (citations omitted). The personal representative of an estate may not be under the age of 18. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-3-501(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b620  After Richard\u2019s death, Ed-as the personal representative of Richard\u2019s estate-was the \u201cperson entitled to bring\u201d the survival claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA. It is undisputed that Ed was not a minor when the cause of action accrued, and he was not \u2014 and could not have been \u2014 a minor when he filed the survival action. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-3-501(1), MCA. Based on the plain language of \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, we conclude minority tolling does not apply to the time after Richard\u2019s death, when Ed-not Richard-was the \u201cperson entitled to bring\u201d the survival action.</p>\n<p id=\"AZp\">\u00b621 Ed argues, however, that the Legislature contemplated that death would end tolling of the 3-year limitations period in \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, for some medical malpractice claims involving minors. He relies on \u00a7 27-2-205(2), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">[n]otwithstanding the provisions of 27-2-401, in an action for death or injury of a minor who was under the age of 4 on the date of the minor\u2019s injury, the period of limitations in subsection (1) begins to run when the minor reaches the minor\u2019s eighth birthday or dies, whichever occurs first, and the time for commencement of the action is tolled during any period during which the minor does not reside with a parent or guardian.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Ed highlights the \u201cor dies\u201d language in \u00a7 27-2-205(2), MCA, and the omission of such language in \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA. Via that language, Ed asserts the Legislature intended death to end \u201ceighth birthday\u201d tolling in survival medical malpractice actions involving children injured before age 4, but not to end minority tolling before a child\u2019s eighteenth birthday in survival medical malpractice cases involving minors injured at age 4 or older. His arguments are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"ADY\">\u00b622  Notwithstanding the \u201cor dies\u201d language in \u00a7 27-2-205(2), MCA, only the adult personal representative of an estate may bring a survival medical malpractice claim regarding injuries the deceased allegedly sustained as a minor, regardless of whether the action involves injury to a minor younger or older than 4 years of age. <em>See Estate of Lambert, </em>\u00b6 15; \u00a7 72-3-501(1), MCA. While tolling applies in a survival medical malpractice claim to the time a minor-or, in an \u201cunder age 4\u201d injury case, a child under age 8-lived between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>accrual of the cause of action and the minor\u2019s death, the tolling does not apply to the time after the minor\u2019s death, when the estate\u2019s personal representative must bring the action. <em>See Estate of Lambert, </em>\u00b6 15. Because Richard died the day after Dr. Allen first became involved in his care, minority tolling extended the limitations period by no more than one day.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b623 Alternatively, Ed relies on <em>Payne v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2002 MT 313,313 Mont. 118,60 P.3d 469, in asserting a survival claim operates under the legal fiction that the decedent did not die and, therefore, Ed may assume Richard\u2019s minority status for the time between Richard\u2019s death and the day he would have turned 18 had he lived. In <em>Payne, </em>the district court denied a motion to exclude expert testimony regarding economic consumption as it pertained to a survival action, and the plaintiff-who had brought both survival and wrongful death claims-petitioned for a writ of supervisory control. <em>Payne, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Accepting supervisory control, we determined that economic consumption factors into lost earnings computations in wrongful death actions, but not in survival actions. <em>Payne, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-12. Noting the 1987 Legislature amended \u00a7 27-1-501, MCA, to require wrongful death and survival actions to be combined in one action and to prohibit double recovery, we stated that \u201c[w]hile the 1987 amendment did change the procedure one must follow in bringing the actions, the amendment did not change the respective substantive law in the area.\u201d <em>Payne, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b624 <em>Payne, </em>\u00b6 14, distinguishes laws pertaining to the procedure for bringing an action from substantive laws applicable to the elements of a claim. While <em>Payne, </em>\u00b6 7, states that an estate\u2019s \u201cright of recovery is identical to the decedent\u2019s had he or she lived[,]\u201d the time period in which the estate\u2019s personal representative may bring a survival action is a procedural question separate from the substantive elements of the claim, such as the damages at issue in <em>Payne. </em>Thus, <em>Payne </em>does not support Ed\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b625 Finally, we note the assertion in Ed\u2019s reply brief that, if his arguments regarding minority tolling are unsuccessful, any new principle of law should not apply retroactively under <em>Ereth v. Cascade County, </em>2003 MT 328, \u00b6\u00b6 26-32, 318 Mont. 355, \u00b6\u00b6 26-32, 81 P.3d 463, \u00b6\u00b6 26-32. Having analyzed this issue based on statutory plain language and prior Montana cases, we conclude this Opinion does not set forth a new principle of law. Thus, <em>Ereth </em>has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"Aol\">\u00b626  We hold the District Court correctly concluded minority tolling does not apply to the survival claim against Dr. Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u00b627 2. Did the District Court err in concluding that minority tolling under \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, does not apply to the limitations period for the wrongful death claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b628 Ed argues that, because \u00a7 27-1-501(2), MCA, requires a survival claim and a wrongful death claim to be joined in a single proceeding, the limitations period for the wrongful death claim is tolled along with-or, in other words, \u201cpiggy backs\u201d onto-the period for the survival claim. Having determined minority tolling does not apply to Ed\u2019s survival claim, we conclude it also does not apply to the joined wrongful death claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b629  We hold the District Court correctly concluded minority tolling does not apply to the wrongful death claim against Dr. Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b630 3. Did the District Court err in concluding that the \u201cdiscovery\u201d provision of \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCAl, does not delay the running of the limitations period?</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b631 As set forth above, \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, states in part that medical malpractice actions generally must be commenced within 3 years after the injury or \u201cwithin 3 years after the plaintiff discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury, whichever occurs last[.]\u201d The District Court relied on <em>Major v. North Valley Hosp., </em>233 Mont. 25, 759 P.2d 153 (1988), <em>overruled in part by Blackburn v. Blue Mountain Women\u2019s Clinic, </em>286 Mont. 60, 75, 951 P.2d 1, 10 (1997), in determining \u201cdiscovery\u201d occurred-and, consequently, triggered the running of the 3-year limitations period in \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA-either at the time Richard died in August of 2000 or no later than when Ed obtained the medical records. Under this conclusion, Ed\u2019s MMLP proceeding in July of 2004 was nearly a year too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b632 In <em>Major, </em>a plaintiff brought a medical malpractice action regarding her daughter\u2019s death, and the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on statute of limitations grounds. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont, at 27, 759 P.2d at 154-55. On appeal, the plaintiff argued the \u201cdiscovery\u201d provision of \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, delayed the running of the statute of limitations until she discovered facts providing a causal connection between the defendants\u2019 acts, errors or omissions and her daughter\u2019s death. We noted the \u201cfarthest reaches\u201d of prior case law provided that discovery may occur as late as the date the plaintiff discovers an injury may have been caused by the defendant. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont, at 29-30, 759 P.2d at 156. The plaintiffs deposition testimony reflected, however, her beliefs on the day her daughter died that the treatment was inadequate and the events of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>day were a \u201cnightmare.\u201d We concluded, on the record before us, that the plaintiffs alleged lack of knowledge of the facts connecting the defendants\u2019 acts to her daughter\u2019s death-that is, the causal connection-did not prevent her from discovering the injury. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont, at 30, 759 P.2d at 156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b633 Here, Ed confronted Dr. Allen on the day Richard died, stating \u201cI guess you put off fixing his leg long enough, now you don\u2019t have to do it[.]\u201d He also stated that, shortly after Richard\u2019s death, he contemplated a lawsuit \u201cif there was something wrong,\u201d and suspected at that time that something had gone wrong because \u201c[tjoday\u2019s time, you know, people don\u2019t usually die from a broken leg[.j\u201d We conclude that, as in <em>Major, </em>the record here reflects a parent\u2019s suspicion of malpractice shortly after his child died.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b634 Ed does not challenge the reasoning in <em>Major, </em>but asserts <em>Major </em>is distinguishable because the facts there established obvious injury caused by obvious negligence, while the present case involves a death resulting from hidden injuries with unknown causes. Ed does not dispute that the autopsy report-which he obtained within weeks after Richard\u2019s death-stated the cause of death was \u201c[mjultifactorial: Fat embolism syndrome, aspiration pneumonia, and multisystem failure.\u201d Rather, he asserts that, due to his lack of medical training and inability to understand the conditions allegedly leading to his son\u2019s death, \u201cdiscover/\u2019 under \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, did not occur until he read the Great Falls Tribune article in February of 2004. In this regard, Ed analogizes to <em>Wisher v. Higgs, </em>257 Mont. 132, 849 P.2d 152 (1993), <em>overruled in part by Blackburn, </em>286 Mont, at 75,951 P.2d at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"AVd\">\u00b635 In <em>Wisher, </em>the plaintiff sued her surgeon for malpractice, alleging she sustained an injury during a surgery that occurred several years earlier. In the years between the surgery and the filing of her claim, the plaintiff allegedly had symptoms unrelated to the injury sustained during surgery; consulted several professionals and specialists; was repeatedly misdiagnosed; had a two-year period of improvement; and ultimately obtained a medical opinion that she sustained an injury during the surgery. <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont, at 135-38, 849 P.2d at 153-55. After trial, a jury found the plaintiff, through reasonable diligence, should have discovered her injury and that it may have been caused by the surgery more than three years before she filed her claim; in other words, the jury effectively decided the claim was time-barred. <em>See Wisher, </em>257 Mont, at 134,849 P.2d at 153. We reversed, reasoning that although the plaintiff perceived her symptoms on the day of her surgery, the nature of the injury was self-concealing and the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>did not support a determination that she knew or through reasonable diligence could have known the symptoms she experienced were causally connected to the surgeon\u2019s negligence. <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont, at 140-44, 849 P.2d at 156-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b636 The record here is not as extensive as that in <em>Wisher, </em>in part because Ed asserted attorney-client privilege and declined to answer certain deposition questions. In addition to matters set forth above including consultations with attorneys and the like, however, Ed\u2019s deposition testimony reflects that: (1) after Richard\u2019s death, he did not discuss Richard\u2019s care with Benefis employees, because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want anything to do with the hospital at that point\u201d; (2) he discussed Richard\u2019s medical records with a general practitioner who was \u201cnot a surgeon\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t say one thing one way or the other\u201d; (3) he spoke with a friend who worked at the hospital in a non-surgical position and had worked in the morgue, who \u201cwould have no way of knowing\u201d whether an error occurred; and (4) he did not discuss the autopsy report with anyone other than Nancy, the general practitioner and the hospital worker and, while he did not understand the report, he \u201cthought if there was something major in it, it would have popped out[.]\u201d In light of this testimony, the undisputed facts here are distinguishable from those in <em>Wisher.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b637 Moreover, unlike the expert opinion in <em>Wisher </em>that the plaintiff sustained an injury during her surgery, Ed points to nothing in the 2004 Great Falls Tribune article providing different information about the cause of Richard\u2019s injuries than the autopsy report and medical records in Ed\u2019s possession since 2000. Indeed, most of the article focused on Dr. Allen\u2019s treatment of a patient in 2003, and its only mention of the cause of Richard\u2019s death was its reference to a fat embolism-one of the causes listed in the autopsy report-without any statement regarding the cause of the embolism. Ed appears to argue that he discovered Dr. Allen\u2019s care was substandard upon reading the report on regulatory proceedings; however, as already discussed, his deposition testimony reflects he suspected malpractice on the day Richard died. In any event, the newspaper article provides no more information about the injury at issue or the cause of that injury than the information in Ed\u2019s possession. Thus, we conclude Ed\u2019s analogy to <em>Wisher </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b638 Alternatively, Ed asserts-in one paragraph of his opening brief and a short follow-up in his reply brief-that, since he is a lay person and the medical issues are complex, the date of his \u201cdiscovery\u201d is a vigorously contested factual issue. In the District Court, Ed did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>assert any disputed facts in his summary judgment brief and, at oral argument on the motion, his counsel merely stated that \u201c[m]any of these questions, fraudulent concealment, simple concealment, duty of discovery, duty of inquiry are fact ladening [sic] questions. They\u2019re not amenable to summary adjudication.\u201d Perhaps in light of this vague argument, the District Court characterized the facts as undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"AsX\">\u00b639 On appeal, as in the District Court, Ed\u2019s \u201cdisputed facts\u201d arguments do not advance any allegedly conflicting evidence regarding discovery which raises an issue of fact. It is not this Court\u2019s obligation to develop arguments on a party\u2019s behalf. <em>See In re Marriage of McMichael, </em>2006 MT 237, \u00b6 12, 333 Mont. 517, \u00b6 12, 143 P.3d 439, \u00b6 12 (citation omitted). We note Ed\u2019s recitation of the background of the case includes an excerpt from his deposition in which he stated he first thought something had gone wrong when he read the Great Falls Tribune article. Were we to consider this deposition testimony in conjunction with his \u201cdisputed facts\u201d argument-despite Ed\u2019s failure to request that we do so-the testimony amounts to a mere denial that he suspected malpractice before reading the news article. Given Ed\u2019s other deposition testimony and evidence of record, mere denial is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See e.g. Ponderosa Pines Ranch, Inc. v. Hevner, </em>2002 MT 184, \u00b6 24,311 Mont. 82, \u00b6 24, 53 P.3d 381, \u00b6 24 (citation omitted). We decline to address Ed\u2019s \u201cdisputed facts\u201d assertions further.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b640  We hold the District Court correctly concluded the \u201cdiscovery\u201d provision of \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, does not delay the running of the 3-year limitations period and, therefore, Ed\u2019s claims are time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"AB1\">\u00b641 4. Does the \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision of \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, apply to the 3-year limitations period?</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b642 As noted above, \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, sets forth a 3-year statute of limitations, which may be delayed pursuant to the \u201cdiscovery\u201d provision,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">but in no case may an action be commenced after 5 years from the date of injury. However, this time limitation is tolled for any period during which there has been a failure to disclose any act, error, or omission upon which an action is based and that is known to the defendant or through the use of reasonable diligence subsequent to the act, error, or omission would have been known to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In the alternative to his assertions regarding minority tolling and the discovery provision, Ed argues the foregoing \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision of \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, applies to the 3-year statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>limitations. He asserts we wrongly concluded <em>iuBlackburn </em>that-based on the plain language of the statute-the \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision applies exclusively to the 5-year statute of repose. We disagree but, before proceeding further, we reiterate that Ed filed his MMLP claim approximately 4 years after the date of Richard\u2019s death; thus, the 5-year statute of repose is not at issue here and the \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision is pertinent only if it applies to the 3-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"AbQd\">\u00b643 Ed asserts <em>Blackburn </em>is wrong because, if a medical malpractice action is barred by the 3-year statute of limitations, applying the \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision to the 5-year statute of repose would accomplish nothing. He is incorrect, primarily because he fails to acknowledge the interplay between the delay of the running of the 3-year limitations period pursuant to the \u201cdiscovery\u201d provision and the tolling of the 5-year statute of repose under the \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision. In other words, a claim filed more than 5 years after injury may be timely if the plaintiff could not through reasonable diligence have earlier discovered the injury and its cause <em>and </em>the defendant failed to disclose an act, error or omission upon which the action is based. We reject Ed\u2019s assertion that applying the \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision solely to the 5-year statute of repose accomplishes nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"A0r\">\u00b644 We also reject Ed\u2019s argument that applying the \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision only to the 5-year statute of repose would negate what he characterizes as the \u201ccentral policy\u201d of <em>Blackburn, </em>which he describes as disallowing immunity for concealment. <em>Blackburn </em>involved a plain language statutory interpretation of the \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision. It was not premised on a policy determination by this Court, but was a straightforward interpretation of the policy reflected in the Legislature\u2019s statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b645 Finally, Ed asserts we were careful <em>iuBlackburn </em>to overrule prior cases only insofar as they applied the <em>statutory </em>\u201cfailure to disclose\u201d language to the 3-year statute of limitations. From that premise, Ed posits that the common law remains viable insofar as <em>pre-Blackburn </em>cases addressed a health care provider\u2019s failure to disclose or concealment in relation to the 3-year limitations period. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AcD\">\u00b646 In <em>Blackburn, </em>we began our discussion of the time limitations associated with medical malpractice actions by recognizing that the limitations period for medical negligence claims is \u201ccodified\u201d at \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA. <em>Blackburn, </em>286 Mont, at 71, 951 P.2d at 7. Given that recognition, our use of \u201cstatutory\u201d language is not surprising. Moreover, nothing in our overruling of prior cases in <em>Blackburn </em>leaves open the possibility that common law may provide an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>basis for extending or delaying the time limitations in the Legislature\u2019s statute. For that reason, and because the \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision applies exclusively to the 5-year statute of repose which is not at issue, we need not address Ed\u2019s assertion that a \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b647  We hold the \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d provision of \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, does not apply to the 3-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b648 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b348-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"ABQ\">dissenting in part and concurring in part.</p>\n<p id=\"Auy\">\u00b649 I dissent as to Issue 1 and concur as to Issues 2, 3, and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u00b650 The plain meaning of the phrase \u201ctime of the disability\u201d reasonably could be interpreted to encompass the time between when a minor dies and when the minor would have reached the age of majority. The phrase also reasonably could be interpreted to include only the time that the minor remains alive. I conclude that the phrase \u201ctime of the disability\u201d is ambiguous regarding the effect of a minor\u2019s death. We must look beyond the plain language of the statute, therefore, to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Mont, for Justice v. State ex rel. McGrath, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 60, 334 Mont. 237, \u00b6 60, 146 P.3d 759, \u00b6 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\u00b651 We must determine the Legislature\u2019s intent with respect to the \u201ctime of the disability\u201d as contained in \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA. The Runstroms argue that the structure of \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-205 and 27-2-401, MCA, supports their interpretation of the phrase \u201ctime of the disability.\u201d The Runstroms correctly point out that this Court previously has interpreted ambiguous language in a statute based on the statutory structure in which the language operates. <em>See e.g., Strzelczyk v. Jett, </em>264 Mont. 153, 157, 870 P.2d 730, 732-33 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">\u00b652 Sections 27-2-205 and 27-2-401, MCA, operate together to provide the statute of limitations on medical malpractice claims brought on behalf of minors. Section 27-2-205(1), MCA, provides that a plaintiff must file a medical malpractice claim within three years of the date of the injury or within three years after the plaintiff reasonably should have discovered the injury. Before 1987, \u00a7 27-2-401, MCA, tolled this three-year statute of limitations for any minor until that minor reached the age of majority. <em>Estate of McCarthy v. Second Judicial Dist., </em>1999 MT 309, \u00b6 9, 297 Mont. 212, \u00b6 9, 994 P.2d 1090, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\u00b653 The Legislature in 1987 limited minority tolling for minors injured while under the age of four, however, when it added subsection (2) to \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA. <em>Estate of McCarthy, </em>\u00b6 10. Section 27-2-205(2), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>MCA, provides that \u201cin an action for death or injury of a minor who was under the age of 4 on the date of the minor\u2019s injury, the period of limitations in subsection (1) begins to run when the minor reaches the minor\u2019s eighth birthday <em>or dies, </em>whichever occurs first....\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Legislature intended \u00a7 27-2-205(2), MCA, to limit the minority tolling provision in \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, in order to \u201caddress concerns regarding escalating medical malpractice insurance premiums and corresponding increases in the cost of medical care.\u201d <em>Estate of McCarthy, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b654 The Runstroms argue that we must interpret the malpractice statutes in a manner that gives effect to all provisions. In particular, they cite to the requirement in \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA, that when a statutory scheme has several provisions, a construction is to be adopted which will, if possible, give effect to all. The Runstroms point to the fact that the Legislature included the \u201cor dies\u201d provision in \u00a7 27-2-205(2), MCA, when it amended the statute in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b655 The \u201cor dies\u201d provision represents one contingency that triggers the running of the period of limitation for a minor injured while under the age of four. Section 27-2-205(2), MCA. The minor\u2019s eighth birthday represents the other possible trigger. Section 27-2-205(2), MCA. The Runstroms contend that the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of the \u201cor dies\u201d provision in subsection (2) would have been unnecessary if the \u201ctime of the disability\u201d in \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, automatically ended upon the death of a minor. They argue that this interpretation of \u201ctime of the disability\u201d would render superfluous the phrase \u201cor dies\u201d in \u00a7 27-2-205(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u00b656 Dr. Allen contends that the Runstroms \u201cignore[] critical differences in how [\u00a7\u00a7 27-2-205(2), and 27-2-401(1), MCA] work.\u201d He explains that \u00a7 27-2-205(2), MCA, by its plain language, tolls the statute of limitations until \u201ca fixed date (the child\u2019s eighth birthday) on which tolling will end.\u201d He asserts that the plain language of \u00a7 27-2-205(2), MCA, would toll the statute of limitations until the \u201cfixed date\u201d at which the child would have turned eight absent language to the contrary. He suggests that the Legislature included the \u201cor dies\u201d provision in order to prevent the statute from continuing to toll until the \u201cfixed date\u201d when the minor would have turned eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b657 Dr. Allen contends that \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, to the contrary, provides for tolling \u201conly \u2018until the plaintiff is no longer disabled.\u2019\u201d He argues that the plain language of \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, would not toll the statute of limitations after the child\u2019s death in light of the fact that the phrase \u201ctime of the disability\u201d ends upon a minor\u2019s death by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>plain language. Thus, he contends that the Legislature had no reason to include a similar \u201cor dies\u201d provision in \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b658 Dr. Allen\u2019s proposed interpretation of the two statutes contradicts itself. He argues on the one hand that \u201ctime of the disability\u201d in \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, cannot continue after death. He argues, on the other hand, that \u201cthe minor\u2019s eighth birthday\u201d in \u00a7 27-2-205(2), MCA, can occur after death. Dr. Allen attempts to explain away this contradiction by focusing on the fact that a \u201cminor\u2019s eighth birthday\u201d represents a fixed date, while \u201ctime of the disability\u201d does not represent a fixed date. His distinction fails. The date at which the disability of minority normally ends-i.e. 18-and the date at which a minor will reach the age of eight, equally will be fixed for any particular child regardless of the fact that the Legislature expresses one age as a number and another age as a legal status.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b659 I conclude that the structure of the applicable statute of limitations indicates that the phrase \u201ctime of the disability\u201d encompasses the time between the death of a minor and when that minor would have reached the age of majority. The Legislature limited the minority tolling provision so that it would end the \u201ctime of the disability\u201d when a minor injured while under the age of four reaches the age of eight, <em>or dies. </em>The Legislature would have had no reason to specify in \u00a7 27-2-205(2), MCA, that tolling would end upon the death of the minor, had the phrase \u201ctime of the disability,\u201d in \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, already ended upon the death of the minor pursuant to its plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b660 Dr. Allen argues that this interpretation conflicts with other courts\u2019 interpretations of analogous statutes. He points specifically to <em>Holt v. Lenko, </em>791 A.2d 1212 (Pa. Super. 2002), where a mother argued that Pennsylvania\u2019s minority tolling statute tolled the statute of limitations on her survival action until two years after her son would have turned 18. <em>Holt, </em>\u00b6 7. The statute at issue provided that if the \u201cindividual entitled to bring a civil action is an unemancipated minor at the time the cause of action accrues, the period of minority shall not be deemed a portion of the time period within which the action must be commenced.\u201d <em>Holt, </em>\u00b6 7. The Pennsylvania court concluded that this language did not toll the statute of limitations beyond the death of the minor. <em>Holt, </em>\u00b6 10. The court reasoned that \u201c[tjhere is nothing in the statutory language that would indicate that the legislature intended that the minority tolling statute would be available to a deceased minor plaintiff.\u201d <em>Holt, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>\u00b661 Dr. Allen fails to note, however, that \u00a7 27-2-205(2), MCA, unlike the statute in <em>Holt, </em>indicates that the Montana Legislature intended that our minority tolling statute would be available to a deceased minor. The \u201cor dies\u201d provision specifies that death ends minority tolling for a specific subclass of minors. This interpretation gives effect to this provision, while Dr. Allen\u2019s interpretation would render it superfluous. Dr. Allen fails to draw our attention to any other court that has reconciled similar provisions in a contrary manner. I conclude that the minority tolling statute at \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, tolls the three-year statute of limitation on the Runstroms\u2019 survival claim until the date at which Richard would have reached the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b662 I concur with the result on Issue 2, but for different reasons. We interpret statutes of limitations according to their plain language. <em>Wing v. State ex. rel. Dept, of Transp., </em>2007 MT 72, \u00b6 13, 336 Mont. 423, \u00b6 13, 155 P.3d 1224, \u00b6 13. The plain language of \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, tolls the statute of limitations only for a minor who seeks to file a claim as \u201ca person entitled to bring an action... at the time the cause of action accrues ....\u201d The Runstroms are the party entitled to bring a wrongful death claim. The Runstroms do not allege that they were minors at the time their action for wrongful death accrued. Section 27-2-401(1), MCA, provides the Runstroms with no relief from the three-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA. I conclude that the District Court correctly determined that \u00a7 27-2-401(1), MCA, does not toll the three-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 27-2-205(1), MCA, on the Runstroms\u2019 wrongful death claim.</p>\n<judges id=\"b351-5\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the dissent and concurrence of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
