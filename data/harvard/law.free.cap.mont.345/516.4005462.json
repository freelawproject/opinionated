We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by failing to secure an appointed</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">\u201cfriend\u201d for O.R.B.?</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court make a sufficiently detailed statement of facts to support its findings as required by \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA? \u00b65 3. Are the District Court\u2019s findings of fact numbered 14 and 17 clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">\u00b66 4. Does the omission of recommendations in the professional person\u2019s written report constitute reversible error?</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">\u00b67 On April 27, 2007, the Glacier County Attorney filed a petition alleging that O.R.B. suffered from a mental disorder requiring commitment, specifically \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d and \u201csuicidal ideations.\u201d Filed with the petition was a report by Karen Baumann from the Center for Mental Health, stating that O.R.B. appeared delusional and often had \u201caudio hallucinations.\u201d At the probable cause hearing, Dr. Randy Webb, M.D., of the Northern Rockies Medical Center, explained that O.R.B. had fractured her ankle in February and refused an evaluation by the orthopedic surgeon. She was instructed then not to bear weight on the leg, but when she had visited the hospital she had walked through snow and the cast was wet. Dr. Webb testified that O.R.B. \u201cwasn\u2019t taking proper care of her leg, and that\u2019s why she was admitted to the hospital.\u201d Dr. Webb stated that O.R.B. appeared malnourished and that she was \u201cnot taking care of herself and seeing to her medical issues ... as a result of her current mental status\u201d and needed \u201cin-patient treatment.\u201d Dr. Webb opined that O.R.B.\u2019s neglect to her leg could become \u201clife-threatening.\u201d His testimony included evidence of suicidal ideation by O.R.B. Dr. Webb read from O.R.B.\u2019s chart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-13\">On 4-19-07, the patient refused to take the evening dose of her medication. She stated to the nurse: \u201cIt is not for brain concussion. I can\u2019t stop the beating, pulsing in head.\u201d When relaxed [O.R.B.] became really upset and in a raised voice said: \u201cI\u2019ll not leave in this condition, I\u2019ll kill myself in this condition.\u201d [O.R.B.] was pounding on her forehead and had her hands to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>throat and yelling: \u201cCut throat, cut throat.\u201d [Grammar and punctuation changes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The court determined that there was probable cause, pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-124, MCA, for the filing of the petition and that an emergency existed requiring O.R.B.\u2019s detention for her protection. The District Court appointed Virginia Villemez as a friend for O.R.B. and ordered Dr. Webb to complete a mental status examination of O.R.B. and provide the court with a written report.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u00b68 A commitment hearing was held May 4, 2007. A friend for O.R.B. did not appear and the County Attorney explained that there was a problem securing a friend for O.R.B. because \u201cthose who have tried to assist her and help her have been accused of various acts against her person, and no one in the community, unfortunately for the community and the Respondent, has been willing to continue to assist her[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\u00b69 Dr. Webb testified at the commitment hearing that during his \u201cinterview with [O.R.B. he] had found that she displayed delusional thoughts and paranoid thinking. She had a flit of ideas and disorganized thoughts, and did not appear to be in touch with reality.\u201d Dr. Webb also stated that O.R.B. \u201chas a very delusional scheme that people are transmitting some type of ultrasonic waves through her home that\u2019s causing problems with her brain. [O.R.B.] described it as a brain concussion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u00b610 Dr. Webb also testified about O.R.B.\u2019s living situation, saying \u201c[s]he is living without heat in Cut Bank, Montana; she is living without proper sanitary facilities, without proper food and nutrition, and I think she is at risk for developing a physical illness that will cause her to have a shortened life span.\u201d Pertinent to O.R.B.\u2019s living situation was Cut Bank Chief of Police, Jason Abbott\u2019s testimony. Officer Abbot stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">I have been to a lot of houses, and this house was absolutely the worst house I have ever been to. All the cupboard doors were taken off, the floor was completely covered in papers, legal papers and newspapers, and there was garbage covering the entire kitchen floor and there was absolutely no where to walk; and there was no heat, this was in winter, and there was no heat in the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">There were chicken bones mixed in with the papers all over the kitchen floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">It was a foul smell. The smell of-a body smell and garbage smell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Also pertinent to O.R.B.\u2019s welfare, Dr. Webb discussed O.R.B.\u2019s nutrition, describing O.R.B as anorectic, explaining that \u201cshe\u2019s not eating, she\u2019s thin, and has decreased the amount of muscle and fat tissue in her body. She has very poor dentition. Her teeth are decayed and have not been properly maintained.\u201d It was Dr. Webb\u2019s medical opinion that with psychiatric assistance and proper medication, O.R.B. could eventually positively function within the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\u00b611 Dr. Charles Ellis, a psychiatrist at the Montana State Hospital also testified at the commitment hearing. It was Dr. Ellis\u2019 diagnosis that O.R.B. suffers from \u201cparanoid schizophrenia.\u201d He stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdQ\">[W]ithout psychiatric treatment [O.R.B. is] not going to agree to proper medical care, and if we don\u2019t clear up her paranoia then she\u2019s going to do herself a lot of damage, especially when she\u2019s already broken her ankle and not taking proper care of it, and the longer we let her go in this state the worse she\u2019s going to be physically. And the other thing with schizophrenia, the longer you leave it untreated the longer it damages the brain and the longer it takes to get a person back to normal functioning, so the longer we leave her like this, the more of a dis-service we\u2019re doing to her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AME\">Dr. Ellis opined that O.R.B. was putting herself in \u201cimminent danger.\u201d O.R.B, however, testified that she did not have a mental illness but rather her neighbors \u201cpulse pressure to [her] house\u201d and \u201cdamaged [her] brain[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b612 Concluding the hearing, the District Court made detailed oral findings of fact, discussed below, and ultimately concluded that O.R.B. \u201csuffers from the mental disorder of psychosis, with paranoid delusions.\u201d The court concluded that because of O.R.B\u2019s mental disorder, O.R.B. was \u201cnot able to provide for her own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health or safety, and that without treatment she\u2019s in imminent danger of self-injury....\u201d A dispositional hearing was set for May 9, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u00b613 At the dispositional hearing, the District Court incorporated its prior findings made at the commitment hearing and committed O.R.B. to the Montana State Hospital at Warm Springs for a period of not more than ninety days. The court noted that \u201c[b]ased on Dr. Webb\u2019s testimony, as well as Dr. Ellis\u2019, there [were] no alternatives for treatment other than the State Hospital.\u201d The District Court entered its written findings of fact on May 9,2007. Pertinent to this appeal are the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">14. The Respondent\u2019s conditions are such that she is an imminent danger to herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>17. The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the Respondent is a danger to herself and it [sic] not able to provide for her own food, clothing, health, and welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">O.R.B. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b614 In an involuntary commitment case we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether, upon viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re G.M., </em>2007 MT 100, \u00b6 12, 337 Mont. 116, \u00b6 12, 157 P.3d 687, \u00b6 12. We exercise de novo review when deciding questions of law such as whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied relevant statutes. <em>In re Mental Health of E.P.B., </em>2007 MT 224, \u00b6 5, 339 Mont. 107, \u00b6 5, 168 P.3d 662, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u00b615 1. Did the District Court err by failing to secure an appointed \u201cfriend\u201d for O.R.B?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\u00b616 O.R.B. contends that the District Court erred by failing to appoint a \u201cfriend\u201d to assist her during the involuntary mental health commitment proceedings as required by \u00a7 53-21-122(2), MCA. O.R.B. argues that \u201cstrict compliance with involuntary mental health commitment statutes\u201d is required, making reversal appropriate because the court did not secure a friend for her. The State asserts that the court initially appointed a friend but that it became apparent that no one was willing to serve as friend for O.R.B due to her conduct. The State argues that O.R.B.\u2019s conduct resulted in the court\u2019s inability to secure her a friend and she cannot now \u201ctake advantage of the fact that no one in the community was willing to assist her due to her psychosis and behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">\u00b617  Pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-122(2), MCA, upon a petition for commitment, \u201c[t]he judge shall appoint a professional person and a friend of respondent and set a date and time for the hearing on the petition....\u201d Section 53-21-102(8), MCA, defines \u201cfriend of respondent\u201d as \u201cany person <em>willing </em>and able to assist a person suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment ....\u201d (Emphasis added.) Here, at the probable cause hearing the District Court appointed Virginia Villemez as friend for O.R.B. However, at the commitment hearing it was disclosed that there was difficulty in maintaining a friend for O.R.B. because O.R.B. accused persons trying to help her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>with \u201cvarious acts against her person,\u201d making others unwilling to assist her. We conclude that the court\u2019s initial appointment of a friend for O.R.B. satisfies \u00a7 53-21-122(2), MCA, which contemplates that appointment of a friend is dependent upon a person\u2019s willingness to serve in that capacity. \u201cThe law never requires impossibilities,\u201d \u00a7 1-3-222, MCA, and it would be fundamentally unfair to fault the District Court for failing to secure a person to act as O.R.B.\u2019s friend where no person was apparently willing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b618 2. Did the District Court make a sufficiently detailed statement of facts to support its findings as required by \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b619 O.R.B. contends the court violated \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA, by making generalized findings of fact that are \u201c[m]issing ... any detail about the conduct and symptoms that support the diagnosis.\u201d O.R.B. attempts to compare the instant case to our decision in <em>In re A.K, </em>2006 MT 166, 332 Mont. 511, 139 P.3d 849, asserting that the findings of fact here \u201cinvolve the same legalese in reference to an unspecified \u2018imminent danger of injury,\u2019 or reference to testimony.\u201d The State argues that O.R.B.\u2019s reliance on <em>In re A.K. </em>is unpersuasive and the District Court provided sufficient findings of fact both in writing and during the May 4, 2007, commitment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b620 Section 53-21-127(8), MCA, requires that \u201c[i]n ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of fact: (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment[.]\u201d In <em>In re A.K. </em>the district court set forth four brief findings of fact related to A.K.\u2019s mental disorder requiring commitment. <em>In re A.K., </em>\u00b6 14. The court concluded that the brief and conclusory \u201cfindings ... [did] not satisfy the statutory mandate.\u201d <em>In re </em>A.K., \u00b6 14. Here, the District Court included nineteen detailed findings of fact in its written order of commitment. Each finding is supported by evidence presented at the commitment hearing. A review of the record in the instant case presents far more detailed findings of fact than other cases, such as <em>In re </em>A.K., where we concluded that the statutory requirements were not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b621 Moreover, the court orally detailed its findings at the conclusion of the commitment hearing. In fact, the commitment hearing transcript contains four pages where the court meticulously reviewed the testimony received in support of each finding of fact. A brief excerpt of the transcript demonstrates the impressive amount of detail the court used to present its findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The Court makes the following findings of fact: Pursuant to 53-21-126, first of all; the court heard from Dr. Randy Webb, who performed a mental status evaluation, and he found that she had delusional thoughts and paranoid thinking, disorganized thinking, and did not appear to be in touch with reality. She-Dr. Webb testified additionally, she had not been maintaining a proper diet; her living conditions put her at risk. He specifically articulated that there was a fracture to her ankle in February, which was not-she did not follow through with the treatment recommendations adequately. Her personal hygiene and cleanliness presented a potential for risk to [O.R.B.] in the area, of infection. Dr. Webb testified that her physical condition stems from her mental disorder, that resources are available to help her within the community, but that she refuses to take advantage of those resources. Dr. Webb testified that, and the court accepts that, the least restrictive setting which would be appropriate for [O.R.B.] would be at Warm Springs, at the State Hospital in Warm Springs; that the county does not have any facility that could accommodate the needs of the Respondent. And I believe his final diagnosis was psychosis, with paranoid ideations. He stated that with a reasonable degree of medical certainty. Dr. Webb indicated that the Respondent has decreased muscle tone and poor dentition. She had not been taking food of a nutritional nature, and would not agree to a blood test which would allow a more complete and further diagnosis. Left untreated, Dr. Webb testified that [O.R.B.\u2019s] conduct created adequate risk of harm to herself, that she was not taking in an adequate amount of nutrition to sustain her over time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">Additionally, sometimes this type of behavior presents a risk for the heart, as well as other organs, which could potentially be damaged beyond repair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The court continued to detail its findings, relying on the testimony of Dr. Ellis, Officer Abbott, and O.R.B. herself. The court found \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty that [O.R.B.] suffered] from psychosis with paranoid delusions,\u201d was \u201ca danger to herself,\u201d and \u201cbecause of her mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for her own basic needs ... plac[ing] herself at risk ....\u201d We conclude that the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA, regarding the statement of facts were satisfied by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b622 3. Are the District Court\u2019s findings of fact numbered 14 and 17 clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u00b623 O.R.B. argues that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact numbered 14 and 17 are clearly erroneous because the testimony supporting these findings \u201cdescribes merely the realm of potential dangers, rather than actual, imminent dangers stemming from overt acts.\u201d The State contends that the court\u2019s decision to commit O.R.B. was justified under the criteria set forth in \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(a) and (c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b624 Once a district court determines that the respondent suffers from a mental disorder, the court must determine whether the respondent requires commitment. Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. In determining whether the respondent requires commitment, the court considers the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health or safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others because of the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">(d) whether the respondent\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent\u2019s recent acts or omissions, will if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent\u2019s mental condition to the point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to the others or will be unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. \u201cCommitment is justified if <em>any </em>of the criteria in \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, are satisfied!).]\u201d <em>In re A.K., </em>\u00b6 12 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">\u00b625 Here, the Court made two findings of fact that O.R.B. complains are clearly erroneous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">14. The Respondent\u2019s conditions are such that she is an imminent danger to herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">17. The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the Respondent is a danger to herself and [is] not able to provide for her own food, clothing, health, and welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">As previously discussed, the corut\u2019s findings of fact are highly detailed and supported by the record. The court determined that O.R.B was unable to care for herself for several reasons, including her neglected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ankle fracture, inadequate nutrition, and the lack of personal hygiene and cleanliness. The court accepted Dr. Webb\u2019s medical opinion that O.R.B. may suffer irreversible organ damage if her behavior persisted. Accordingly, the court concluded that O.R.B. was a danger to herself and commitment was necessary to prevent O.R.B. from further harming herself. Contrary to O.R.B.\u2019s argument, the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous merely because the court did not support its findings of fact with \u201cproof of an overt act or omission sufficiently recent in time.\u201d The court\u2019s findings satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(a), MCA, and support the necessary criteria. <em>In re A.K., </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b626 4. Does the omission of recommendations in the professional person\u2019s written report constitute reversible error?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b627 O.R.B. next argues that pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-123(1), MCA, the professional person must make a written report of his/her examination and if the report \u201crecommends commitment then it <em>must </em>also contain recommendations for disposition.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) O.R.B. asserts that because Dr. Webb\u2019s written report did not include his \u201crecommendations for disposition,\u201d the court failed to comply with the statutory requirements. O.R.B. claims error because (l)the court is not \u201cskilled in psychiatry\u201d and without a recommendation \u201cthe court has little to rely on\u201d and (2) without recommendations O.R.B. had \u201cno notice of what to prepare for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b628 The State concedes that Dr. Webb\u2019s written report did not contain recommendations, but asserts that Dr. Webb \u201cfulfilled the statutory requirements by providing the district court with recommendations not only regarding O.R.B.\u2019s commitment, but also O.R.B.\u2019s disposition\u201d at the May 4, 2007, commitment hearing. In response to O.R.B.\u2019s contention that she was unable to prepare for the hearing, the State claims that O.R.B. raised no complaint in the district court and, in any event, the probable cause hearing \u201cput O.R.B. on notice that Dr. Webb was likely to testify at the hearing that the district court should commit her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b629 We have held that \u201cMontana\u2019s civil commitment laws are to be strictly followed.\u201d <em>In re Mental Health ofAS.B., </em>2008 MT 82, \u00b6 48, 342 Mont. 169, \u00b6 48, 180 P.3d 625, \u00b6 48 (internal quotation omitted). O.R.B. relies on our decision in <em>Matter ofR.M., </em>270 Mont. 40, 889 P.2d 1201 (1995), to assert that reversal is a necessary consequence of failing to strictly follow \u00a7 53-21-123, MCA. In <em>Matter </em>ofR.M., we held that the district court had erred because it failed to appoint a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>professional person to assess R.M.\u2019s mental health. <em>Matter ofR.M., </em>270 Mont, at 45, 889 P.2d at 1204. Without a professional person\u2019s evaluation, the corub\u2019s decision was based on \u201can examination ofR.M. performed before the commitment proceeding was initiated, and by the very person who requested that the commitment petition be filed.\u201d <em>Matter ofR.M., </em>270 Mont, at 45, 889 P.2d at 1204. Here, the court appointed Dr. Webb as the professional person to examine O.R.B. but unfortunately, Dr. Webb\u2019s written report did not include \u201crecommendations\u201d as required by \u00a7 53-21-123(1), MCA. O.R.B. contends that \u201c[i]t matters little that the distinction between this case and <em>R.M. </em>is merely that the professional person here did not make recommendations as required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b630 Under the circumstances here, we conclude that the report error was <em>de minimus. </em>While we <em>agree </em>with O.R.B. that the District Court erred by failing to ensure that recommendations were in the written report, this error was harmless. <em>See In re A.S.B., </em>\u00b6 36 (\u201c\u2018[a] harmless error does not mandate that we reverse a district court judgment; an error must cause substantial prejudice to warrant reversal.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Matter ofS.C. &amp; L.Z., </em>2005 MT 241, \u00b6 29, 328 Mont. 476, \u00b6 29, 121 P.3d 552, \u00b6 29)). Unlike <em>Matter ofR.M., </em>the court here complied with \u00a7 53-21-123, MCA, by appointing a professional person to evaluate O.R.B.\u2019s mental health. Further, the court relied on Dr. Webb\u2019s professional testimony when considering O.R.B.\u2019s commitment-a fact O.R.B. easily ignores when arguing that she was prejudiced because the District Court is not \u201cskilled in psychiatry.\u201d In fact, when concluding the commitment hearing, the court clearly stated that it based its decision on the testimony of Dr. Webb and Dr. Ellis, both of whom testified that commitment at Warm Springs was the only viable option for O.R.B. Thus, the court\u2019s decision was based on the recommendations of the professional person and distinguishes the concerns expressed in <em>Matter ofR.M.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b631  O.R.B. argues that she had \u201cno notice of what to prepare for.\u201d The State notes that O.R.B.\u2019s counsel never objected or complained that he was unaware of what the recommendation would be or unable to prepare for the hearing because the report did not contain recommendations. Dr. Webb testified at the probable cause hearing in April that O.R.B. required in-patient treatment, providing an early indication that a recommendation of commitment would be necessary. O.R.B. was then held under an emergency detention. Dr. Webb\u2019s report clearly set forth his belief that O.R.B. suffered from a serious disorder. Thus, the testimony at the initial hearing, O.R.B.\u2019s emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>detention, and the written report\u2019s conclusions were together sufficient to put O.R.B. \u201con notice\u201d that the recommendation would be for her commitment. Although we do not condone the report error, and recognize that the error could potentially be prejudicial in other circumstances, we cannot conclude that Dr. Webb\u2019s oversight requires reversal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
