Sweeney (Christina), appeals from the post-judgment order entered by the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, denying her motions for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in denying Christina\u2019s motion for a</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">new trial based on an asserted insufficiency of the evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion by denying Christina\u2019s motion for a new trial based on alleged jury misconduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">\u00b65 In January of2002, Christina and Everett P. Harris (Everett) had a two-vehicle accident in Lolo, Montana, at an intersection controlled by a traffic light. Christina was driving a sport utility vehicle. Everett was driving a Peterbilt truck pulling a \u201cpup\u201d trailer in the course of his work for one or more of the defendants Maclay Ranch, Maclay and Sons, or H. Bruce Maclay.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">\u00b66 Christina sued Everett, H. Bruce Maclay and the two Maclay entities. The caption of some documents of record lists Zomer Trucking Company (Zomer) as a defendant. Nothing else of record reflects that Zomer is a party to this case, however, and for that reason we do not address Zomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">\u00b67 The case proceeded to a jury trial. The jury awarded damages to Christina, and allocated 40% liability to her and 60% liability to the defendants. The District Court entered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. Christina then filed post-trial motions, including motions for a new trial based on an asserted insufficiency of the evidence and alleged jury misconduct. The District Court denied the motions. We set forth additional facts as necessary below.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">\u00b68 Our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial depends on the basis of the motion. <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 164, 338 Mont. 442, \u00b6 164, 167 P.3d 815, \u00b6 164 (citing <em>Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27,338Mont. 19, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27,162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>P.3d 134, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27). When the basis of the motion is insufficiency of the evidence, our review is de novo and, like the district court, we determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the verdict. <em>Giambra, </em>\u00b6 27 (citations omitted). Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it may be less than a preponderance of the evidence, but must be more than a \u201cmere scintilla.\u201d <em>Upky v. Marshall Mountain, LLC, </em>2008 MT 90, \u00b6 22, 342 Mont. 273, \u00b6 22, 180 P.3d 651, \u00b6 22 (citation omitted). When the basis of the motion for a new trial is alleged juror misconduct, we will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision absent a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>See McGillen v. Plum Creek Timber Co., </em>1998 MT 193, \u00b6 15,290 Mont. 264, \u00b6 15, 964 P.2d 18, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b69 <em>1. Did the District Court err in denying Christina\u2019s motion for a new trial based on an asserted insufficiency of the evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u00b610 Christina contends the evidence was not sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict apportioning 40% of the liability to her. Accordingly, she asserts the District Court erred in denying her motion for a new trial based on insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u00b611 After the close of all evidence, the District Court instructed the jury that a motorist has a duty to look not only straight ahead but also laterally ahead. The instruction also stated that a motorist has a duty to see that which is in plain sight, and cannot escape the penalty of his or her negligence by saying he or she did not see that which was in plain view. Christina objected to this instruction in the District Court-albeit without presenting argument when afforded the opportunity to do so during the settling of jury instructions-but she does not challenge it on appeal. Thus, we review her assertion of insufficiency of the evidence in light of the jury instruction given.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\u00b612 On direct examination, Christina testified that when she was stopped at the intersection, she observed a pickup truck immediately behind her in her rearview mirror and was \u201cfocusing on the car that was across the street, coming at me.\u201d On cross-examination, she admitted that, upon entering the intersection, she did not see Everett\u2019s truck approaching from the side until almost immediately before impact. The investigating law enforcement officer testified that the intersection was \u201cwide-open\u201d and \u201cno obstructions\u201d would have precluded Christina from seeing Everett\u2019s truck. We conclude a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>reasonable mind could accept the foregoing testimony as adequate to support a conclusion that, as contemplated in the jury instruction, Christina did not look laterally-as well as straight-ahead or see that which was in plain view. <em>See Upky, </em>\u00b6 22. Having so concluded, we need not address Christina\u2019s challenges to other aspects of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"Au5\">\u00b613  We hold that substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict and, therefore, the District Court did not err in denying Christina\u2019s motion for a new trial based on insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b614 <em>2. Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion by denying Christina\u2019s motion for a new trial based on allegedjury misconduct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b615 In support of her motion for a new trial based on jury misconduct, Christina submitted the affidavit of juror Wade Street. Street averred, among other things, that fellow juror Lynne Marie Schoonover disrupted the deliberation process with false statements and accusatory language, including statements that Christina failed to react when a courtroom door slammed on her injured arm and that Christina\u2019s lawyers bought a medical expert a Toyota. The defendants responded, and submitted Schoonover\u2019s affidavit regarding her remarks during jury deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b616 Advancing <em>State v. Brogan, </em>272 Mont. 156,160-61, 900 P.2d 284, 287 (1995), Christina asserts juror affidavits may be used to overturn a judgment if \u201cextraneous prejudicial information\u201d is improperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention, as contemplated in M. R. Evid. 606(b). She further posits that Schoonover\u2019s alleged comments were extraneous or external in nature, as opposed to an internal influence.</p>\n<p id=\"A2e\">\u00b617 The provisions in M. R. Evid. 606(b) for challenging a jury verdict via juror testimony, including the \u201cextraneous prejudicial information\u201d provision, are exclusive and narrowly construed. <em>Stockman Bank of Montana v. Potts, </em>2006 MT 64, \u00b6 66,331 Mont. 381, \u00b6 66,132 P.3d 546, \u00b6 66 (citation omitted). Regarding the alleged door-slamming comment, Christina observes Street\u2019s affidavit states that Schoonover was the only juror who saw the incident. Notwithstanding, and absent adequately-supported argument to the contrary, we conclude that a juror\u2019s alleged observation of an event in the courtroom cannot properly be characterized as \u201cextraneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u00b618 Regarding Schoonover\u2019s alleged comment that plaintiffs counsel purchased a Toyota for a medical expert, the only portion of Street\u2019s affidavit suggesting this was \u201cextraneous\u201d information is his statement that \u201c[cjlearly, there was no evidence of any kind that this had occurred.\u201d In prior cases, however, we have concluded that jurors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>statements during deliberations regarding matters not in evidence were internal influences, as opposed to external influences or extraneous information. <em>See e.g. Williams Feed, Inc. v. State, Dept, of </em>Trans., 2007 MT 79, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31,336 Mont. 493, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31,155 P.3d 1228, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, <em>overruled on other grounds by Giambra, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>State v. Lawlor, </em>2002 MT 235, \u00b6 13, 311 Mont. 493, \u00b6 13, 56 P.3d 863, \u00b6 13; <em>State v. Kelman, </em>276 Mont. 253, 262-63, 915 P.2d 854, 860 (1996). We need not discuss the details of our prior cases because, on appeal, Christina neither analogizes Schoonover\u2019s alleged comment to, nor distinguishes it from, any specific juror comments addressed in our jurisprudence. We conclude Christina has failed to establish that Schoonover\u2019s alleged Toyota-related comment was \u201cextraneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b619 We observe most of Christina\u2019s arguments on this issue relate to Street\u2019s averments regarding his opinions, including that \u201c[f]rom the beginning to the end of deliberations, [Schoonover] attempted to influence the outcome ... with false statements and accusatory language.\u201d From these statements in Street\u2019s affidavit, Christina\u2019s attorneys argue on appeal that Schoonover \u201cconsciously and intentionally attempted to influence the outcome.\u201d Christina having failed to establish Schoonover\u2019s alleged comments were \u201cextraneous,\u201d we decline to address these arguments regarding Street\u2019s opinions and characterizations of Schoonover\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u00b620 In denying Christina\u2019s motion for a new trial, the District Court did not expressly address M. R. Evid. 606(b) or whether the alleged comments at issue involved \u201cextraneous prejudicial information.\u201d It determined, based in part on Schoonover\u2019s affidavit, that Schoonover\u2019s comments during deliberations pertained to matters she observed at trial. In this regard, we observe Christina\u2019s counsel remarked during opening statements that a medical expert for Christina would receive $12,000 per day to testify-a remark supporting Schoonover\u2019s averment that she did not intend her comment regarding a Toyota purchase to be taken literally. In any event, our conclusions that the alleged comments at issue were not \u201cextraneous\u201d are consistent with the District Court\u2019s determination that Schoonover\u2019s comments pertained to matters she observed at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b621  We hold the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion by denying Christina\u2019s motion for a new trial based on alleged juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, RICE, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
