We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it determined McMaster\u2019s restitution obligation based in part upon testimony given at the restitution hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">\u00b64 Dennis Wright (Wright) bought Crossroads Sports and Fitness (Crossroads), a health club located in Helena, Montana, in 1997. Wright\u2019s accountant described Crossroads as a \u201ccash cow\u201d and considered the club a good investment for Wright. Wright hired McMaster as the general manager in 2000 to help run the club\u2019s operations. Wright hired Teresa Whitney (Whitney) a short time later to serve as the club\u2019s business manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">\u00b65 Crossroads encountered serious financial difficulty late in 2002. The club lost large amounts of money from 2002 to 2005. Wright invested an additional $250,000 during this period to stave off bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">\u00b66 Valley Bank of Helena contacted Wright late in 2005 concerning Crossroads\u2019 account with the bank. The bank recently had installed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>fraud detection software. The software program had flagged the Crossroads account as a possible victim of fraudulent activity. Wright learned from the bank that a significant amount of unauthorized and unusual account activity had occurred. Wright filed a report of potential embezzlement and internal theft with Helena Police Detective Russ Whitcomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b67 Detectives Whitcomb and Mark Ekola and Agent Wade Cooperider began an investigation of Wright\u2019s allegations. They accompanied Wright to Crossroads\u2019 offices to collect evidence and to speak with McMaster. McMaster admitted that he had done things \u201cwhich were not right,\u201d but did not admit to having stolen money from Crossroads at that time. Detective Whitcomb estimated that Wright had suffered a loss of approximately $66,000 at the conclusion of his investigation. The State filed embezzlement charges against both McMaster and Whitney.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b68 Whitney pled guilty to the theft of property by embezzlement. She received a three year deferred imposition of sentence and a restitution obligation of $18,945.88. McMaster pled guilty to theft of property by embezzlement on May 11, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b69 Probation Officer Michael Touchette prepared a Pre-sentence Investigation Report (PSI) for the court. The PSI documented McMaster\u2019s assets as a moderate income, a house, two vehicles, and a supplemental income from his wife. The PSI did not include an affidavit submitted by Wright that described his pecuniary loss, but it did refer to statements submitted by Wright concerning his estimation of an appropriate amount for restitution. The PSI outlined the circumstances of McMaster\u2019s embezzlement activities and the various methods used by McMaster to steal funds. The PSI recommended that the court set McMaster\u2019s restitution obligation at $12,914.46. The probation officer filed the PSI and delivered it to the State on August 22, 2006-two days before the restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b610 The District Court held a restitution hearing on August 24, 2006, and continued the hearing for a second day on September 6, 2006. Wright submitted a written statement concerning the funds embezzled by McMaster fifteen minutes before the start of the hearing on August 24,2006. Wright testified on both days of the hearing. McMaster cross-examined Wright on the first day of the hearing. McMaster also cross-examined Wright when the court re-convened the hearing nearly two weeks later on September 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u00b611 Wright described the losses that Crossroads had incurred as a result of McMaster\u2019s activities. Wright \u201ctotally disagree[d]\u201d with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>restitution figure set forth in the PSI. Wright submitted a written summary of his alleged losses that varied with the calculations provided in the PSI. McMaster objected to the summary on the grounds that he had received the summary only minutes before the first day of the hearing. The State informed the court that it had received the PSI two days before the first day of the hearing. The State had asked Wright to prepare the summary in the interim to reflect his disagreement with the PSI\u2019s restitution figure. The District Court provided McMaster with the opportunity to request a continuation of the hearing or a delay in the imposition of McMaster\u2019s restitution. McMaster\u2019s counsel stated that she did not want to continue the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b6 12 McMaster obj ected to witness testimony and estimates throughout the hearing based upon his late receipt, or non-receipt in some cases, of various financial documents. The court offered on several occasions to continue the hearing if McMaster felt \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d at the lack of timely access to Wright\u2019s financial records or if McMaster wanted more time to review the records or to obtain additional records.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b6 13 Wright\u2019s summary included two different restitution calculations. Wright first employed a cash-flow analysis that compared the club\u2019s cash-flow and account balance from the period after McMaster left Crossroads to the club\u2019s finances during the time that McMaster had embezzled funds. The analysis assumed that no significant improvements or changes had occurred in Crossroads\u2019 operating procedures. The analysis concluded that the club should have netted a positive balance of $105,000 for each of the years that McMaster had embezzled funds. The analysis presented a total restitution recommendation of $334,425-the projected net balance multiplied by the three years covered by the embezzlement charge against McMaster, plus accounting charges incurred in the investigation of the club\u2019s losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b614 The summary presented by Wright included an alternate restitution calculation based upon Wright\u2019s calculations of lost funds. The summary contained nineteen categories of embezzlement activity, including improper cash withdrawals, illegitimate credit card charges, unauthorized \u201cbonus\u201d payments, and unauthorized trade-outs with other businesses. Wright highlighted in his testimony the areas that he believed the probation officer had failed to account in calculating the restitution. Wright calculated these amounts based on his own review of financial records, interviews with other Crossroads employees, and assumptions that he had made regarding the club\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>business. Wright\u2019s alleged losses under this method of analysis totaled $231,693.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b615 Leigh Ann West Simendinger (Simendinger) testified on behalf of the State. Simendinger is an accountant and an independent consultant who works with struggling businesses to improve their financial situations. Simendinger regularly employs cash-flow analyses in her consulting work. She supported the restitution calculation that Wright had presented using the cash-flow analysis. Simendinger testified that Wright\u2019s cash-flow analysis constituted a very conservative estimate of Crossroads\u2019 earning potential during McMaster\u2019s period of embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b6 16 David Johnson, an accountant hired by McMaster, testified on the second day of the hearing. The court qualified Johnson as an expert. Johnson testified that he had received and reviewed a copy of the written statement that Wright had submitted on the first day of the hearing. Johnson sought to discredit Wright\u2019s restitution figures. Johnson critiqued specific restitution claims in Wright\u2019s written statement as well as Wright\u2019s testimony regarding a cash-flow analysis. Johnson also discussed Simendinger\u2019s testimony concerning the cash-flow analysis. Johnson characterized the analysis as \u201cirresponsible.\u201d Johnson testified that he would rely only upon \u201cactual records\u201d and would require the records to demonstrate a \u201cdirect benefit\u201d to McMaster for any restitution calculation. Johnson later admitted that the available records appeared to reveal that McMaster had documented legitimate transactions, but McMaster had left no source documents with regard to any illegitimate transactions. He conceded that a cash-flow analysis would constitute a proper method for determining the restitution amount in an embezzlement case when the \u201cactual records\u201d were known to be inaccurate and where an employee had skimmed cash from the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b617 The probation officer who had prepared the PSI, Touchette, also testified at the hearing. The State challenged the analysis that Touchette had employed in preparing the PSI and challenged his final restitution calculations. Touchette testified that he and Johnson had reviewed Wright\u2019s claimed losses in detail and had \u201cwhittled that down to what we could actually prove the defendant put in his pocket....\u201d Touchette asserted that he would not provide a restitution figure without having \u201cdocumentable\u201d evidence that demonstrated the victim\u2019s losses with \u201cabsolute certainty.\u201d Touchette attributed the majority of Wright\u2019s losses to bad management choices made by McMaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u00b618 The District Court received several restitution recommendations. The recommendations ranged from the $12,914 proposed by the probation officer, to $334,425 as set forth in Wright\u2019s cash-flow analysis. McMaster noted again at the conclusion of the hearing that he had not received Wright\u2019s written statement regarding Crossroads\u2019 losses until fifteen minutes before the first day of the hearing. McMaster argued that he had received no documents that supported Wright\u2019s written statement between the first day of the hearing on August 24, 2006, and the second day of the hearing on September 6, 2006. The State informed the court that neither the State, nor Wright, had received a request for additional records during the two weeks between the hearing dates. The court adjourned the hearing without imposing a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b619 The court issued an order five days later on September 11, 2006, that found that the pecuniary loss to Wright consisted of $102,753, \u201cat a minimum.\u201d The court found further, however, that McMaster could afford to pay only $30,000. The court set McMaster\u2019s restitution at $30,000 based upon this finding. McMaster appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b620 We apply a two-tiered standard of review to a criminal sentence that does not qualify under statute for review by the Sentence Review Division because the sentence does not impose at least one year of actual incarceration. <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6\u00b6 6-23, 320 Mont. 490, \u00b6\u00b6 16-23, 87 P.3d 1017, \u00b6\u00b6 16-23. We review de novo whether the court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the applicable sentencing parameters, and whether the court adhered to the mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 323, \u00b6 10, 184 P.3d 313, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b621 We next review the district court\u2019s sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6 25. An abuse of discretion exists if the sentencing court acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason and works a substantial injustice. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 10. We review findings of fact made by the district court under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 11. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are unsupported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves a definite and firm conviction that the sentencing court made a mistake. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b622 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it determined McMaster\u2019s restitution obligation based in part upon testimony given at the restitution hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b623 Our de novo review of McMaster\u2019s sentence requires that we first address a potential defect in the sentencing court\u2019s restitution determination for McMaster. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 10. District courts must sentence offenders to make full restitution to victims who have sustained pecuniary losses. Section 46-18-241, MCA; <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 13. Section 46-18-242(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[wjhenever the court believes that a victim may have sustained a pecuniary loss ...\u201d the court shall order the PSI to include a list of the offender\u2019s assets and a victim-submitted affidavit describing the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"AG2\">\u00b624 The PSI in this case documented McMaster\u2019s assets as a moderate income, a house, two vehicles, and a supplemental income from his wife. The PSI did not include an affidavit submitted by Wright that described Wright\u2019s pecuniary loss. Wright did describe his pecuniary losses under oath, however, in his testimony before the district court at the hearing on restitution. McMaster cross-examined Wright at length concerning his alleged losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b625 The record does not reveal whether the District Court ordered the PSI to include a victim\u2019s affidavit regarding alleged losses. This Court may disregard any defect in a proceeding that does not affect substantial rights. Section 46-20-701(2), MCA. We conclude that any potential failure on the part of the District Court to order the PSI to include a victim\u2019s affidavit did not affect McMaster\u2019s substantial rights in light of Wright\u2019s extensive and scrutinized testimony at the hearing and our resolution of McMaster\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b626 McMaster argues that the District Court could not rely on a cash-flow analysis for determining the victim\u2019s losses in this case. McMaster asserts that the State and Wright had to provide documents to support Wright\u2019s alleged losses. McMaster argues that due process and the statutory guidelines require documentation to substantiate a court\u2019s imposition of restitution. The State responds by noting that McMaster embezzled money through fraudulent accounting practices. The State contends that McMaster\u2019s actions rendered the relevant financial documents worthless and necessitated the use of a cash-flow analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"ApT\">\u00b627 Section 46-18-242(1), MCA, as noted above, requires the PSI in a case involving a pecuniary loss to a victim to include a list of the offender\u2019s assets and a victim-submitted affidavit describing the victim\u2019s loss. The 2001 version of \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, required the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>PSI to include \u201cdocumentation\u201d of both the offender\u2019s assets and the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss. Section 46-18-242(l)(a)-(b), MCA (2001). The legislature eliminated the word \u201cdocumentation\u201d in 2003. Laws of Montana, 2003, Ch. 272, \u00a7 4. The amended statute requires only a \u201clist\u201d of the offender\u2019s assets and \u201can affidavit that specifically describes\u201d the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss. Section 46-18-242(1), MCA. The legislature eliminated in 2003 the documentation requirement that McMaster would have this Court impose upon the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b628  We have held that a victim may recover losses \u201ceven though the actual losses may be uncertain, if the losses were calculated by use of reasonable methods based on the best evidence available under the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Benoit, </em>2002 MT 166, \u00b6 29, 310 Mont. 449, \u00b6 29, 51 P.3d 495, \u00b6 29. We upheld in <em>Benoit </em>a district court\u2019s reliance on a victim\u2019s methodology and underlying assumptions in calculating a restitution amount that stemmed from Benoit\u2019s falsifying and voiding sales at a restaurant. <em>Benoit, </em>\u00b6 30. We approved of the use of \u201csome guess work\u201d in <em>Benoit </em>and concluded that the sentencing court adopted reasonably the restitution calculation method employed by the victim under the circumstances. <em>Benoit, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b629  The Dissent chides the District Court for crediting the \u201coff-the-cuff surprise, non-expert, undocumented testimony\u2019 of Wright and his accountant. Dissent, \u00b6 51. Nothing in the controlling restitution statutes, however, requires a court or a victim to substantiate a restitution calculation with documentation. And nothing in the restitution statutes circumscribes a court from relying on victim testimony presented at a sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b630 Title 46, Chapter 18, MCA, contains the procedural and substantive guidelines that govern a sentencing court\u2019s imposition of restitution. Section 46-18-242(1), MCA, as noted above, no longer requires the PSI to include \u201cdocumentation\u201d in support of a calculation of a victim\u2019s pecuniary loss. The statute requires only an affidavit submitted by the victim describing any pecuniary loss. Section 46-18-242(l)(b), MCA. In fact, a victim may \u201cdecline[] to confer ...\u201d with the probation officer altogether during the preparation of the PSI regarding the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss. Section 46-18-112(l)(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AKb\">\u00b631 District courts must permit victims to present a statement concerning the impact of the crime on the victim and the victim\u2019s opinion regarding an appropriate sentence. Section 46-18-115(4)(a), MCA. The victim may present this statement, \u201c[a]t the victim\u2019s option, ... in writing before the sentencing hearing <em>or orally under oath at the sentencing hearing, or both.\u201d </em>Section 46-18-115(4)(a), MCA (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>added). Section 46-18-115(4)(b), MCA, requires only that the court provide to the defendant a copy of any written statement submitted by the victim \u201cprior to imposing sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b632 Section 46-18-115(4)(c), MCA, further provides that a court \u201cshall consider the victim\u2019s statement ...\u201d and authorizes a court to rely on \u201cnew material facts ...\u201d presented by the victim at the sentencing hearing. A court must provide the defendant with an adequate opportunity to respond if the court intends to rely on new material facts presented by the victim. Section 46-18-115(4)(c), MCA. A court also may continue the hearing if it intends to rely upon any new material facts. Section 46-18-115(4)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b633 Wright submitted a written statement regarding the impact of McMaster\u2019s embezzlement to the court. McMaster received this document fifteen minutes before the first day of the hearing on August 24, 2006. The court continued the hearing at the end of the day on August 24, 2006. Wright resumed testifying thirteen days later at the second day of the hearing on September 6, 2006. The court concluded the hearing without imposing sentence. The court ultimately set McMaster\u2019s restitution obligation on September 11, 2006. McMaster received the written statement submitted by Wright eighteen days \u201cprior to [the court] imposing sentence.\u201d Section 46-18-115(4)(b), MCA. Wright chose to present his statement \u201cboth\u201d in writing and orally at the sentencing hearing. Section 46-18-115(4)(a), MCA. The District Court, in turn, \u201cconsidered]\u201d Wright\u2019s statement and relied upon \u201cnew material facts ...\u201d contained in the statement. Section 46-18-115(4)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b634  The court satisfied \u00a7 46-18-115(4)(c), MCA, by providing McMaster with an \u201cadequate opportunity to respond ...\u201d to Wright\u2019s statement. McMaster\u2019s expert reviewed Wright\u2019s statement between the first day of the hearing on August 24, 2006, and the second day of the hearing on September 6,2006. McMaster\u2019s expert offered a critical analysis of Wright\u2019s written statement and the testimony concerning the cash-flow analysis. The court also offered to \u201ccontinue the sentencing hearing...\u201d on at least three separate occasions. McMaster declined each offer. The District Court complied fully with the controlling statutes to the extent that it considered Wright\u2019s written statement and credited the \u201cnon-expert, undocumented testimony\u201d presented by Wright during the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b635 Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA, sets forth the substantive information that a district court may consider when calculating a victim\u2019s pecuniary loss. The statute defines pecuniary loss for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>restitution purposes as \u201call special damages, but not general damages, substantiated by evidence in the record, that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action....\u201d Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA. We have stated that testimony at a sentencing hearing comprises part of the record when considering an appeal in a criminal case. <em>State v. Korang, </em>237 Mont. 390, 396, 773 P.2d 326, 329 (1989); see <em>also State v.

Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b636 Testimony from McMaster\u2019s accountant and the probation officer reveal that both failed to understand the burden of proof for restitution. McMaster\u2019s accountant attempted to discredit Wright\u2019s restitution analysis. The accountant testified that he would rely only upon \u201cactual records\u201d and would require the records to demonstrate a \u201cdirect benefit\u201d to McMaster for any restitution calculation. The probation officer likewise asserted that he would not provide a restitution figure without having \u201cdocumentable\u201d evidence that demonstrated the victim\u2019s losses with \u201cabsolute certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b637 The District Court heard testimony from multiple witnesses who confirmed that McMaster\u2019s fraudulent accounting practices prohibited an accurate determination of a restitution amount based upon a review of Crossroads\u2019 financial records. McMaster offers no alternative non-documentary method of analysis to determine the restitution amount. Indeed, McMaster\u2019s accountant admitted that a cash-flow analysis often could constitute a proper method for determining the restitution amount in an embezzlement case given the inaccuracy of the underlying records. The testimony at the hearing confirmed that the PSI\u2019s exclusive reliance on documented transactions did not provide the \u201cbest evidence available under the circumstances\u201d in light of McMaster\u2019s fraudulent bookkeeping practices and the various embezzlement methods that he had employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b638 The District Court heard testimony from numerous witnesses at the sentencing hearing regarding the extent of McMaster\u2019s embezzlement. Wright described at length the losses that Crossroads had incurred as a result of McMaster\u2019s activities. The District Court provided McMaster with the opportunity to request a continuation of the hearing or a delay of the imposition of McMaster\u2019s restitution on several occasions if McMaster felt \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d at the lack of timely access to the financial records or if McMaster wanted more time to review the records or to obtain additional records. McMaster declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u00b639  McMaster admitted to taking money from Wright. The District Court received varying restitution recommendations that ranged from $12,914 to $334,425. The court determined that the pecuniary loss to Wright consisted of at least $102,753. The court reached this amount based upon the calculations made in the PSI, Wright\u2019s testimony at the hearing, and the testimony at the hearing concerning the cash-flow analysis. Substantial evidence in the record supports the District Court\u2019s findings. <em>Korang, </em>237 Mont, at 396, 773 P.2d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b640 The Dissent faults the District Court for discrediting the calculations made by the defense accountant and the probation officer as set forth in the PSI. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53. The Dissent confuses the duties of the probation officer in creating the PSI with the roles of the court and the victim. The probation officer must make a reasonable effort to ascertain whether a victim has sustained a pecuniary loss. Section 46-18-112(l)(f), MCA. The victim need not provide any information to the probation officer. Section 46-18-112(l)(f), MCA. The victim can wait until the hearing to present testimony or documents in support of the amount of the loss. Section 46-18-115(4)(a), MCA. Moreover, the information included in the PSI does not bind a district court. The court need only \u201cconsider\u201d a PSI before imposing a sentence. Section 46-18-111(1), MCA. The Dissent concedes that the court considered the information included in the PSI. Dissent, \u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b641 The Dissent argues that some of Wright\u2019s calculations \u201cwere demonstrably wrong-which should have cast suspicion on the rest.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 52. The Dissent fails to note that the State established that some of the calculations and assumptions made by Touchette and Johnson also \u201cwere demonstrably wrong,\u201d which, of course, should have cast suspicion on the rest of their work. For example, Touchette first described McMaster\u2019s financial status as a debt of $168,000. Touchette erroneously had failed to account for the value of the assets for which McMaster owed money. Touchette recognized this flaw in his accounting only after extensive questioning from the State, and corrected his assessment of McMaster to a positive financial status of $20,000. Touchette also had accounted zero dollars in restitution for illegitimate trade-outs because he had not \u201cseen any documentation ....\u201d Touchette conceded at the same time, however, that the defendant had admitted to illegitimate trade-outs. Similarly, Johnson testified that he would rely only upon \u201cactual records,\u201d despite conceding that McMaster had produced no documents for his illegitimate transactions. Nothing prevented the court from deeming the victim\u2019s information more accurate than the information presented by the probation officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>or by the defendant\u2019s expert witness, especially in light of the testimony presented at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b642 The Dissent argues that the proceedings before the District Court constituted a \u201ctrial by ambush.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 60. The record below reveals, however, that the District Court proceeded in compliance with the controlling statutes. In fact, the District Court offered to make accommodations beyond those required by the statute with respect to McMaster\u2019s concerns on at least three separate occasions. McMaster declined all three offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b643 McMaster made no requests for additional records in the thirteen days that passed between the first and second day of the hearing. The District Court provided McMaster with multiple opportunities to request a continuance or to delay the imposition of sentence if McMaster felt \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d by the lack of financial records or if he wanted more time to obtain additional records. McMaster declined. McMaster\u2019s repeated refusal of the court\u2019s offers undermines his alleged due process violations and the Dissent\u2019s assertion of an \u201cambush.\u201d We will not allow McMaster to decline the District Court\u2019s offers for additional time during the hearing and then argue on appeal that he had only \u201cfifteen minutes\u201d to prepare.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b644 The Dissent claims that the District Court\u2019s management of the restitution hearings will discourage defendants from cooperating with the pre-sentence investigation. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 60. The PSI and testimony from Johnson reveal that McMaster did not cooperate with the pre-sentence investigation that took place before the hearings. We suspect that the disincentive for defendants to cooperate lies not in the sentencing framework set forth in the statutes; rather, the disincentive likely stems from the fact that, for every dollar a defendant admits taking, the court \u201cshall ... require payment of full restitution to the victim ....\u201d Section 46-18-201(5), MCA. As aptly stated in McMaster\u2019s PSI: \u201cThe defendant minimized the extent of his crime when being investigated and still disputes the amount of restitution owed by him in this case. This is common among people charged with embezzlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b645  The District Court, citing <em>State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, 302 Mont. 1,11 P.3d 539, limited the restitution amount to $30,000 based on the court\u2019s assessment of McMaster\u2019s ability to pay the restitution. The legislature amended the restitution statute in 2003 and eliminated the need to include in the PSI the offender\u2019s \u201cfuture ability to pay restitution ....\u201d Laws of Montana, 2003, Ch. 272, \u00a7 4. An offender\u2019s future ability to pay restitution no longer remains a consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>under \u00a7 46-18-242, MCA. <em>State v. Workman, </em>2005 MT 22, \u00b6 15, 326 Mont. 1, \u00b6 15, 107 P.3d 462, \u00b6 15. The State correctly points out that the court\u2019s consideration of this factor simply worked in McMaster\u2019s favor. We conclude, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered McMaster to pay restitution in the amount of $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b646 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b206-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AAj\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u00b647 I dissent from the Court\u2019s Opinion. What took place at the restitution hearing violates fundamental fairness. The Court\u2019s decision sets a precedent that will encourage \u201ctrial by ambush\u201d tactics and will serve as a disincentive for defendants to cooperate in any presentence investigation (PSI) ordered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\u00b648 The procedural background of this case deserves to be recounted. To begin with, probation officer Michael Touchette (Touchette) and forensic accountant David Johnson (Johnson), who was qualified as an expert by the trial court, carefully reviewed all available information provided to them by the prosecution and in possession of law enforcement, including the investigating officer\u2019s report. Touchette and Johnson interviewed the parties, including the Crossroads Fitness Center\u2019s owner, Dr. Dennis Wright (Wright), and made a restitution recommendation in the PSI of $12,914.46. Both Touchette and Johnson believed that this was the amount that was provable as criminal conduct by McMaster and his accomplice. They believed that other claims, ranging from $66,000 by the investigating officer to some $300,000 by Wright, were the result of bad business judgment and mismanagement-largely because McMaster was not a businessman-rather than the result of embezzlement or other criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">\u00b649 No additional information was made available to the defense or to the probation officer until fifteen minutes before the restitution hearing was scheduled to commence. At this time, the prosecution faxed to defense counsel a document prepared by Wright with the demand for $334,425 in restitution calculated by \u201cproject[ing]... back\u201d the money Crossroads Fitness Center (Crossroads) should have made during 2003, 2004, and 2005. Using a different method-one deemed \u201cless accurate\u201d by Wright-he calculated that the funds stolen from Crossroads, in addition to an accounting fee, totaled $251,118. No supporting documentation was produced then, nor has it been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>produced since, to substantiate Wright\u2019s claims. Wright\u2019s bare, undocumented demand for $334,425 in restitution was provided to and considered by the court at the restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b650 At the hearing, Wright offered all sorts of testimony about his claimed losses and how they were calculated. Wright conceded that he was not an accountant, that he had no formal business training, and that he had never conducted a forensic audit. Wright never produced any documentation substantiating his claims, and his figures and recollections were, at best, equivocal in a number of particulars. Indeed, some of his contentions were proven to be flat wrong by Touchette and Johnson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Another prosecution witness, Leigh Ann West Simendinger (Simendinger) likewise testified completely out of the blue. Simendinger apparently had an accounting degree and had passed the CPA exam, but had not activated her license in Montana. She was not qualified as an expert. She produced no written report; testified without producing any records; and admitted that she had not audited Crossroads\u2019 books. She admitted that she was not qualified to give an audit opinion. Indeed, Johnson-who was a forensic accountant and who was qualified as an expert-found her calculations to be \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d without having produced any evidence to support her conclusions. Wright\u2019s and Simendinger\u2019s testimony was admitted over McMaster\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b651 As noted in \u00b6 19 of the Court\u2019s Opinion, the trial judge settled on a restitution figure of $30,000-not as the amount which McMaster was criminally responsible for, but as the amount he could likely pay. Clearly, the trial court discredited the careful analysis of the defense witness-expert forensic accountant Johnson-and probation officer Touchette, and, instead, credited the off-the-cuff surprise, non-expert, undocumented testimony of Wright and Simendinger.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b652 Here, Johnson and Touchette, working diligently together from all of the documentary evidence provided to them by the prosecution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>from their interviews of witnesses, including Wright, came up with a figure of $12,914.46. Minutes before the restitution hearing was to begin, the prosecution came up with all new numbers and claims by witnesses which had not been disclosed previously by the State. No documentation was ever produced to support the new numbers or the methodology by which these numbers were produced. Some of Wright\u2019s self-serving claims and calculations were demonstrably wrong \u2014 which should have cast suspicion on the rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b653 We have previously stated that methods used to calculate restitution-including \u201c \u2018some guess work\u2019 \u201d on the part of a victim-may be acceptable if the methods utilized were \u201creasonable based on the <em>best evidence </em>available under the circumstances presented\u201d in the case. <em>State v. Benoit, </em>2002 MT 166, \u00b6 30, 310 Mont. 449, \u00b6 30, 51 P.3d 495, \u00b6 30 (emphasis added). Here, the methods utilized by Johnson and Touchette were based on the \u201cbest evidence available under the circumstances.\u201d Indeed, the $12,914.46 restitution figure they compiled was the <em>only </em>figure supported by documentation. Wright never produced <em>any </em>documentation in support of his self-serving claims for $334,425 or $251,118. Simendinger\u2019s unsupported calculations and methodologies were labeled as \u201cirresponsible\u201d by the forensic accountant. And, many of Wright\u2019s claims were shown to be flat wrong. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s decision based on the surprise evidence at the restitution hearing was clearly <em>not </em>the best evidence available under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b654 Moreover, the District Court noted that \u2018Wright\u2019s estimate of the total stolen is probably somewhat overstated.\u201d Despite this concession, the court apparently decided that Wright\u2019s estimate of the total amount stolen was \u201ccloser to the mark than is the amount of restitution\u201d suggested in the PSI, in large part because the PSI failed to account for \u201ctrade outs\u201d-whereby McMaster traded club memberships for goods and services from area businesses. Yet the PSI noted that the problem with calculating the value of trade-outs was that the \u201cclub would not have received full membership dues for every individual who was given a trade-out.\u201d The court made no attempt to resolve this issue and instead concluded that McMaster took at least $21,000 from Crossroads in unauthorized trade-outs.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b655 While this Court takes great pains to note that \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, no longer requires documentation in support of a calculation of a victim\u2019s pecuniary loss, the Court conflates consideration of the impact of the crime on a victim with a determination of a victim\u2019s pecuniary loss or restitution amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u00b656 A PSI shall contain information on a victim\u2019s pecuniary loss. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-112(l)(f), MCA (when a PSI is required, the probation officer shall inquire into and report upon \u201cthe victim\u2019s pecuniary loss, if any\u201d); \u00a7 46-18-242, MCA (\u201cWhenever the court believes that a victim may have sustained a pecuniary loss,\u201d the PSI shall include a list of the offender\u2019s assets and an affidavit that specifically describes the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss.). If a PSI is not authorized or requested, \u201cthe court shall accept evidence of the victim\u2019s loss at the time of sentencing.\u201d Section 46-18-242(2), MCA. Here, there was a PSI. Wright had been interviewed by the probation officer in accordance with \u00a7 46-18-112(l)(f), MCA. There were no challenges to the accuracy of the information in the PSI. And, the court was under no obligation to allow, much less credit, Wright\u2019s wild, undocumented, and self-serving claims of pecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b657 The law also provides that the court \u201cshall permit the victim to present a statement concerning the effects of the crime on the victim, the circumstances surrounding the crime, the manner in which the crime was perpetrated, and the victim\u2019s opinion regarding appropriate sentence.\u201d Section 46-18-115(4)(a), MCA. The substance of a victim\u2019s statement concerning the effects of the crime on the victim-which presumably may include a description of how the crime made the victim feel, the loss of sleep suffered by the victim as a result of the crime, the effect on family relationships, etc.-is entirely separate and apart from the calculation of pecuniary loss, which must be \u201csubstantiated by evidence in the record.\u201d Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA. This calculation must be based on \u201cthe <em>best evidence </em>available under the circumstances presented\u201d in the case. <em>Benoit, </em>\u00b6 30 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b658 Furthermore, \u00a7 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA, defines the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss in terms of what could be proven in a civil action under the applicable standard of proof. I am unaware of any civil case that we have ever decided in which this Court affirmed a trial court\u2019s decision that resulted from a situation like the one at issue here-i.e., a party prepares to come to court with his witnesses for a damages hearing; he\u2019s ready to present evidence based on his and his expert\u2019s own investigations, interviews of opposing witnesses, audits of information, and documents and discovery provided by the adverse party; but fifteen minutes before the hearing, the adverse party comes up with entirely new numbers, undisclosed witnesses, no experts, questionable methodologies, and no documents to back any of it up. To make matters worse, the court allows this undisclosed and untested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>evidence to be admitted over the adverse party\u2019s objection, and then rules on the basis of this information. We would never allow this scenario in a civil context. Wright could not, under any standard of proof that I am aware of, prove his wild, self-serving claims of loss in a civil case in the maimer that the trial court allowed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b659 Unfortunately, this Court, today, says that this sort of practice and procedure is perfectly acceptable in a criminal case. Our decision now serves as precedent for prosecutors and trial judges across the State to do exactly the same thing-sandbag<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defense on the morning of the hearing. And, presumably, the State will not be heard to complain when the defendant refuses to cooperate in the presentence investigation, and, instead, shows up at the restitution hearing with a whole plethora of undisclosed witnesses, experts, and expert-wannabes who offer speculative and undocumented, self-serving testimony and hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b660 I cannot condone this \u201ctrial by ambush\u201d approach. It is unfair; it is antithetical to the search for truth; it discourages cooperation between the parties and the investigating probation officer; it obviates trust and reliance on mutual discovery; it rewards the party who waits until the last minute to prepare his or her case; it encourages sharp practice; it demeans the careful work of the investigating probation officer; it destroys the orderly administration of justice; and, ultimately, it produces an inaccurate and unjust result which is not based on the best evidence available.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b661 McMaster is entitled to have his restitution obligation reduced to $12,914.46.1 dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\"> Indeed, compare our decision in a recent civil case involving an inverse condemnation issue, <em>K&amp;R Partnership v. City of Whitefish, </em>2008 MT 228, 344 Mont. 336,_P.3d_. There we observed that, to comply with the second prong of the \u201clandowner-witness\u201d rule, where a property owner (there a landowner) testifies as to the value of his own property beyond its current use, he must have some peculiar knowledge not possessed by the average layman and must indicate some basis or foundation for Ins claimed expertise. <em>See K&amp;R Partnership, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43, 45. Quite to the contrary, here, Wright admitted no business or accounting experience at all, much less any expertise in computing the forensic loss from a claimed business emhezzlement. In the restitution hearing, however, he was allowed to pull figures out of the air without documentation or foundation using questionable methodologies and proeedures-some of which were demonstrably wrong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\"> Ironically, we recently condemned this sort of conduct in another civil case, <em>Nikolaisen v. Advance Transformer Co., </em>2007 MT 352, 340 Mont. 332, 174 P.3d 940, wherein we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The term \u201csandbagged,\u201d in the present context derives from the tactic of a poker player to trap another player by checking a strong hand to induce a bet, and then raising once that bet is made. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged </em>2009 (Philip Babcock Gove, ed., Merriam-Webster, Inc. 2002).
