We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-22\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it determined that Deputy Suta had particularized suspicion to stop McMaster\u2019s vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b64 On December 29, 2006, Police Officer Travis Alexander observed a possible drug deal in the parking lot of the Town Pump and Lucky Lil\u2019s Casino in Conrad, Montana. Officer Alexander noticed three individuals continuously monitoring his actions and engaging in suspicious behavior. The individuals left their vehicles and entered the casino, looking over their shoulders as they went.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b65 Officer Alexander moved his patrol vehicle to a more discreet location and continued to observe the Town Pump. After a short time, the individuals exited the casino, returned to their vehicles, and exchanged a box. The individuals then got in their vehicles and left the Town Pump. Officer Alexander followed one vehicle and contacted Pondera County Sheriffs Deputy Carl Suta, the local narcotics officer, and requested that he follow the second vehicle, a pickup with the license plate \u201cJ R M.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\u00b66 Deputy Suta contacted dispatch and learned that the vehicle was registered to Jon Ross McMaster, a known cocaine and methamphetamine dealer. In an unmarked car, Deputy Suta followed the pickup on the interstate from the Conrad Town Pump to the Ledger exit, the first exit north of Conrad. After he observed apparent traffic violations and erratic driving, Deputy Suta requested that a deputy in a marked patrol vehicle stop the pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">\u00b67 The deputies identified McMaster as the vehicle\u2019s driver. While the deputies spoke with McMaster, McMaster reached into the seat, of the vehicle and behind the seat. Deputy Suta observed what he believed to be knife handles in the door pocket, a metal dart stuck in the dash, and heavy flashlights within McMaster\u2019s reach. Deputy Suta had McMaster exit the pickup, and the deputy performed a pat-down of McMaster. Deputy Suta discovered a pocket knife and a methamphetamine pipe. The deputies arrested McMaster for possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">\u00b68 During booking, law enforcement found marijuana and a second glass pipe containing methamphetamine residue in McMaster\u2019s pockets. McMaster admitted to Deputy Suta that he was traveling to Spokane to purchase methamphetamine, and he disclosed that the individuals at the Town Pump were giving him money to purchase drugs. McMaster explained that they agreed to meet at the Ledger exit after they noticed Officer Alexander at the Town Pump. McMaster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>consented to a search of his pickup, and officers discovered $9,000 under the seat, several glass pipes, lighters, and additional methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b69 The State charged McMaster with three misdemeanors for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia and one felony for criminal possession of methamphetamine. McMaster moved to suppress the evidence and dismiss the charges, arguing that Deputy Suta did not possess the particularized suspicion required to justify the stop. The District Court denied McMaster\u2019s motion. Under a plea agreement, McMaster then pleaded guilty to the felony charge, and the State dismissed the misdemeanor charges. McMaster specifically reserved his right to appeal, and he now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Thomas, </em>2008 MT 206, \u00b6 9, 344 Mont. 150, \u00b6 9, 186 P.3d 864, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err when it determined that Deputy Suta had particularized suspicion to stop McMaster\u2019s vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">\u00b612 McMaster argues that Deputy Suta did not possess enough objective data to form the requisite particularized suspicion to justify an investigative stop and that the District Court thus erred when it denied his motion to suppress/dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">\u00b613 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect persons from unreasonable searches and seizures. These protections extend to brief investigative stops of vehicles. <em>U.S. v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411,417,101S. Ct. 690, 694-95 (1981); <em>State v. Gopher, </em>193 Mont. 189, 194, 631 P.2d 293, 296 (1981). An officer may conduct a constitutionally valid investigative stop of a vehicle if the officer possesses a \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d that the vehicle\u2019s occupant \u201chas committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d Section 46-5-401(1), MCA. To establish particularized suspicion, the State must demonstrate (1) objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the vehicle\u2019s occupant is or has been engaged in wrongdoing. <em>State v. Gouras, </em>2004 MT 329, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>16, 324 Mont. 130, \u00b6 16, 102 P.3d 27, \u00b6 16. Whether particularized suspicion supports an investigative stop is a question of fact that we evaluate in the context of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 10. When evaluating the totality of the circumstances, we consider the quantity or content of the information available to the officer and the quality or degree of reliability of that information. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b6 14 McMaster argues that particularized suspicion cannot result from \u201cgeneral information and observed behavior\u201d that is not illegal, but that officers may view as suspicious. McMaster cites to <em>State v. Broken Rope, </em>278 Mont. 427, 925 P.2d 1157 (1996) as an example. McMaster then isolates the factors on which Deputy Suta relied and argues that they do not rise to the level of particularized suspicion. McMaster maintains that the observed behaviors were consistent with innocent behavior. For example, McMaster points out that the events occurred during the Christmas season, and he argues that the box transferred at the Town Pump could have contained a gift, rather than drugs. Similarly, although Deputy Suta may have known that drug deals commonly occur at the Town Pump, the Town Pump is also a \u201cplace where people gather to purchase gas, convenience items, and gamble.\u201d McMaster also discounts as \u201csecond-hand\u201d Deputy Suta\u2019s knowledge of McMaster\u2019s drug-dealing activity and his knowledge regarding the activity at the Town Pump.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b615 The United States Supreme Court has unanimously rejected the \u201cdivide-and-conquer\u201d approach employed by McMaster. <em>U.S. v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 274, 122 S. Ct. 744, 751 (2002). In <em>Arvizu, </em>the Supreme Court stated that such an approach \u201cdeparts sharply\u201d from the Court\u2019s reasonable-suspicion jurisprudence and fails to \u201ctake into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances ....\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274, 122 S. Ct. at 751. The Court reiterated that a series of innocent actions, when taken together, may warrant further investigation. <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274, 122 S. Ct. at 751 (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 22, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 1880-81 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b616 We agree with the Supreme Court that the approach McMaster offers fails to recognize the totality of the circumstances. Further, we reject McMaster\u2019s suggestion that an officer cannot rely on another officer\u2019s observations to support particularized suspicion because the information is \u201csecond-hand.\u201d Montana law allows an arresting officer to rely on information from another officer to establish particularized suspicion. <em>See State v. Olmsted, </em>1998 MT 301, \u00b6 34,292 Mont. 66, \u00b6 34, 968 P.2d 1154, \u00b6 34, <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u00b617 McMaster also finds no support from <em>Broken Rope </em>as the factual circumstances present here differ significantly from those present in that case. In <em>Broken Rope, </em>we held that no particularized suspicion existed to justify the investigative stop of a man whom officers observed entering and leaving a Kwik Way, talking on a phone, walking around the store\u2019s parking lot, putting his hands in his pockets, and staring at an officer. 278 Mont, at 432, 925 P.2d at 1160. In that case, we rejected the State\u2019s contention that the officers \u201ccould draw upon their training and experience\u201d to conclude that Broken Rope was acting in a \u201csuspicious and nervous manner\u201d that would justify an investigative stop, and we stated that Broken Rope\u2019s actions were not \u201cinherently suspicious.\u201d <em>Broken Rope, </em>278 Mont, at 432, 925 P.2d at 1160. Our review, however, was confined to an agreed statement of facts, and we observed that the agreed facts contained no information regarding the officers\u2019 training and experience. <em>Broken Rope, </em>278 Mont, at 432,925 P.2d at 1160. Further, the agreed facts did not mention whether the officers had even concluded that Broken Rope was acting nervous or suspicious. <em>Broken Rope, </em>278 Mont, at 432, 925 P.2d at 1160. In <em>Broken Rope, </em>the officers possessed no information about Broken Rope prior to the investigative stop, and there was no indication that the Kwik Way was a location known for illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"Acp\">\u00b618 In this case, Deputy Suta\u2019s testimony revealed that he stopped McMaster based on Officer Alexander\u2019s observations at the Conrad Town Pump, Deputy Suta\u2019s knowledge of McMaster as a drug-dealer, his personal observations of McMaster\u2019s erratic driving, and his knowledge that the Town Pump was a location known for drug deals.</p>\n<p id=\"A3x\">\u00b619 Officer Alexander informed Deputy Suta that three individuals were engaged in suspicious behavior next to their vehicles in the Town Pump and Lucky Lil\u2019s Casino parking lot. Officer Alexander told Deputy Suta that the individuals were continuously monitoring his actions and that they went into the casino after they noticed him. Once he moved his patrol car out of sight, Officer Alexander observed the individuals exit the casino and transfer a box from one vehicle to the other. Deputy Suta described the individuals\u2019 initial behavior as \u201crubber-necking\u201d-when individuals constantly look at an officer \u201ceight or 10 times in a couple of seconds\u201d-and distinguished this activity from the public\u2019s usual reaction to an officer in a marked car. According to Deputy Suta, while the general public might look at an officer once, people who are \u201crubber-necking\u201d often are engaged in illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"A75\">\u00b620 Deputy Suta testified that, in addition to a Pondera County Sheriffs deputy, he is also federally deputized as a member of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Blackfeet Safe Trails Task Force. Deputy Suta testified that he had been trained to recognize behaviors and activities consistent with drug traffickers and that he had received over 200 hours of drug-crime education. Deputy Suta described that the majority of his work involves investigating drug crimes and that his drug task force works closely with law enforcement and drug task forces throughout Montana. He explained that the task forces commonly share information regarding suspected drug traffickers.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b621 Deputy Suta testified that, based on his experience and through shared information with the Great Falls Police Department and the Central Task Force, he knew that McMaster was a \u201cvery large player\u201d in the cocaine and methamphetamine drug trade in Great Falls and the surrounding areas, including Conrad. Deputy Suta testified that when he learned the pickup with the \u201cJ R M\u201d plates was registered to Jon Ross McMaster, \u201call kinds of bells [went] off.\u201d Deputy Suta had learned from the Great Falls police that McMaster recently had sold his home to finance his drug-dealing venture. Deputy Suta had also discovered information linking McMaster to the drug trade while executing a search warrant earlier in the month, and a person he arrested confirmed that McMaster was a large-scale drug dealer. Deputy Suta explained that he believed McMaster to be the driver of the vehicle based on the license plates and the driver\u2019s build. Deputy Suta further testified that he had witnessed drug deals at the Town Pump and that, based on his training and experience with the Blackfeet Safe Trails Task Force, he knew that it was \u201ccommon practice\u201d for drug dealers to use the Conrad Town Pump for illegal drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b622 Deputy Suta testified that he followed McMaster from the Town Pump onto Interstate 15 and observed McMaster commit traffic violations and engage in erratic driving. According to Deputy Suta, he was traveling approximately 83 miles per hour and McMaster was pulling away from him. Deputy Suta observed McMaster exit the interstate at Ledger and drive toward Highway 91, which parallels I-15. McMaster slowed and stopped his pickup, and then drove a bit further before stopping. McMaster next drove onto Highway 91, performed a u-turn, and drove a short distance before stopping again. According to Deputy Suta, McMaster appeared to be looking for something or waiting to meet someone. Deputy Suta testified that, when McMaster spotted him, McMaster accelerated back to the interstate and traveled south on 1-15. After observing McMaster\u2019s erratic driving, Deputy Suta requested that Chief Deputy Dailey, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>was traveling behind Suta in a marked patrol vehicle, stop McMaster.</p>\n<p id=\"AjI\">\u00b623  Determining whether particularized suspicion supports an investigative stop \u201cdoes not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities.\u201d <em>Gopher, </em>193 Mont, at 192, 631 P.2d at 295 (quoting <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. at 418, 101 S. Ct. at 695). We conclude that Deputy Suta, an experienced law enforcement officer and a specially trained member of a drug task force, reasonably could infer that McMaster was engaged in criminal activity based on Officer Alexander\u2019s observations at the Town Pump, Deputy Suta\u2019s personal observations of McMaster\u2019s erratic driving, Deputy Suta\u2019s knowledge of McMaster as a drug dealer, and Deputy Suta\u2019s knowledge of the Town Pump as a location known for drug deals. Thus, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it determined that Deputy Suta possessed the requisite particularized suspicion to justify the investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"A40\">\u00b624 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
