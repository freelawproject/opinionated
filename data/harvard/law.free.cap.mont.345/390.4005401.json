We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it denied Merry\u2019s motion to suppress the results of his blood alcohol test on the grounds that the sample was collected in violation of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b64 Does the Health Center\u2019s policy unlawfully allow LPNs to conduct blood draws without the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u00b65 Do violations of the Health Center\u2019s policy demonstrate that Bailey was not an \u201cother qualified person acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse\u201d as required by \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err when it used Merry\u2019s failure to controvert his implied consent to support its ruling?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">\u00b67 On March 26, 2006, at approximately 2:30 a.m., McCone County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Marc Speer observed Merry commit several traffic infractions, including driving on the wrong side of the street, failing to stop at three different stop signs, and stopping in the middle of the street although he had the right of way. Deputy Speer stopped Merry and began a DUI investigation. Deputy Speer decided not to conduct standard field sobriety tests due to Merry\u2019s difficulties with walking and maintaining his balance. Merry provided Deputy Speer a breath sample, which indicated that Merry had an alcohol concentration of .136. Merry also agreed to provide a blood sample. Deputy Speer transported Merry to the McCone County Health Center (the Health Center), where Tina Bailey, the licensed practical nurse (LPN) on duty, conducted Merry\u2019s blood draw at Deputy Speer\u2019s request. A registered nurse (RN) and a physician\u2019s assistant were on call, but were not physically present in the Health Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">\u00b68 The State charged Merry with DUI after receiving the results of Merry\u2019s blood alcohol test, which indicated that Merry had an alcohol concentration of. 14. Merry filed a motion to suppress the results of the test, arguing that Bailey was not statutorily authorized to draw blood to detect the presence of alcohol. The Justice Court denied Merry\u2019s motion. Merry then pleaded guilty to DUI, but specifically reserved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>right to appeal the admissibility of the blood test. Merry appealed the Justice Court\u2019s ruling to the District Court and moved to suppress the result of the blood test. The District Court denied Merry\u2019s motion to suppress after considering the parties\u2019 briefs and hearing oral argument. Merry now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Zakovi, </em>2005 MT 91, \u00b6 9, 326 Mont. 475, \u00b6 9,110 P.3d 469, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b610 I. Did the District Court err when it denied Merry\u2019s motion to suppress the results of his blood alcohol test on the grounds that the sample was collected in violation of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\u00b611 Merry contends that the District Court erred when it concluded that Bailey was acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or RN when she drew his blood. Merry maintains that Bailey was not acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or RN, as required by \u00a7 61-8-405, MCA, because neither a physician nor an RN was physically present at the Health Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">\u00b612 The District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 61-8-405, MCA, presents a conclusion of law which we review for correctness. <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 150, \u00b6 15, 310 Mont. 320, \u00b6 15, 50 P.3d 530, \u00b6 15. When interpreting statutes, we seek to implement the Legislature\u2019s objectives. <em>Boettcher v. Montana Guar. Fund, </em>2007 MT 69, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont. 393, \u00b6 19, 154 P.3d 629, \u00b6 19. The statute\u2019s plain language controls our interpretation if we can discern the legislative intent from the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s words. <em>Boettcher, </em>\u00b6 19. Further, we refuse to insert \u201cwhat has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The definition of a statutorily defined term applies throughout the Montana Code unless \u201ca contrary intention plainly appears.\u201d Section 1-2-107, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">\u00b613 Section 61-8-405, MCA, governs the administration of blood tests and provides that only a physician, registered nurse, or \u201cother qualified person acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered muse,\u201d may withdraw blood to determine the presence of alcohol and drugs. Though Merry claims to dispute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Bailey is a \u201cqualified person,\u201d Merry raises no challenges to Bailey\u2019s qualifications on appeal. Further, Merry\u2019s briefing to the District Court reveals that he regarded Bailey as a qualified person within the meaning of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. For this appeal, we accept without deciding that Bailey, as an LPN, is an \u201cother qualified person\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b614 Merry argues that Bailey was not acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or RN because neither a physician nor an RN was physically present at the Health Center. According to Merry, the plain language of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, clearly and unambiguously requires the physical presence of a physician or an RN for a blood draw administered by an \u201cother qualified person\u201d to be proper. Merry contends that the District Court erred in relying on statutes related to other healthcare professions to interpret the meaning of supervision and direction. The State counters that the legislative history of \u00a7 61-8-405, MCA, and this Court\u2019s precedent support a more \u201cgeneral\u201d view of supervision and direction. The State further argues that the purpose of the statute was satisfied in this case because Bailey was under the supervision of an on-call RN.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b615 Section 61-8-405, MCA, does not define the terms \u201csupervision and direction.\u201d Definitions for \u201cdirect supervision,\u201d \u201cgeneral supervision,\u201d and \u201cqualified medical direction\u201d appear in other sections of the Montana Code Annotated; however, in each instance, the Legislature has constrained the applicability of the definitions to particular sections ofthe Code. For example, sections relating to dental hygienists and hearing aid dispenser trainees state that the definitions apply for \u201cthe purposes of this section\u201d and the section relating to respiratory care states that the definition is applicable \u201c[a]s used in this chapter.\u201d Sections 37-4-405, 37-16-405, and 37-28-102, MCA. The Legislature plainly has limited the reach of these definitions, and thus, they cannot properly define the terms of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. Section 1-2-107, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b616 As the phrase \u201cacting under the supervision and direction\u201d is undefined, we look to the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s words to discern the legislative intent. <em>Boettcher, </em>\u00b6 19. The plain meaning ofthe word \u201cunder,\u201d as used in the statute means \u201c[s]ubject to the authority, rule or control of: <em>under a dictatorship ... </em>Subject to the supervision, instruction, or influence of: <em>under parental guidance.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary ofthe English Language </em>1874 (4th ed. Houghton Mifflin Co. 2000). \u201cSupervision\u201d is defined as the \u201cact, process, or function of supervising\u201d and \u201csupervise\u201d means to \u201chave the charge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>direction of; superintend.\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>at 1738-39. \u201cDirection\u201d means \u201c[m]anagement, supervision, or guidance of an action or operation.... An authoritative indication; an order or a command.\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>at 512. We disagree with Merry that \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, clearly and unambiguously requires the physical presence of a physician or RN for a blood draw administered by an \u201cother qualified person\u201d to be proper. The definitions set forth above do not resolve whether \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, requires the physical presence of a physician or RN; the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s words is broad enough to encompass both the State\u2019s and Merry\u2019s interpretations. \u00b617 We turn to a statute\u2019s legislative history to determine its correct interpretation when we cannot discern the Legislature\u2019s intent from the statute\u2019s plain language. <em>Stockman Bank of Montana v. Mon-Kota, Inc., </em>2008 MT 74, \u00b6 17, 342 Mont. 115, \u00b6 17,180 P.3d 1125, \u00b6 17. Prior to 1981, \u00a7 61-8-405, MCA, authorized only physicians and RNs to draw blood to determine the presence of alcohol. The 1981 amendment allowed \u201cother qualified person[s] under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse\u201d to draw blood. Section 61-8-405, MCA (1981). Unfortunately, the committee minutes do not specify whether the Legislature contemplated that \u201csupervision and direction\u201d would require the actual physical presence of a physician or RN or something more general.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b618 The committee minutes do indicate, however, that \u00a7 61-8-405, MCA, was amended to expand the category of persons who permissibly could conduct a blood test, and thus, to facilitate DUI prosecutions. The committee members heard testimony that blood tests were being challenged because lab technicians conducted blood draws, rather than a physician or RN. Mont. H. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on SB 111, </em>47th Leg., Reg. Sess. 3 (Mar. 5, 1981). Committee members also learned that the individuals who perform the blood draws generally are lab technicians. The bill\u2019s proponents informed the committee that the amended language would remove evidentiary challenges to blood tests which were not performed by a physician or an RN. Mont. H. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on SB 111, </em>at 3. Senator Stimatz, who introduced the bill at the request of the Department of Justice (DO J), indicated that \u201cqualified persons, such as laboratory technicians\u201d should be \u201callowed to take blood samples to determine alcohol level of the blood.\u201d Mont. Sen. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on SB 111, </em>47th Leg., Reg. Sess. 1 (Jan. 19, 1981). Similarly, Representative Daily, who presented the bill in the House, stated that the amendment would \u201callow a person other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>a doctor or a registered nurse to draw blood. A lab technician who specializes in this could withdraw the blood.\u201d Mont. H. Jud. Conun., <em>Hearing on SB 111, </em>at 2. Notably, neither Senator Stimatz nor Representative Daily hinged the lab technician\u2019s ability to draw blood on the physical presence of a physician or RN. Further, Senator Mazurek questioned whether \u201ceven broader language in determining who was qualified to draw a blood sample might be helpful.\u201d Mont. Sen. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on SB 111, </em>at 1-2. DOJ spokesman Larry Majerus responded that the main intent of the amendment was \u201cto allow the medical technicians to be included\u201d as persons qualified to draw blood samples, but that it was not intended to \u201ctake the process out of the hospital environment where such qualified persons would not be available.\u201d Mont. Sen. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on SB 111, </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"AJG\">\u00b619  Given the overall purpose of the amendment, the apparent willingness of the Senate Judiciary Committee to consider even broader language in the statute, and the discussion of laboratory technicians\u2019 ability to draw blood with no mention of a specific level of supervision and direction, we conclude that the Legislature contemplated a more general level of \u201csupervision and direction\u201d than that suggested by Merry. Adopting Merry\u2019s interpretation would require us to insert the terms \u201consite\u201d or \u201cdirect\u201d to qualify the \u201csupervision and direction\u201d requirement, and thus, to insert what the Legislature omitted. As the Legislature has not limited \u201csupervision and direction\u201d to onsite or direct supervision, we conclude that a physician\u2019s or RN\u2019s physical presence is not required and that a qualified person who draws blood while subject to offsite or on-call supervision can satisfy the statutory requirement that the person be \u201cacting under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse ....\u201d Section 61-8-405(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b620 Our conclusion that \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, does not require the physical presence of a physician or RN finds support in other statutory provisions involving supervision and direction in the healthcare arena. For example, \u00a7 37-4-405, MCA, allows a dental hygienist to practice under a licensed dentist\u2019s supervision. The statute differentiates between \u201cdirect supervision\u201d and \u201cgeneral supervision\u201d and provides that treatment requiring direct supervision \u201cmust be performed while the dentist is on the premises\u201d while treatment falling under general supervision does not require the dentist to be on the premises. Section 37-4-405, MCA. Similarly, \u00a7 37-16-405, MCA, requires a trainee who is licensed to dispense hearing aids to \u201cwork under the direct supervision of the sponsoring licensed hearing aid dispenser.\u201d In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>context, \u201c\u2018direct supervision\u2019 means the direct and regular observation and instruction of a trainee by a licensed hearing aid dispenser who is available at the same location for prompt consultation and treatment.\u201d Section 37-16-405(8), MCA. Statutes regulating physical therapists and physician assistants also detail when direct or onsite supervision is required. <em>See </em>\u00a7 37-11-105, MCA, and \u00a7 37-20-403, MCA. Though we do not use these statutes to define the terms of \u00a7 61-8-405, MCA, these statutes demonstrate that the Legislature drafts with specificity when it intends to require direct or onsite supervision and direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b621 Moreover, to require the physical presence of a physician or RN when the blood sample is withdrawn renders useless the provision allowing \u201cother qualified persons\u201d to take the blood sample; if the physician\u2019s or RN\u2019s presence is required, the physician or RN could simply perform the blood draw. Such a limited reading contradicts the purpose of the amendment and renders the \u201cother qualified person acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse\u201d language moot. Section 61-8-405(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b622 Our conclusion that a physician\u2019s physical presence is not required under \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, is also consistent with <em>Zakovi. </em>In <em>Zakovi, </em>we determined that a phlebotomist conducted a blood draw in accordance with \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, because she was \u201ccontinuously under the supervision of a registered nurse on duty in the emergency room, <em>as </em>her position is subordinate and requires compliance with the registered nurse\u2019s orders under hospital policy.\u201d <em>Zakovi, </em>\u00b6 36 (emphasis added). Though the RN in <em>Zakovi </em>was apparently present at the St. Peter\u2019s Hospital complex in Helena, we focused on the phlebotomist\u2019s subordinate position and the requirement that the phlebotomist follow the RN\u2019s orders, rather than on the physical presence of the RN.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b623 In this case, the District Court heard testimony that both Hans Arnston, the director of nursing and an RN, and Patti Wittkopp, the physician\u2019s assistant, were on call the night that Bailey withdrew Merry\u2019s blood. Nancy Hansen, the Health Center\u2019s CEO, testified that the Health Center does not have a physician, but does have a physician\u2019s assistant who is on call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Hansen further testified that an RN is on call whenever an LPN is on duty, and that Arnston was on call the night that Bailey drew Merry\u2019s blood. According to Hansen, an RN is on call in case a situation arises that an LPN is not qualified to handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b624 Hansen also testified that Arnston provides LPNs training in blood drawing. When an LPN demonstrates his or her proficiency at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>drawing blood, the LPN receives a \u201ccompetency\u201d in that area and is permitted to draw blood. Hansen testified that Bailey had received the competency to withdraw blood. Hansen further testified that LPNs are supervised by \u201ctelephone the same way our medical provider provides supervision to our physician\u2019s assistant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b625 Bailey testified that she was supervised and directed by superior staff on the night that she drew Merry\u2019s blood. Bailey testified that Amston and Wittkopp are her supervisors and that Arnston was the person she calls when she needs assistance. She stated, \u201cI am under the direction of an RN at all times. If I need them to come in and I can\u2019t handle a situation, I do, I call. [There\u2019s] always somebody on call for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b626  The District Court determined that Bailey was subject to the supervision and direction of the on-call RN and that the offsite level of supervision and direction satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. The supervision in this case falls within the statutory language and is consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA; thus, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it concluded that the offsite supervision and direction of the on-call RN satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, and that the District Court correctly denied Merry\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b627 II. Does the Health Center\u2019s policy unlawfully allow LPNs to conduct blood draws without the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse?</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u00b628 Merry maintains that the Health Center\u2019s policy added LPNs to the list of professionals who are authorized to draw blood without the supervision and direction of a physician or RN. Merry contends that such an amendment to \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, is unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">\u00b629 We conclude that Merry\u2019s argument is meritless. Montana law, not a health facility\u2019s policy, governs the admissibility of a blood sample. To be admissible, a blood sample must have been obtained by a physician, RN, or \u201cother qualified person\u201d acting under a physician\u2019s or RN\u2019s supervision and direction. Section 61-8-405(1), MCA. As discussed under Issue I, Bailey met the statutory requirements, and the District Court did not err in denying Merry\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"AXO\">\u00b630 III. Do violations of the Health Center\u2019s policy demonstrate that Bailey was not an \u201cother qualified person acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse\u201d as required by \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\u00b631 Merry contends that Bailey did not comply with the Health Center\u2019s policy when she drew Merry\u2019s blood sample because she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>not obtain a written statement, as required by the policy, from Deputy Speer asserting that Merry was under arrest for DUI or that Deputy Speer had probable cause to believe Merry was DUI and had been in an accident. Merry claims these failures establish that Bailey was not a \u201cqualified person acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse\u201d as required by \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. We decline to address this issue. As discussed in \u00b6 29, Montana law, not a health facility\u2019s policy, governs the admissibility of a blood sample. We determined under Issue I that Bailey drew Merry\u2019s blood in accordance with \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b632 IV. Did the District Court err when it used Merry\u2019s failure to controvert his implied consent to support its ruling?</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b633 The District Court determined that Bailey met the requirements of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, when she took Merry\u2019s blood sample. In the final sentence of the order, the District Court observed, \u201c[a]lso, [Merry] did not controvert that he consented to the blood draw\u201d at the Health Center. Merry contends that the District Court\u2019s order suggests that Merry waived the statutory protections of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, based on his implied consent. Merry argues that the court\u2019s requirement that he refute his consent as a condition to challenging the admissibility of his blood draw is inconsistent with Montana law and constitutional guarantees. We determined under Issue I that the District Court correctly concluded that Bailey met the statutory requirements of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, and that the District Court correctly denied Merry\u2019s motion to suppress. Thus, we need not address the District Court\u2019s alternative rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"Ace\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AyZ\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\u00b635 I agree with \u00b6\u00b6 13 and 15 of the Court\u2019s Opinion. However, given the statute\u2019s plain language and its sketchy legislative history (Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 17 and 18), I believe that the Court misreads \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. This statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">Only a physician or registered nurse, or <em>other qualified person acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse, </em>may, at the request of a peace officer, withdraw blood for the purpose of determining any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol, drugs, or any combination of alcohol and drugs in the person. This limitation does not apply to the sampling of breath. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">\u00b636 From what legislative history there is, I believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Legislature amended \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, in 1981 to accomplish two things. First, the Legislature acknowledged that there are any number of persons who are qualified by training and experience to <em>draw </em>blood. Second, the Legislature, nevertheless, believed that it was still necessary to vest in two particular types of professional healthcare providers-physicians and registered nurses-the power to decide <em>whether blood should be drawn and, if so, by </em>whom.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b637 As noted in \u00b6 18, the bill\u2019s proponents were desirous of removing challenges to blood tests \u201cnot performed\u201d by a physician or registered nurse. The DOJ believed that \u201cqualified persons, such as laboratory technicians\u201d should be \u201callowed to <em>take </em>blood samples\u201d (emphasis added). Likewise, Senator Mazurek was concerned about the limitations on those who could \u201cdraw\u201d blood. However, with its main goal to broaden the categories of persons who could <em>draw </em>or <em>take </em>blood, the Legislature still required that if the blood sample was not physically drawn by the physician or registered nurse, the otherwise \u201cqualified person\u201d drawing the sample had to act under the \u201csupervision and direction\u201d of a physician or registered nurse. Section 61-8-405(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b638 With that in mind, I believe that, at a minimum, the \u201cacting under the supervision and direction\u201d language of the statute contemplates: (1) that the physician or registered nurse actually determine that the blood draw is medically appropriate in terms of there being a lawful request, from an authorized person, to perform the test on a proper patient<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereafter, I refer to these, collectively, as the medical determinations); and (2) that, having made these medical determinations, the physician or registered nurse then orders the person who he or she deems qualified to actually draw the blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b639 The Court\u2019s interpretation of the statutory language marginalizes the role of the physician or registered nurse and the medical determinations that would necessarily be made before ordering a blood draw-for DUI purposes or otherwise. The plain language of the statute requires that the physician or registered nurse be the person in charge-i.e., be acting in a supervisory and directive capacity over the technician. Here, the record is clear that LPN Bailey-qualified to <em>draw </em>blood though she may be-was the person in charge. It was she who made the medical determinations referred to above. It was she who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>was acting as her own supervisor-utilizing her actual supervisors only in the event that \u201cshe needled] assistance\u201d or when there was a situation she could not \u201chandle.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b640 That is not what \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, requires. Under the framework of the statute, the technical person draws the blood. The physician or registered nurse determines if, how, and from whom the blood sample is to be taken. The Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute effectively emasculates the function of the physician and registered nurse. As here, those decision-making professionals are relegated to pinch-hitters if something goes wrong during the draw-people to call if back-up or advice is needed or if the situation devolves into something the technician can\u2019t handle. While I agree that the statute does not textually address the on-site/off-site issue, it strikes me that a healthcare provider is simply asking to be sued if a DUI blood draw goes south, and the technician-who made the medical determinations at the outset-is left to frantically try to locate a physician or registered nurse to bail her or him out.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b641 Curiously, the Court cites <em>State v. Zakovi, </em>2005 MT 91,326 Mont. 475, 110 P.3d 469, in support of its decision. Rather, <em>Zakovi </em>supports the undersigned\u2019s interpretation of the statutory language. In that case, the defendant moved to suppress the blood alcohol test on the grounds that the sample was collected in violation of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. Zakovi contended that the technician withdrew his blood sample at the request of the arresting officer and not pursuant to the supervision or direction of a physician or registered nurse. <em>Zakovi, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33-34. We observed in that case that the technician testified that she was \u201ccontinuously under the supervision of a registered nurse on duty in the emergency room, as her position is subordinate and requires compliance with the registered nurse\u2019s orders under hospital policy.\u201d <em>Zakovi, </em>\u00b6 36. Accordingly, we concluded that the blood sample was drawn in accordance with the statutory requirements. <em>Zakovi, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"A-TE\">\u00b642 Unlike <em>Zakovi, </em>the record here is clear that Bailey was not continuously under the supervision of a registered nurse on duty in the emergency room, nor did Bailey draw Merry\u2019s blood sample in compliance with a registered nurse\u2019s order. Indeed, Bailey was in charge of the whole blood-draw operation; she acted on no physician\u2019s or registered nurse\u2019s orders; she was neither supervised nor directed by anyone. Bailey\u2019s supervisors were simply \u201con-call\u201d if she needed help, needed advice, or couldn\u2019t handle the situation. <em>Zakovi </em>supports the diametrically opposite result than that reached by the Court here. \u00b643 Under the Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute, the technician is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the person actually in charge of the entire blood-draw operation. The technician involves the physician or registered nurse only in the event of an apparent emergency. That is not what the \u201cacting under the supervision and direction\u201d language plainly requires or what the Legislature obviously envisioned. From the structure and language of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, the Legislature contemplated that the medical determinations referred to above would be made at a certain professional level-by a physician or registered nurse-as opposed to the technical level at which they were made here, and at which they will be made in future cases based on our Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b644 I would hold that Merry\u2019s blood sample was collected in violation of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA; I would order that blood sample evidence suppressed; and I would reverse and remand for further proceedings \u00b645 Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-7\"> I presume that neither this Court nor the Legislature deems a person to be any less entitled to appropriate medical determinations, protocols and treatment when undergoing a blood draw simply because he or she is drunk.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
