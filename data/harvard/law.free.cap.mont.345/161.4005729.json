We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">\u00b62 Fenno presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court properly concluded that federal law preempted Fenno\u2019s state wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court properly determined that Fenno qualified as a bank officer for purposes of the National Banking Act\u2019s (the National Act) \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">\u00b65 Mountain West is a nationally chartered bank. Mountain West employed Fenno as an internal audit officer responsible for reviewing policies and procedures. Fenno also served as secretary of two Mountain West Bank branch\u2019s boards of directors. Fenno discovered what he believed to be a potential irregularity in a Mountain West loan transaction in June 2005. Fenno believed that the irregular loan transaction may have involved misconduct by a Mountain West executive.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">\u00b66 Fenno reported the irregularity to Mountain West management. Fenno also informed Mountain West management that he intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>report the irregularity to the bank\u2019s audit committee. Fenno reported the irregularity to the audit committee and the bank\u2019s executive committee. Fenno alleged that his reporting of the irregularity prompted Mountain West to begin stripping Fenno of his duties and responsibilities. Mountain West removed Fenno from the two boards of directors and reduced his salary. Mountain West suspended Fenno completely in August 2006. Mountain West finally terminated Fenno in September 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b67 Fenno sued Mountain West under the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA). Sections 39-2-901, et seq., MCA. Fenno alleged that Mountain West had discharged him in retaliation for Fenno\u2019s having reported a potential violation of public policy. Fenno sought both actual and punitive damages. Mountain West moved to dismiss, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, on the grounds that federal law preempted Fenno\u2019s claim under the WDEA. Mountain West argued that Fenno\u2019s claim fell under the National Act\u2019s \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth). This provision permits national banks to dismiss bank officers at their pleasure. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b68 The District Court considered both the \u201cat pleasure\u201d clause and 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j(a)(l). Section 1831j(a)(l) protects national bank employees from discrimination in retaliation for reporting possible bank misconduct to any federal banking agency or to the U.S. Attorney General. The District Court analyzed these two statutes in conjunction with the WDEA. The court determined that the more specific federal statutes conflicted with the WDEA\u2019s more general prohibition on termination in retaliation for an employee\u2019s reporting of a violation of public policy. This perceived conflict led the District Court to conclude that the federal statutes preempted the WDEA and granted summary judgment to Mountain West. Fenno appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b69 We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. <em>Prosser v. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., </em>2008 MT 87, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 209, \u00b6 10,179 P.3d 1178, \u00b6 10. We use the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 10. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>opposing summary judgment. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court properly concluded that federal law preempted Fenno\u2019s state wrongful discharge claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b611  This Court recognizes three ways in which federal law may preempt state law. <em>Vitullo v. International Broth, of Elec., </em>2003 MT 219, \u00b6 14, 317 Mont. 142, \u00b6 14, 75 P.3d 1250, \u00b6 14. Congress may include a preemption clause in the federal statute that provides expressly that state law will not apply in the area governed by the federal statute. <em>Vitullo, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Favel v. American Renovation and Const. Co., </em>2002 MT 266, \u00b6 40,312 Mont. 285, \u00b6 40,59 P.3d 412, \u00b6 40. Federal law may supersede state law when the state law actually conflicts with the federal law. This \u201cconflict preemption\u201d occurs either when one cannot comply with both state and federal law, or when \u201c\u2018the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019\u201d <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 40 (quoting <em>Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Labs, </em>471 U.S. 707, 713, 105 S. Ct. 2371, 2375 (1985)). Congress also may imply its intent to preempt state law in a particular area where the regulation of the area is so comprehensive that it is reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to \u201coccupy the field\u201d and to leave no room for supplementary state regulation. <em>Vitullo, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b612 This Court starts with the presumption that the historic powers of the states \u201cwere not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Vitullo, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 39 (both quoting <em>Sleath v. West Mont Home Health Services, </em>2000 MT 381, \u00b6 23, 304 Mont. 1, \u00b6 23,16 P.3d 1042, \u00b6 23). A party will overcome the presumption against preemption only by \u201cevidence of a clear and manifest intent of Congress to preempt state law.\u201d <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 39 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). National banks, such as Mountain West, remain generally subject to state laws, \u201cunless those laws infringe the national banking laws or impose an undue burden on the performance of the banks\u2019 functions.\u201d <em>Anderson Nat. Bank v. Luckett, </em>321 U.S. 233, 248, 34 S. Ct. 599, 607 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b613 The District Court analogized from decisions of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to reach its conclusion that the federal statutes preempted Fenno\u2019s WDEA claim. These federal cases previously had interpreted state law in relation to the National Act\u2019s \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision and whistleblower provision. We first analyze these federal decisions to determine their applicability to Fenno\u2019s WDEA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u00b614 The District Court relied particularly on <em>Kroske v. U.S. Bank Corp., </em>432 F.3d 976 (9th Cir. 2005, <em>cert, denied, </em>127 S. Ct. 157 (2006)). The Ninth Circuit considered whether the National Act\u2019s \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision preempted the plaintiffs state age discrimination claim. <em>Kroske, </em>432 F.3d at 980. The court determined that the National Act\u2019s \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision impliedly had been repealed to the extent necessary to effectuate the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). <em>Kroske, </em>432 F.3d at 987. The court applied the general conflict preemption rule to establish that the federal statutes did not conflict with the state age discrimination statute. <em>Kroske, </em>432 F.3d at 987-89. The court relied upon the fact that the state statute \u201cmirrors the substantive provisions of the ADEA and is interpreted consistently with the ADEA.\u201d <em>Kroske, </em>432 F.3d at 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b615 The District Court also relied upon the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Mackey v. Pioneer Nat. Bank, </em>867 F.2d 520 (9th Cir. 1989). There a state bank officer alleged wrongful discharge pursuant both to his employment contract and to state tort law. The bank fired the officer after he had been accused of sexual harassment. <em>Mackey, 867 </em>F.2d at 522. The court determined that the National Act\u2019s \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision preempted the contract claim as a matter of law. <em>Mackey, 867 </em>F.2d at 525. The court considered whether the National Act also preempted the officer\u2019s state law tort claim. <em>Mackey, 867 </em>F. 2d at 525-26. The court cited its general disapproval of substituting tort for contract claims. <em>Mackey, </em>861 F.2d at 526. The court further reasoned that \u201c[t]he purpose of the provision in the [National Act] was to give those institutions the greatest latitude possible to hire and fire their chief operating officers, in order to maintain the public trust.\u201d <em>Mackey, 867 </em>F.2d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b616 The District Court distinguished <em>Kroske </em>on the basis that the WDEA\u2019s retaliatory discharge provision did not mirror the substantive provisions of the federal whistleblower statute. The District Court further noted that the federal statute identifies specific employee actions for which a bank may not carry out a retaliatory discharge-reporting information regarding a possible violation of federal law or regulation, or bank mismanagement. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j(a)(l). The District Court pointed out that the WDEA, by contrast, prohibits termination generally if \u201cit was in retaliation for the employee\u2019s refusal to violate public policy or for reporting a violation of public policy.\u201d Section 39-2-904(l)(a), MCA. Thus, the District Court interpreted the federal statutes as affording Mountain West great latitude to fire its officers similar to the latitude afforded by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>in <em>Mackey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b617 The District Court concluded that federal law protects employees who report violations to a federal agency or the U.S. Attorney General specifically, where the WDEA does not identify to whom the employee must report violations in order to qualify for protection. Section 39-2-904(l)(a), MCA. The District Court did not provide, however, any further analysis of the existence of conflict preemption in the operation of the state and federal statutes at issue. The District Court did not demonstrate explicitly that \u201c \u2018the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Favel, </em>\u00b6 40 (quoting <em>Hillsborough County, </em>471 U.S. at 713, 105 S. Ct. at 2375).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b618 Fenno distinguishes <em>Kroske </em>and <em>Mackey </em>on the basis that the decisions discuss age discrimination and general wrongful discharge, respectively. Fenno contends <em>that Booth v. Old Nat. Bank, </em>900 F.Supp. 836 (N.D. W. Va. 1995), and <em>Sargent v. Central Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>809 P.2d 1298, (Okla. 1991), represent more closely analogous and better reasoned federal decisions that consider more directly whether the National Act preempts state wrongful discharge laws. <em>Booth </em>and <em>Sargent </em>analyzed whether the National Act preempts state law in the context of a bank officer\u2019s allegation that he had been discharged in retaliation for his refusal to violate a federal law or regulation. <em>Booth, </em>900 F.Supp. at 840; <em>Sargent, </em>809 P.2d at 1300-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"><em>\u00b619 Sargent </em>explained the \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision\u2019s policy goals as being rooted in the ability to \u201chire and fire at will... for the sake of the institution\u2019s financial integrity.\u201d <em>Sargent, </em>809 P.2d at 1302 (citing <em>Armano v. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, </em>468 F.Supp. 674, 676 (D.Mass. 1979)) (emphasis omitted). <em>Sargent </em>reasoned that this right is \u201cnot without a limit,\u201d however, when \u201cthe public policy whose violation gives rise to [the retaliatory discharge] claim parallels that of the federal law which is sought to be invoked as a shield from liability....\u201d <em>Sargent, </em>809 P.2d at 1302 (emphasis omitted). The court determined that \u201cpre-emption does not shield the defendant-bank from tort liability for dismissing an employee in violation of a state public policy which is consistent with the federal statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>Sargent, </em>809 P.2d at 1300 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b620 The <em>Booth </em>court agreed. <em>Booth, </em>900 F.Supp. at 843 (adopting <em>Sargent\u2019s language </em>regarding state public polices that are \u201cconsistent with the federal statute\u2019s purpose\u201d <em>(Sargent, </em>809 P.2d at 1300)). The court in <em>Booth </em>noted that the National Act\u2019s \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision has been construed generally to preempt state law governing employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>relations, particularly with regard to contract claims. <em>Booth, </em>900 F.Supp. at 841. The court cautioned, however, that \u201cthis preemption does not amount to complete preemption\u201d as the U.S. Supreme Court has applied complete preemption only in specific, limited areas. <em>Booth, </em>900 F.Supp. at 841 (citing <em>Watson v. First Union Nat. Bank of South Carolina, </em>837 F.Supp. 146 (D. S.C. 1993)). The court distinguished <em>Mackey </em>on the grounds that cases finding preemption in the tort context had not addressed generally the issue of retaliatory discharge. <em>Booth, </em>900 F.Supp. at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b621 The court then analyzed whether the National Act preempted state retaliatory discharge protection in the context of the competing policy interests at stake between the federal and state laws. <em>Booth, </em>900 F.Supp. at 841. <em>Booth </em>looked to whether a conflict existed between the policy underlying the National Act and the policy underlying the state retaliatory discharge law. <em>Booth, </em>900 F.Supp. at 842-43. The court found no policy conflict, and, thus, concluded that 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth), does not preempt a state retaliatory discharge claim. <em>Booth, </em>900 F.Supp. at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b622 The South Dakota Supreme Court recently adopted <em>Sargent\u2019s </em>and <em>Booth\u2019s </em>conflict preemption analysis. <em>Tiede v. CorTrust Bank, N.A., </em>748 N.W.2d 748 (S.D. 2008). The court considered whether an employee could bring a state retaliatory discharge suit against a national bank covered by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth). <em>Tiede, </em>748 N.W.2d at 750. The bank had fired the employee after she had filed several federally required reports over the bank\u2019s objections. The statutes that require banks to file these reports provide criminal penalties for failure to accomplish the filing. <em>Tiede, </em>748 N.W.2d at 750. South Dakota common law, like Montana\u2019s WDEA, allows employees to bring a wrongful termination claim for retaliatory discharge where the employee\u2019s discharge violated a public policy. <em>Tiede, </em>748 N.W.2d at 751. South Dakota specifically recognizes a violation of public policy when the employer has committed a criminal or unlawful act. <em>Tiede, </em>748 N.W.2d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b623 The court applied the policy-based preemption test from <em>Sargent </em>and <em>Booth </em>in conjunction with its own state conflict preemption test. This test mirrors Montana\u2019s-whether the law \u201c \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tiede, </em>748 N.W.2d at 752 (quoting <em>Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, </em>517 U.S. 25, 32, 116 S. Ct. 1103, 1108 (1996)); <em>see also Favel, </em>\u00b6 40. The court determined that Congress had intended the federal statutes that required the employee to file the reports at issue to aid federal criminal investigations. <em>Tiede, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>748 N.W.2d at 753 (citing The Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5313(a) and 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5322(a)). The court noted that the state retaliatory discharge law likewise prevented employers from violating public policy, particularly with regard to criminal or unlawful acts. <em>Tiede, </em>748 N.W.2d at 751, 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b624 The court balanced the body of federal law against state law and concluded that the \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision of 12 U.S.C \u00a7 24 (Fifth) did not preempt the state retaliatory discharge claim. The court agreed that the federal banking laws\u2019 purpose of addressing potential criminal interference in banking conformed with the state retaliatory discharge law\u2019s purpose of preventing employers from violating public policy. <em>Tiede, </em>748 N.W.2d at 754-55. As a result, the state law did not \u201cstand[] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Tiede, </em>748 N.W.2d at 753, 754-55; <em>Barnett Bank, </em>517 U.S. at 32, 116 S. Ct. at 1108; <em>see also Favel, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b625 We agree with South Dakota\u2019s preemption analysis. South Dakota applied conflict preemption instead of field preemption. The U.S. Supreme Court has applied complete preemption only in specific areas. <em>Booth, </em>900 F.Supp. at 841 (citing <em>Watson, 837 </em>F.Supp. 146). The National Act has not preempted completely state law governing employment relations. Montana\u2019s preemption analysis dictates that conflict preemption occurs either when one cannot comply with both state and federal law, or when the \u201c \u2018state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 40 (quoting <em>Hillsborough County, </em>471 U.S. at 713, 105 S. Ct. at 2375).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b626  Preemption cannot \u201cshield [a] defendant bank from tort liability for dismissing an employee in violation of a state public policy which is consistent with the federal statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>Tiede, </em>748 N.W.2d at 754; <em>Booth, </em>900 F.Supp. at 842; <em>Sargent, </em>809 P.2d at 1302. A bank cannot avail itself of the National Act\u2019s \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision unless one cannot comply with both state and federal law, or if the state law \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 40 (quoting <em>Hillsborough County, </em>471 U.S. at 713, 105 S. Ct. at 2375).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b627 We too analyze first the policies underlying the federal statutes at issue. The federal courts have determined that Congress intended the \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision to \u201censure the financial stability of the banking institutions by affording them the means to discharge employees who were felt to compromise an institution\u2019s integrity.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Kroske, </em>432 F.3d at 984 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Westervelt v. Mohrenstecher, </em>76 F. 118, 122 (8th Cir. 1896). The National Act\u2019s \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision has been repealed impliedly, however, to the extent necessary to effectuate 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j(a)(l). <em>See Kroske, </em>432 F.3d at 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b628 The federal whistleblower protection provision, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j(a)(l), shields national bank employees from discrimination in retaliation for reporting possible bank misconduct to any federal banking agency or to the U.S. Attorney General. Congress enacted this provision as an amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1811 et seq., in 1989. Pub. L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183, 494 (1989). Congress sought to \u201cenhance the regulatory and enforcement powers of Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies ....\u201d Pub. L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183, 183 (1989). The WDEA\u2019s retaliatory discharge provision, \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(a), MCA, similarly exists to protect the State\u2019s interest in enforcing State policies \u201cconcerning the public health, safety, or welfare established by constitutional provision, statute, or administrative rule.\u201d Section 39-2-903(7), MCA. The federal statutes and the WDEA protect employees who take steps in their employment to promote the enforcement of laws and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b629  The WDEA\u2019s retaliatory discharge provision comports with the federal whistleblower statute\u2019s purpose. <em>Tiede, </em>748 N.W.2d at 754-55; <em>Booth, </em>900 F.Supp. at 843; <em>Sargent, </em>809 P.2d at 1302. The WDEA does not \u201cstand[] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Barnett Bank, </em>517 U.S. at 32, 116 S. Ct. at 1108; <em>see also Favel, </em>\u00b6 40. No conflict exists between the policies underlying the Montana law and the federal statutes. The District Court\u2019s determination that the federal statutes and Montana\u2019s WDEA conflicted in light of the fact that the federal statute included more specific criteria is not determinative in the context of conflict preemption. The District Court improperly concluded that 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth) and 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j(l)(a), preempted Fenno\u2019s retaliatory discharge claim pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(a), MCA, of the WDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b630 <em>Whether the District Court properly determined that Fenno qualified as a hank officer for purposes of the National Act\u2019s \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b631 The National Act\u2019s \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision permits national banks to dismiss bank <em>officers </em>at their pleasure. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth). Fenno argues on appeal that Mountain West had stripped him of his officer status before it had terminated him. We need not reach Fenno\u2019s claim regarding his officer status in light of the fact that we have determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>above that the District Court improperly applied 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth) in this case. \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b632 We reverse and remand.</p>\n<judges id=\"b192-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b192-6\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"A2d\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b633 I dissent. I would affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that federal law preempts Fenno\u2019s claim under the Montana WDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u00b634 The Court correctly states the law on preemption. As the decision accurately notes, state law is preempted when either of the following is true: (1) one cannot comply with both the state and federal law or (2) \u201cstate law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d \u00b6 11 (quoting <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b635 The Court incorrectly applies the law at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29 when it concludes that there is not an irreconcilable conflict between the state and federal laws because they both serve the same purposes. In this case, the WDEA is preempted by federal law under both criteria stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">\u00b636 The Court erroneously concludes that the purposes underlying the state and federal laws are the same and that the WDEA does not impede the accomplishment of Congress\u2019 objectives. The purpose of the \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth) is to give banks \u201cthe greatest latitude possible to hire and fire their chief operating officers, in order to maintain the public trust.\u201d <em>Mackey, </em>867 F.2d at 526. <em>See also Sargent, </em>809 P.2d at 1302; <em>Kroske, </em>432 F.3d at 984. Section 1831j is the one and only exception under federal law to the \u201cat pleasure\u201d provision. When enacting the bill that includes 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j, Congress stated that its purpose was, among other things, \u201c[t]o strengthen the enforcement powers of Federal regulators of depository institutions\u201d and \u201c[t]o strengthen the civil sanctions and criminal penalties for defrauding or otherwise damaging depository institutions and their depositors.\u201d Pub. L. No. 101-73,103 Stat. 187 (1989). Both of these federal statutes are intended by Congress to protect the integrity of banking institutions and to provide enforcement mechanisms when necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">\u00b637 The purpose of the WDEA is focused not on protecting the integrity of the banking system, but on protecting employees, as the Court states at \u00b6 28. The purpose of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth) and 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j, as stated above, is not to protect employees, but banks.</p>\n<p id=\"AUh\">\u00b638 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 183 lj does offer some whistleblower protection to bank employees, but it is not a blanket protection. The protection exists only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>if the employee reports the potential violation to the appropriate agency, because the congressional objective of greater enforcement is achieved only when a violation is reported outside the banking institution involved, rather than reporting internally, as Fenno did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b639 Today\u2019s decision, by limiting the power of banks under \u00a7 24 (Fifth) to fire employees at will unless the requirements of \u00a7 1831j are met, undermines the congressional purpose of the statute and \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Barnett Bank, </em>517 U.S. at 32, 116 S. Ct. at 1108; <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b640 Further, in this instance, federal law preempts the WDEA because there is an irreconcilable conflict between it and 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth). <em>See Favel, </em>\u00b6 40. Nowhere does Fenno assert that he reported the alleged violation to either a federal banking agency or the Attorney General, as required to secure protection from an at will termination under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j(a)(l). Therefore, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth) gave Mountain West the right to dismiss Fenno at its pleasure, and the Bank was fully in compliance with the federal statutes when it fired him. The Court\u2019s decision today puts Mountain West in the position of being in compliance with federal law while at the same time potentially violating Montana\u2019s WDEA. Thus, Mountain West may be found liable in a Montana court for exercising its statutory right under federal law to terminate Fenno\u2019s employment. In this situation, federal law preempts the WDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b641 Today\u2019s decision undermines federal law governing banks and interferes with the congressional purposes underlying 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Fifth) and 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j. I would conclude that in this case the WDEA is preempted by federal law. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
