The WCC granted his petition. The insurer, Liberty Northwest Insurance (Liberty), appeals the decision of the WCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">\u00b62 We restate and address the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\u00b63 Issue 1: Does \u00a7 39-71-741(l)(c), MCA (2003), limit the Department of Labor and Industry (DLI) to $20,000 lump sum conversions of permanent total disability benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">\u00b64 Issue 2: Did the WCC err in determining that Barnard was entitled to a lump sum payment because the money would be used for his necessities of life?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">\u00b65 Barnard was injured at work on June 22,2004. His employer was insured by Liberty, which accepted workers\u2019 compensation liability under its policy. On May 9, 2005, Liberty agreed to convert Barnard\u2019s benefits to permanent total disability benefits. On December 30,2005, Barnard petitioned the WCC to convert the entire amount of his future benefits to a lump sum settlement. Liberty opposed his petition, arguing that the law prohibits a lump sum payment greater than $20,000 and that he had not shown that he needed the money for necessities of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">\u00b66 On March 31, 2006, the WCC held a trial on Barnard\u2019s petition. He and his wife testified. The WCC entered findings of fact based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the evidence produced at the trial. It found that Barnard receives slightly less that $900/month in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. As of March 2006, the present net value of Barnard\u2019s benefits was $80,893.43. He also receives just over $1200/month in Social Security benefits. His wife earns approximately $12,000 to $15,000 annually as a housekeeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b67 Barnard and his wife own 120 acres of land west of Great Falls. They own the property outright and have no debts. Barnard testified that he is strongly opposed to borrowing money, particularly since he lives on a fixed income. He does not want to sell the property and move into town because he pays less tax on his current property and because he uses the property to generate income by raising cattle, as discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b68 Barnard and his wife reside in a 1966 mobile home and have been unable to insure the home because of its age. The mobile home is on blocks, not a foundation, and there are three steps that Barnard must climb to get into the home. It also has narrow hallways and a small bathroom. Barnard has difficulty entering and moving about the home because it does not accommodate his wheelchair. The property also includes a building Barnard uses as a shop and an office. He walks from his residence to the shop, where he is able to use a wheelchair. Barnard testified that he wants to use part of the lump sum payment to purchase a new home that is easier for him to get into and use. He anticipates that he would need to purchase a custom-built mobile home.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b69 Barnard raises cattle on his property. Each year he buys and sells cattle, keeping any profits to buy more cattle the following year. Some years Barnard has lost money on the cattle business, particularly during periods of drought. In other years he has made a profit. He wishes to use part of the lump sum payment to buy additional cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai\">\u00b610 The Barnards own several vehicles. One truck no longer runs, and another is a 1987 pick-up with 200,000 miles on it. They have a diesel truck they use for towing stock trailers and an unlicensed pick-up used as a farm vehicle. Their newest vehicle is a 2001 Subaru which Mrs. Barnard uses to go to work. Barnard has difficulty getting in and out of these vehicles. He plans to use part of the lump sum payment to buy a newer, reliable car that he can more easily and comfortably use.</p>\n<p id=\"AzZ\">\u00b611 The driveway to the Barnards\u2019 property is a half-mile long, and it has a steep grade and a gumbo shale surface. It is difficult to navigate in bad weather and requires the use of chains in the winter. Barnard intends to use part of the lump sum payment to gravel the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u00b612 After considering the evidence presented, the WCC found that Barnard and his wife were credible, that he had established that the lump sum payment of the whole of his permanent total disability benefits was for necessities of life, and that he was entitled to receive the requested lump sum payment of the entire amount of his benefits. Liberty filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b613 We review the WCC\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial credible evidence, and we review its conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Hiett v. Missoula Co. Pub. Schs., </em>2003 MT 213, \u00b6 15, 317 Mont. 95, \u00b6 15, 75 P.3d 341, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b614 <em>Issue 1: Does \u00a7 39-71-741(l)(c), MCA (2003), limit the DLI to $20,000 lump sum conversions of permanent total disability benefits?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AW6\">\u00b615 The applicable workers\u2019 compensation statutes are those in effect at the time of an injury. <em>Buckman v. Mont. Deaconess </em>Hosp., 224 Mont. 318,321,730 P.2d 380,382 (1986). Barnard was injured in 2004, so the 2003 statutes in effect at that time apply to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\u00b616 Section 39-71-741, MCA (2003),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permits the conversion of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to a lump sum in certain circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">(1) By written agreement filed with the department, benefits under this chapter may be converted in whole or in part into a lump sum.... The department may approve an agreement to convert the following benefits to a lump sum only under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">(c) permanent total disability benefits if the total of all lump-sum conversions in part that are awarded to a claimant do not exceed $20,000. The approval or award of a lump-sum permanent total disability payment in whole or in part by the department or court must be the exception....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The WCC concluded that this section permits lump sum payments greater than $20,000 if it is a lump sum conversion of the whole of a permanent total disability benefit. The WCC concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>$20,000 limitation in \u00a7 39-71-741(l)(c), MCA, refers only to lump sum conversions of a part of an injured worker\u2019s permanent total disability benefits. DLI has employed a like interpretation of this statute for years. Liberty challenges the WCC and DLI interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\">\u00b617 When the Court interprets a statute, \u201cour goal is to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Fliehler v. Uninsured Employers Fund, </em>2002 MT 125, \u00b6 13, 310 Mont. 99, \u00b6 13, 48 P.3d 746, \u00b6 13. We first attempt to construe a statute according to its plain meaning. If the language of the statute is unambiguous, no further interpretation is necessary. <em>Rausch v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2002 MT 203, \u00b6 33, 311 Mont. 210, \u00b6 33, 54 P.3d 25, \u00b6 33. We read all parts of a statute as a whole and strive to give effect to all of its provisions. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Fliehler, </em>\u00b6 13. Our task is \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. When there is a longstanding agency interpretation of a statute, we will give that interpretation \u201crespectful consideration.\u201d <em>Glendive Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Mont. Dept, of Pub. Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>2002 MT 131, \u00b6 14, 310 Mont. 156, \u00b6 14,49 P.3d 560, \u00b6 14 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b618 We have not previously addressed the meaning \u00a7 39-71-741(1), MCA, to determine if it strictly limits lump sum conversions of permanent total disability benefits to $20,000. As both parties note, we have addressed the issue in passing. <em>See Martin v. The Hartford, </em>2004 MT 57, 320 Mont. 206, 86 P.3d 569. However, this precise issue was not before us in <em>Martin, </em>and our statements in that case regarding the interpretation of \u00a7 39-71-741(1), MCA, were not part of our holding. As we expressly stated in <em>Martin, </em>we did not \u201crule on the correctness of the Department\u2019s ... interpretation\u201d that a lump sum conversion in whole can exceed $20,000. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 6, n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b619 We conclude that the WCC and DLI have correctly interpreted \u00a7 39-71-741(1), MCA. When the statute is read in its entirety, it limits lump sum conversions to $20,000 only if the requested conversion to a lump sum constitutes a part of the permanent total disability benefit. Section 39-71-741(l)(c), MCA, does not limit to $20,000 a lump sum payment of the whole of a permanent total disability benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b620  The language of \u00a7 39-71-741(1), MCA, specifies that there may be lump sum payments \u201cin whole or in part.\u201d The portion of the statute referring to the $20,000 limitation on lump sum payments refers only to \u201cthe total of all lump-sum conversions in part.\u201d The Legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>thus distinguished between a lump sum payment of the whole amount of benefit payments and a lump sum payment of a part of a benefit. We must give effect to this distinction. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Fliehler, </em>\u00b6 13. The plain language of the statute, coupled with a respectful consideration of the longstanding interpretation by DLI, means that \u00a7 39-71-741(l)(c), MCA, limits only the total of partial lump sum payments to $20,000. The WCC correctly concluded that it had authority to order a lump sum payment of the entire amount of Barnard\u2019s permanent total disability payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b621 <em>Issue 2:Did the WCC err in determining that Barnard was entitled to a lump sum payment because it would be used for necessities of life\"?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOH\">\u00b622 In order to receive a lump sum conversion of permanent total disability benefits, the employee must demonstrate that he has a financial need that relates to one of several things, one of which is the \u201cnecessities of life.\u201d Section 39-71-741(l)(c)(i)(A), MCA. To determine whether a lump sum should be awarded, the primary factor courts must consider is the claimant\u2019s best interest. <em>Sullivan v. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, 271 </em>Mont. 12,17, 894 P.2d 278, 281 (1995). Other factors to be considered include the interests of the claimant\u2019s family and the general public, pressing need, and outstanding debt. <em>Sullivan, 271 </em>Mont, at 16, 894 P.2d at 280. We accord the WCC wide latitude to determine when a lump sum conversion is appropriate, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the WCC. <em>Sullivan, 271 </em>Mont, at 18, 894 P.2d at 282. The claimant has the burden to show that a lump sum conversion is in his best interest. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b623  The WCC found, based on evidence and testimony properly introduced, that it is very difficult for Barnard to get in and out of his house and that it is impossible for him to use his wheelchair in the house. The WCC then found that the inability to comfortably and safely move around his house is a justification for granting his petition for the lump sum payment so that he could purchase a new home. Likewise, the WCC found that the lump sum conversion was justified so that Barnard could purchase a new vehicle and gravel his driveway. The WCC did not err in finding that it was in Barnard\u2019s best interest to grant the lump sum so he could use it to expand his cattle business. Contrary to Liberty\u2019s assertion that Barnard\u2019s ranching activities are a speculative venture that usually loses money, the record contains substantial evidence, which was deemed credible by the WCC, that Barnard carefully manages his money and the cattle often produce a profit. The WCC properly exercised its wide discretion when it found that Barnard would use a lump sum payment for the necessities of life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>and concluded that it was in his best interest to convert his benefits to a lump sum. We will not interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b624  We conclude that \u00a7 39-71-741, MCA (2003), permits lump sum payments of the whole of permanent total disability benefits, even though such conversions may result in a payment that exceeds $20,000. The WCC did not err in finding that Barnard had met the requirements of \u00a7 39-71-741, MCA, and that the lump sum payment he requested would be used for the necessities of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b109-6\">JUSTICES COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-12\"> Any references hereafter to the worker\u2019s compensation statutes refer to the 2003 version unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b109-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AK4\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u00b626 I join in the result the Court reaches in this' case. I write separately to address what appears to me to be a disconnect between \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-741(l)(c) and (4), MCA (2003), the facts of this case and our existing jurisprudence on the issue of lump-sum conversions. I do so in hopes that, in a future case where these matters are raised and argued, the Court might more clearly resolve the disconnect, and the Legislature might revisit the statutes and provide more clarity about its intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">\u00b627 As I read \u00a7 39-71-741(l)(c), MCA, it applies only to a written agreement between a claimant receiving permanent total disability benefits and the carrier regarding a lump-sum conversion. Such an agreement is filed with the DLI and may be approved under the circumstances set forth in detail in \u00a7 39-71-741(l)(c), MCA, which include \u201cthe necessities of life[.]\u201d As I read it, this portion of the statute sets limits on the DLLs ability to approve such a conversion. Section 39-71-741(4), MCA, however, provides that \u201c[a] dispute between a claimant and an insurer regarding the conversion of biweekly payments into a lump sum\u201d is a matter entrusted to the jurisdiction of a mediator and the WCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">\u00b628 In the present case, no written agreement between Barnard and Liberty was filed with the DLL Instead, Barnard filed his \u201cdispute\u201d with Liberty over the conversion in the WCC. Our jurisprudence, including <em>Sullivan, </em>then authorized the WCC to apply the \u201cbest interest\u201d test, rather than the statutory \u201cnecessities of life\u201d test which constrains the DLI in approving conversion agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">\u00b629 I recognize the instant case was not presented to either the WCC or this Court under the approach I suggest. I also recognize that this approach has not been utilized in our earlier jurisprudence. I submit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>however, that it is the only harmonious construction of two very different subsections of \u00a7 39-71-741, MCA. Moreover, it seems to me an appropriate rationale under which the WCC and this Court properly can substitute the \u201cbest interest\u201d test for the somewhat more restrictive \u201cnecessities of life\u201d test imposed on the DLI in \u00a7 39-71-741(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b630 For these reasons, I join the Court\u2019s result. I, too, would affirm the WCC.</p>\n<judges id=\"b110-5\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the foregoing specially concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
