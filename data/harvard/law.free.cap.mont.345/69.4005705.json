We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">1. Did the District Court err in denying postconviction relief on the issue of whether the parties had a plea agreement and what were its terms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">2.

The State then filed an Amended Information charging Maldonado with deliberate homicide after Madden died. Maldonado retained Robert L. Stephens Jr. to represent him in the matter, although L. Sanford Selvey, II later joined Stephens in representing Maldonado. Stephens also represented Maldonado in a federal criminal case in which Maldonado had been charged with several drug related offenses. Maldonado entered into a plea agreement with the federal government and was sentenced to 210 months of imprisonment, which was later reduced to 100 months for assisting and cooperating with the federal government in the narcotics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b64 Following Maldonado\u2019s arrest on the State criminal charges, the parties began discussions on a possible plea agreement. The day before the scheduled trial date of January 7, 1997, Maldonado filed an \u201cAcknowledgment of Waiver of Rights This is an Alford Plea\u201d (\u201cAcknowledgment\u201d). In summary, the Acknowledgment detailed Maldonado\u2019s rights under an <em>Alford </em>plea, the maximum sentence he could receive, that his counsel explained the case to him fully and completely, the State\u2019s recommendations for a sentence, and the sentence Maldonado would ask the court to impose. The Acknowledgment also addressed the State\u2019s purported agreement to not involve itself in parole matters. While Maldonado and both of his counsel signed the Acknowledgment, no representative of the State did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b65 At the change of plea hearing that same day, Maldonado withdrew his guilty plea and then entered an <em>Alford </em>Plea to the deliberate homicide charge. After some discussion of the language of the Acknowledgment and Maldonado\u2019s understanding of the charges against him, the District Court accepted Maldonado\u2019s plea. Approximately three weeks later, the State filed its \u201cOffer of Proof, Statement of Authority and Plea Agreement\u201d (\u201cOffer of Proof\u2019). In it, the State claimed that the plea agreement was limited to four main points: the State\u2019s recommended sentence for the deliberate homicide charge, the State\u2019s recommended sentence for the use of a weapon enhancement, that Maldonado would likely recommend a lesser sentence, and that Maldonado could withdraw his plea if he received a sentence greater than that recommended by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b66 The District Court sentenced Maldonado to a term of forty years at the Montana State Prison with the sentence set to run concurrently with Maldonado\u2019s federal sentence. This was despite the State\u2019s recommendation that Maldonado\u2019s state sentence run consecutively to the federal sentence. The court also sentenced Maldonado to ten years for the use of a weapon in the commission of the offense, with that sentence set to run consecutively to the sentence for deliberate homicide and concurrently to the federal sentence. Shortly thereafter, Maldonado was returned to federal custody to serve out his federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b67 While still in federal custody in Greenville, Illinois, Maldonado petitioned the Montana Board of Pardons and Parole for a parole hearing. Maldonado was subsequently released from federal custody on May 28,2002, after completing his federal sentence and transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to the Montana State Prison to serve his remaining time on the state sentence. The parole board held a hearing on Maldonado\u2019s petition on July 29,2002. Prior to the hearing, former Deputy Yellowstone County Attorney Dale Mrkich sent a letter to the parole board in opposition to Maldonado\u2019s possible parole. Three additional letters opposing Maldonado\u2019s release were provided to the parole board: one from the Billings Police Department, another from an individual with the Billings Police Department, and one from the Chief Deputy Yellowstone County Attorney, who also testified before a parole board member (who later recused herself from the proceedings). The minutes of the hearing reflect that the Yellowstone County Attorney testified that pursuant to the plea agreement, the County Attorney\u2019s office agreed that it would have no involvement in Maldonado\u2019s parole matters and the office withdrew the letter of opposition. The board ultimately denied Maldonado\u2019s parole request and set its next review for July 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b68 On January 25, 2002, Maldonado filed a petition for postconviction relief with the District Court. Maldonado alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, that his <em>Alford </em>plea was not knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily given, and that he was twice put in jeopardy. After Maldonado received court appointed counsel, he filed a Motion for Leave to File Amended Petition for Postconviction Relief on February 17, 2004, which the District Court subsequently granted. The amended petition added a claim that the State breached the plea agreement entered into with Maldonado and thereby violated his federal and State constitutional rights when it opposed his parole/pre-release application in 2002. The District Court held a three day evidentiary hearing on Maldonado\u2019s amended petition, beginning on June 6,2006, and heard testimony from several witnesses including both of Maldonado\u2019s trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b69 The District Court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order on May 24,2007. The court concluded that Maldonado failed to establish that his counsels\u2019 performance was deficient. The District Court also concluded that it was not appropriate to address Maldonado\u2019s double jeopardy claim in a postconviction relief petition as the claim could have been directly appealed. In regard to the plea agreement, the court concluded that the agreement was limited to capping the incarceration term Maldonado faced on the State charges, allowing Maldonado to argue for a lesser sentence, and allowing Maldonado to withdraw his plea if he received a sentence exceeding the cap. The court also concluded that there was no evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>parole board relied on State participation in its parole decision or that Maldonado was prejudiced by State participation. Furthermore, the court found any State participation to be harmless given the additional overwhelming evidence justifying denial of parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a postconviction relief petition to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, \u00b6 9, 183 P.3d 861, \u00b6 9. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims, however, constitute mixed questions of law and fact for which our review is de novo. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 9. Additionally, we review a district court\u2019s decisions on claims that the State breached a plea agreement for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bartosh, </em>2007 MT 59, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. 212, \u00b6 18, 154 P.3d 58, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b611 <em>Issue One. Did the District Court err in denying postconviction relief on the issue of whether the parties had a plea agreement and what were its terms?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\u00b612 Maldonado contends that the District Court erred when it concluded that the basis of the bargain between the parties was capping Maldonado\u2019s length of imprisonment, allowing Maldonado to argue for less time, and allowing Maldonado to withdraw his plea if he received a sentence exceeding the cap. In contrast, Maldonado argues that there was no plea agreement between the parties as the plea agreement did not contain all the material terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\u00b613 As a threshold matter, we note that Maldonado has failed to produce the transcript of the postconviction relief evidentiary hearing, despite relying heavily on testimony presented at the hearing in his briefing to the Court. A primarily element of our review of a denial of a postconviction relief petition is determining whether the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>See Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 9. \u201cWe have repeatedly stated that if an appellant seeks to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a verdict, the appellant must provide this Court with a trial transcript, sufficient portions of a trial transcript, or a record sufficient to enable this Court to rule upon the issues raised.\u201d <em>Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, \u00b6 35, 338 Mont. 19, \u00b6 35, 162 P.3d 134, \u00b6 35. Despite the limited record, we will attempt to address Maldonado\u2019s arguments regarding the plea agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>beginning with the question of whether the parties ever reached a plea agreement, and if so, what were its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b6 14 A plea agreement is a contract between the State and a defendant. <em>State v. Bartosh, </em>2007 MT 59, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont. 212, \u00b6 19, 154 P.3d 58, \u00b6 19. As such, plea agreements are subject to contract law standards. <em>State v. Rardon, </em>2005 MT 129, \u00b6 18,327 Mont. 228, \u00b6 18,115 P.3d 182, \u00b6 18. Whether or not a contract exists is a combined issue of law and fact. <em>Johnston v. Palmer, </em>2007 MT 99, \u00b6 38, 337 Mont. 101, \u00b6 38, 158 P.3d 998, \u00b6 38. In order for an offer to mature into a binding contract, both parties must consent to the terms of the contract. <em>City of Bozeman v. Taylen, </em>2007 MT 256, \u00b6 19, 339 Mont. 274, \u00b6 19,170 P.3d 939, \u00b6 19. Based on the language of the Acknowledgment and the subsequent conduct of the State at the change of plea hearing and Maldonado\u2019s parole hearing, we conclude that the parties did have a plea agreement and we agree with the State and the District Court that it was limited to the four terms enumerated by the State plus the State\u2019s agreement not to involve itself in parole matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b615 The majority of the Acknowledgment addresses Maldonado\u2019s understanding of the charges against him and that he had discussed <em>the Alford </em>plea with his attorneys and was making the plea of his own accord. Paragraph 13 addressed the State\u2019s recommended sentence. Paragraph 14 described the State\u2019s agreement not to involve itself in parole matters. Paragraph 15 detailed that Maldonado reserved the right to ask the District Court to impose a lesser sentence of twenty years with ten years suspended for deliberate homicide and a consecutive sentence of two years for the use of a weapon, with both sentences to run concurrently with his federal sentence. Paragraph 15(c) pointed out that Maldonado would specifically request that these sentences be made concurrent to his federal sentence. Paragraph 17 acknowledged the State\u2019s agreement that Maldonado could \u201cwithdraw his plea as a matter of law in the event the Court does not abide by the terms of this plea agreement.\u201d Paragraph 18 also stated that the County Attorney\u2019s office agreed to be bound by the terms and spirit of the agreement, although no representative from the County Attorney\u2019s office signed it. The only signers to the Acknowledgment were Maldonado and his co-counsel, Stephens and Selvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b616 The testimony presented at the change of plea hearing held the same day as the signing of the Acknowledgment supports the argument that the plea agreement did not contain all the terms set forth in the Acknowledgment. In reference to the agreed terms of the plea agreement, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>We agree-we, the State, agree that we will recommend 40 years on the underlying offense, which is Deliberate Homicide. We will recommend an enhancement for the use of a weapon of 10 years, and we will not exceed that recommendation to this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-4\">We understand in contradistinction to the plea agreement procedure statute that the defendant reserves his right to argue for or intends to argue for a lesser sentence, and there is a question about whether it runs concurrently or consecutively with another case and another sentence imposed in federal court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b617 That the State only agreed to a few of the points in the Acknowledgment is reinforced by its submission of the Offer of Proof later that month. The State acknowledged that the parties entered into a plea agreement grounded in \u00a7 46-12-211, MCA, and listed four paragraphs which it claimed recited the entire agreement between the parties and contained a complete statement of the State\u2019s obligations under the Agreement. In summary, the State offered that the four points of agreement were: (1) the parties agreed that the State would recommend a forty year sentence at the Montana State Prison for the felony crime of deliberate homicide, under \u00a7 45-5-102(1), MCA; (2) the parties agreed that the State would recommend an additional sentence of ten years at the Montana State Prison for the commission of an offense with a dangerous weapon, under \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, with the sentence to run consecutively to the deliberate homicide sentence; (3) the parties agreed that Maldonado would probably recommend a sentence less than that recommended by the State; and (4) the parties agreed, pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-211(4), MCA, that if the court imposed a sentence greater than forty years for the deliberate homicide charge and an enhancement of ten years for the use of a weapon, then the court would afford Maldonado an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. In addition, by its own admission at Maldonado\u2019s July 29, 2002 parole hearing, the State agreed that it would have no involvement in any parole matters concerning Maldonado.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b618  We hold that a plea agreement existed between the State and Maldonado and that the District Court did not err in concluding that the scope of the plea agreement was limited to the five terms set forth in \u00b6 17, as the parties mutually consented only to these terms. The District Court did not err in denying Maldonado\u2019s petition for postconviction relief on the ground the parties had no plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"A2Y\">\u00b619 <em>Issue Two. Did the District Court err in denying postconviction relief on Maldonado\u2019s claim that his plea was not voluntary?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u00b620 Although Maldonado maintains that there was no plea agreement, he next argues that the plea agreement between the parties was based on a fundamental mistake or misunderstanding and that he should be paroled as a result. Maldonado claims that the fundamental mistake or misunderstanding stemmed from his being misinformed as to the consequences of the guilty plea. Maldonado is essentially arguing that he should be entitled to withdraw his <em>Alford </em>plea. Thus we will analyze Maldonado\u2019s claims under our standards for withdrawal of a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b621 We review a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea to determine if the defendant has shown good cause to withdraw. Section 46-16-105(2), MCA (1995). Our review of whether a plea was entered voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review de novo. <em>State v. McFarlane, </em>2008 MT 18, \u00b6 8, 341 Mont. 166, \u00b6 8, 176 P.3d 1057, \u00b6 8. We review the trial court\u2019s underlying factual findings to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 327 Mont. 352, \u00b6 23, 114 P.3d 254, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b622 Under the law in effect at the time Maldonado entered his <em>Alford </em>plea, the district court could permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty, at any time before or after judgment, for good cause shown. Section 46-16-105(2), MCA (1995). \u201cGood cause\u201d includes involuntariness of the plea, but may also include other criteria. <em>McFarlane, </em>\u00b6 11. \u201cThe defendant, before entering the plea, must be \u2018fully aware of the direct consequences, including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor, or his own counsel....\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2005 MT 234, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 397, \u00b6 14,121 P.3d 521, \u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 1472 (1970)). In determining whether a district court erred in denying a request to withdraw a guilty plea, we have looked to the adequacy of the district court\u2019s interrogation at the time of the plea regarding the defendant\u2019s understanding of the consequences of the plea. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b623 Maldonado argues that, in light of paragraph 16 of the Acknowledgment, he believed that the District Court could impose either the State\u2019s recommended sentence of fifty years consecutive to his federal sentence or his recommended sentence of twenty years with ten suspended concurrent with his federal sentence. Paragraph 16 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">The defendant is aware that all parties to this agreement have made the Court aware of the State\u2019s intended sentence recommendation and the defendant\u2019s intended sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>recommendation and the Court will either agree with the State or the defense after reviewing the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report and hearing any and all evidence presented by the State and the defendant. The Court will impose a sentence it feels appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abq\">\u00b624 In order to determine whether Maldonado was aware of the direct consequences of entering the plea, <em>see </em>Warclub, \u00b6 32, the District Court questioned him thoroughly before accepting his guilty plea. In the order denying postconviction relief, the District Court concluded that \u201c[a] review of Maldonado\u2019s letters, court documents and Maldonado\u2019s testimony shows that he was well aware of the issues involved in his case and that there was no viable issue of incapacity or mental disease on the part of Maldonado.\u201d The record before us supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the plea was entered voluntarily. Furthermore, we note that Maldonado in fact received a concurrent sentence, which was far more favorable then the sentence recommended by the State. Maldonado\u2019s argument that he misunderstood the consequences of his guilty plea is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b625 Maldonado next contends that he understood that he would be paroled by the State authorities to his federal sentence and that he would never serve any time in the Montana State Prison. Maldonado claims that this was confirmed by an August 6, 1997 letter from Stephens to Maldonado. However, as the State makes clear, the relevant passage of the letter reads \u201cfor purposes of serving your sentence, it was contemplated by all parties that the service of your federal sentence would operate as a discharge of any time you would be required to serve at Montana State Prison <em>for purposes of securing parole eligibility.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Maldonado did in fact become parole eligible in Montana while serving his federal sentence. Maldonado\u2019s argument on this point is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b626 Maldonado also claimed that as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not enter a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent <em>Alford </em>plea. The \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement for withdrawal of a guilty plea is satisfied if a petitioner can satisfy both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test-deficient performance by counsel and resulting prejudice to the petitioner. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>2004 MT 173, \u00b6 17, 322 Mont. 69, \u00b6 17, 93 P.3d 1231, \u00b6 17. For the reasons discussed in Issue Four, <em>infra </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-40, Maldonado lacks good cause to withdraw his guilty plea on the theory of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b627  We conclude that Maldonado acted voluntarily and has not shown good cause for withdrawing his guilty plea on the grounds of either fundamental mistake or misunderstanding, or ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>assistance of counsel. We hold that the District Court correctly denied Maldonado\u2019s petition for postconviction relief on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b628 <em>Issue Three. Did the District Court err in denying postconviction relief on the issue of whether the State breached the plea agreement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b629 Notwithstanding his argument that there was no plea agreement between the parties, Maldonado contends that the State breached the agreement in paragraph 14 of the Acknowledgment to not involve itself in any parole matter concerning Maldonado. He claims that the District Court erred in concluding that even if the State\u2019s actions violated paragraph 14 of the Acknowledgment, any breach was harmless. We agree with the District Court that the State\u2019s actions were harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b630 Although the parole board did receive a letter from the State opposing Maldonado\u2019s release on parole and one board member met with a deputy Yellowstone County attorney, the State withdrew the letter of opposition and the board member who spoke with the deputy county attorney recused herself. Maldonado has failed to present any evidence that the State\u2019s actions ever factored into the parole board\u2019s determination or that he was prejudiced in any way. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Maldonado\u2019s petition for postconviction relief on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u00b631 <em>Issue Four. Did the District Court err in denying postconviction relief on the issue of whether defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">\u00b632 Maldonado argues that the District Court erred in concluding that his counsel did not render ineffective assistance. Maldonado contends that defense counsels\u2019 actions were outside of the wide range of professional competent assistance, and that he was prejudiced by counsels\u2019 actions. The State responds by arguing that Maldonado has failed to satisfy the burden of showing deficient performance and prejudice. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">\u00b633 In order to analyze ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we have adopted the two-part test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Under the <em>Strickland </em>test, \u201ca defendant must prove (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 90, \u00b6 10, 183 P.3d 861, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">\u00b634 The primary question under the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test is \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20. However, we \u201c \u2018must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\u2019 and the defendant \u2018must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689,104 S. Ct. at 2065 (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b635 In order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the defendant must satisfy both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>DuBray v. State, </em>2008 MT 121, \u00b6 19, 342 Mont. 520, \u00b6 19, 182 P.3d 753, \u00b6 19. If an insufficient showing is made regarding one prong, then there is no need to address the other prong. <em>Adams v. State, </em>2007 MT 35, \u00b6 22, 336 Mont. 63, \u00b6 22, 153 P.3d 601, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b636 Maldonado first contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the advice and assistance he received and, therefore, he did not enter a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent <em>Alford </em>plea. In support of this assertion, Maldonado offers only that he met with Selvey three times after being returned to the Yellowstone County Detention Facility in October 1996. Not only does the limited record before us reveal extensive communications between Maldonado and both Stephens and Selvey in regard to the plea, but even if Maldonado only met with Selvey three times, Maldonado has failed to show how this constituted ineffective assistance. There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and that the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689,104 S. Ct. at 2065; <em>State v. Tennell, </em>2007 MT 266, \u00b6 16, 339 Mont. 381, \u00b6 16, 170 P.3d 965, \u00b6 16. We conclude that Maldonado has failed to overcome this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b637 Maldonado next claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based on his contention that defense counsel informed him that if he entered a guilty plea, he would receive a concurrent sentence and that he could withdraw his plea if he did not receive a concurrent sentence, but that this guarantee was not in the plea agreement. Given that Maldonado received a concurrent sentence, this claim is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">\u00b638 Maldonado then claims that defense counsel informed him that his federal sentence would operate as a discharge of his state sentence and he would not have to serve any prison time at the Montana State Prison. As we concluded in \u00b6 25, this argument is without merit and Maldonado has failed to demonstrate that counsels\u2019 conduct fell below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b639 Maldonado lastly claims that he was informed by defense counsel that the State had agreed not to involve itself in any parole matters concerning Maldonado. Given our conclusion in \u00b6 17 that the State did in fact agree not to involve itself in parole matters, Maldonado\u2019s claim on this point is moot and need not be addressed any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b640  In sum, Maldonado has failed to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test as he has not demonstrated that counsels\u2019 conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of surrounding circumstances. <em>See Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20. We need not address the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test as Maldonado has failed to satisfy the first prong. <em>See Adams, </em>\u00b6 22. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court correctly concluded that Maldonado\u2019s counsel did not render ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b641 In conclusion, a plea agreement did exist between the parties but was limited to five key terms. Maldonado has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel or that his guilty plea was anything but knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. The District Court did not err in denying Maldonado\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u00b642 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
