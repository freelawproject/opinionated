Torgerson guilty of the misdemeanor offenses of unlawful possession of a game animal and unlawful possession of bird parts. Torgerson appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-19\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-20\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in refusing to suppress evidence gathered during the searches of Torgerson\u2019s residence and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>premises of Torgerson Implement?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in admitting the testimony of Torgerson\u2019s former wife?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court erroneously admit hearsay testimony by Game Warden Rod Duty?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err in denying Torgerson\u2019s motions for mistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u00b67 5. Was the evidence sufficient to convict Torgerson?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">\u00b68 In February of 2004, Daisy Doane went to the Conrad, Montana, office of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks with information about her then-estranged husband Torgerson\u2019s unlawful killing of four whitetail deer bucks, in four separate incidents, over a period of several years. Based in large part on the information Doane provided, game wardens and other law enforcement officers obtained warrants to search Torgerson\u2019s residence and his family\u2019s business, Torgerson Implement. From the collections of antlers and mounts in both locations, they seized two head mounts from the business and a set of velvet antlers and a head mount from the residence. They also seized a golden eagle skull, feathers and numerous photographs of Torgerson posing with dead deer from the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">\u00b69 In October of2004, the State of Montana charged Torgerson with unlawful possession of bird parts and unlawful possession of wildlife-four whitetail deer bucks it alleged he had taken either outside the legal hunting season or illegally with the use of a spotlight. The State valued three of the bucks at $500 each, pursuant to \u00a7 87-1-111, MCA, and the fourth as a trophy animal worth $8,000, pursuant to \u00a7 87-1-115, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">\u00b610 Doane and Torgerson subsequently divorced. At Torgerson\u2019s trial in the summer of 2006, Doane testified for the State under a grant of immunity. Doane told the jury she had pled guilty to two misdemeanor counts of possession of unlawfully-killed game animals-the mounts seized from Torgerson\u2019s (and her former) home. She told the jury she had hunted with Torgerson many times while they were dating and during their three-year marriage. At trial, she claimed lack of memory as to many details she had provided the game wardens in February of 2004, but counsel refreshed her memory with notes from her meetings with game wardens. Doane testified that she held a spotlight for Torgerson while he shot at a whitetail buck with velvet-covered antlers in a CRP field before the gun hunting season, and then saw the dead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>animal the next day. She testified that, on another occasion, before the general hunting season during which hunting with a gun is allowed, Torgerson shot a whitetail deer with a gun and then his brother shot the same animal with a bow and arrow. She testified that she held a spotlight while Torgerson shot a whitetail buck with a rifle in Bob Layne\u2019s field. She also testified that Torgerson shot a whitetail buck with a gun during bow hunting season on \u201cParceH\u2019s ranch\u201d and brought it home the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b611 The three mounts and the set of velvet antlers seized from Torgerson\u2019s home and family business were admitted into evidence. William J. Reneau, director of big game records for the Boone and Crocket Club, identified the mounts and antlers as those of the animals shown in several photographs seized from Torgerson\u2019s residence and associated with Doane\u2019s testimony about the illegally-taken whitetail bucks. Wildlife biologist Gary Olson explained the yearly cycles of a deer buck\u2019s antlers and hair, testifying that deer usually lose their velvet beginning in August. Olson noted the antlers in evidence were still in velvet and, on one mount, the velvet appeared to have been scraped off after the animal died. Olson also noted that the hair on the mounts appeared to be in a transition process between the summer coats and the winter coats, which he testified typically would happen in mid-August to mid-September.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u00b612 Game Warden Rod Duty testified, among other things, that the five-week general hunting season in Montana begins five weeks before Thanksgiving. He also testified that, prior to the searches, Doane told the wardens where they would find unused hunting tags of Torgerson\u2019s and that Torgerson would often save them in case he wanted to use them later. During the search of Torgerson\u2019s home, the searchers found hunting tags for the years 1998,1999 and 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u00b613 Game Warden Bryan Golie testified that, during the search of Torgerson\u2019s home, Torgerson said, \u201c[y]ou\u2019re going to find this anyway. I might as well get it.\u201d Torgerson then walked over to a back room and picked up a backpack with feathers sticking out of it. He told Golie he had found the feathers, as well as a bird skull which was also in the backpack, while he was antler hunting. According to wildlife biologist Olson, the feathers and skull were golden eagle parts, possession of which is prohibited by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u00b614 Torgerson testified on his own behalf. He admitted shooting two of the deer, but denied doing so illegally. He specifically denied shooting any of the deer with the aid of a spotlight. He told the jury he found the deer in the Layne field already dead, apparently from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>natural causes; and that he did not shoot the deer Doane claimed he shot with a gun and his brother later shot with a bow and arrow. Torgerson presented evidence that the yearly cycles of deer antlers and coats can vary, and pointed out gaps in Doane\u2019s observations. He also suggested Doane or the game wardens may have planted the eagle parts in his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b615 The District Court gave the jury two special verdict forms. On the first, the jury was asked whether Torgerson was guilty of possession of unlawfully-killed wildlife and, if so, the total value of the animals he illegally possessed. On the other verdict form, the jury was asked to find whether Torgerson was guilty of unlawful possession of bird parts. The jury found Torgerson guilty of possession of unlawfully-killed wildlife and set the total value at $500; it also found him guilty of unlawful possession of bird parts. The District Court sentenced Torgerson to six months in the county jail on each of the two offenses, all of which time it suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u00b616 Did the District Court err in refusing to suppress evidence gathered during the searches of Torgerson\u2019s residence and the premises of Torgerson Implement?</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">\u00b617 Torgerson timely moved the District Court to suppress evidence gathered during the searches of his residence and family business, arguing the search warrants were based on \u201cillegal private searches\u201d and information obtained from a disgruntled spouse, Doane, whose information was privileged. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\u00b618 One year later-well after the deadline set in the omnibus order for pretrial motions-Torgerson filed a \u201csupplemental motion to suppress\u201d the same evidence. In that motion, Torgerson raised new arguments for suppressing the evidence, including the argument he now raises on appeal: that the warrants to search his residence and his family\u2019s business were facially defective and unlawfully executed as a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d because they did not particularly describe the things to be seized. The District Court denied the \u201csupplemental motion to suppress,\u201d citing the law of the case and Torgerson\u2019s failure to cite any new evidence previously unavailable which would justify reconsideration of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">\u00b619 In his reply brief, Torgerson claims he did not have all the information to support his motion to suppress until he was represented by his present counsel, who filed the \u201csupplemental motion to suppress\u201d in the District Court. Torgerson does not claim the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>information was unavailable until that time, however-only that his original counsel did not obtain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b620 Absent plain error, this Court will not consider an issue not timely raised in the district court. <em>See State v. Minez, </em>2004 MT 115, \u00b6 30, 321 Mont. 148, \u00b6 30,89 P.3d 966, \u00b6 30 (citation omitted). Torgerson did not timely raise this issue in the District Court, nor has he alleged or established plain error. Therefore, we will not consider this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b621  We hold Torgerson has failed to establish error in the District Court\u2019s refusal to suppress evidence gathered during the searches of his residence and the premises of Torgerson Implement.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b622 Did the District Court err in admitting the testimony of Doane, Torgerson\u2019s former wife?</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u00b623 Torgerson asserts admission of Doane\u2019s testimony was improper for several reasons. We address each of his arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">\u00b624 Prior to trial, Torgerson moved the District Court to exclude Doane\u2019s testimony because she was an accomplice who was legally accountable for two of the counts of unlawful possession of wildlife for which he was being tried-the shootings at which she testified she held the spotlight for him. Immediately before Doane testified, the court denied Torgerson\u2019s motion to exclude her testimony and ruled the State could present her testimony before it presented evidence corroborating it, as is required under \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA. The court also stated that, after the State had presented its case, it would entertain Torgerson\u2019s motion for dismissal for insufficient corroborating evidence. At the close of the State\u2019s case, the District Court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\u00b625 On appeal, Torgerson claims the court erred in denying his motion for dismissal due to insufficient corroborating evidence. We review questions regarding the sufficiency of corroborating evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>State v. Berger, </em>1998 MT 170, \u00b6 28, 290 Mont. 78, \u00b6 28, 964 P.2d 725, \u00b6 28 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">\u00b626  Accomplice testimony cannot form the basis for a criminal conviction unless it is properly corroborated. Section 46-16-213, MCA. Corroborating evidence must be independent and must tend to connect the defendant with commission of the offense. Conversely, corroborating evidence need not be sufficient to support a conviction or even to make out a prima facie case against the defendant. <em>Berger, </em>\u00b6 28 (citations omitted). Nor is corroborating evidence insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>merely because it is circumstantial, disputed or possibly consistent with innocent conduct. <em>State v. Marler, </em>2008 MT 13, \u00b6 23, 341 Mont. 120, \u00b6 23, 176 P.3d 1010, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b627  Doane\u2019s testimony that Torgerson shot two deer with the aid of a spotlight was supported by the spotlights found in Torgerson\u2019s home. Her testimony about the shootings of the various deer was supported by the envelopes of photographs seized from his home, marked 1996,1998,1999 and 2000, showing him posing with the dead animals. It was further supported by the unused deer hunting permit tags for the years 1998,1999 and 2000 seized from Torgerson\u2019s home. In addition, the game wardens\u2019 testimony regarding the velvet antlers and the summer coats supported Doane\u2019s testimony that the animals were taken before the five-week general hunting season began. The State\u2019s corroborating evidence was independent of Doane\u2019s testimony and tended to connect Torgerson to the charged offenses. We conclude that, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence sufficiently corroborated Doane\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b628 Torgerson also argues the District Court erred in allowing Doane to testify about communications between them while they were married in violation of \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, which prohibits such testimony without the nontestifying spouse\u2019s permission. Before trial, Torgerson moved to exclude testimony by Doane regarding his spousal communications with her. In discussing Torgerson\u2019s motion with counsel immediately before trial, the District Court made no formal ruling on the motion, but advised counsel \u201c[i]f [spousal immunity] does come up, raise your objections, if you want a continuing objection to some of those things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b629 On appeal, Torgerson advances only one instance of Doane\u2019s testimony. Counsel for the State had asked Doane if she had taken anything with her when she went to meet with the game wardens early in their investigation of Torgerson. Doane responded that she had taken a piece of paper on which she had jotted down some notes to help her remember dates and other details. Counsel then asked if Doane remembered what she had written across the top of the paper, and Doane replied she did not. Counsel produced the notes and asked Doane to refresh her recollection by reading them. Counsel then had Doane read aloud what she had written across the top: \u201cIf you go to the game wardens, I will say you\u2019re just as guilty as I am.\u201d Doane testified Torgerson had made that statement to her when they were angry with each other and trying to work out custody terms for their daughter as part of the dissolution of their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u00b630 Torgerson contends on appeal that the District Court violated \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, in admitting the above testimony by Doane. He claims the court had granted him a continuing objection on grounds of spousal immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b631 As indicated above, the record reflects that the court told defense counsel prior to trial that \u201c[i]f [spousal immunity] does come up, raise your objections, if you want a continuing objection to some of those things.\u201d Torgerson did not follow the District Court\u2019s directive; nor did he object to the testimony he now argues was improperly admitted. As a result, we conclude he may not now argue trial court error in this regard. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA; <em>State v. Clausell, </em>2001 MT 62, \u00b6 25, 305 Mont. 1, \u00b6 25, 22 P.3d 1111, \u00b6 25 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b632 Finally, Torgerson argues Doane\u2019s statement that he told her, \u201cIf you go to the game wardens, I will say you\u2019re just as guilty as I am,\u201d was inadmissible on hearsay grounds. Torgerson is correct that hearsay generally is not admissible into evidence. <em>See </em>M. R. Evid. 802. However, because he did not object on this basis, we conclude he waived the ability to assert error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\u00b633  We hold Torgerson has not established error by the District Court in admitting Doane\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\u00b634 Did the District Court erroneously admit hearsay testimony by Game Warden Rod Duty?</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">\u00b635 Duty testified concerning meetings he had with Doane in February and March of2004. Torgerson objected, on hearsay grounds, to Duty\u2019s testimony about several things Doane told him at those meetings. Based on Doane\u2019s uncertainty in her own testimony and Torgerson\u2019s challenges to her recollections on cross-examination, however, the District Court ruled-in essence-that Duty\u2019s testimony was allowable as prior inconsistent statements of a witness. <em>See </em>M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1). On appeal, Torgerson argues Duty\u2019s testimony regarding statements Doane made at those meetings was inadmissible hearsay pursuant to M. R. Evid. 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">\u00b636 We observe that Torgerson does not advance legal argument or authorities in support of his assertion that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting Doane\u2019s testimony. M. R. App. P. 12(l)f places that burden on the appellant. We are not obligated to conduct legal research or develop legal analysis that might support an appellant\u2019s position. <em>State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6\u00b6 99-100, 331 Mont. 517, \u00b6\u00b6 99-100, 134 P.3d 53, \u00b6\u00b6 99-100. The appellant bears the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>burden of establishing trial court error. <em>See e.g. State v. Johnson, </em>2008 MT 227, \u00b6 17, 344 Mont. 313, \u00b6 17, 187 P.3d 662, \u00b6 17(citation omitted); <em>Buck, </em>\u00b6 31 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b637  We conclude Torgerson has failed to establish that the District Court erroneously admitted hearsay testimony by Duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\u00b638 Did the District Court err in denying Torgerson\u2019s motions for mistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\u00b639 During her questioning of Doane at trial, the prosecutor commented that Doane\u2019s lawyer, who was present in the courtroom, was from Kalispell, Montana, the \u201csame place defense counsel practices.\u201d After Doane\u2019s testimony had been completed, Torgerson moved for a mistrial based on this comment. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\u00b640 In addition, the prosecutor noted during her rebuttal closing argument that Doane had testified with immunity. Torgerson made an unspecified objection and requested a sidebar. The District Court denied Torgerson\u2019s request for a sidebar and reminded the jury that they would decide what the facts were. After closing arguments were completed, Torgerson\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial based on the reference to Doane\u2019s immunity. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"ATp\">\u00b641 On appeal, Torgerson again asserts his entitlement to a new trial on the grounds raised in the District Court. He also challenges several additional remarks by the prosecutor during closing argument. Because Torgerson objected to only one remark during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, he has waived other objections in that regard. <em>See State v. Dunfee, </em>2005 MT 147, \u00b6\u00b6 41-44, 327 Mont. 335, \u00b6\u00b6 41-44, 114 P.3d 217, \u00b6\u00b6 41-44 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">\u00b642 We review the denial of motions for mistrial by determining, first, whether the prosecutor made improper comments. If so, we determine whether the comments prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 1, \u00b6 12, 972 P.2d 827, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">\u00b643 Torgerson does not enlighten us as to why he believes the prosecutor\u2019s comment that Doane\u2019s counsel, like defense counsel, was from Kalispell represents grounds for a mistrial. Nor does he provide any legal support for his claim that the remark during rebuttal closing argument constituted prosecutorial misconduct. He makes only general reference to cases regarding prosecutorial misconduct as grounds for mistrial. <em>See Gladue </em>(improper comments by a prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>in closing argument are viewed with disfavor); <em>State v. Statczar, 228 </em>Mont. 446, 457, 743 P.2d 606, 613 (1987) (statements by a prosecutor reflecting the prosecutor\u2019s personal views are improper); <em>State v. Bain, </em>176 Mont. 23, 575 P.2d 919 (1978) (misconduct by a prosecutor can form the basis for a new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u00b644 This Court is not obligated to conduct legal research on an appellant\u2019s behalf or to develop legal analysis to support the appellant\u2019s position, and we will not address an argument which is unsupported by analysis or citation to legal authority as required by M. R. App. P. 12(l)f. <em>Buck, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 99, 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u00b645  We conclude Torgerson has not established that the District Corut erred in denying a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u00b646 Was the evidence sufficient to convict Torgerson?</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">\u00b647 Torgerson moved for dismissal for insufficiency of the evidence following the State\u2019s case, and the District Court denied that motion. On appeal, Torgerson asserts error on the basis that the evidence against him was insufficient to support his convictions for the misdemeanor offenses of unlawful possession of a game animal and unlawful possession of bird parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">\u00b648 Dismissal for insufficiency of the evidence is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there is no evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Bomar, </em>2008 MT 91, \u00b6 13, 342 Mont. 281, \u00b6 13, 182 P.3d 47, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted). It is within the province of the finder of fact to determine the credibility of witnesses and, in the event of conflicting evidence on factual issues, to determine the weight to be given that evidence. <em>See State v. Sattler, </em>1998 MT 57, \u00b6 55, 288 Mont. 79, \u00b6 55, 956 P.2d 54, \u00b6 55 (citation omitted). We review de novo the denial of a motion for dismissal for insufficiency of the evidence, to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to convict. <em>State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 326, \u00b6 19, 160 P.3d 511, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">\u00b649 Here, the court instructed the jury that, to find Torgerson guilty of an act or acts, all of its members must agree that Torgerson committed the same act or acts. The court instructed the jury that, to convict Torgerson of unlawful possession of wildlife, the State must prove that Torgerson possessed, had or kept in storage a game animal, the game animal was unlawfully killed, and Torgerson acted purposely or knowingly. The court further instructed the jury that the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>value of a nontrophy deer was $500 and the statutory value of a trophy animal was $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b650 As set forth above, the jury found Torgerson guilty of unlawful possession of wildlife, which it valued at $500. Hence, pursuant to the instructions given, the jury clearly found Torgerson guilty of unlawful possession of one nontrophy deer. The special verdict form did not require the jury to specify the animal or animals as to which it might render a guilty verdict, however, and Torgerson did not object to the special verdict form on those grounds. Because we cannot determine which animal the jury found Torgerson unlawfully possessed, we review the evidence as to each of the four deer to determine whether sufficient evidence existed to support a guilty verdict on the charged offense of unlawful possession of each of those animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b651 Doane testified she held a spotlight to assist Torgerson while he used a gun to shoot at the deer with the velvet antlers at night and that, while she did not actually see the dead animal that night, she saw it-dead-the next day. She identified that animal as the one shown in photographs admitted into evidence in an envelope marked, in what she identified as Torgerson\u2019s handwriting, with \u201c96 Lin Velvet WT.\u201d Game Warden Duty testified that he saw spotlights in Torgerson\u2019s home during the search. Finally, the Boone and Crockett expert, Reneau, testified that one of the mounts in evidence was the same animal shown in the photographs in the envelope marked \u201c96 Lin Velvet WT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u00b652 Doane testified that, on another occasion, she was driving around with Torgerson when he shot at a whitetail deer with a gun before the gun hunting season had opened. The deer stumbled, but then Doane saw it run \u201call the way to the river.\u201d Doane testified that Torgerson and his brothers went out looking for the animal the following day, and Torgerson\u2019s brother shot it with a bow. Doane further identified the handwritten words \u201c\u201998 Velvet WT Chase\u201d as Torgerson\u2019s writing on an envelope of photographs admitted into evidence. Reneau testified the photographs in the envelope were of the animal preserved in one of the mounts introduced into evidence. In addition, Doane testified the animal\u2019s head had been preserved on a pedestal mount which was kept at Torgerson\u2019s house-not at his brother\u2019s house-and Reneau identified that mount as the animal shown in the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u00b653 As to the third charge of unlawful possession of wildlife, Doane testified she held a spotlight while Torgerson shot a whitetail buck with a rifle in Bob Layne\u2019s field. An envelope of photographs seized from Torgerson\u2019s home and introduced into evidence, marked in what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Doane identified as Torgerson\u2019s handwriting with \u201c\u201999 Lin WT,\u201d show him beside the bloated dead deer in daylight. Reneau testified those photographs showed the animal in a mount admitted into evidence. The words \u201cLin Torgerson, 1999\u201d were written on the back of the mount.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b654 Finally, Doane testified that she and Torgerson observed a whitetail buck during bow hunting season on \u201cParcell\u2019s ranch,\u201d and Torgerson shot it with a gun and brought it home the next day. She identified that buck in photographs seized from Torgerson\u2019s home showing Torgerson posing with the dead animal. Reneau testified the photographs were of the animal preserved in one of the mounts in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u00b655  We conclude the evidence would allow a rational trier of fact to find Torgerson guilty of unlawful possession of wildlife, beyond a reasonable doubt, of each of the four deer.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u00b656 As to Torgerson\u2019s conviction of the offense of possession of wild bird parts, Torgerson contends the State did not offer any evidence that the parts he possessed were from wild birds, as opposed to from a falconer\u2019s bird. Indeed, he asserts the State did not prove that the feathers and skull were from an eagle, because no DNA test was obtained. Further, Torgerson points out that the State put on no proof that he did not have a \u201ccertificate, falconer\u2019s license, or permit\u201d allowing him to possess the parts, pursuant to \u00a7 87-5-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\u00b657 These arguments are not dispositive of the issue of whether the evidence was sufficient to support Torgerson\u2019s conviction on this count. The court instructed the jury-without objection-that a person commits the offense of unlawful possession of bird parts if he purposely or knowingly possesses any part of the plumage, skin or body of a wild bird other than a game bird. As set forth above, the State presented testimony by Game Warden Golie that, during the search of Torgerson\u2019s home, Torgerson pointed out the backpack containing the feathers and skull. The State also presented testimony by wildlife biologist Olson identifying the feathers and skull found in Torgerson\u2019s home as those of an eagle based on the shape and size of the beak and on feather length, color and shape.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">\u00b658  We hold the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"AKV\">\u00b659 Torgerson having established no grounds for reversal of his convictions, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b565-9\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
