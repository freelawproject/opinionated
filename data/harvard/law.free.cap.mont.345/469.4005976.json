We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u00b62 Mackrill visited a number of bars in Livingston, Montana, during the evening of October 23,2005. He entered the Whiskey Creek Saloon at around 9:30. The bartender, Lori Munro, observed that he appeared to be intoxicated. According to Munro, Mackrill staggered around the bar for awhile and then walked up to two patrons, ordered a drink for one, and turned to the other and began to pick a fight. At that point, Munro ordered Mackrill to leave, and he did so. Roughly an hour later, Mackrill poked his head in the door of the bar but then turned around and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u00b63 A similar scenario occurred at the Murray Bar. The bartender, Christina Gillespie, observed that Mackrill was intoxicated, and Mackrill indicated to Gillespie that he did not know where he was. Gillespie refused to serve Mackrill alcohol and instead gave him a glass of water and told him that he could sober up there for a little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>while. According to Gillespie, Mackrill initially was polite, but he eventually began \u201cmisbehaving\u201d and became upset that Gillespie would not serve him alcohol. Mackrill walked up to a woman sitting at the bar and got into an argument with her. Gillespie asked the woman if Mackrill was bothering her, and the woman replied that he was. So, Gillespie asked Mackrill to leave. Mackrill later returned to the bar, insisting that he had left his jacket there, but Gillespie informed him that there was no jacket in the bar and that she would call the police if he entered again. Mackrill lingered outside the bar for awhile peering through the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b64 Mackrill also visited the Mint Bar two or three times that evening, where he eventually got into the altercation at issue in this case. According to Dan Connelley, a patron at the Mint Bar who noticed Mackrill during these visits, Mackrill was \u201cbeyond intoxication\u201d and was trying to pick fights. Mackrill was asked to leave the bar at around 7:30, and he did so; but when he returned at around midnight and the bartender, Kaylene Little, asked him to leave, Mackrill became obstinate and argumentative. In Connelley\u2019s view, Mackrill \u201cjust wouldn\u2019t comprehend that it was time for him to leave\u201d and \u201cthat they were going to call the cops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b65 Mackrill eventually approached Connelley, who had been chatting with a friend, Robert Gluesing. Mackrill positioned himself between Connelley and Gluesing and asked Connelley for a drink. Gluesing offered Mackrill a couple of dollars and suggested that he get a drink someplace else, since Little was unwilling to serve him. At this point, Little again ordered Mackrill to leave; and when he refused to do so, she picked up the phone to call the police. Gluesing attempted to persuade Mackrill to leave, but Gluesing ended up escorting Mackrill out the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b66 Meanwhile, Jeremy Shields, the operator of the Sport Bar located half a block from the Mint Bar, was standing outside of the Sport Bar talking on the phone when he observed two men (Mackrill and Gluesing) exit the Mint Bar. Shields observed that \u201cthey had their hands on each other\u201d and that \u201cit looked like there was a scuffle going on.\u201d Shields called two of his friends in the Sport Bar, Nate Ousley and Jory Mitchell, to come out and witness the commotion. Shields saw Mackrill, whom Shields characterized as \u201clarger\u201d and \u201cthicker\u201d than Gluesing, hit Gluesing several times, including a \u201cvery solid shot\u201d that caused Gluesing\u2019s feet to come off the ground and the back of his head to hit the pavement. According to Shields, the sound of Glue sing\u2019s head hitting the pavement \u201csounded like a pumpkin breaking.\u201d Mitchell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>noted that prior to the final punch, Gluesing\u2019s hands were down and he was basically \u201csleeping on his feet.\u201d After Gluesing hit the ground, Mitchell contacted 911 to report the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b67 Livingston City Fire and Rescue responded to the scene and found Gluesing unconscious in the street. Gluesing was bleeding from the back of his head and from his right ear and was unresponsive. He was transported to Livingston Memorial Hospital, where he was treated for head injuries, including a skull fracture. Gluesing\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration was .246. He remained in the hospital for about a week to receive treatment for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b68 Livingston Police Department Officers Jerry Harmon and Joseph Harris also responded to the emergency call. After arriving at the scene, they checked on Gluesing\u2019s condition and gathered information about the assailant from witnesses. Officer Harris then set out to search for Mackrill. Harris eventually made contact with Mackrill and observed that although he was able to give his name, date of birth, and social security number, Mackrill appeared to be highly intoxicated and confused. Harris placed Mackrill under arrest and transported him to the police station, where the officers conducted a voluntary videotaped interview with Mackrill.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b69 On November 17,2005, the State charged Mackrill with one count of aggravated assault, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-202, MCA. Mackrill pleaded not guilty to the charge. Thereafter, he filed a Notice of Affirmative Defenses, in which he stated that he would be arguing consent at trial (i.e., that Gluesing had consented to the fight and that Mackrill, therefore, was not guilty of the charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00b610 Trial commenced on April 13, 2006. Following opening statements, defense counsel made a motion to exclude any questions or testimony regarding the fact that Mackrill had been asked to leave several of the bars he visited on October 23, 2005, due to disorderly conduct. Counsel argued that such evidence would be prejudicial and that it was inadmissible under M. R. Evid. 404(b). The prosecutor responded that evidence of the events which occurred before, during, and after the offense was committed was relevant and admissible under the transaction rule. <em>See </em>\u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. The court agreed with the State and denied Mackrill\u2019s motion, explaining: \u201cI think it\u2019s part of res gestae, which is a transaction rule, both before and after.\u201d The court also indicated, albeit not explicitly, that the evidence was not unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b611 Mackrill\u2019s trial proceeded, and the jury heard testimony from several witnesses, including Connelley, Gluesing, and a number of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>bartenders on duty the evening of October 23. On the second day of trial, the issue arose as to whether the State could introduce the videotape of Mackrill being interviewed at the police station after his arrest. Mackrill objected \u201cto any presentation, whatsoever,\u201d of the video on the grounds that its prejudicial value outweighed its probative value and that it was cumulative of earlier testimony. The District Court agreed that portions of the taped interview were unduly prejudicial. Thus, the court ordered the prosecution to edit out any references to Mackrill\u2019s criminal record, tattoos, and violent tendencies. The prosecutor edited the tape and then moved to admit it at trial, at which point Mackrill reiterated his objection that the video was cumulative. The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b612 The jury ultimately found Mackrill guilty as charged. Thereafter, Mackrill filed a post-trial motion requesting that the court, pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, \u201cfind him not guilty of Aggravated Assault, or in the alternative, guilty of the lesser included offense of Misdemeanor Assault.\u201d Mackrill argued that the State had \u201cfailed to introduce evidence upon which the jury could conclude that Robert Gluesing did not consent to the October 24, 2005 bar fight\u201d and had \u201cfailed to introduce evidence upon which the jury could conclude that Robert Gluesing, by reason of intoxication, was unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the bar fight.\u201d The District Court held a hearing and denied the motion. The court reasoned that the jury had been properly instructed on the law and had heard the facts and that the court was not permitted under the circumstances to substitute its judgment for that of the jury. Mackrill now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b613 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">1. Did the District Court err in denying Mackrill\u2019s motion for a new trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">2. Did the District Court err in admitting evidence concerning Mackrill\u2019s conduct before and after the altercation with Gluesing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">3. Does Mackrill\u2019s conviction violate due process?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">\u00b614 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court err in denying Mackrill\u2019s motion for a new </em>trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">Mackrill\u2019s Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">\u00b615 We begin with Mackrill\u2019s sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>provides context for our discussion of the evidentiary issues under Issue 2. As noted, Mackrill filed a post-trial motion contending that the State had failed to present evidence sufficient to prove two matters: (1) that Gluesing did not consent to the assault, and (2) that Gluesing, by reason of intoxication, was unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the assault. Mackrill asked the District Court either to find him not guilty of aggravated assault or to find him guilty of the lesser offense of misdemeanor assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b616 We note that Mackrill captioned his motion as one for \u201cjudgment notwithstanding the verdict.\u201d On appeal, he refers to the motion as one for a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d and also as one for \u201can acquittal notwithstanding the verdict.\u201d Montana\u2019s statutes governing criminal procedure, however, do not recognize these motions. <em>See State v. McWilliams, </em>2008 MT 59, \u00b6\u00b6 36,41,341 Mont. 517, \u00b6\u00b6 36,41,178 P.3d 121, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 41. Indeed, we have clarified that a \u201cmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict\u201d is properly referred to as a \u201cmotion for a new trial\u201d under \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA. <em>See McWilliams, </em>\u00b6 41; <em>State v. Bell, </em>277 Mont. 482, 485, 923 P.2d 524, 526 (1996). Likewise, we have clarified that a \u201cmotion for a directed verdict\u201d is properly referred to as a \u201cmotion to dismiss for insufficient evidence\u201d under \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA. <em>See McWilliams, </em>\u00b6 36; <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 21 n. 2, 342 Mont. 1, \u00b6 21 n. 2, 180 P.3d 1102, \u00b6 21 n. 2. The latter motion (to dismiss for insufficient evidence) is made \u201cat the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidence or at the close of all the evidence.\u201d Section 46-16-403, MCA. Thus, this statute and motion are not applicable here. Rather, we deem Mackrill\u2019s motion, which was made following the jury\u2019s verdict, to be one for a new trial under \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA. Indeed, he cited this statute in the motion. And we once again urge the bench and bar to use the correct terminology. <em>McWilliams, </em>\u00b6 36 n. 1; <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 21 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b617 Section 46-16-702, MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">(1) Following a verdict or finding of guilty, the court may grant the defendant a new trial if required in the interest of justice. A new trial may be ordered by the court without a motion or may be granted after motion and hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">(2) The motion for a new trial must be in writing and must specify the grounds for a new trial. The motion must be filed by the defendant within 30 days following a verdict or finding of guilty and be served upon the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">(3) On hearing the motion for a new trial, if justified by law and the weight of the evidence, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>(a) deny the motion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">(b) grant a new trial; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">(c) modify or change the verdict or finding by finding the defendant guilty of a lesser included offense or finding the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b618 Mackrill contends on appeal that \u201cthere was insufficient evidence that Gluesing did not consent to fight Mr. Mackrill, and there was ample evidence that he did consent to fight Mr. Mackrill.\u201d Thus, according to Mackrill, the District Court should have granted him a new trial or entered a finding of not guilty. Section 46-16-702(3)(b), (c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\u00b619 Where a motion for a new trial under \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, is based on sufficiency of the evidence, we review the grant or denial of the motion de novo. <em>See McWilliams, </em>\u00b6 42 n. 2; <em>State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 326, \u00b6 19,160 P.3d 511, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u00b620 At the outset, we observe that Mackrill\u2019s sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument is somewhat perplexing. Mackrill states in his opening brief that the issue here \u201cis essentially a sufficiency of the evidence argument regarding the issue of consent.\u201d As noted, he claims that \u201cthere was insufficient evidence that Gluesing did not consent to fight Mr. Mackrill.\u201d Yet, the statute under which he was prosecuted states as follows: \u201cA person commits the offense of aggravated assault if the person purposely or knowingly causes serious bodily injury to another.\u201d Section 45-5-202(1), MCA (2005). Nothing in this statute requires the State, in order to convict an individual of aggravated assault, to prove that the victim did not consent to fight the defendant. Moreover, Mackrill does not contend that there was insufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, i.e., that he \u201cpurposely or knowingly cause[d] serious bodily injury to [Gluesing].\u201d Section 45-5-202(1), MCA. Thus, the sufficiency-of-the-evidence question here is not whether the State failed to prove the elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">\u00b621 Rather, in his reply brief, Mackrill articulates the pertinent question as follows: \u201c[T]his Court should consider whether no rational jury could have found that a preponderance of the evidence demonstrated that Gluesing failed to consent to fight Mr. Mackrill.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Mackrill goes on to argue that \u201cthe preponderance of the evidence was that Gluesing consented to fight Mr. Mackrill.\u201d It appears, therefore, that Mackrill\u2019s claim is this: Consent is an affirmative defense which, if proven by a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cprecludes\u201d a conviction for aggravated assault; Mackrill proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Gluesing consented to the assault; thus, no rational jury could have found him guilty of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b622 To address this argument, we begin with the consent statute. Under \u00a7 45-2-211(1), MCA, \u201c[t]he consent of the victim to conduct charged to constitute an offense or to the result thereof is a defense.\u201d Under \u00a7 45-2-211(2), MCA, however, consent is ineffective if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">(a) it is given by a person who is legally incompetent to authorize the conduct charged to constitute the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">(b) it is given by a person who by reason of youth, mental disease or defect, or intoxication is unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct charged to constitute the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">(c) it is induced by force, duress, or deception; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">(d) it is against public policy to permit the conduct or the resulting harm, even though consented to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u00b623  Recognizing that Gluesing was intoxicated on the night in question and that consent is ineffective if it was given by \u201ca person who by reason of . . . intoxication is unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct charged to constitute the offense,\u201d \u00a7 45-2-211(2)(b), MCA, Mackrill argues that he proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cthat [Gluesing] was not too intoxicated to decide whether to agree to fight Mr. Mackrill.\u201d This argument, however, assumes a critical issue that must be determined as a threshold matter-namely, whether \u00a7 45-2-211(1), MCA, applies to Mackrill\u2019s offense, i.e., whether consent is a defense to the charge of aggravated assault. In this regard, the State suggests that \u00a7 45-2-211(2)(d), MCA, \u201carguably removes consent as a defense to charges arising from assaultive conduct, even by mutual combat, on a public street in downtown Livingston.\u201d For the reasons which follow, we agree that it is against public policy to permit a person purposely or knowingly to cause serious bodily injury to another, even though that conduct and the resulting harm were consented to. Section 45-2-211(2)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u00b624 While this Court has not previously considered whether a person can consent to be the victim of an assault, \u201cthe great weight of authority disfavors the defense of consent in assault cases.\u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Baxter, </em>141 P.3d 92, \u00b6 25 (Wash. App. Div. 2 2006). In <em>Baxter, </em>the court observed that \u201c[i]n determining whether consent is a defense in a criminal case, the courts have considered the particular act, the surrounding circumstances, and society\u2019s interest in the activity involved.\u201d <em>Baxter, </em>\u00b6 22. The court pointed out, for instance, that consent was not a defense to the violation of a domestic-violence protection order in <em>State v. Dejar\u00edais, </em>969 P.2d 90 (Wash. 1998), since the public has an interest in preventing domestic violence; that consent was not a defense to a game of shooting BB guns at each other in <em>State v. Hiott, </em>987 P.2d 135 (Wash. App. Div. 21999), since the game was not a generally accepted athletic contest and was against public policy; and that consent was not a defense to punching another player during a basketball game in <em>State v. Shelley, </em>929 P.2d 489 (Wash. App. Div. 1 1997), where the contact was not foreseeable behavior in the play of the game. <em>See Baxter, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b625 Likewise, in <em>Hiott, </em>the court observed that \u201ca child cannot consent to hazing, a gang member cannot consent to an initiation beating, and an individual cannot consent to being shot with a pistol,\u201d since such activities are \u201cagainst public policy\u201d and since \u201ccriminal statutes are enacted to protect citizens and to prevent breaches of the public peace.\u201d <em>Hiott, </em>987 P.2d at 136-37 (citing <em>People v. Lenti, </em>253 N.Y.S.2d 9, 15 (1964), <em>Helton v. State, </em>624 N.E.2d 499, 514 (Ind. App. 1 Dist. 1993), and <em>State v. Fransua, </em>510 P.2d 106,107 (N.M. App. 1973)). Similarly, in <em>Shelley, </em>the court observed that \u201calthough the defense of consent is applied in the realm of sexual assault, it has been sparingly applied by the courts in other areas,\u201d since \u201csociety has an interest in punishing assaults as breaches of the public peace and order.\u201d <em>Shelley, </em>929 P.2d at 491-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b626 In <em>Fransua, </em>the New Mexico Court of Appeals confronted the following factual scenario, which is not too far removed from Mackrill\u2019s version of what transpired between him and Gluesing in the case at hand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">On March 3,1972 both defendant and the victim were in a bar in Albuquerque. Defendant had apparently been drinking heavily that day and the previous day. Sometime around 3:00 p.m. after an argument, defendant made a statement to the victim to the effect that if he (defendant) had a gun, he would shoot the victim. The victim then left the bar, went to his own automobile, removed a loaded pistol from the automobile and returned to the bar. He approached the defendant, laid the pistol on the bar and made the following statement: \u201cI told him (defendant) that there was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>gun, that if he wanted to shoot me to go ahead.\u201d Defendant then picked up the pistol, put the barrel next to the victim\u2019s head and pulled the trigger, wounding him seriously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><em>Fransua, </em>510 P.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b627 The defendant asserted that the actions of the victim in procuring the weapon and inviting the defendant to shoot him constituted consent to the shooting and, as such, a defense to the crime of aggravated battery. The court rejected this contention, explaining as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">It is generally conceded that a state enacts criminal statutes making certain violent acts crimes for at least two reasons: One reason is to protect the persons of its citizens; the second, however, is to prevent a breach of the public peace. While we entertain little sympathy for either the victim\u2019s absurd actions or the defendant\u2019s equally unjustified act of pulling the trigger, we will not permit the defense of consent to be raised in such cases. Whether or not the victims of crimes have so little regard for their own safety as to request injury, the public has a stronger and overriding interest in preventing and prohibiting acts such as these.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\"><em>Fransua, </em>510 P.2d at 107 (citation omitted). The court thus held that consent is not a defense to the crime of aggravated battery, irrespective of whether the victim invites the act and consents to the battery. <em>Fransua, </em>510 P.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b628 An equally \u201cabsurd\u201d situation was presented in <em>State v. Brown, </em>364 A.2d 27 (N.J. Super. L. Div. 1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">[Defendant contends that he is not guilty of the alleged atrocious assault and battery because he and Mrs. Brown, the victim, had an understanding to the effect that if she consumed any alcoholic beverages (and/or became intoxicated), he would punish her by physically assaulting her. The testimony revealed that the victim was an alcoholic. On the day of the alleged crime she indulged in some spirits, apparently to Mr. Brown\u2019s dissatisfaction. As per their agreement, defendant sought to punish Mrs. Brown by severely beating her with his hands and other objects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-10\"><em>Brown, </em>364 A.2d at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">\u00b629 In considering this contention, the court first noted that the defense of consent implicates broader interests in the criminal context than it does in the civil context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">While criminal law is designed to protect the interests of society as a whole, the civil law is concerned with enforcing the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>each individual within the society. So, while the consent of the victim may relieve defendant of liability in tort, this same consent has been held irrelevant in a criminal prosecution, where there is more at stake than a victim\u2019s rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><em>Brown, </em>364 A.2d at 28. Also at stake, the court observed, is the public interest in peace, health, and good order; and an individual cannot consent to a wrong that is committed against the public peace. <em>Brown, </em>364 A.2d at 29. Although the defendant\u2019s acts (the physical assaults upon Mrs. Brown) may have been done in private, the court reasoned that they had \u201can impingement (whether direct or indirect) upon the community at large in that the very doing of them may tend to encourage their repetition and so to undermine public morals.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>364 A.2d at 29. Moreover, the court reasoned that \u201cthe State has an interest in protecting those persons who invite, consent to and permit others to assault and batter them. Not to enforce these laws which are geared to protect such people would seriously threaten the dignity, peace, health and security of our society.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>364 A.2d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b630 The court ultimately held that \u201cno one has the right to beat another even though that person may ask for it.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>364 A.2d at 31, <em>affd, State v. Brown, </em>381 A.2d 1231, 1232 (N.J. Super. App. Div. 1977) (per curiam). Notably, in reaching this conclusion, the court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">street fighting which is disorderly and mischievous on many obvious grounds (even if for a purse and consented to), and encounters of that kind which tend to and have the specific objective of causing bodily harm, serve no useful purpose, but rather tend to breach the peace and thus are unlawful. No one is justified in striking another, except it be in self defense, and similarly whenever two persons go out to strike each other and do so, each is guilty of an assault. It is no matter who strikes the first blow, for the law proscribes such striking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-7\"><em>Brown, </em>364 A.2d at 30 (citations omitted); <em>accord State v. Weber, </em>155 P.3d 947, \u00b6 21 (Wash. App. Div. 3 2007) (\u201cThere is nothing redeeming or valuable in permitting fighting and every reason to dissuade it.\u201d). \u00b631 The court in <em>State v. Dunham, </em>693 N.E.2d 1175 (Ohio App. 1 Dist. 1997) (per curiam), expressed a similar view, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">where, as here, two persons agree to fight each other not in conformity with statutes authorizing boxing matches, each may be held guilty of assault, and where, as here, the harm visited upon one of the fighters constitutes serious physical harm, the fact that the fight was begun by mutual consent is not a defense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>in law, to a charge brought pursuant to [the felonious-assault statute].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><em>Dunham, </em>693 N.E.2d at 1179. The court was not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s theory that \"where two people engage in ... a mutually agreed-upon fistfight, neither can claim that an assault and battery has been committed upon him, i.e., neither possesses a criminal intent when battering his opponent.\u201d <em>Dunham, </em>693 N.E.2d at 1177-78. The court stated plainly that \u201c[t]he fact that street fighters agree to engage in a public brawl to settle old or current differences cannot and does not negate the penal consequences.\u201d <em>Dunham, </em>693 N.E.2d at 1178. \u00b632 There are numerous other cases supporting the foregoing principles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Having considered these cases and the reasoning of the authorities discussed above, we conclude that it is against public policy to permit a person purposely or knowingly to cause serious bodily injury to another, even though that conduct and the resulting harm were consented to. Sections 45-5-202(1), 45-2-211(2)(d), MCA. We agree that criminal statutes are generally intended to protect citizens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>and to prevent breaches of the public peace, <em>Hiott, </em>987 P.2d at 136-37, and that interpreting the consent statute as legalizing mutually agreed-upon aggravated assaults would thwart the purpose of the aggravated-assault statute, <em>George, </em>937 S.W.2d at 256. We also agree that society has an interest in punishing aggravated assaults as breaches of the public peace, health, and good order, <em>Shelley, </em>929 P.2d at 491-92; <em>Brown, </em>364 A.2d at 29, and that whether or not the victim of an aggravated assault consented to the defendant\u2019s causing him serious bodily injury, the public has an overriding interest in preventing such acts, <em>Fransua, </em>510 P.2d at 107. In particular, we recognize that this type of conduct not only puts the combatants at risk, but also jeopardizes the safety of the police, emergency personnel, and bystanders. It also consumes public resources and imposes on society various costs, such as medical expenses and the inability of individuals to feel safe and secure in their persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b633 While recognizing consent as a defense (\u00a7 45-2-211(1), MCA), the Legislature contemplated that consent would be ineffective if it were \u201cagainst public policy to permit the conduct or the resulting harm, even though consented to\u201d (\u00a7 45-2-2ll(2)(d), MCA). We hold, for the public-policy reasons discussed above, that consent of the victim is not a defense to the charge of aggravated assault under \u00a7 45-5-202(1), MCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b634 Given this holding, Mackrill\u2019s arguments-that the jury was bound to acquit him because he proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Gluesing consented to fight him and was not too intoxicated to give legal consent-are moot. Even if Gluesing consented to engaging in \u201cmutual combat\u201d with Mackrill resulting in serious bodily injury, that consent was ineffective. Section 45-2-211(2)(d), MCA. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Mackrill\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b635 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court err in admitting evidence concerning Mackrill\u2019s conduct before and after the altercation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>with Gluesing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">MackrilPs Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b636 Mackrill contends that the District Court erroneously allowed the State to present (1) testimony that he was, as Mackrill puts it, \u201cdisorderly, rude, and/or confrontational,\u201d as well as \u201cobnoxious, obstreperous, and even verbally confrontational,\u201d in other nearby bars during the hours before the incident with Gluesing, and (2) the videotape of Mackrill being interviewed at the police station after his arrest, which showed his \u201caggressive demeanor.\u201d Mackrill contends that the only reason the prosecution wanted to present this evidence was to show that Mackrill \u201cwas so aggressive that he must have wanted to fight,\u201d i.e., he \u201cwas predisposed to commit assault outside the Mint.\u201d Mackrill argues that \u201c[s]uch evidence was totally unnecessary, as Mr. Mackrill did not contest that he was an active participant in the fight with Gluesing.\u201d Rather, according to Mackrill, \u201c[t]he real issue was whether Gluesing was also a willing fighter,\u201d and evidence regarding Mackrill\u2019s \u201cearlier disorderliness\u201d and his \u201cpost-arrest aggressiveness\u201d was not needed to determine this issue. Mackrill challenges the admission of the evidence on two grounds: first, he asserts that the ground relied on by the District Court-the transaction rule-was mistaken; and second, he asserts that the evidence was \u201coverly prejudicial\u201d under M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b637 We generally review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. McOmber, </em>2007 MT 340, \u00b6 10, 340 Mont. 262, \u00b6 10,173 P.3d 690, \u00b6 10. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>McOmber, </em>\u00b6 10. Notwithstanding this deferential standard, however, judicial discretion must be guided by the rules and principles of law; thus, our standard of review is plenary to the extent that a discretionary ruling is based on a conclusion of law. <em>McOmber, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>State v. Price, </em>2006 MT 79, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 502, \u00b6 17, 134 P.3d 45, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\u00b638 First, given our holding under Issue 1, we disagree with Mackrill that \u201c[t]he real issue was whether Gluesing was also a willing fighter.\u201d That was not an issue at all, since consent is not a defense to aggravated assault. Rather, the issue was whether Mackrill \u201cpurposely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>or knowingly cause[d] serious bodily injury to [Gluesing].\u201d Section 45-5-202(1), MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b639 Second, we also disagree with Mackrill\u2019s contention that the testimony regarding his conduct at the other bars and the videotape of his post-arrest interview were not admissible under the transaction rule. M. R. Evid. 404(b) states that \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith\u201d but that such evidence \u201cmay ... be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d In order for evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts to be admissible, the requirements set out in <em>State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 142-43, 814 P.2d 52, 56 (1991), must be satisfied. One of those requirements is that the prosecution must give the defendant written notice that such evidence is to be introduced. <em>Matt, </em>249 Mont, at 142-43, 814 P.2d at 56; <em>see also State v. Bieber, </em>2007 MT 262, \u00b6 56, 339 Mont. 309, \u00b6 56, 170 P.3d 444, \u00b6 56 (\u201cAs a safeguard we require that evidence of other crimes may not be received unless proper notice has been provided to the defendant of the State\u2019s intent to use such evidence and the State has indicated the purpose for which the evidence will be introduced.\u201d (citing <em>State v. Just, </em>184 Mont. 262, 268, 602 P.2d 957, 960-61 (1979)). Mackrill points out-and the State concedes \u2014 that the prosecution did not give notice that it would be introducing Rule 404(b) evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b640 The State points out, however, that the notice requirements of <em>Matt </em>and <em>Just </em>do not apply to evidence of matters which are inextricably linked to, and explanatory of, the charged offense. Indeed, there is a distinction between Rule 404(b) \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence and evidence of a defendant\u2019s misconduct which is inseparably related to the alleged criminal act. <em>State v. Lozon, </em>2004 MT 34, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 26, \u00b6 12, 85 P.3d 753, \u00b6 12. Furthermore, we have said that evidence which \u201c \u2018tends to explain circumstances surrounding the charged offense\u2019 \u201d is relevant, probative, and competent. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 12 (quoting <em>State v. Wing, </em>264 Mont. 215, 225, 870 P.2d 1368,1374 (1994)). Thus, where the evidence at issue \u201cis not wholly independent or unrelated to the charged offense,\u201d it is not \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, and the prosecution is not required to comply with the notice requirements of <em>Just </em>and <em>Matt. Lozon, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b641  We have associated this rule with \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, which states as follows: \u201cWhere the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d <em>See e.g. State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6 76, 331 Mont. 517, \u00b6 76, 134 P.3d 53, \u00b6 76; <em>State v. Gittens, </em>2008 MT 55, \u00b6 37, 341 Mont. 450, \u00b6 37, 178 P.3d 91, \u00b6 37. Pursuant to the \u201ctransaction rule,\u201d evidence of matters that are \u201cinextricably linked to, and explanatory of, the charged offense\u201d is admissible notwithstanding the rules relating to \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Gittens, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b642 Mackrill acknowledges that the evidence regarding his \u201cearlier bar wanderings\u201d and his demeanor after being arrested \u201cmight have been explanatory of whether Mr. Mackrill purposely or knowingly fought with Gluesing, which was undisputed.\u201d But he maintains that the evidence \u201cwas not inextricably linked to the charged offense.\u201d We disagree. Evidence of Mackrill\u2019s disorderly and \u201cobstreperous\u201d conduct at the various Livingston bars during the course of the evening in question was in fact closely related to the charged aggravated assault on Gluesing and was explanatory of the circumstances surrounding that offense. <em>Cf. Lozon, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Buck, </em>\u00b6 79; <em>Gittens, </em>\u00b6 39. In particular, this evidence helped to explain Mackrill\u2019s unruly and confrontational behavior in the Mint Bar and his aggression against Gluesing.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b643  Admissibility under the transaction rule is predicated on the jury\u2019s right to hear what transgressed immediately prior and subsequent to the commission of the offense charged, so that the jurors may evaluate the evidence in the context in which the criminal act occurred. <em>State v. Detonancour, </em>2001 MT 213, \u00b6 29, 306 Mont. 389, \u00b6 29, 34 P.3d 487, \u00b6 29. But while the timing of the events is relevant to admissibility under the transaction rule, it is not determinative. <em>Cf. State v. Marshall, </em>2007 MT 198, \u00b6 20, 338 Mont. 395, \u00b6 20, 165 P.3d 1129, \u00b6 20 (holding that the defendant\u2019s prior acts of grooming the victim, which occurred a month or two before the transaction at issue, satisfied the transaction rule). Here, we are not persuaded by Mackrill\u2019s contention that the events which occurred at the other bars during the few hours before the assault and at the police station shortly after the assault were not sufficiently contemporaneous with the assault itself. Accordingly, we hold that the challenged evidence was admissible under the transaction rule. The District Court did not err or abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b644 Lastly, with respect to Mackrill\u2019s contention that the testimony regarding his conduct at the other bars and the videotape of his post-arrest interview were overly prejudicial, M. R. Evid. 403 states: \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Mackrill, however, has not explained why, in his view, the probative value of the challenged evidence was \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d He makes a number of conclusory assertions in this regard, but these are not sufficient to sustain his burden of showing error by the District Court. <em>See State v. Bailey, </em>2004 MT 87, \u00b6 26, 320 Mont. 501, \u00b6 26, 87 P.3d 1032, \u00b6 26 (\u201cIt is the appellant\u2019s burden to establish error by a district court....\u201d); <em>State v. Miller, </em>2008 MT 106, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 355, \u00b6 15, 181 P.3d 625, \u00b6 15 (observing that conclusory assertions are \u201ca wholly inadequate presentation of an issue to this Court\u201d). Thus, we affirm the District Court on this matter as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b645 <em>Issue 3. Does MackrilVs conviction violate due process?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b646 Mackrill asserts that his conviction violates due process because he was too intoxicated to consent to fight Gluesing. More specifically, Mackrill contends that if the victim\u2019s intoxication can nullify a defendant\u2019s otherwise-viable consent defense (\u00a7 45-2-211(2)(b), MCA), then the defendant\u2019s intoxication should be able to nullify his guilt for the charged conduct. Yet, the latter is precluded by statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-2-203, MCA (\u201cA person who is in an intoxicated condition is criminally responsible for his conduct and an intoxicated condition is not a defense to any offense and may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state which is an element of the offense unless the defendant proves that he did not know that it was an intoxicating substance when he consumed, smoked, sniffed, injected, or otherwise ingested the substance causing the condition.\u201d). Mackrill claims this scheme violates his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b647 Mackrill\u2019s argument fails on two grounds. First, per our analysis under Issue 1, the defense of consent was not available to Mackrill in the first place. Second, Mackrill did not raise his due process claim in the District Court; and as a general rule, this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 22, \u00b6 12, 78 P.3d 850, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b648 An exception to this general rule is our common-law doctrine of plain error review. Under this doctrine, this Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">may discretionarily review a claimed error that implicates a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights-even if a timely objection was not made in the trial court, and notwithstanding the inapplicability of the criteria set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA-where failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 77, 342 Mont. 1, \u00b6 77,180 P.3d 1102, \u00b6 77 (citations omitted). We use our inherent power of common-law plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis, and only in the aforementioned circumstances. <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b649 Mackrill has failed to demonstrate that his due process claim meets the elements of plain error review. He simply states that the elements were satisfied, without any supporting analysis. This is utterly insufficient under M. R. App. P. 12(l)f. to present an issue to this Court. Accordingly, we will not consider this claim any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u00b650  We hold that the defense of consent is inapplicable to a charge of aggravated assault. We further hold that the District Court did not err or abuse its discretion in admitting testimony regarding Mackrill\u2019s conduct at the other bars on the night in question and the videotape of his post-arrest interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u00b651 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\"> <em>See e.g. Durr v.
