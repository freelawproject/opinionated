We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">\u00b62 Zier presents the following issue for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court properly determined that the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA) governed Zier\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">\u00b64 Zier began talking with accountant Pat Davison in 2002 about collaborating to open a new bank in Billings, Montana. Zier and Davison enlisted Beartooth\u2019s support in this endeavor. Zier entered into two nearly identical letter agreements with Beartooth. Zier signed the first agreement on March 17, 2003, and signed the second agreement four months later on July 1,2003. Tom Hancock signed the March agreement on behalf of Beartooth, and Pat Davison signed the July agreement on behalf of Beartooth.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">\u00b65 The agreements provided that Zier would become the president of Beartooth Bank upon the happening of two contingencies: (1) Beartooth obtaining a contingent charter from the Division of Banking; and (2) Beartooth receiving approval from the FDIC. The letter agreements also provided that Zier would receive a salary of $130,000 and benefits. The letter agreements further provided that Zier would receive annual salary increases. The letter agreements did not specify an end date.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">\u00b66 Zier left his position as president of another bank and began working for Beartooth in March 2003 before either of the contingencies had been met. Zier assisted Beartooth in its efforts to obtain the FDIC\u2019s approval and the Division of Banking\u2019s approval. He also assisted Beartooth in attracting investors. Beartooth paid Zier the salary and benefits provided by the agreements. Beartooth withheld taxes for Zier and Beartooth provided Zier with W-2 tax forms. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Beartooth board of directors terminated Zier on January 17,2005. The directors also did not offer Zier the position of bank president as contemplated by the letters of agreement. Beartooth had not yet obtained a charter from the Division of Banking and had not yet received FDIC approval by the time of Zier\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b67 Zier alleged that his termination constituted a material breach of Beartooth\u2019s contractual agreement to hire him as bank president as set forth in the letters of agreement. Beartooth moved for summary judgment. Beartooth argued that Zier\u2019s contract claim actually represented a claim for wrongful discharge under the WDEA. Beartooth asserted that the WDEA provided Zier\u2019s exclusive remedy and prohibited Zier\u2019s claim as Zier had exceeded the one-year statute of limitations provided in the WDEA. Zier countered that Beartooth never had hired him as bank president, and, therefore, could not discharge him. Zier argued that the District Court instead should have applied the eight-year statute of limitations for breach of a written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b68 Zier had testified in a deposition, however, that he had been Beartooth\u2019s employee between March 2003 and January 2005. Zier testified that he had received an annual salary of $130,000 and benefits, provided for under the letters of agreement, until January 2005. Zier testified that Beartooth had withheld taxes and had supplied him with W-2s. Zier also testified that he understood that Beartooth had terminated his employment when Beartooth\u2019s directors informed him in January 2005 that they would not offer Zier a new contract. The District Court relied upon this evidence to conclude that Zier had been an employee of Beartooth pursuant to the letter agreements until his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b69 The District Court determined that Zier\u2019s claim for relief constituted a wrongful discharge claim under the WDEA rather than a separate contract action. The WDEA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations required Zier to bring his claim within one year of the date of his termination on January 17,2005. Zier filed his complaint on February 27, 2006. The District Court concluded that the WDEA\u2019s statute of limitations barred his claims. Zier appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u00b610 We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. <em>Prosser v. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., </em>2008 MT 87, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 209, \u00b6 10,179 P.3d 1178, \u00b6 10. We use the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 10. Summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court properly determined that the WDEA governed Zier\u2019s claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b612 Zier argues that the District Court improperly applied the WDEA to a claim that he asserts arose only from the letters of agreement. Zier admits that he had performed services for Beartooth before the letters of agreement were to go into effect. Zier also admits that he thought he was an \u201cemployee\u201d at the time of his termination. Zier argues nevertheless that the effect of the letters of agreement should govern this issue. Zier maintains that, according to the terms of the letters of agreement, Beartooth never had hired him as the conditions upon which the letters of agreement were based had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b613 Zier cites <em>Kneeland v. Luzenac America, Inc., </em>1998 MT 136, 289 Mont. 201, 961 P.2d 725, for support of his contention that the WDEA could not govern his claim because Beartooth could not discharge him without first hiring him as bank president. <em>Kneeland </em>determined that the WDEA applies only where the employee has been discharged. <em>See Kneeland, </em>\u00b6 27 (citing <em>Beasley v. Semitool, Inc., </em>258 Mont. 258, 262, 853 P.2d 84, 86 (1993)). Zier also argues that his claim arises from a contract for hire similarly not covered by the WDEA according to <em>Kneeland\u2019s </em>determination that the WDEA does not bar claims arising from contracts for rehire. <em>See Kneeland, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28-30. Zier finally argues that the letters of agreement constituted a written contract for a specific term. The WDEA excludes claims arising from written employment contracts for a specific term. <em>Basta v. Crago, Inc., </em>280 Mont. 408, 412-13, 930 P.2d 78, 81 (1996) (citing \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"AiI\">\u00b614 We decline to address the substance of Zier\u2019s contractual claims, however, in light of the fact that Zier misplaces reliance upon the effectiveness of the letters of agreement. This Court long has recognized the rule that a plaintiff must allege and prove that a contingency or condition precedent has been met where the right of recovery depends upon its happening. <em>Binzel v. Viehmann, </em>111 Mont. 6,11,106 P.2d 187,189 (1940); <em>J.M. Broat Lumber Co. v. Van Houten, </em>66 Mont. 478, 480, 213 P. 1116, 1117 (1923). The Court also has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>determined that \u201c[a] party generally cannot be liable for a present breach for failure to perform under a contract if that party\u2019s obligation to perform is contingent on a condition precedent that has yet to occur.\u201d <em>Eschenbacher v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT 206, \u00b6 36, 306 Mont. 321, \u00b6 36,34 P.3d 87, \u00b6 36 (citing <em>Management, Inc. v. Mastersons, Inc., </em>189 Mont. 435, 440-41, 616 P.2d 356, 360 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b615  The letters of agreement expressly provided that they would not become effective until the occurrence of two events. First, Beartooth had to obtain a contingent charter from the Division of Banking. Second, Beartooth had to receive approval from the FDIC. Zier acknowledges that neither of these conditions had occurred at the time that Zier filed his complaint on February 24, 2006. Zier has not demonstrated why the District Court should have determined that Beartooth faced potential liability for breach of the letters of the agreement for failure to hire him as president when the conditions upon which the letters of agreement were based had not yet occurred. <em>Eschenbacher, </em>\u00b6 36. The District Court properly refused to consider Zier\u2019s claim under a contract theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b616 The WDEA provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful discharge. Section 39-2-902, MCA. The WDEA also explicitly preempts all common law remedies. It provides that \u201c \u2018no claim for discharge may arise from tort or express or implied contract.\u2019 <em>\u201dKulm v. Montana State University-Bozeman, </em>285 Mont. 328, 331, 948 P.2d 243, 245 (1997) (quoting \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA). The WDEA defines discharge as any termination of employment \u201cincluding resignation, elimination of the job, layoff for lack of work, failure to recall or rehire, and any other cutback in the number of employees....\u201d Section 39-2-903(2), MCA. The WDEA defines an employee as \u201ca person who works for another for hire,\u201d who is not an independent contractor. Section 39-2-903(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AIt\">\u00b617 The District Court determined that Zier qualified as an employee. He worked for Beartooth for hire; he received a salary and benefits; and he received W-2s from Beartooth. Section 39-2-903(3), MCA. Zier\u2019s claim for relief arose from termination of his employment with Beartooth. Zier alleged in his complaint that Beartooth wrongfully had refused to hire Zier as bank president when it discharged him from employment on January 17, 2005. Several exceptions to the WDEA exist. These exceptions include claims where the employee has not been discharged, <em>Kneeland, </em>\u00b6 27 <em>(citingBeasley, </em>258 Mont, at 262,853 P.2d at 86), and where the claim arises from a written employment contract for a specific term, <em>Basta, </em>280 Mont, at 412-13,930 P.2d at 81 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>(citing \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA). Zier has failed to demonstrate that either of these exceptions applied to his claim. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b618  The WDEA provided the exclusive remedy for Zier\u2019s claim. Zier failed to file his complaint within one year of the date of his discharge as required by \u00a7 39-2-911(1), MCA. The District Court correctly granted Beartooth\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b619 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b116-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
