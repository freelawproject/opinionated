We affirm, in part, and, reverse and remand, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u00b62 The County\u2019s appeal presents the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court properly exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the County\u2019s petition for judicial review?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court properly use a rank based minimum salary in calculating the Deputies\u2019 longevity pay rather than the department\u2019s minimum salary?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court correctly determine that the calculation of the deputy sheriffs\u2019 longevity pay includes the $2,000 supplement to the sheriffs\u2019 \u201cbase annual salary,\u201d found at \u00a7 7-4-2503(2)(b), MCA (2003)?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court properly conclude that the County\u2019s \u201crepeated violations\u201d entitled the Deputies to recover back wages and penalties over a three-year period under \u00a7 39-3-207(3), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court correctly increase the amount of the penalty owed by the County to the Deputies from fifty-five percent to 110 percent of wages owed?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">\u00b68 The Deputies filed petitions to recover wages, under \u00a7 39-3-207, MCA, with the Wage and Hour Unit (WHU) of the State of Montana\u2019s Department of Labor and Industry (Department). The Deputies alleged primarily that the County improperly had calculated the Deputies\u2019 salaries and longevity pay during the period between July 2001 and March 2004. The Department\u2019s hearing officer concluded that the County had failed to calculate salary and longevity pay properly, that the County had engaged in \u201crepeated violations,\u201d and that the County owed the Deputies a penalty of fifty-five percent of the wages due in addition to the withheld salary and longevity pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">\u00b69 The Deputies filed a petition for judicial review of the penalty and the hearing officer\u2019s longevity calculation. The County filed a cross-petition for review of the penalty, the \u201crepeated violations\u201d determination, and the longevity calculation. Neither party appealed the hearing officer\u2019s determination of the proper calculation of the Deputies\u2019 salaries. The District Court ruled in favor of the Deputies on all issues. The County appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">\n<em>Background of Sheriff and Deputy Sheriff Salary Calculations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ALg\">\u00b610 The sheriff has the authority to adjust the deputy sheriffs\u2019 compensation within a particular county according to a rank structure in that county. Section 7-4-2508(2)(b), MCA. The following percentages associate with each rank in Lewis and Clark County:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Investigator/Captain 90 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">Lieutenant/Probationary Investigator 88 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">Sergeant 86 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">Patrolman I 82 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">Patrolman II 78 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">Patrolman III 76 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">Patrolman Probationary 74 percent</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Generally, a sheriff is paid a base salary set by the county governing board, the statutory $2,000 salary supplement contained in \u00a7 7-4-2503(2)(b), MCA, longevity pay, and overtime compensation. The deputy sheriff is paid a rank based percentage of the combined sheriff s base salary and $2,000 supplement, plus longevity and overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">\u00b611 For many years, the Sheriffs Office of Lewis and Clark County and the Lewis and Clark County Sheriff Employee\u2019s Association (Association) had negotiated the longevity calculation as part of their collective bargaining agreement (Agreement). The Agreement covering the time between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2005, provides the relevant guidelines and expectations for hourly and longevity pay of most of the sheriffs deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">\u00b612 The County previously included the sheriffs $2,000 statutory salary supplement in the calculation of deputies\u2019 <em>salaries </em>from July 1, 1998 to June 30, 2001. After June 30, 2001, however, the $2,000 supplement disappeared from the calculation of the deputies\u2019 salaries. This omission by the County prompted some deputies to file for back wages and the corresponding difference in longevity pay for the period from July 1,2001, to June 30,2004. The County modified the deputies\u2019 salaries for the period from July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005, to include the sheriffs $2,000 supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">\u00b613 When the County modified the salaries to make up for the omission, it also revised the deputy longevity calculation. The County\u2019s Human Resources Department sent a memo to each claimant, announcing that it had changed its method of calculating deputy longevity and that it intended to apply the new method retroactively. The County previously had calculated deputy longevity using the minimum base annual salary correlating with the deputy\u2019s rank, but had <em>not </em>included the appropriate percentage of the sheriffs $2,000 salary supplement in the deputy\u2019s salary when calculating longevity. The County changed the deputy\u2019s longevity pay from being rank based to non-rank based.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u00b614 The County began calculating longevity by taking one percent of the lowest minimum base annual salary allowed under the statute (seventy-four percent) for each year in the department. This revision gave all deputies the probationary patrolman\u2019s rank (seventy-four percent of sheriffs salary) for purposes of computing the \u201cminimum base annual salary.\u201d The County also maintained that the sheriffs $2,000 salary supplement should not be included in the calculation of the deputies\u2019 salary for purposes of calculating longevity.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\n<em>Administrative Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b615 The first claimants, David Clouse and Lynn Michel, filed with the WHU on February 25, 2004, claims for wages and longevity pay improperly withheld by the County. Clouse and Michel claimed to have earned the pay between July 1,2001, and the dates of their respective retirements in 2003. Several other deputies filed claims between March and June 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b616 The WHU Compliance Specialist issued its Determination of several of the deputies\u2019 claims on June 23, 2004. The Compliance Specialist determined that the County owed the Deputies additional wages and longevity pay withheld for the two years before the County had notice of the claims. The Compliance Specialist also imposed the statutory penalty of fifty-five percent on the County, to be reduced to fifteen percent if the County paid the entire amount within the time specified by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b617 The Compliance Specialist rejected the County\u2019s view that Montana law requires that deputy longevity be calculated using only the minimum base annual salary in the sheriffs department, rather than the minimum base annual salary within the deputy\u2019s rank. The Compliance Specialist also disagreed with the County\u2019s assertion that the prior practice of paying the deputies\u2019 longevity according to rank had been a mistake. The Compliance Specialist noted that the law has established a required minimum amount, but recognized that \u201cthe law does not prohibit the County and the union from bargaining for a higher amount, which is what has been done for several years.\u201d The Compliance Specialist further took issue with the lack of support for the County\u2019s position that it could \u201cretroactively take credit on this longevity pay they contend was an overpayment and offset it against wages now found due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b618 The Compliance Specialist ultimately transferred for final resolution the 38 pending claims from the WHU to the Department\u2019s Hearings Bureau. The hearing officer held a scheduling conference on March 16,2005. The hearing officer also ordered the County to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>two individual claimants, Lamb and Bourassa, certain information by March 31,2005, necessary to calculate the wages to which they would be entitled. Deputy Lamb requested a default against the County on April 21, 2005, after the County had failed to provide the requested information. The County did not respond to Lamb\u2019s request for default or provide the information ordered before the hearing. The hearing officer denied the motion for default, but ordered the County to produce all relevant records at the hearing on May 19, 2005. The hearing officer established sanctions to be imposed for any failure by the County to produce records.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b619 The hearing officer issued a Final Agency Decision on October 3, 2005. The hearing officer determined that (1) the appropriate longevity formula should be one percent of the deputy sheriffs salary, including the $2,000 salary supplement, for every year of service that the deputy was with the department; (2) deputy sheriffs\u2019 salaries should be based on the entry-level percentage (seventy-four percent in Lewis and Clark County) for purposes of calculating longevity, rather than the percentage set by the individual deputy\u2019s rank as determined by the sheriff under \u00a7 7-4-2508, MCA; (3) the County had engaged in repeated violations, \u201cwith respect to the number of deputies who were improperly paid, with respect to the number of successive pay periods over several years, and with respect to the failure to properly calculate wages even when the County adjusted the pay;\u201d and (4) the County owed the Deputies a penalty of fifty-five percent of the wages due.</p>\n<p id=\"AzD\">\u00b620 The hearing officer\u2019s determination that the County had engaged in repeated violations triggered the County\u2019s liability for underpaid wages going back three years before the claims had been filed. The hearing officer further determined that the County should have adjusted for its mistake going back to July 1, 2001, the date when the County began calculating longevity without considering the $2,000 supplement to the sheriffs base salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\n<em>District Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b621 The Deputies filed a petition for judicial review of the Agency\u2019s determination regarding the longevity calculation. The County filed a cross-petition for judicial review on November 7, 2005. The Deputies moved to dismiss the County\u2019s cross-petition for failing to file the petition within the 30 days required by statute. The District Court initially granted the motion to dismiss the petition, but later issued an order amending the prior ruling to allow the County\u2019s petition to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u00b622 The District Court agreed with the hearing officer that the calculation of deputies\u2019 longevity pay should have included the $2,000 statutory supplement to the sheriff\u2019s base salary. The court disagreed with the hearing officer\u2019s determination, however, that \u00a7 7-4-2508, MCA, required the County to use the entry level percentage to calculate the Deputies\u2019 longevity pay. The court held that the hearing officer correctly had interpreted the phrase \u201crepeated violations\u201d found in \u00a7 39-3-207, MCA, to mean \u201cmore than once,\u201d and correctly determined that the County had engaged in \u201crepeated violations,\u201d that supported recovery for wages withheld within three years before the claim. Finally, the District Court concluded that the County should have been ordered to pay the Deputies a penalty of 110 percent, rather than fifty-five percent, due to the existence of special circumstances that warranted the higher penalty, pursuant to Admin. R. M. 24.16.7556 (2003). The County appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b623 This case arises from an appeal of an administrative agency\u2019s determination that the County owed the Deputies three years of backpay and penalties. We review the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law that it had subject matter jurisdiction to determine if its interpretation of law is correct. <em>Pickens v. </em>Shelton-Thompson, 2000 MT 131, \u00b6 7, 300 Mont. 16, \u00b6 7, 3 P.3d 603, \u00b6 7. \u201cA district court reviews an administrative decision in a contested case to determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the agency correctly interpreted the law.\u201d <em>Ostergren v. Department of Revenue, </em>2004 MT 30, \u00b6 11, 319 Mont. 405, \u00b6 11, 85 P.3d 738, \u00b6 11. We employ \u201cthe same standards when reviewing a district court\u2019s order affirming an administrative decision.\u201d <em>Ray v. Montana Tech of the Univer. of Montana, </em>2007 MT 21, \u00b6 24, 335 Mont. 367, \u00b6 24, 152 P.3d 122, \u00b6 24 (citing <em>Ostergren). </em>We review de novo the District Court\u2019s legal interpretations. <em>Pickens, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b624 <em>Did the District Court properly exercise jurisdiction over the County\u2019s petition for judicial review?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b625 Before we address the threshold question of whether the District Court properly exercised jurisdiction over the County\u2019s petition for judicial review, we must consider whether this argument is properly before this Court. The Deputies challenge the court\u2019s decision on a motion for reconsideration that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>over the County\u2019s petition for judicial review. The Deputies did not file an appeal or cross-appeal on this issue. The Deputies instead raise this challenge in their response brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b626 In defense of this action, they cite M. R. App. P. 2(a) (2005), which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">[u]pon appeal from a judgment in a civil case, the court may review the verdict or decision, and any intermediate order or decision excepted or objected to within the meaning of Rule 46 of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, which involves the merits, or necessarily affects the judgment, except a decision or order from which an appeal might have been taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The Deputies characterize the court\u2019s order on reconsideration regarding subject matter jurisdiction as an \u201cintermediate order\u201d involving the merits or necessarily affecting the judgment. The Deputies argue that upon final judgment, all nonappealable intermediate orders or decisions, to which there has been a proper objection, are reviewable on appeal from the final judgment, citing <em>Ruana v. Grigonis, </em>275 Mont. 441, 452, 913 P.2d 1247, 1254 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"AaZH\">\u00b627 The Deputies properly raised their objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction in the District Court. Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure 4(c) and 5(a)(3) (2005) provide, however, that the party raising an issue with an intermediate order or a final judgment must file a notice of appeal or cross-appeal. <em>See Colmore v. Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund, </em>2005 MT 239, \u00b6 39, 328 Mont. 441, \u00b6 39, 121 P.3d 1007, \u00b6 39. Montana Rule of Appellate Procedure 2(a) (2005) provides that, upon proper <em>appeal, </em>then and only then, may this Court review an intermediate order. The Deputies failed properly to appeal or cross-appeal the court\u2019s determination of jurisdiction upon the County\u2019s motion for reconsideration. This failure precludes the Court from reaching the merits of the Deputy\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction argument on the County\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b628 <em>Did the District Court properly use a rank based minimum salary in calculating the Deputies\u2019 longevity pay rather than the department\u2019s minimum salary?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b629 The County, like dozens of counties across Montana, negotiated its method of calculating longevity with the Association as part of the Agreement. Section 7-4-2510, MCA, leaves open to negotiation the meaning of \u201cminimum base annual salary.\u201d From 1991 to 2004, the deputies received one percent of their rank\u2019s <em>base salary </em>as longevity. The County unilaterally changed the method of calculation for sheriff s deputies\u2019 longevity in February 2004. As a result, all deputies received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>one percent of the salary of an entry level probationary patrolman in Lewis and Clark County. We address here only whether some provisions of \u00a7 7-4-2510, MCA, required the County to undertake the unilateral change in how it calculated longevity.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b630 The County amended the minimum base annual salary to reflect the lowest possible compensation percentage allowed under \u00a7 7-4-2508(2)(a), MCA, rather than to reflect each deputy\u2019s assigned rank within the department\u2019s rank structure. The Deputies suggest that, through this unilateral change after over twelve years of using the rank based method, the County sought to offset some back wages that it owed deputies for other reasons. The County defends this revision as reflecting the correct interpretation of \u00a7 7-4-2510, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b631 The legislature approved a longevity provision in 1981 to aid in the retention of experienced deputies in the sheriffs department:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">Sheriffs department-longevity payments. Beginning on the date of his first anniversary of employment with the department and adjusted annually, a deputy sheriff or undersheriff is entitled to receive a longevity payment amounting to 1 % of the minimum base annual salary for each year of service with the department, but years of service during any year in which the salary was set at the same level as the salary of the prior fiscal year may not be included in any calculation of longevity increases. This payment shall be made in equal monthly installments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Section 7-4-2510, MCA. If the legislature had intended to restrict the \u201cminimum base annual salary\u201d to the lowest percentage provided in the salary schedule, it could have made that intent explicit through an internal reference to the lowest applicable percentage found at \u00a7 7-4-2508(2)(a), MCA. The absence of this internal reference leads the Court to believe that the Legislature intended to allow counties to continue the practice of negotiating the assignment of base salaries and calculation of longevity based on rank as part of the collective bargaining process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b632 The County\u2019s decision to change unilaterally the percentage to seventy-four percent lowered the longevity pay for all deputies who were ranked above probationary patrolman. This change worked specifically against captains and lieutenants. This reduction and the County\u2019s rigid interpretation of \u201cminimum base annual salary\u201d defeats the purpose of longevity pay-to retain more experienced employees through an extra financial incentive.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\u00b633 To base the longevity calculation on seventy-four percent as the minimum base annual salary would result in the number of years that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>a deputy remains with the County constituting the only factor increasing longevity pay. To apply this seventy-four percent forward also would result in a promoted deputy seeing no increase in longevity arising from that promotion. This interpretation would defeat any incentive within the longevity pay program for a deputy to be promoted or to improve at the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b634 The County suggests that it relied on attorney general opinions that concluded that the smallest percentage allowed in a county would determine the minimum base annual salary. 39 Mont. Op. No. 82 Atty. Gen. (June 22, 1981). The County relies exclusively on a lone 1981 opinion that the \u201cminimum base annual salary\u201d for calculating longevity payments is the statutory minimum level for the county involved. 39 Mont. Op. No. 82 Atty. Gen. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b635 The attorney general opinion reasons that in the early stages of the legislative process, the provision referred to \u201c1% of <em>his </em>minimum base annual salary.\u201d 39 Mont. Op. No. 82 Atty. Gen. at 5 (emphasis added). The opinion surmises that the Legislature initially intended to require \u201ccalculations based on the specific salary level of each individual undersheriff or deputy sheriff.\u201d 39 Mont. Op. No. 82 Atty. Gen. at 5. The opinion notes, however, that a conference committee changed the modifying article to \u201cestablish the amount of payment as <em>\u20181% </em>of <em>the </em>minimum base annual salary.\u2019 \u201d 39 Mont. Op. No. 82 Atty. Gen. at 5 (emphasis added). The opinion concludes that the Legislature, through this change in the modifying article, \u201cintended to standardize the base figure for longevity payment calculations by statutorily setting that figure at the minimum permissible level for each county.\u201d 39 Mont. Op. No. 82 Atty. Gen. at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b636 The opinion overreaches where it gleans this changed intent through a substitution of \u201cthe\u201d for \u201chis\u201d as the modifying article. A change of \u201chis\u201d to \u201cthe\u201d could have been proposed for reasons other than standardizing the calculation of deputies\u2019 minimum base annual salaries. The Legislature simply may have been attempting to draft laws that were gender neutral. Future attorney general opinions unfortunately approached the issue of deputy sheriffs\u2019 longevity based upon the erroneous interpretation in the 1981 opinion. See, e.g., 43 Mont. Op. No. 44 Atty. Gen. at 6 (November 28,1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b637  Nothing on the statute\u2019s face prevents the County from calculating longevity using a \u201cminimum base annual salary\u201d gauged to the individual deputy\u2019s rank, rather than on the statutory minimum. The County unilaterally changed its definition of \u201cminimum base annual salary\u201d in 2004 to the more limited definition despite having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>negotiated a different definition of \u201cminimum base annual salary\u201d for the deputies as part of its Agreement. The County cannot rely on its erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 7-4-2510, MCA, to justify its unilateral departure from the terms of its Agreement with the Deputies. The District Court correctly calculated the base salary used for Deputies\u2019 longevity pay using the percentage of the sheriffs salary that each individual Deputy earned as the base salary of their respective rank, as originally negotiated in the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b638 Did the District Court correctly determine that the calculation of the deputy sheriffs\u2019 longevity pay includes the $2,000 supplement to the sheriffs\u2019 \u201cbase annual salary,\u201d found at \u00a7 7-4-2503(2)(b), MCA? \u00b639 The sheriffs salary contains two components: the amount established by the county governing board under \u00a7 7-4-2503(l)(a), MCA, and a statutory supplement under \u00a7 7-4-2503(2)(b), MCA. The statutory supplement has been $2,000 since 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b640 The County conceded during this dispute that the \u201csalary of that sheriff\u201d included the $2,000 supplement to the sheriff\u2019s base salary for purposes of calculating the Deputies\u2019 salaries. Section 7-4-2508(2)(a), MCA. The County argued, however, that the $2,000 did not belong in the sheriff s salary when calculating longevity pay for the sheriff <em>or </em>the Deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b641 The County contends that, when the law governing <em>sheriffs\u2019 </em>longevity went into effect, the Legislature sought to \u201cgive sheriffs the same longevity payment that deputy sheriffs currently receive.\u201d The law governing the calculation of sheriffs\u2019 longevity explicitly excludes the $2,000 supplement from the sheriffs\u2019 salary. Section 7-4-2503(2)(c), MCA. The County argues, therefore, that it also must exclude the $2,000 supplement from the sheriff\u2019s salary when calculating the deputies\u2019 longevity pay in order to calculate longevity in a uniform manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b642 We will not insert what the Legislature has omitted from a statute unless the result is contrary to the Legislature\u2019s clear intent. Section 1-2-101, MCA. No provision specifically excludes the sheriff\u2019s $2,000 statutory supplement from the definition of deputies\u2019 compensation or the definition of deputies\u2019 longevity. Section 7-4-2503(2)(c), MCA, by contrast, specifically excludes sheriff\u2019s longevity payment from the sheriff\u2019s salary for purposes of computing deputy sheriffs\u2019 compensation. If the Legislature likewise had wanted to exclude the $2,000 supplement from the sheriff\u2019s salary for purposes of computing deputy sheriffs\u2019 compensation or longevity, \u00a7\u00a7 7-4-2503(2)(c) and 7-4-2510, MCA, would have been the appropriate places. Instead, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>statute excludes only sheriffs\u2019 longevity payments from the calculation of the deputies\u2019 compensation. Section 7-4-2503(2)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b643 The County similarly contends that the deputies\u2019 \u201cminimum base annual salary\u201d represents a percentage of the sheriffs \u201cbase salary,\u201d set forth in \u00a7 7-4-2503(1), MCA, not the sheriffs actual salary that includes the $2,000 supplement contained in \u00a7 7-4-2503(2)(b), MCA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b644 Section 7-4-2508(2)(a), MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he sheriff shall fix the compensation of the deputy sheriff based upon a percentage of the <em>salary of that sheriff </em>according to the following schedule....\u201d (Emphasis added.) Nothing in that sentence suggests that the compensation of the Deputy should be based solely on the sheriffs \u201cbase salary.\u201d In fact, the statute refers only to basing compensation on the entire \u201csalary of that sheriff.\u201d Section 7-4-2508(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b645  Section 7-4-2510, MCA, requires that longevity should be one percent of the deputies\u2019 minimum base annual <em>salary. A </em>deputy\u2019s salary is achieved through the aforementioned calculation of compensation, based on the \u201csalary of that sheriff\u2019 referred to in \u00a7 7-4-2508(2)(a), MCA. Therefore, the Court must factor the $2,000 statutory supplement into the sheriffs salary in calculating deputies\u2019 longevity. We agree with the District Court that a deputy sheriffs salary represents a percentage of the \u201csalary of that sheriff.\u201d This salary includes the $2,000 supplement. Section 7-4-2503(2)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b646 <em>Did the District Court properly conclude that the County\u2019s \u201crepeated violations\u201d entitled the Deputies to recover back wages and penalties over a three-year period under \u00a7 39-3-207(3), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u00b647 The statutory wage and hour provisions entitle a successful claimant to recover past wages for the two years before their filing of a wage claim, or two years before their last day of employment. Section 39-3-207(2), MCA. If the employer has committed \u201crepeated violations,\u201d however, the statute allows a successful claimant to recover past wages for the three years before the filing of the claim. Section 39-3-207(3), MCA. The statute nowhere defines \u201crepeated violations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">\u00b648 The County argues that we should adopt the federal definition for \u201crepeated violations\u201d and apply it in Montana wage and hour cases rather than apply our plain meaning rule of statutory construction. The federal law provides that an employer\u2019s violation of minimum wage or overtime pay laws is \u201crepeated\u201d (1) where the employer has previously violated the law and received notice from a responsible official of such violation, or (2) where a court or other tribunal has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>made a finding that an employer has previously violated the law. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 578.3 (2006). The County contends that it did not commit repeated violations, as contemplated by \u00a7 39-3-207(3), MCA, between July 1, 2001 and February 14, 2004, because (1) no court ever had ordered that its payment of wages had been improper, and (2) the County had no independent knowledge from a responsible official that its payment of wages had been improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b649 The Deputies argue in favor of the plain meaning interpretation used by the Department\u2019s hearing officer as well as the District Court. The hearing officer distinguished between the function of Montana\u2019s wage and hour statutes and the federal wage claim statutes. The federal statute requires that any penalty imposed against the employer must be paid to the federal government rather than to the employees who have been shortchanged. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(c) (2003). The hearing officer stated, \u201cthe [Federal] regulation has no applicability to interpretation of Montana law, and to apply it here would violate the plain meaning rule of statutory construction.\u201d The District Court agreed: \u201cThe plain language of the statute does not require that an employer must be placed on notice of a violation before being subject to the longer recovery period, and neither the Department nor this Court can insert such a caveat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b650 To apply the meaning of \u201crepeated\u201d as used in the federal law would require additional language in the Montana statute to explain the implicit necessity of receiving advance notice of a violation from a responsible official, court, or tribunal. Our rule is simply to \u201cascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained [in statutes], and not insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted.\u201d <em>Sink v. School Dist. No. 6, </em>199 Mont. 352, 360, 649 P.2d 1263, 1267 (brackets in original, citation omitted). We instead infer from the unadorned use of \u201crepeated\u201d in the statute that the Legislature meant for its plain meaning to apply. <em>See State v. Martel, </em>273 Mont. 143,150, 902 P.2d 14, 19 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b651  We agree with the District Court that \u201crepeated violations\u201d means more than one violation. The County repeatedly violated the wage and hour statute. First, the County failed to calculate salary and longevity properly for more than one deputy. The County failed to correct the mistake after one pay period. And finally, the County failed to recalculate longevity correctly after its error had been brought to its attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u00b652 <em>Did the District Court correctly increase the penalty owed by the County to the Deputies from fifty-five percent to 110 percent of wages owed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b653 Montana law provides for a penalty to be assessed against an employer who fails to pay wages within ten days of when they become due. Section 39-3-204, MCA. This penalty generally represents fifty-five percent of the wages due, unless special circumstances warrant the imposition of a higher penalty up to 110 percent of wages due. Admin. R. M. 24.16.7566(1). The four special circumstances include the employer failing to provide information requested by the Department or not cooperating in the Department's investigation of the wage claim, and the employer previously having violated similar wage and hour statutes within three years before the date of filing of the wage claim. Admin. R. M. 24.16.7556. The Deputies argue that the County\u2019s conduct meets the criteria either for failing to provide information or previously having violated a similar wage and hour statute in December 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b654 The Department\u2019s final agency decision noted that gaps in the information provided by the County made it difficult to calculate accurately the amounts owed to the Deputies. The hearing officer imposed a fifty-five percent penalty on the County. The hearing officer imposed no sanctions despite having set a sanction schedule. We only can infer from the lack of analysis in the decision that the hearing officer determined that the County\u2019s actions did not rise to the level of employer misconduct contemplated by Admin. R. M. 24.16.7556. The hearing officer cited the absence of special circumstances in settling on a fifty-five percent penalty on wages, other than overtime, for the period of the claim. The District Court, by contrast, justified its decision to increase the penalty to 110 percent in light of the hearing officer\u2019s observation regarding the incomplete nature of the information provided by the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b655 The County argues against the imposition of any penalty because the County (1) is a government entity and (2) relied in good faith upon attorney general opinions of ambiguous statutes. The County argues, in the alternative, that if any penalty is proper, it should be set at fifty-five percent because the County complied with requests for information as best it could. The County claims that it had to dissect three different computer systems to locate the necessary information. The County points to staffing problems that exacerbated its difficulty in withdrawing all the requested information from the various computer systems. The County also asserts that the successful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>December 2003 longevity claim was not sufficiently similar to constitute a previous violation for purposes of enhancing the penalty percent to 110 percent. Admin. R. M. 24.16.7556.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b656 Firefighters argued in <em>Ruhr v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 201, \u00b6 32, 338 Mont. 402, \u00b6 32,168 P.3d 615, \u00b6 32, that the fact that the City had thrown away certain relevant payroll records supported the imposition of a penalty of 110 percent. We opted instead for a fifty-five percent penalty. <em>Ruhr, </em>\u00b6 33. We refused to impose the higher penalty in the absence of substantial credible evidence that the employer\u2019s records had been falsified or had been intentionally misleading. <em>Ruhr, </em>\u00b6 32. The same standard applies here. The Deputies must present substantial credible evidence that the County either failed to provide information requested by the Department or did not cooperate in the department's investigation of the wage claim. <em>Ruhr, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b657 We defer to the hearing officer\u2019s determination that no special circumstances existed. We must infer from the hearing officer\u2019s lack of statements to the contrary that the County reasonably attempted to comply with the hearing officer\u2019s directives in light of the complicating factors in retrieving the salary information posed by the three computer systems used by the County. Similar to <em>Ruhr, </em>no substantial credible evidence exists on which to impose the higher penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b658 We also have increased a penalty to 110 percent where the facts show that a successful wage claim had been brought against the employer within three years before filing. In <em>Reier Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. Reier, </em>2000 MT 120, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 299 Mont. 463, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 1 P.3d 940, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, the District Court made a finding, and the employer did not refute it, that the employer recently had been subject to at least three similar wage claims by other employees. Substantial evidence substantiated that fact. The District Court\u2019s failure to take judicial notice of the Admin. R. M. 24.16.7556, and its subsequent failure to apply the maximum penalty, did not prevent this Court from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"AGG\">\u00b659  The District Court in this case likewise increased the penalty from fifty-five percent to 110 percent, in part, upon noting the hearing officer\u2019s determination that the County had lost a similar, although not identical, wage claim in 2003. The County does not contest the fact that it had lost a previous wage claim. The County contests the extent to which the previous wage claim was similar to the claims at issue here. The Deputies failed to provide substantial credible evidence regarding the similarity of the previous wage claim. We will defer to the hearing officer without more evidence in the record substantiating the nature of the previous wage claim. We reverse the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>order to recalculate the penalty and determine that the fifty-five percent penalty was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b660 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order regarding jurisdiction, longevity, and \u201crepeated violations,\u201d but we reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of a 110 percent penalty. We instead remand to the District Court for imposition of the fifty-five percent penalty recommended by the hearing officer.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b245-7\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"Ag3\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u00b661 I concurred with Justice Rice\u2019s dissent in <em>Ruhr, </em>that the Department may not arbitrarily fix one of only three penalties. <em>Ruhr, </em>\u00b6 51 (Rice, J., dissenting). However, that decision of this Court is applicable precedent, and I am constrained by <em>stare decisis </em>to acquiesce. Thus, I sign the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b245-9\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AW8\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">\u00b662 I concur with the Court\u2019s holdings under Issues 1, 2, and 3 regarding the Deputies\u2019 salary calculations. However, I dissent from the Court\u2019s holdings under Issues 4 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">\u00b663 With respect to Issue 4, I disagree that the County engaged in \u201crepeated violations\u201d simply because its miscalculation of wages affected multiple deputies over the course of multiple pay periods. I believe the federal definition of \u201crepeated violations\u201d provides a persuasive basis for concluding that an employer should not receive additional punishment for failing to correct its violation unless it has been made aware of its violation through notice from a responsible official or pursuant to a previously adjudicated violation. Opinion, \u00b6 46; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 578.3 (2006). I see no reason to distinguish the federal rule on the ground that its penalties are to be paid to the government, while Montana requires that penalties be paid to the employees who have been shortchanged. This is a notice issue. Without knowledge that a violation is occurring, an employer should not receive an increased penalty for \u201crepeating\u201d that violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">\u00b664 Moreover, even under the Court\u2019s plain meaning approach to \u201crepeated violations,\u201d (\u00b6 49), I still do not agree that more than one violation occurred here. In my view, paying multiple employees an incorrect amount for a single period of time-be it one pay period or multiple pay periods-amounts to a single violation. As the County argues, to hold otherwise will lead to the absurd result that virtually all wage claims will involve \u201crepeated violations\u201d and will warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>recovery of penalties for the extended three-year period because the violations cover more than one consecutive pay period. We should be mindful that the employer will be assessed penalties in any event; the entire rationale for adding an additional year\u2019s worth of penalties is to punish those employers who consciously disregard our wage statutes, and to deter those employers who would try to get away with multiple, distinct violations. The County aptly points out that \u201c[i]f the employer does not have some official notice that it is paying [wages] in error, punishing that employer makes little sense.\u201d Indeed, an additional year of penalties will not deter an employer who is unaware it is doing something wrong. Whether we adopt the federal definition, or use a plain meaning approach to \u201crepeated violations,\u201d adding an additional year of penalties for a repeat violation accomplishes nothing if the employer is unaware that it violated our wage laws in the first place. \u00b665 Finally, under Issue 5, I reiterate my belief that the administrative rules setting penalty floors for wage violations are defective because they infringe upon and are in conflict with the broad discretion to impose penalties granted by \u00a7 39-3-206, MCA. I thus dissent to the Court\u2019s analysis under Issue 5 for the reasons set forth in my dissent in <em>Kuhr v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 201, \u00b6\u00b6 48-52, 338 Mont. 402, \u00b6\u00b6 48-52, 168 P.3d 615, \u00b6\u00b6 48-52. Although I would also reverse on this issue, I would remand to the District Court for imposition of the appropriate penalty pursuant to the discretion granted by the statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
