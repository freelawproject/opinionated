However, the actions which constituted conduct violations remained confidential under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement. The Billings Gazette (Gazette) sought a copy of her disciplinary file and the Commission on Practice (Commission) and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) refused to provide it. The Gazette sued in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, and the District Court held that it did not have jurisdiction over the matter. The Gazette appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">\u00b62 A restatement of the dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly decided it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">\u00b63 Moira D\u2019Alton was a deputy city attorney in Billings, Montana, until her employment was terminated in 2004. In October 2004, she began working as a Yellowstone County public defender. D\u2019Alton was formerly married to William D\u2019Alton, the intervenor in this case. Based on an alleged domestic assault incident, Mr. D\u2019Alton filed a civil suit against his former wife and the City of Billings in federal district court. This civil suit is unrelated to the case before us but is referenced to explain Mr. D\u2019Alton\u2019s status as intervenor. He seeks to obtain D\u2019Alton\u2019s disciplinary record for use in his federal civil action. Reference to \u201cthe Gazette\u201d in this Opinion will incorporate Mr. D\u2019Alton\u2019s claims as well.</p>\n<p id=\"ArR\">\u00b64 Complaints were filed against D\u2019Alton with the ODC in 2003 and 2004. In November 2005, D\u2019Alton filed a Conditional Admission and Affidavit of Consent with the Commission. The Commission conducted a private hearing for the purpose of obtaining information to aid in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>determination as to whether to recommend approval or rejection of her Admission. In March 2006, the Commission recommended that this Court approve D\u2019Alton\u2019s Admission. Subsequently, we approved the Admission, suspended D\u2019Alton\u2019s law license for thirty days, and publicly censured her, placing her on probation for two years. We articulated the rules of professional conduct that D\u2019Alton violated in our order but did not describe the specific actions that led to the censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b65 In April 2006, the Gazette requested from the ODC \u201cpublic documents\u201d relating to D\u2019Alton\u2019s discipline. Citing Rules 20 and 26 of the Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE or Rules), the ODC declined to provide D\u2019Alton\u2019s file. Shortly thereafter the Gazette requested the Commission\u2019s files on D\u2019Alton. Citing the same rules, the Commission also refused. In May 2006, the Gazette filed a Petition to Obtain Public Documents in the First Judicial District Court. The court concluded that it did not have the authority to order the Commission or the ODC to release documents that are protected by rules promulgated by the Montana Supreme Court under its constitutional authority. The Gazette filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b66 Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law which we review for correctness. <em>Boe v. Court Adm\u2019r for the Mon. Jud. Branch, </em>2007 MT 7, \u00b6 5, 335 Mont. 228, \u00b6 5, 150 P.3d 927, \u00b6 5 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court correctly decide it lacked subject matter jurisdiction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">\u00b68 While the parties argued the merits of their claims to the District Court and to this Court on appeal, we need not reiterate those arguments as we resolve this case on jurisdictional grounds. This matter involves the confidentiality of lawyer disciplinary proceedings before the Commission and the ODC. The applicable rules, in relevant part, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">RULE 20. ACCESS TO DISCIPLINARY INFORMATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">A. Confidentiality. All disciplinary proceedings which are prior in time to the filing of a formal complaint with the Clerk of the Supreme Court shall be confidential, except that the pendency, subject matter, and status of an investigation may be disclosed by Disciplinary Counsel if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-12\">(1) The respondent has waived confidentiality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>(2) The proceeding is based upon allegations that include either the conviction of a crime or reciprocal discipline;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">(3) The proceeding is based upon allegations that have become generally known to the public; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">(4) There is a need to notify another person or organization, including the Lawyers Fund for Client Protection Board or the Commission on Character and Fitness, in order to protect the public, the administration of justice, or the legal profession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">Upon the filing of a formal complaint, the Commission\u2019s entire file on the matter shall be subject to discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">RULE 26. DISCIPLINE BY CONSENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">D. Confidentiality. All tendered admission proceedings prior to entry of a consent discipline order shall be confidential and subject to the provisions of Rule 20 of these Rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\u00b69 Additionally, the preamble to the RLDE unequivocally states that the Montana Supreme Court \u201cpossesses original and exclusive jurisdiction and responsibility under Article VII, Section 2(3), of the 1972 Montana Constitution and the provisions of Chapter 61, Title 37, Montana Code Annotated, in addition to its inherent jurisdiction, in all matters involving... the conduct and disciplining of [persons admitted to practice law in Montana].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">\u00b610 We addressed a similar situation in Roe, in which Boe, a longtime judicial assistant for the district court in Billings appealed the Yellowstone County District Court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint challenging various provisions of the Montana Judicial Branch Personnel Plan (Plan). In anticipation of transferring all county judicial employees from across the State into State employees in July 2003, and at the behest of the Montana Legislature, the Montana Supreme Court developed and adopted the Plan to provide for job classification, pay, recruitment and selection, performance appraisal, training and promotion of statewide judicial branch employees. Upon adoption and implementation of the Plan, all county judicial employees were transferred to the Montana Judicial Branch. Boe challenged the Plan, claiming, among other things, that it contained inequities, was capricious and violated her equal protection and due process rights. The State, representing the Court Administrator\u2019s office, argued that the Supreme Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the Plan, and therefore the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The district court agreed and dismissed Boe\u2019s complaint. We affirmed, noting that we had accepted original jurisdiction over previous petitions filed seeking amendments to the Plan, and that we had \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over [the Plan] and a district court [could not] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>invalidate, modify, or replace any or all of it.\u201d <em>Boe, </em>\u00b6 10. We further stated that <em>Goetz v. Harrison </em>153 Mont. 403, 457 P.2d 911 (1969), supported this ruling. In <em>Goetz, </em>the Court unequivocally held that \u201cno Montana district judge has jurisdiction to sit in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana.\u201d <em>Boe, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b611  As in the case of the Montana Judicial Branch Personnel Plan, we have exclusive jurisdiction over lawyer discipline and the rules on how such discipline shall be dispensed. Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 2(3). In the current Rules, we have declared that certain procedures are confidential. The District Court does not have the authority to issue a contrary ruling. As we instructed in <em>Boe, </em>an original petition is necessary when rules or policies expressly adopted by this Court pursuant to our rule-making authority are subject to a direct challenge. <em>Boe, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b612  In <em>Boe, </em>we advised Boe that she could pursue her claim by filing an original petition in this Court. However, we cannot extend the same offer to the Gazette when it comes to D\u2019Alton\u2019s case. D\u2019Alton tendered her Admission pursuant to a duly authorized proceeding under our rules of disciplinary conduct. She did so in reliance upon the confidentiality provided for in the Rules. We cannot now declare D\u2019Alton\u2019s file open to the public. To do so would, in effect, be to revise our Rule and apply it retroactively to D\u2019Alton\u2019s disadvantage. While the constitutional provisions and statutes prohibiting ex post facto laws have not been applied to the attorney conduct rules adopted by this Court, the principles of fairness and notice associated with the prohibition nonetheless apply in this situation. <em>State v. Leistiko, </em>256 Mont. 32, 36-37, 844 P.2d 97, 100 (1992). Moreover, due process requires fundamental fairness of procedure which includes notice. <em>In re B.N.Y., </em>2003 MT 241, \u00b6 21, 317 Mont. 291, \u00b6 21, 77 P.3d 189, \u00b6 21; <em>In re A.F.-C., </em>2001 MT 283, \u00b6 50, 307 Mont. 358, \u00b6 50, 37 P.3d 724, \u00b6 50. D\u2019Alton was not put on notice that at some future time, under circumstances over which she had no control, her file could be opened to the public. To now issue such a ruling would be a violation of D\u2019Alton\u2019s entitlement to due and fair process.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u00b613 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing the Gazette\u2019s petition on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b411-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
