Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Additionally, Sneed has filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-24\">In counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, Sneed contends the district court erred in calculating his sentencing guidelines\u2019 range. As Sneed raised no objection below, we review this claim for plain error. <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 394 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 950, 122 S.Ct. 2643, 153 L.Ed.2d 821 (2002). We find no error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s calculation of Sneed\u2019s guidelines\u2019 range.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-25\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Sneed argues the district court erred in determining his base offense level and that his Speedy Trial rights were violated. We find these arguments to be without merit. Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm Sneed\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>ther review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
