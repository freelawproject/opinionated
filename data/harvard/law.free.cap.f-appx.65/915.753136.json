This court may grant a certificate of appealability only if the appellant makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). Where, as here, a district court dismisses a motion to vacate on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>tion states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debat-able whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Boyd has not satisfied either standard. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">We must construe Boyd\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief on appeal as an application to file a second or successive motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>\u2014 F.3d -, 2003 WL 1949822, at *7 (4th Cir. Apr.25, 2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a second motion to vacate, a movant must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable fact-finder would have found the movant guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), 2255118 (2000). Boyd\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, we decline to authorize Boyd to file a successive \u00a7 2255 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
