He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Although we find that mandamus relief is not warranted because the delay is not unreasonable, we deny the mandamus petition without prejudice to the filing of another mandamus petition if the district court does not act expeditiously. Odman has also moved to amend his mandamus petition to request an order directing the district court to compel the United States Attorney\u2019s office to begin an investigation of motions filed under Rule 35(b), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for certain of his co-defendants. We grant the motion to amend. However, this relief is not available by way of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
