We have reviewed the record and find that this appeal is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">The district court correctly found that Cuffee-Smith has no constitutional right to inmate trustee status. <em>See Rosson v. Weatherholtz, </em>405 F.Supp. 48, 49-50 (W.D.Va.1975); <em>see also Inmates, Washington Co. Jail v. England, </em>516 F.Supp. 132,141 (E.D.Tenn.1980). Thus, her claim that such a denial constitutes the deprivation of a liberty interest is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">Cuffee-Smith alleges that a hearing was held in her absence regarding the denial of her trustee status. To the extent that this is construed as a procedural due process argument, it is without merit. The United States Supreme Court held in <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), that only when the loss at issue constitutes the deprivation of a liberty interest, must there be procedural safeguards. Because the denial of trustee status does not constitute such a deprivation, such a claim is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">Lastly, Cuffee-Smith claims that she requested copies of inmate grievances and appeals from prison officials, but never received them. We find that this claim, too, is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Paine v. Baker, </em>595 F.2d 197, 200 (4th Cir.1979) (holding that state prisoners do not have a constitutional right to their prison files).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Accordingly, we deny Cuffee-Smith\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and dismiss the appeal as frivolous.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b949-13\"> On appeal, Cuffee-Smith asserts several additional claims relating to her confinement, including allegations of unsanitary living conditions, insect bites, hair loss, and denial of a shower, comb, and clean uniform prior to her trial. Absent exceptional circumstances, however, we will not consider claims raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993). Because Cuffee-Smith does not demonstrate extraordinary circumstances, we decline to address these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
