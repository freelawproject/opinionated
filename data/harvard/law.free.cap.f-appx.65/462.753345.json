Weaver claims that the district court erred in denying her motion for a directed verdict with respect to the negligence of Defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">A district court must direct a verdict if, without weighing the evidence or witness credibility, it determines that a reasonable jury could reach only one conclusion, or that a verdict in favor of the non-moving party would necessarily be based upon speculation and conjecture. <em>See Gairola v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Gen. Servs., </em>753 F.2d 1281, 1285 (4th Cir.1985). This court reviews a district court\u2019s judgment granting a directed verdict de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor. <em>See Austin v. Paramount Parks, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 715, 727 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-17\">South Carolina law provides that the driver of a vehicle who approaches a stop sign must halt and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. <em>See </em>S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 56-5-2330(b) (Law.Co-op.1991). However, \u201c[tjravelers on both the favored and unfavored highway must use ordinary care in keeping a proper lookout for vehicles approaching an intersection.\u201d <em>Cope v. Eckert, </em>284 S.C. 516, 327 S.E.2d 367, 369 (S.C.Ct.App.1985) (citing <em>Carter v. Beals, </em>248 S.C. 526, 151 S.E.2d 671 (S.C.1966)). In so interpreting \u00a7 56-5-2330, the South Carolina courts have recognized a shifting responsibility and duty to yield that applies to all drivers at intersecting roads. The driver on the unfavored road has the initial responsibility to stop and yield to traffic that \u201cconstitute^] an immediate hazard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, once he enters the intersection, any approaching traffic on the favored highway then has the duty to yield the right of way to that vehicle. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, Chambless stopped at the intersection, verified that no traffic was coming from his right, and proceeded lawfully into the intersection. Weaver corroborated this fact when she testified that Chambless\u2019 truck was \u201csticking out\u201d from the golf course entrance when she first observed it. (J.A. at 103). Once Chambless was in the intersection, Weaver was obligated to yield the right of way but failed to do so. Accordingly, the jury\u2019s verdict was not un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>reasonable or based on speculation and conjecture. We affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
