An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000) . In reviewing the denial of a claim on its merits, this Court may only grant a certificate of appealability if the appellant makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The relevant inquiry is whether \u201c \u2018reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-24\">Where the district court dismisses a claim solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the movant can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001) .</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Stieff has not made the requisite showing. We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
