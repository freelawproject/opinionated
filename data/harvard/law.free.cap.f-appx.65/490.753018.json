On appeal, Rice alleges that the district court erred by refusing to grant him a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3El.l(a) (2001), and by failing to grant his proferred jury instruction regarding the interstate commerce element of the crime. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">As he did in the district court, Rice argues that, to support the interstate commerce element of \u00a7 922, the Government must prove a present and substantial connection between the firearm and interstate commerce. We have rejected this claim. <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 138 (4th Cir.2001). Thus, Rice has failed to show that the district court committed prejudicial error by declining to give the jury an erroneous instruction. <em>See United States v. Fleschner, </em>98 F.3d 155, 158 (4th Cir.1996) (providing review standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Next, Rice alleges that, even though he pled not guilty and put the Government to the burden of a trial, he should have received a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3El.l(a). We do not find that the district court clearly erred in denying Rice the adjustment. <em>See United States v. Castner, </em>50 F.3d 1267, 1279 (4th Cir.1995) (providing review standard). Rice has failed to meet his burden of establishing by a preponderence of the evidence that he was entitled to the reduction. <em>See United States v. Urrego-Linares, </em>879 F.2d 1234, 1238-39 (4th Cir.1989); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 3E.1., comment. (n.2) (stating that, where a defendant has proceeded to trial, it is rare that a defendant would receive the adjustment, absent circumstances not present in the instant appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
