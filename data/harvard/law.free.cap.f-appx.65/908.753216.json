United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Mandamus relief is only available when there are no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>means by which the relief sought could be granted, <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987), and may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>In re Catawba Indian Tribe, </em>973 F.2d 1133, 1135 (4th Cir. 1992). The party seeking prohibition or mandamus relief carries the heavy burden of showing that he has no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires and that his entitlement to such relief is clear and indisputable. <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Graham fails to make such a showing because mandamus relief may not be used as a substitute for appeal. Because Graham may challenge the district court\u2019s adverse decision on appeal, we deny Graham\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis in this Court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
