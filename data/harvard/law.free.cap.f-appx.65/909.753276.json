In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>see United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 3582 proceeding is criminal in nature and ten-day appeal period applies). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-25\">The district court entered its order denying the motion for reduction of sentence on November 6, 2002; the ten-day appeal period expired on November 20, 2002. Jenkins filed his notice of appeal after the ten-day period expired but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Jenkins has shown ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>eusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
