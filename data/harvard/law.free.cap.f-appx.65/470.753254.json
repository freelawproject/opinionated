In No. 03-1057, he challenges the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Tillman v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1032, 1034 (4th Cir.1994). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Siegel v. Arlington County Dep\u2019t of Community Planning, </em>No. CA-02-902-A (E.D. Va. filed Dec. 2, 2003 <em>&amp; </em>entered Dec. 5, 2002; filed Jan. 23, 2003 &amp; entered Jan. 24, 2003). In No. 03-1220, Siegel appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to reconsider under Rule 60, Fed. R.Civ.P. We review denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion, <em>Werner v. Carbo, </em>731 F.2d 204, 206 (4th Cir.1984), and we find no such abuse here. We deny Siegel\u2019s motion to remand; we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
