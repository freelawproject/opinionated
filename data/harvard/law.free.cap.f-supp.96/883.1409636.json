As the statement of facts therein makes dear, Eastbound Conference Agreement No. 4490 \u2014 from its initial approval by the U.S. Maritime Commission on August 25, 1935, through subsequent amendments as approved by the Commission down to the present \u2014 has -provided for contract-non-contract rates, although the Conference has not availed itself generally of this power in the past. Agreement No. 7920-1, to which the Westbound Conference is a party, as approved by the Commission on August 24, 1948, similarly undertakes to authorize the use of contract-noncontract rates in the Westbound trade. On October 1, 1948, the defendant carriers sent notices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>to all known shippers in the North Atlantic trade that effective November 1, 1948, the exclusive patronage contract-noncontract rate system would be inaugurated; the contract rates were to be the then prevailing freight rates, but shippers who refused to enter into contracts to ship with the conference lines exclusively when those lines could provide transportation, were to be charged noncontract rates to be fixed by an arbitrary differential at a level 20% to 30% higher than the contract rates. On Isbrandtsen\u2019s motion, this court granted a temporary injunction, restraining the defendant carriers from instituting the exclusive patronage system, conditioned upon Isbrandtsen\u2019s diligent prosecution before the Maritime Commission of a complaint challenging the validity of these Conference agreements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b933-5\">Subsequently, Isbrandtsen filed a complaint with the Maritime Commission. The United States (by the Attorney General) and the Secretary of Agriculture intervened in support of the complaint. Evidence was taken before a trial examiner who made two reports. Before the Commission finally acted on these reports, it was abolished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b933-6\">Its successor, the Federal Maritime Board, thereafter made a decision and order on December 1, 1950, which will be found in 3 F.M.B. -, approving the contract-noncontract rate provisions of the conference agreements and dismissing Is-brandtsen\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b933-9\">Isbrandtsen then filed in this court an amended complaint, which referred to the Board\u2019s order and asked that it be enjoined. The United States (by the Attorney General) appeared, and the Secretary, of Agriculture was permitted to intervene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They argued in support of the injunction.

The plaintiff, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Agriculture contend that in no circumstances can a dual-rate provision (i. e., an exclusive patronage, or dual-rate, or contract-noncontract provision) in a conference agreement be valid under 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 812, Third.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We need not, and do not, decide whether or not that contention is sound.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the purposes of this decision, we shall assume that, as the Board contends, in some circumstances the Board may, pursuant to 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 814,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> approve a conference agreement containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>such a provision. For even so, we think that, on the record now before us, the dual-rate provision in each of these conference agreements is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">2. In effect, the Board\u2019s position is that such a provision may be authorized under Sec. 814 unless the Board finds that it is \u201cunjustly discriminatory or unfair as between carriers, shippers, exporters, importers, or ports\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the Board has made a finding, and the evidence before the Examiner shows that the announced contract and noncontract rates of the conference carriers, acting pursuant to the dual-rate provisions of the conference agreements, were such that the spread between those rates was arbitrary. The conference carriers thus interpreted the dual-rate provisions of the conference agreements as authorizing such an arbitrary spread, and the Board held valid the dual-rate provisions thus interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">The effect of the Board\u2019s order is to approve the dual-rate provisions which permit unreasonable spreads between the contract and non contract rates. We hold such dual-rate provisions to be unlawfully discriminatory between shippers, and we therefore set aside the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">3. In Swayne &amp; Hoyt Ltd. v. United States, 300 U.S. 297, 303, 57 S.Ct. 478, 481, 81 L.Ed. 659, the Court said that a differential, pursuant to a conference agreement, between contract and noncontract rates was \u201cprima facie discriminatory since the two rates were charged for identical services and facilities * * <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the Board, in justifying its decision, refers to decisions of its predecessors,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>well to note that in Rawleigh v. Stoomvart, 1 U.S.S.B. 285, 293, the Shipping Board said that a contract-noncontract clause in a conference agreement would violate the statute \u201cwhere the spread is such in amount as to constitute unlawfulness.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">4. Here, then, the complainant, before the Board, made out a case of unlawful discrimination by presenting the agreements containing the dual-rate provisions together with proof of the unreasonableness of the spread between the announced contract and iioncontract rates. For a witness called by the carriers, Andrews, Secretary since 1935 of one of the two Conferences,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> testified on cross-examination, that \u201cgenerally the non-contract rates were fixed at a differential of approximately 20% above the contract rates\u201d and that: \u201cI don\u2019t think the making of rates by differential is a proper basis, for that is an arbitrary 'basis.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No evidence was offered contradicting this statement of the arbitrary nature of the differential.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-17\">The trial examiner made an initial report to the effect that the dual-rate provisions were not illegal per se. After receiving this report, the Commission (later superseded by the Board) issued a supplemental order returning the case to the examiner with directions to make findings as to whether the exclusive-contract provisions of this case \u201c(1) are unjustly discriminatory or unfair as between * * * shippers, or (2) operate to the detriment of the commerce of the United States, or (3) are in violation of the provisions of the Shipping Act. * * The order also directed the examiner to rule upon the proposed findings of fact submitted by the complainant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-20\">The examiner in his second report, pursuant to this order, found, as proposed by complainant, that the noncontract rates \u201cwere fixed by means of an arbitrary differential at a level 20% to 30% higher than the currently existing scale.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (As the testimony quoted in footnote 10 shows, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>announced contract rates were fixed by-adopting that scale.) The Board did not in precise terms adopt this finding. But, in oral argument before the court, counsel for the Board construed its decision as accepting the examiner\u2019s findings in so far as they were not inconsistent with its own report. There is nothing in the Board\u2019s report inconsistent with this finding of the examiner.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the Board made this finding its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">It should be added that, according to the evidence, the Conferences propose to offer contract rates to the federal government and its agencies, which ship by the conference carriers many tons of commodities, without requiring those shippers, \u25a0 as distinguished from private shippers, to sign exclusive patronage contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">5. We have, then, a specific (hiding, supported by the evidence, of a \u201cconstitutive\u201d or \"pivotal\u201d or \u201cbasic\u201d fact, i. e., that the spread between the rates announced, in accordance with the dual-rate provisions, was arbitrarily determined.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This specific -finding is inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>the Board\u2019s finding, as an \u201cultimate\u201d fact and in the very words of the statute, that the \u201cdual rate system * * * is not unjustly discriminatory or unfair as between * * * shippers.\u201d That latter finding, since it cannot be rationally inferred in the face of the specific finding of a \u201cbasic\u201d fact, cannot stand up.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Dual-rate provisions which authorize arbitrary differentials are obviously not reasonable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For arbitrary conduct means unreasoned or unreasonable conduct, i. e., without reference to an adequate determining principle or standard;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and unreasonable discrimination is the equivalent of \u201cunjust\u201d discrimination.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Consequently, here the rates proposed to be charged shippers who do not sign contracts are unreasonably, and therefore unjustly, discriminatory; and the dual-rate provisions which permit such rates are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-17\">6. The Board\u2019s predecessors in some of their decisions have said that the validity of a dual-rate provision in a conference agreement is a question which must be determined by the facts in each case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It may be urged, however, that some of those decisions contain intimations that sufficient facts exist to validate such a provision, as part of a conference agreement, if it appears merely that any carrier may join the conference and that the dual-rate provision will create \u201cstability\u201d by tending to drive competing non-conference carriers into the conference or out of business.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is by no means clear that such administrative interpretations, even if un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>ambiguous, uniform and consistent, would be tenable, in the light of the provision in Sec. 814 as to unjustly discriminating provisions in conference agreements.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But we need not deal with that question. For (perhaps due to the way in which the statutory powers have been frequently shifted from one agency to another) the decisions of the Board (none of which approving a dual-rate provision has heretofore come to court) have lacked uniformity and consistency ;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and, in such circumstances, ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>ministrative interpretations have little weight.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">What is even more to the point, in each of the cases in which such intimations occurred, there was absent any specific finding, such as we have here, that the spread between the contract and noncontract rates, permitted by the dual-rate provisions, was arbitrary. As previously noted, in Rawleigh v. Stoomvart, 1 U.S.S.B. 285, the Shipping Board said that a dual-rate provision in a conference agreement is invalid if it authorizes a spread which is unlawful. In no subsequent decision by the Board, or by any of its predecessors, has that ruling been rejected. In the Rawleigh case, however, the Shipping Board sustained such a provision without considering the spread. But it did so only because, as the Board\u2019s opinion, 1 U.S.S.B. at page 288 discloses, there the complainant had explicitly stated: \u201cThe question of rates from our viewpoint * * *, or the spread between them, is entirely immaterial and outside the scope of this proceeding.\u201d For that reason, the Board held, 1 U.S.S.B. at pages 288, 293 that that particular proceeding \u201cdoes not present for determination anything other than the lawfulness in the trade concerned of the contract-noncontract rate practice itself, apart from and independent of any factor of quantum of spread,\u201d and \u201cinvolves no issue respecting anything other than the lawfulness of the contract rate practice per se.\u201d But the instant case is in that respect clearly distinguishable: Here the complainant proved before the Board that the spread was not reasonable; the Board, by its supplemental order, directed the examiner to rule upon findings of fact proposed by the complainant; the examiner, in conformity with that direction, explicitly found that the differential between the rates was arbitrary; and the Board has adopted that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\"> 7. It might conceivably be suggested that, nevertheless, the Board properly ignored the unreasonableness of the spread, authorized by the dual-rate provisions, because plaintiff, before the Board, attacked the dual-rate provisions not for such unreasonableness, but on the sole ground that they are unlawful per se under Sec. 812, Third. However, plaintiff, before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>the Board, did inject the issue of the authorized spread hy requesting the finding as to the arbitrariness of the differential.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">There is this further consideration. In United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard S. S. Co., 2 Cir., 50 F.2d 83, 89, the court, interpreting Sec. 814, said: \u201cThe Board shall approve such agreements as it does not find \u2018to be unjustly discriminatory or unfair.\u2019 \u201d In oral argument before us, counsel for the Board sfeemed to suggest a different interpretation, i. e., that at least in initially approving a conference agreement under Sec. 814, the Board has no obligation whatever to inquire into unjust or unfair discrimination; need make no finding on that score; and, only if it does choose to inquire and also does choose to find unjust or unfair discrimination, need it disapprove or modify the agreement on that ground. This is a somewhat surprising contention, to be contrasted with the following views of 'Commissioner Aitchison of the Interstate Commerce Commission concerning the obligations of administrative agencies: \u201cThey are not expected merely to call balls and strikes, or to weigh the evidence submitted by the parties and let the scales tip as they will. The agency does not do its duty when it merely decides upon a poor or nonrepresentative record. As the sole representative of the public, which is a third party in these proceedings, the agency owes the duty to investigate all the pertinent facts, and to see that they are adduced when the parties have not put theim in * * *. The agency must always act uppn the record made, and if that is not sufficient, it should see the record is supplemented before it acts. It must always preserve the elements of fair play, but it is not fair play for .it to create an injustice, instead of remedying one, iby omitting to inform itself and by acting ignorantly when intelligent action is possible * * *.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">Even if, however, the interpretation seemingly suggested by the Board\u2019s counsel were correct, it would have no pertinence in this case. For it seems plain that here the Board, in a complaint proceeding under 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 821, having actually found the authorized spread arbitrary, had the duty, of its own motion, to hold the dual-rate provisions unlawful, because they authorize such a spread. See Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. United States, D.C., 22 F. Supp. 533, 537 (per Judge L. Hand).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">Nor can it be sucessfully maintained that plaintiff\u2019s complaint, in this court, is not broad enough to support our decision.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">8. Were it urged that the complainant, as a carrier, has no standing to complain of unlawful discrimination' between shippers, the short answer (all else aside) would be that the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Agriculture, an intervenor in the Board\u2019s proceeding, is itself a shipper, and spoke for many other shippers of agricultural commodities. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, <em>7 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1622(j), authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture \u201cTo assist in improving transportation services and facilities and in obtaining equitable and reasonable transportation rates and services and adequate transportation facilities for agricultural products and farm supplies by making complaint or petition to * * * the Maritime Commission * * * with respect to rates, charges, tariffs, practices, and services * * An expert of the Department of Agriculture gave testimony before the examiner showing the movement of 1,027,253 tons of a wide range of agricultural commodities in the trade here involved, from July 1, 1947, to June 30, 1948; and that, for the shipments on which the ocean rates on the commodities were named in cents per one hundred pounds, freight charges of $5,323,778.50, based on the Conferences\u2019 present rates or proposed exclusive patronage contract rates would be assessed as against $6,406,671.50, based on their proposed higher noncontract rates, or a difference of $1,082,893. This tonnage represents approximately 10 percent of the total products of agriculture exported annually.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">9. It has been argued that, .since the dual-rate provisions authorize an arbitrary spread and are thus unjustly discriminatory, they also fall foul of the third subdivision of Sec. 812, prohibiting retaliation by a carrier because a shipper has \u201cpatronized any other carrier\u201d. But, for reasons previously canvassed, we think it unnecessary to decide that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">10. To summarize: The conference carriers, acting pursuant to the dual-rate provisions, proposed to put into effect contract and noncontract rates with a spread between the two, which spread the Board found to be arbitrary. We decide that the dual-rate provisions, since they permit an arbitrary spread, are invalid. Our order will therefore provide that the Board\u2019s order 'be set aside, and that the defendants be enjoined from acting pursuant to the dual-rate provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">The motions to dismiss are denied. A final injunction will issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">This opinion is hereby substituted for this court\u2019s earlier opinion, dated January 25, 1951, which is hereby recalled and vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">Appendix by Judge FRANK</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">The briefs and oral arguments were devoted principally to contentions concerning the meaning and applicability of 46 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 812(3),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> but the court has reached its decision without reference to that subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">I deem it desirable, however, to set forth, in this appendix, the arguments, pro and con, as to that subsection, which were advanced by the parties before this court or which occurred to any members of this court, but <em>zmthout expressing an opinion as to the cogency of those arguments. </em>See W. R. Grace Co. v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 2 Cir., 154 F.2d 271, 282-285, for a previous use of such an appendix. My colleagues, Judges RYAN and KAUFMAN, regard such an appendix as superfluous and undesirable. I therefore take the sole responsibility for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">1. The Board argues that Sec. 812(3) must be read in the light of the paramount purpose of Sec. 814. The Board maintains that Sec. 814 authorizes carriers to enter into a conference agreement (a) which obliterates competition -in rates among those carriers who become parties to the agreement and (b) which also contains provisions having the effect ,or tend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>ency of destroying outside competition, i. e., competition between (1) the conference carriers as a group and (2) independent carriers, by forcing the independents either to join the conference or (sooner or later) to go out of business. In other words, Congress in Sec. 814 authorized combinations which can coerce all carriers (in any given trade) into accepting noncompetitive rates.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">In support of this interpretation, there is cited the language of Sec. 814 that carriers\u2019 agreements may provide for \u201cdestroying competition,\u201d and exempting those making such agreements from the antitrust laws. It is then argued that an interpretation of Sec. 812 which would deny a conference the use of any devices whatever that destroy rate competition by independent carriers would nullify the intent of Sec. 814. Accordingly, as exclusive patronage contracts with shippers help to carry out that intent, Sec. 812(3) must be construed as not forbidding a conference to use such contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">2. The following answers to these arguments have been urged:</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Repeals by implication of statutes \u2014 especially of the anti-trust laws \u2014 are not favored. See U. S. v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 198-199, 60 S.Ct. 182, 188, 84 L.Ed. 181.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The purpose of Sec. 814 was merely to exempt from the anti-trust laws agreements destroying, or substantially reducing, competition among those carriers who choose to join a conference. The first three subdivisions of Sec. 812 were intended (inter alia) to prohibit the use of all methods which would coerce an independent carrier, under threat of financial ruin, to become a member of a conference, thereby destroying rate competition between (1) independents and (2) the conference, to the grave injury of American shippers. This appears from the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">Section 812(1) forbids \u201cdeferred rebates\u201d; Sec. 812(2) forbids \u201cfighting ships\u201d to be used \u201cfor the purpose of excluding, preventing, or reducing competition by driving another carrier out of said trade\u201d; Sec. 812(3) forbids any carrier to \u201cretaliate\u201d against any shipper either \u201cby refusing, or threatening to refuse, space accommodations when such are available, or resort to other discriminating or unfair methods, because such shipper has patronized any other carrier * * Since the admitted tendency or effect of exclusive patronage contracts is fully as deadly as deferred rebates or fighting ships in wiping out competition between a conference and independents, Congress could not have intended to authorize a conference to use such contracts. The Board\u2019s interpretation of Sec. 812(3) would poke a wide hole in the dike erected by Congress against the creation of cartels free of outside competition. That interpretation would work a repeal, by mere implication, of the anti-trust laws, far beyond the express and limited repeal contained in Sec. 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">Competition is cherished by the common law (and safeguarded 'by the anti-trust laws) in large part for the purpose of protecting consumers from unreasonably high prices or rates likely to result from monopoly or unreasonable restraint of trade. Therefore, whenever any of our governments has, by statute, insulated anyone from all competition in the same industry\u2014 as, for example, by a grant of an exclusive franchise \u2014 it has coupled the grant with the establishment \u2014 as a substitute for competition as a price-regulator \u2014 of a governmental agency empowered to fix reasonable maximum prices or rates. A legally sanctioned complete monopoly, minus such regulation, is virtually unprecedented.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-16\">This traditional policy of rate regulation was fully recognized by the House Committee which in 1914, in the so-called Alexander Report,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> made recommendations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>that led to the Shipping Act of 1916. That Report (pp. 420-421) recommended that the Interstate Commerce Commission he authorized to investigate the rates of all carriers, including those in foreign commerce, and to order their \u201crates changed if convinced that the rate under consideration is unreasonably high.\u201d The Report explained this recommendation by saying that \u201cthe Committee feels that in the absence of governmental control steamship combinations may in many instances have it within their power to arbitrarily raise rates to an unreasonable degree both as regards the general level and in the case of particular commodities * * *. (The) purpose of the law should be to protect the shipper against any unreasonably high rate wich the combination lines may have within their power, by virtue of their agreements and conference arrangements, arbitrarily to impose in the absence of government supervision and control.\u201d Congress partly accepted this recommendation, in Sec. 817, by there giving the Shipping Board (now the Federal Maritime Board) the express power to order just and reasonable maximum rates with respect to interstate water-carriers. But Congress omitted any such provision as to carriers in foreign commerce; as to such carriers, there is only the statutory power to forbid discrimination in rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Congress could not have intended to authorize such cartels, engaged in foreign commerce, as the Board here has attempted to approve. For the evidence shows that the conference agreements here involved provide that the rates named in the agreements cannot 'be changed \u2014 up or down\u2014 without the consent of every single member of the conferences; and a considerable majority of the members are foreign-owned carriers. If the exclusive patronage provisions were valid, and if they effectively achieved their purpose of putting out of business all carriers who refuse to join the conferences, then, with no governmental agency having power to impose maximum rates, American shippers would be entirely at the mercy of foreign-owned carriers, which could maintain rates no matter how unreasonably high.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Sections 812(3) and 814, it is said, must be read against this background. Section 814 provides that the Board is not to approve a conference agreement \u201cin violation of this Act,\u201d and, of course, Sec. 812(3) is part of the Act. Stress is laid upon the fact that the word \u201cdiscriminating\u201d in Sec. 812(3) is unqualified by any adjective, and that this is in striking contrast with (a) Sec. 812(4), which speaks of \u201cany unfair or unjustly discriminatory contract\u201d, (b) Sec. 814 which uses the words \u201cunjustly discriminatory,\u201d (c) Sec. 815 which contains the phrase \u201cundue or unreasonable preference or advantage * * * or * * prejudice or disadvantage\u201d, and (d) Sec. 816 where \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d is preceded by \u201cunjustly\u201d. Consequently, Sec. 812(3) forbids any carrier to resort to any discrimination whatever \u2014 whether or not \u201cunjust\u201d or \u201cundue\u201d or \u201cunreasonable\u201d \u2014 as against a shipper for patronizing another carrier. Wherefore, exclusive patronage contracts are unlawful per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">See Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. United States, DC., 22 F.Supp. 533, 538, where Judge Learned Hand said: \u201cSubdivision 1, as amended, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3(1), generally forbids a carrier to discriminate unduly or unreasonably in any way between one person, \u2018locality, port, port district, gateway, transit point\u2019 and another. It does not, and could not, impose a peremptory prohibition in such cases; the discrimination must be \u2018undue or unreasonable\u2019; discriminations are not per se unlawful, their occasion must be examined. That is not true of discrim-inations under subdivision three, which <em>is </em>peremptory, and admits no excuses; carriers must not discriminate in rates between connecting lines.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> See also Hocking-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Valley R.

For then it would confer upon a conference, a private cartel, the power to exclude an independent carrier from trade unless the independent joins the conference and accepts its terms; this would be the equivalent of granting a private cartel the power to issue certificates of convenience and necessity, with no statutory criteria to guide their issuance. The statute so construed would, at least, verge on unconstitutionality. A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 537, 55 S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570; cf. Fashion Organizators\u2019 Guild of America v. Federal Trade Comm., 312 U.S. 457, 465, 61 S.Ct. 703, 85 L.Ed. 949. Such an interpretation should, if possible, be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">3. To these arguments, the Board replies thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">(a) The Board has power to prescribe maximum reasonable rates for conferences of carriers engaged in foreign commerce. For, under Sec. 814, the Board may disapprove, cancel or modify any conference agreement if the Board finds the agreement \u201cto operate to the detriment of the commerce of the United States.\u201d The Board\u2019s predecessors \u2014 once in 1935 and twice in 1939 \u2014 have stated, in opinions, that this language confers power to withdraw approval of conference agreements among carriers engaged in foreign commerce, upon a showing that a conference rate is unreasonably high, since such a rate is detrimental to the commerce of the United States.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">(b) If Sec. 812(3) applies at all to conference agreements, the word \u201cdiscriminating\u201d in that section must be read as \u201cunjustly discriminating,\u201d in order to harmonize it with Sec. 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>(c) But Sec. 812(3) is inapplicable to agreements under Sec. 814. For Sec. 814 authorizes agreements \u201cgiving * * * special rates\u201d. Moreover, while Sec. 812 (1) forbids \u201cdeferred rebates,\u201d including those by a \u201ccombination,\u201d and Sec. 812(2) prohibits the use of a \u201cfighting ship either separately or in conjunction with any other carrier,\u201d Sec. 812(3) does not similarly refer to joint action.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">(d) In any event, the word \u201cretaliate\u201d in Sec. 812(3) means solely conduct that penalizes a shipper for past conduct in patronizing another carrier. The word must be read in the light of Menacho v. Ward, C.C., 1886, 27 F. 529, which held illegal increased rates to shippers because they had previously shipped by a competing carrier. Section 812(3) is a codification of the ruling in that case. Moreover, the non-contract rate here is not a retaliation, since it is charged a shipper who does not sign a contract, regardless of whether or not he patronizes an independent carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">(e) Although the Alexander Report recognized the then prevailing use of \u201cdeferred rebates\u201d and of \u201cfighting ships\u201d, as well as of exclusive patronage contracts, nevertheless the Report recommended the prohibition of the first two practices but did not recommend prohibition of such contracts. Congress adopted the Board\u2019s recommendations. Therefore, Sec. 812(3) was not intended to forbid such contracts. In a footnote to Swayne &amp; Hoyt Ltd. v. United States, 300 U.S. 297, 307, 57 S.Ct. 478, 81 L.Ed. 659, the Court referred to the Alexander Report as recognizing that conference agreements providing for such contracts might, in some circumstances, be valid.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">(f) The dual-rate system is not the equivalent of giving the conferences power to issue certificates of convenience and necessity. There is, said the Board in its opinion here, \u201c * * * no evidence that the dual-rate system * * * will * * * effectively cause the exclusion of an independent carrier from any trade route on which he wishes to operate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">4. The following are suggested answers to the Board\u2019s contention summarized in point 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b945-17\">(a) The words \u201cdetriment of the commerce of the United States\u201d in Sec. 814 are far too vague to empower the Board to establish reasonable maximum rates for foreign commerce conferences, since those words are in significant contrast with the very specific provision, as to maximum rates of interstate carriers in Sec. 817, which was enacted at the same time as Sec. 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-18\">The statements, in the cited cases, by the Board\u2019s predecessors, that Sec. 814 confers powers to fix foreign commerce conference maximum rates, were but dicta, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>since in those cases the Board did not exercise that power. Nor, in the thirty-four years (1916-1950) since the statute was enacted, has the Board ever attempted to fix such maximum rates.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">\u25a0Counsel for the conference carriers said, in oral argument, that it would never be feasible for the Board to disapprove of foreign commerce conference agreements, when tendered to the Board for approval, on account of unreasonably high rates, because a Board investigation, conducted at that time, into the reasonableness of such rates would be fruitless, and would preclude approval, as conditions affecting rates in foreign commerce fluctuate rapidly. He intimated that the Board could subsequently modify or abrogate such a conference \u25a0agreement, previously approved, because of unreasonably high rates. But he did not explain why, since conditions would then also be fluctuating, it would then be more feasible for the Board to investigate and fix reasonable maximum rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">A recent Report by a Senate Sub-Committee<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> states: \u201cRates in the foreign trade cannot be subject to the direct control of the Government. They are set through the medium of conference agreements between the American and foreign operators in each particular service; \u201d and adds that \u201cdiscipline in the matter of rates\u201d in foreign commerce \u201cwas nearly impossible by our government\u201d and that only \u201cconference discipline\u201d \u2014 i. e., concurrence by members of the conferences \u2014 can keep rates reasonable. There is, then, no efficacious governmental power to compel reasonable rates in the case of foreign-trade conference carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">(b) Section 812(3) does apply to joint action, since Sec. 812 begins with a clause relating to what a carrier does \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d. In Pacific Forest Industries v. Blue Star Line, Ltd., 2 U.S.M.C. 54, 57, the Maritime Commission said: \u201cThere is testimony to the effect that the conference threatened to deny complainant space unless it agreed to the increased rates. This is denied by conference witnesses. Such retaliation would be a misdemeanor under the act for which a severe penalty is provided.\u201d Thus the Board\u2019s predecessor recognized that Sec. 812(3) applies to a conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">(c) The authorization in Sec. 814 of provisions for \u201cspecial rates\u201d does not sanction such rates if used to penalize a shipper for patronizing another carrier, for that practice is explicitly made unlawful in Sec. 812(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">(d) \u201cRetaliate\u201d in Sec. 812(3) does nst relate exclusively to conduct penalizing past acts of a shipper: The lex talionis served as a warning of the consequences of future misdeeds. \u201cRetaliatory statutes\u201d look to the future.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> So, too, does Sec. 812(3) in the phrase \u201cthreatening to refuse\u201d. There is no basis for the assertion that Sec. 812 (3) 'was intended merely to \u201ccodify\u201d Men-acho v. Ward, C.C., 27 F. 529.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">Answering the Board\u2019s argument that there is here no retaliation since the non-contract rate is charged a shipper who does not sign a contract, regardless of whether or not he patronized an independent carrier, it is noted that the higher rate is charged a shipper who does sign a contract and who then patronizes an independent: in such a situation the higher rate is exacted for the shipper\u2019s conduct which is past conduct at the time of such exaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">(e) The Alexander Report did not approve exclusive patronage contracts. Referring to \u201cdeferred rebate systems\u201d as \u201cobjectionable,\u201d it said (p. 307) : \u201cBy deferring the payment of the rebate until three or six months following the period to which the rebate applies, ship-owners effectively tie the merchants to a group of lines for successive periods. In this connection <em>it </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number><em>is argued </em><footnotemark>40</footnotemark> that the ordinary contract system does not place the shipper in the position of continual dependence that results from the deferred rebate system.\u201d More important, Congress significantly deviated from the Report\u2019s recommendation. The Report (p. 421) recommended that \u201call carriers should be prohibited from retaliating against any shipper by refusing space accommodations when such are available, or by resorting to other unfair methods of discrimination, because such shipper has patronized an independent line, or has filed a complaint charging unfair treatment, or for any other reason.\u201d This recommendation was before the Committees which, in the next session, brought out (July 18, 1916) the Bill which became the 1916 Act. See 64th Cong. 1st Sess., Sen.Report No. 689, pp. 10-11. But the Bill and the Act importantly departed from the recommendation of the Alexander Report: Sec. 812(3) substituted, for the recommended words \u201cother unfair methods of discrimination,\u201d the words \u201cother discriminating or unfair methods\u201d. And this change was concomitant with another deviation from the Alexander Report by which Congress inserted \u201cunfair or unjustly discriminatory\u201d in Sec. 812(4) \u2014 thus showing that it knowingly and deliberately deleted \u201cunfair\u201d in Sec. 812(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The footnote in Swayne &amp; Hoyt, Ltd. v. United States, 300 U.S. 297, 57 S.Ct. 478, 482, 81 L.Ed. 659, is at best, dictum, for the Court there affirmed an administrative decision which had disapproved an exclusive patronage provision as unduly discriminatory under Secs. 815 and 816, so that Sec. 812(3) was not before the Court. Moreover, the body of the court\u2019s opinion, which said that the operation of an exclusive contract system \u201cdoes not differ substantially from that of \u2018deferred rebates\u2019 \u201d, is somewhat inconsistent with the footnote. In addition, although the Court in the footnote referred to the Alexander Report, it did not have its attention directed to the fact that Congress had importantly deviated' from the Report\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">(f) It does not answer the certificate-of-convenience argument to say that the dual-rate provisions will not exclude an independent carrier from any trade route on which he wishes to operate. For as the Board states in its brief (see footnote 13 supra), such exclusion will result if the dual-rate provisions work successfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">(g) The Attorney General advanced the following contention: The exemption in \u25a0Sec. 814 from the anti-trust laws is specifically restricted to an \u201cagreement\u201d by a carrier \u201cwith another such carrier or other person subject to this chapter\u201d; a shipper, under Sec. 801, is not an \u201cother person subject to\u201d this Chapter; consequently the exemption does not include a contract between a conference and a shipper. In support of this argument, it is noted that the Alexander Report recommended that Commission approval be required not only of agreements between carriers but also of carriers\u2019 contracts with shippers, but that, in enacting Sec. 814, the recommendation as to contracts with shippers was omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">5. It is suggested that an exclusive patronage provision in a conference agreement will not violate Sec. 812(3) if that provision has a clearly legitimate economic purpose and effect other than that of either penalizing shippers for patronizing non-conference carriers or creating a cartel free of competition from such independent carriers. This suggestion has these variants: (a) Such a provision is lawful if, and only if, the Board, on the basis of substantial evidence, finds that the \u201cspread\u201d between the contract and noncontract rates is reasonable. (b) Such a provision is lawful if, and only if, in addition to (a), the Board, on the basis of substantial evidence, finds that the noncontract rates are not unreasonably high.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>I repeat that I express no opinion as to the cogency of any of the foregoing arguments.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b933-12\">.

Mr. Andrews, in establishing your contracts, (sic) non-contract rate system, it is my understanding that it was proposed to continue in effect after November 1st, the tariff that had been largely in existence prior to that date, but that after November 1st the rates in the present existing tariff would then become the contract rates, is that correct? A. Yes. We were establishing as a contract basis the tariff rates which had been in effect for some time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-13\">\u201cQ. How did you calculate what the non-contract rates would be? Were they arranged on a basis pretty much. \u2014 \u25a0 A.

In other words, in general terms, the non-contract rates were going to be fixed on a differential of approximately 20 per cent above the contract level? A. That has been the basis pre-war, and the basis in effect to all of the European freight where there is a contract system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-22\">\u201cQ. Well, now, is it your own view that the rates which are fixed on a differential basis, either above or below other rates, are reasonable? A. We didn\u2019t fix them on a, so to speak, differential basis. We fixed them at specific rates in the tariff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-23\">\u201cQ. I understand that, but I also understand that generally the non-contract rates were fixed at a differential of approximately 20 per cent above the contract rates ? A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-24\">\u201cQ. And I am asking you whether in your judgment the fixing of any rate scale at any time on a differential basis is a reasonable method of making rates? A. I don\u2019t think the making of rates by differential is a proper basis, for that is an arbitrary basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b935-26\">. See the Commission\u2019s Rule, 46 C.F.R. 201.191.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b935-27\">. This finding reads in full as follows: \u201cShippers were informed that failure to sign such a contract would entail application to their shipments by respondent\u2019s lines after November 1, 1948 of noncon-tract rates which were fixed by means of an arbitrary differential at a level 20% to 30% higher than the currently existing scale.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b936-8\">. Moreover, the Board in its brief filed with us, candidly interprets the Board\u2019s decision as holding, in effect, that the purpose of the dual-rate provisions was, if possible, to bring about a condition in which an independent carrier would be compelled (through loss or threatened loss of profits) either to join the Conference or go out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">The Board\u2019s brief says: \u201cThe contract system should be frankly recognized as a device tending towards the monopolization of ocean commerce in particular trades by the members, collectively, of conferences which serve those trades. We use the word \u2018monopolization\u2019 with no ideological overtones, but merely in its dictionary sense, which is the obtaining or assumption of \u2018exclusive possession or control.\u2019 Whether the contract system in a particular case actually has the effect of producing a complete monopoly (i. e., control of a trade) depends upon how well it works; admittedly, it is monopolistic in purpose. The extent to which it is monopolistic in effect depends upon how successfully that purpose is achieved * * *. The record warrants the conclusion that if a contract system is wholly effective, it will result in a complete monopoly in the sense that all cargo moving in a trade where the system is used, will move in ships of conference carriers. Necessarily, in these circumstances, there would be no service by independent operators * * *. In considering the system itself (precedent to examination of specific contract provisions), we feel that this court should assume that the conference contracts are in fact effective; that shippers sign them in substantial numbers, voluntarily or as a choice of evils; that they exclude Isbrandtsen from carrying the freight of all shippers who sign; and that the contracts seriously restrict Isbrandtsen\u2019s access to cargoes for its ships, and will continue to do so if, and as long as, the conferences employ the contract system and Isbrandt-sen remains a non-member.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b936-11\">. The Board approved the conference agreements without holding hearings or taking evidence or making findings. It might be argued that, consequently, the first time the Board considered making an \u201corder\u2019\u2019 concerning the validity of those agreements was in connection with the complaint proceedings involved in the instant case. Cf. State of North Carolina v. United States, 325 U.S. 507, 517, 65 S.Ct. 1260, 89 <em>L.Ed. </em>1760. Were that argument accepted, it might then be argued that the order made in those proceedings is subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1006(c), so that the burden of proving the validity of the agreements was on the proponent of the order, i. e., the carriers. See also the Board\u2019s rule as to the burden of proof, 46 C.F.R. g 201.122.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">After approvals of the conference agreements in suit, the Board\u2019s predecessor, the Maritime Commission, promulgated an order, effective September 8, 1949, which is still in force and which provides as follows: When a proposed agreement is filed, the Board publishes a notice thereof, which advises interested parties that, within twenty days, they may request a hearing. The Board may then, in its discretion, order the holding of a hearing. If such a hearing is held, the burden of proof is obviously on the proponents of the approval. Of the Commission\u2019s order of September 8, 1949, counsel for the Board, in a letter to this court, stated: \u201cGeneral Manager\u2019s Order No. 106 was not published in the Federal Register inasmuch as it constituted a direction to the Commission\u2019s (now the Board\u2019s) staff on internal procedure, and in particular as to the manner in. which notice should be given to the public.\u201d Cf.

There, in 1894, before the statute, the court held that, in special circumstances, it was lawful for a water-carrier to grant lower rates to shippers making exclusive patronage contracts. But the court based its decision on the fact that there was an express finding by the trial court that the non contract rates were reasonable, so that there was \u201cno refusal to carry for a reasonable compensation\u201d, and no \u201cdetriment of the public, by exacting unreasonable charges.\u201d The court said: \u201cIf the general rates are reasonable, a deviation from the standard by the carrier in favor of particular customers, for special reasons not applicable to the whole public, does not furnish to parties not similarly situated any just ground for complaint. * * * Special favors in the form of reduced rates to particular customers may form an element in the inquiry whether, as a matter of fact, the standard rates are reasonable or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b937-20\">.

How much stability the particular dual-rate provisions in this case would furnish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>has been questioned. Without passing upon that question, we note the following: The examiner found, \u201cWith regard to the respondent carriers\u2019 obligations under the contract, the contract provided that respondents agreed to furnish the merchant at contract rates \u2018space in such vessels as they may respectively load at said loading ports for transportation and dispatch at the ports desired, provided that suitable unbooked space is available therein when the merchant makes application.\u2019 \u201d This apparently means that, to a shipper who signs an exclusive patronage contract, the conference carriers agree to supply no transportation facilities, except as the conference members may see fit to provide them from time to time. Andrews, called by the carriers as a witness in the Board\u2019s hearing, testified that, if the conference carriers provided a contract shipper with no space, the contracting shipper would be free to ship via an independent, non-conference, carrier. But the very purpose of the dual-rate provision is, if possible, to compel independent shippers to join the conference or go out of business. If, then, the dual-rate provision is successful, there will be no independent carriers. In that event, a shipper who signs a contract will apparently receive only such carrying space as the conference members choose to supply. Plaintiff argues that this shows that the dual-rate provision will not assure \u201cstability\u201d to shippers. The Board, in its opinion, intimated at one point that shippers endorsed the dual-rate provisions but, at another point, said: \u201cThe conferences realize that * * * something more than voluntary shipper cooperation must be agreed to. The dual-rate system is the device which has been developed for that purpose.\u201d It added: \u201cShippers have testified in this case that they deem the stability of rates and regularity of service which a conference can offer are worth the price measured in terms of freight rates.\u201d However, two private shippers intervened in the Board\u2019s proceeding to protest against the dual-rate provisions in the agreements in suit. So, too, did the Secretary of Agriculture, as the representative of many other shippers; see infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b938-7\">. See, e. g., Neuberger v.

Co. 1 U.S.S.R. 41, decided in 1922, not long after the enactment of the statute, the Shipping Board held it unlawful as \u201cunjustly discriminatory,\u201d for a carrier in foreign commerce to use the eontraet-noneontract device. Citing Secs. 16 and 17, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 815 and 816, the Shipping Board said: \u201cIt is evident that the purpose of Congress in enacting these provisions of the statute was to impose upon common carriers within the purview thereof the duty of charging uniform rates to all shippers receiving a similar transportation service. The duty of the respondent under these sections was to serve the public impartially, and we think the language used in Western Union Tel. Co. v. Call Pub. Co., 181 U.S. 92 [21 S.Ct. 561, 564, 45 L.Ed. 765], in dealing with a similar statute, is entirely applicable to the case in hand. The court there said: \u2018All individuals have equal rights both in respect to service and charges. Of course, such equality of right does not prevent differences in the modes and kinds of service and different charges based thereon. * * * But that principle of equality does forbid any difference in charge which is not based upon difference in service, and, even when based upon difference of service, must have some reasonable relation to the amount of difference, and cannot be so great as to produce an unjust discrimination.\u2019 From the facts of record in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>case before us it is manifest that the transportation service furnished the complainants and contract shippers was in all respects identical.\u201d The Board also said: \u201cIt should be here remarked, however, that we do not decide whether under that act the according of lower rates to those shippers who contract to confine their shipments to a certain carrier or carriers are lawful when based upon regularity of consignments, number of shipments, or quantity of merchandise furnished for transportation, as in the instant case no such question is presented for determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">Some eleven years later, in Rawleigh v. Stoomvart, 1 U.S.S.B. 285, 290 (1933), it was indicated that the Eden rule applied exclusively to the case of a single carrier and was inapplicable to a conference agreement. However, some two years later, in Intercoastal Investigation, 1 U.S.S.B. 400, 452 (1935), the Shipping Board Bureau rejected this distinction. Then, some four years after that, in Contract Routing Restrictions, 2 U.S.M.C. 220, 226-227 (1939), the Maritime Commission cited the Eden case as applicable to a conference agreement. But now, eleven years after that case, the Federal Maritime Board, in the instant case, once more indicates that the Eden rule applies to the case of a single carrier only.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">Again, Menacho v. Ward, C.C., 27 F. 529, has been variously treated: It was relied upon in the Eden case, supra (1922); treated as having been made irrelevant by the statute in Pacific Coast European Conference, 3 U.S.M.C. 11, 15-16 (1947); and, in the instant case, cited by the Board (1950) as authority in interpreting the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b939-15\">.

Of course it is literally true that there cannot be a discrimination between localities without an incidental discrimination between connecting carriers where the localities can only be reached by connecting lines; but for that very reason we should avoid any redundancy. There is some confirmation of this in the last clause of subdivision three, because, although the adverb, \u2018unduly,\u2019 is there introduced, the prohibition appeared to have in mind alternative routes between the same termini. That is what we think this part of subdivision three covers; no general inquiry is necessary beyond that of the two alternative routes. We do not believe that the problem of comparative rates between two localities can be so simplified.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b944-14\">. See Edmund Weil v.

That footnote reads: \u201cThe report of the House Committee on Merchant Marine &amp; Fisheries, H.R.Doc. 805, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. (1914), recommended the prohibition of deferred rebates, adopted in Sec. 14 of the Shipping Act, because it operated to tie shippers to a group of lines for successive periods, and because the system \u2018is unnecessary to secure <em>ex</em>cellence and regularity of service, a considerable number of conferences being operated today without this feature.\u2019 See, e.g. pp. 103-105, 200. The Committee recognized that the exclusive contract system does not necessarily tie up the shipper as completely as \u2018deferred rebates,\u2019 since it does not place him in \u2018continual dependence\u2019 on the carrier by forcing his exclusive patronage for one contract period under threats of forfeit of differentials accumulated during a previous contract period. Accordingly the Committee did not condemn the contract system completely. Cf. W.T. Rawleigh Co. v. Stoomvaart, 1 U.S.S.B. 285. The policy of the statute may properly be applied where, as in the circumstances of this case, the contract system must be taken as actually operating to effect a monopoly. Cf. Eden Mining Co. v.
