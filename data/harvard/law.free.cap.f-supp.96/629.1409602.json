Count II advances a smaller claim based upon an alleged arbitrary decision of defendant\u2019s contracting officer relating to the value of certain services rendered under a contract change order. Count III of the petition has been abandoned by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-19\">Count I</p>\n<p id=\"b680-20\">Considering first plaintiff\u2019s claim under Count I, the court must determine: (1) the proper interpretation of the contract entered into by the plaintiffs and the defendant; (2) whether or not defendant has breached that contract; '(3) whether or not, if there was breach, the plaintiff was damaged thereby; (4) whether or not plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of Change Order No. 36 operated to release their claim for damages based upon lack of access roads; (5) whether or not, assuming breach and damage thereby, plaintiff has presented to the court sufficient criteria by which damages may be computed and relief awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-21\">The pertinent parts of the contract itself are set forth in the court\u2019s findings of fact. The more important provisions for the purpose of this opinion have been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>peated above. Both parties took the position before the Commissioner and maintain here that the contract was not ambiguous, and the record and briefs of parties afford little aid in the interpretation of certain contract provisions which both parties claim to be clear \u2014 but which the parties interpret entirely differently. The contract clause about which the dispute centers is Article 24, which is, by the terms of the contract, applicable to Part II only and which provides \u201cAccess roads to the project and on the site will be provided and maintained by others in such a manner as to permit this Contractor to proceed with the work under this contract without undue interference or delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The contract for the fabrication and erection of the 500 dwelling units was entered into on April 2, 1942. The site had not at that time been designated with particularity, but plaintiffs knew that erection was to be in the vicinity of Texarkana, Texas. A later change order provided for the erection of 300 additional units, and the contract price was increased accordingly. The erection of that project was sublet, however, and is not in controversy here except with respect to certain plumbing changes considered under Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Notice to proceed with the work under Parts I and II of the contract was issued by the defendant on April 29, 1942, and received by the plaintiffs on the following day. Immediately thereafter, the plaintiffs sought out the exact location of the project. They found that construction was to be at Hooks, Texas, about 14 miles from Texarkana. The project site consisted of a tract of 260 acres of flat and relatively level land, a portion of which had at one time been under cultivation, from which furrows remained, but which had then grown up in high weeds and brush. One-third of the site was covered with trees. A shallow creek ran an irregular course through the center of the tract. Its bed was dry except during the rainy seasons or during periods of heavy rainfall. There was a growth of briars, vines, brush, and small trees extending some 30 feet on each side of the. creek. Although the land on both sides of the creek sloped gradually to it, there were a number of depressions or low spots varying in size up to four acres where water collected after a rain. There were several small goose ponds, and, within the wooded areas, there were two large stock ponds. Each of these ponds held water for long periods of time. There were also- a number of low mounds on parts of the site. In dry weather, the surface of the ground was dusty and hard with the exception of some areas of loose sand and although the cultivated portion was very rough, heavy trucks and similar equipment could be driven upon the open areas of the project. There was no natural drainage for a large part of the project. During wet weather and for a considerable time after heavy rainfall, the soil was wet and boggy. At such times it was impossible to operate large, heavily loaded trucks and difficult to drive lighter trucks and wagons anywhere on the site. About 900 feet of the southwest corner of the site fronted a concrete highway 18 feet in width separated from the site itself by a graded drainage ditch about two or three feet deep. A gravel road ran parallel to the east side of the project and intersected the concrete highway at a point beyond the site. There were no other surfaced or graded roads on or near the site. There was a railroad siding located across the paved highway at a point about three blocks from the southwest corner of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">It had been the intention of the Government\u2019s contracting officer that the site contract, which would involve preparation of building sites, grading of roads, and grading for drainage, would be let simultaneously with the fabrication and erection contract and that the work would go forward together. The Government, however, was unsuccessful in obtaining a bidder for the site work at this time and, although in daily anticipation of getting work started upon the site, a contract for this work was not in fact made until November 1942, and actual site clearing work did not commence until November 17, 1942. On the day the proceed order issued, the land was in a raw condition,' without any identifying marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>The plaintiffs interpreted the contract they had signed as requiring the Government to provide a prepared site and access to the individual building sites before being called upon to perform their part of the bargain. Plaintiffs\u2019 bid price was based upon the orderly, systematic erection of dwelling units upon previously graded building sites. The contract required the defendant, through its architect-engineer to furnish four stakes showing the location of each house and indicating- the grade level for the floor. Under plaintiffs\u2019 erection plan, work is begun by putting in foundations in accordance with the stakes furnished. The foundations are installed in alternating operations by carpenter and concrete crews, parts for complete house units are trucked directly to individual building sites, and when the foundations are complete, the floors are framed thereon. Wall, ceiling, and roof panels are then erected simultaneously to give a closed-in house. Thereafter, the house is finished in a succession of jobs by specialized crews of mechanics.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Immediately upon viewing the project site, plaintiffs protested what they considered the premature issuance of the proceed order, the site not having been prepared nor access roads provided. The contracting officer was at the time under considerable pressure from the military, who demanded that houses be made available for defense workers at nearby ordnance plants, and, while admitting the proceed order to have been premature, he declined to rescind it, but urged plaintiffs to go forward, promising that any claim for excess costs would be given consideration at the close of the work. It is evident that at this stage of the controversy both parties saw in the contract a promise by the Government that access roads would be provided for the contractor\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Plaintiffs began performance. The findings of fact particularize the difficulties encountered. Initially, plaintiffs were 'hampered by wartime procurement difficulties, lack of adequate priorities,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cfreezes\u201d of material, labor shortages, and restrictions on motor transport. At the site, there was some difficulty in getting the concrete work under way. A still greater obstacle was defendant\u2019s delay in furnishing grade lines and, later, in providing cleared building sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Although originally scheduled for September, 1942, completion, the work lagged \u201chorribly behind schedule\u201d and was not actually completed until late in June, 1943. Throughout the rainy winter months plaintiffs were unable to operate mechanized equipment of any size over the project site because of the lack of access roads or even drainage. A freeze on motor transport obliged plaintiffs to ship by rail to the project area and then transport to the site by truck. Until about August 15, 1942, plaintiffs, because of lack of material, were unable to fabricate and deliver to the project site complete house units. Such parts as were furnished could not be put to immediate use and so, beginning early in June, 1942, were stockpiled on the site. By the time plaintiffs were able to ship complete dwelling units, bad weather had set in and great difficulty was experienced in getting the units to the individual building sites. Stockpiling continued while efforts were made to get the units into place. Part of the panels for the houses contained sheet-rock, an interior finish material susceptible to damage by moisture. The plaintiffs\u2019 superintendents and crew, while good mechanics, were not capable of organizing and carrying through a project of this size under adversity. The stockpiles were negligently kept in many instances and material was not properly protected from the inclement weather, while poor arrangement of the stockpiled material added to an unavoidably high incidence of breakage due to handling.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">From time to time plaintiffs reiterated their protest at having to proceed upon an unimproved site and complained of defendant\u2019s many delays in furnishing grade lines, cleared sites, etc. At the same time the defendant repeatedly called plaintiffs\u2019 atten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tion to the lack of care being afforded stockpiled materials and protested regularly about damaged materials being incorporated into houses and about other deviations from specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In order to complete the project, plaintiffs were obliged to furnish a great quantity of extra material to replace defective panels. It was also necessary to use a crew of expert carpenters for the repair of panels still salvageable. Because the erection and finishing of the houses could not proceed in orderly sequence and because of the great difficulty in hauling materials over the 260 acre tract, the construction period was greatly prolonged and a great deal of excess labor and overhead costs were incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Turning first to an examination of the contract itself, and especially to Article 24,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is evident from a literal reading that two equally logical interpretations are possible. Plaintiffs contend the true meaning to be that whatever access roads as may be necessary to plaintiffs\u2019 delivery and erection of the dwellings without undue interference or delay will be furnished \u201cby others.\u201d Defendant contends the meaning to be that access roads to the project and on the site will be put in \u201cby others\u201d in such a manner that their work on the roads will not interfere with nor delay plaintiffs\u2019 work on the houses. This latter interpretation involves, also, the assumption that \u201caccess roads\u201d means access for the people who are to live in the houses and not access for the builders. We must, in the light of all available facts, choose between these possible, and opposed, constructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Two circumstances point toward plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation as the proper one. First, Section 8(c) of the contract (set forth in full, supra) provided, in substance, that when more than one contractor was to work in the same vicinity, the work should be coordinated by the contracting officer so that the various workmen would not interfere with each other\u2019s work. Article 24 was added as a part of the \u201cgeneral conditions.\u201d If Article 24 meant only that the access roads were to be put in without interfering or delaying the erection work, then it is entirely superfluous, be-cuse Article 8(c) covers essentially the same situation. It is not to be assumed that Article 24 was added for no purpose. Second, both parties, before the advent of litigation, interpreted the contract to obligate the Government to provide access roads for the builder, so that the house panels could be trucked directly to location and erected in orderly sequence. The contracting officer proceeded initially upon this theory when he urged plaintiffs to go ahead, promising to consider their claims for lack of access roads at the conclusion of the project. Later, the contracting officer\u2019s interpretation changed to that now taken by defendant; but his superior,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as late as December 13, 1945, took the official position that the contract called for the Government to provide access roads for the contractor\u2019s use. Plaintiffs\u2019 representatives raised the issue of access roads and advanced their interpretation of the contract immediately upon learning that they were expected to proceed with erection upon an unimproved site. Their interpretation met with acquiescence on the part of the Government\u2019s representatives at that time. The conclusion follows that the parties themselves, at the time of contracting, believed that the contract obligated the Government to provide access roads for the use of the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">The interpretation of a contract by the parties to it before it becomes the subject of controversy is deemed by the courts to be of great, if not controlling, weight. Central Engineering &amp; Construction Company v. United States, 59 F.Supp. 553, 103 Ct.Cl. 440, 465. The now apparent ambiguity of a literal reading must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>give way to the contemporary construction of the parties themselves, <em>vis. </em>that the contract required the Government furnish access roads to and on the site for the benefit of the contractor and before the contractor should commence deliveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Breach of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">There can be no doubt that the Government did not provide access roads and that the contract was thereby breached. Plaintiffs allege lack of site preparation as a further breach, contending that a contract such as this carried with it an implied obligation on the Government\u2019s part to prepare the site for the work to be done by the contractor. A great deal of force is taken from plaintiffs\u2019 argument by the fact that a change order was issued June 30, 1942, and accepted without reservation by plaintiffs under which plaintiffs agreed, pending the arrival of the site contractor, to do the necessary filling and grading underneath the houses as erection proceeded. This change order was extended from time to time, and plaintiffs were paid for this work as well as granted contract time extensions because of it. However, it does appear from the evidence that plaintiff was delayed five days in this operation due to defendant\u2019s failure to furnish required grade lines, without which plaintiffs could not dress the fills to proper grade for drainage. Defendant\u2019s promise to supply grade lines implies the promise to supply them when needed in the prosecution of the work, George A Fuller Co. v. United States, 69 F.Supp. 409, 108 Ct.Cl. 70, and it thus appears that there was a further breach of contract by defendant to this extent. Delay was also occasioned by defendant\u2019s failure to furnish promptly drawings and specifications for certain plumbing changes, but most of this delay occurred concurrently with other delays. Altogether we conclude that plaintiff was delayed, by the Government\u2019s breaches of contract, 30 days in the performance of Part I and 65 days in performance of Part II.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">A more difficult question is whether damages of which this court may take cognizance flowed from these breaches. Plaintiffs have not sought reformation of the contract; under the theory adopted they must show actual damages resulting directly from a breach of the contract as written. Part I of the contract, as amended, required plaintiff to fabricate and deliver to the individual building sites all parts necessary to a complete dwelling unit. The Government was to pay for work under Part I when it accepted delivery at the individual building sites.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Part II of the contract, as amended, required plaintiffs to erect the units and required the Government to pay for erected units when accepted as ready for occupancy. Subsection l(m) (2) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the general conditions provides that Article 24 of the contract shall apply only to Part II. Article 24, by its own terms, provides that it is applicable only to Part II. This article contains the only reference to access roads to be found in the entire contract, yet when the typewritten addendum amended the general conditions so as to shift the obligation to deliver the units to individual building sites from Part II of the contract to Part I, there was no corresponding amendment of Article 24.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is the Government\u2019s posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>tion that this was a divisible contract and that any breach of the access roads provision must have been a breach under Part II, from which it follows that plaintiffs were not damaged by the breach, since the lack of access roads interfered with plaintiff\u2019s performance under Part I (to which Article 24 did not apply) and not with their performance under Part II, which covered erection only \u2014 an operation in which access roads play a very minor role. By the terms of this contract, it is divisible into two parts \u2014 one for the fabrication and delivery of parts \u2014 the other for the erection of those parts into dwelling units. Yet these two parts were integrated and dependent one upon the other and were to be carried on practically simultaneously and by the same contractor. The only possible damage that could flow from a breach of Article 24, as the parties themselves regarded it, was that the contractor would be unable to truck in the prefabricated panels to the building sites. Whether we consider the contract here divisible or indivisible, it is apparent that Part I and Part II were made with reference to- each other and that damage under .one part could be expected to result from a breach under the other. Assuming that two separate contracts exist here, and one, made in contemplation of the other is breached, the defendant is liable for all the reasonably forseeable .damages flowing from the breach, including damages under the other contract that were in the contemplation of the parties at the time of execution. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Hall, 124 U.S. 444, 456, 8 S.Ct. 577, 31 L.Ed. 479; Ed S. Michelson, Inc. v. Nebraska Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 8 Cir., 63 F.2d 597, 601. The defendant here is liable for all of plaintiffs\u2019 damages directly attributable to the Government\u2019s breaches of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Change Order No. 36</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The defendant also contends that plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of Change Order No. 36, which extended the contract time and relieved plaintiff from liquidated damages, operated to release plaintiffs\u2019 claims for damages due to lack of access roads and negligent delays on the part of the Government. It has been repeatedly held by this Court that provisions for an extension of time for completion of the work on account of delays due to unforeseen causes, including those caused by the Government, do not serve to relieve the Government from liability. George A. Fuller Co. v. United States, 69 F.Supp. 409, 108 Ct.Cl. 70, 97. The provisions of Change Order No. 36 that \u201cAll claims against the United States of America which are incidental to or as a consequence of the aforementioned change, including claims, if any, for adjustment of contract time, are satisfied\u201d does not foreclose the plaintiff from a remedy for breaches of contract which in fact delayed and damaged it, because it is clear that the 266 day extension of contract time granted by Change Order No. 36 was neither offered nor accepted as a compromise of plaintiffs\u2019 then pending claims against the United States. Henry Ericsson Co. v. United States, 62 F.Supp. 312, 104 Ct. Cl. 397. On the date that Change Order No. 36 issued, plaintiffs had damage claims pending for over $200,000, * and if it had been the parties intention to compromise this claim, it is evident that such intent would have been recited in the change order. That the parties did not consider this claim compromised is apparent from the fact that final settlement was made expressly reserving plaintiffs\u2019 right to press this very claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">Measure of Damages</p>\n<p id=\"AU3\">We come, then, to the problem of determining the amount of damages, to which plaintiff is entitled because of the interference and delay occasioned by defendant\u2019s breach of contract. As a result of defendant\u2019s breach, plaintiffs were forced to depart drastically from their usual orderly procedure and to work haphazardly about the project as building sites became avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>able and accessible. Building parts were stockpiled instead of being delivered directly to building sites. House panels were handled and rehandled before they were finally incorporated into houses, and each 'handling took its toll in breakage. The project ran on into the winter months and damage to stockpiled materials from winter rains was severe. At the same time, it is apparent that another cause of stockpiling rather than delivery direct to,sites was that plaintiffs were not able, at least until the middle of August, 1942, to deliver complete house units due to shortages of certain components and to the wartime \u201cfreeze\u201d on motor transport. Complete carloads of certain types of panels would be shipped by rail and stockpiled awaiting the arrival of other panels necessary to the erection of a complete unit. The stockpiling was inefficiently handled and inadequate steps were taken to protect the stored panels until late in October 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The end result was that plaintiffs, in <em>order </em>to complete performance under the contract, were obliged to ship some $41,447.36 worth of excess material<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the project and to expend $92,690.28 for excess labor,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to which must be added $8,418.71, representing payroll taxes and insurance upon the foregoing. The contract lagged 280 days behind schedule, and a portion of plaintiffs\u2019 overhead expenses during this period was properly chargeable to the Hooks project. Grand Trunk Western R. Co. v. H. W. Nelson Co., 6 Cir., 116 F.2d 823; M. H. McClosky, Jr., Inc., v. United States, 66 Ct.Cl. 105. Team hire caused an extraordinary expense of $1,507.50, and about $2,000.00 in excess of normal requirements had to be expended for truck hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">Overhead, Part I</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Although there were at many times concurrent delays, it is found that the Government, in breach of1 its contract, caused plaintiff 30 days\u2019 delay in performance of Part I of the contract. During this time, plaintiffs\u2019 overhead, o-f which $319.83 per day may be considered applicable to the instant contract,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was prolonged. Plaintiff is entitled to recover $9,594.90 on this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">Overhead, Part II</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">Sixty-five days\u2019 delay to plaintiffs\u2019 performance of Part II is solely attributable to the Government and in breach of contract. The plaintiffs\u2019 daily overhead attributable to this part of the contract was $77.95.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff is entitled to recover $5,066.75 on this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">Team Hire</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for team hire in the amount of $1,507.50 is directly attributable to lack of access roads. Had the defendant not breached its contract in this respect, the plaintiff would not have had to use teams at all. Plaintiff is entitled to recover $1,507.50 on this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-16\">Truck Hire</p>\n<p id=\"b686-17\">Plaintiffs were required, because of defendant\u2019s failure to provide access roads on the project site, to expend $2,000 in excess truck hire and are entitled to recover that sum on this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Excess Material and Excess Labor</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">As a measure of damages for excess material and labor claims, plaintiffs have offered a comparison between unit costs of a similar project at Mineral Wells, Texas, where access roads were furnished, and unit costs at the instant Hooks project. Such a comparison cannot be expected to yield perfect accuracy, but \u201cabsolute certainty as to the amount of the damages is not essential, this being a matter for determination according to the circumstances of each case. All that the law requires is that such damages be allowed as, in the judgment of fair men resulted from the breach of. contract for which suit is brought.\u201d Needles v. United States, 101 Ct.Cl. 535. In arriving at our determination as to the amount of damages suffered by plaintiff because of defendant\u2019s breach of contract, we have considered the proofs laid before us by both plaintiff and defendant. We have examined the comparison between the unit costs as Mineral Wells and those at Hooks and! have made allowance for acknowledged variables between the two projects. We have considered the various causes of excess cost and the fact that neither party was at all times faultless. Upon all the evidence before us, we find that excess material costs attributable to defendant\u2019s breach of contract amount to $19,220.00 and that excess labor costs attributable to defendant\u2019s breach of contract amount to $42,904.00. Payroll taxes and insurance paid on the above excess labor charges are found to be $3,-844.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Count II</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Under Count II of the petition, plaintiffs claim the sum of $4,176.00 as additional compensation due for work performed and material furnished by them in connection with the change involving the substitution of showers for bathtubs in dwelling units. The original specifications called for the installation of bathtubs in each of 800 units. It was later decided to substitute shower stalls, and the Government directed plaintiffs to submit a proposal for the cost of the extra work. A sample installation was made before the Government\u2019s representatives at the project, and an itemized proposal totaling $18.50 was submitted by plaintiffs and approved by the two Government representatives at the site, the project manager and project engineer. The contracting officer, however, objected to approving extra compensation of more than $15.00 per unit. Subsequently, plaintiffs found that they had omitted certain items from their estimate, and submitted a supplemental proposal increasing the price per unit by $1.72. The contracting officer executed the change order in the amount of $15.00 only, giving his reasons therefor in a letter dated April 9, 1946. This decision was appealed from and affirmed by the head of the department on April 19, 1946. It is plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the contracting officer\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious and should be set aside in favor of a finding that the reasonable value of the change was $20.01 per dwelling, or $4,008 more than the sum allowed and paid by defendant. It is clear that under the contract considered here, the contracting officer\u2019s decision, if supported by findings of fact, is final unless arbitrary or capricious. United States v. Callahan Walker Co., 317 U.S. 56, 63 S.Ct. 113, 87 L.Ed. 49. Cf. Wunderlich v. United States, C. Cls. No. 46307, Decided June 5, 1950, 117 Ct.Cl.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The major item of disagreement between plaintiffs\u2019 proposal and defendant\u2019s allowance regarded the amount of time to be credited the Government on the shower substitution. The original specifications called for setting bathtubs, and the contractor\u2019s estimate was based upon the time of a plumber and a helper. Less time is required to set a shower than a tub, and in estimating the cost of the change, the Government was to be credited with the time saved by the installation of the shower in lieu of the tub. The contractor allowed one hour\u2019s credit; the contracting officer first demanded that three hours time be allowed, then compromised and allowed two hours, the difference amounting to $2.-25. The evidence shows that the problem was considered by the contracting officer and that the decision was reached upon the basis of previous experience with similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>changes. Under these circumstances, we cannot hold that such a considered finding was arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The second item disallowed was the subcontractor\u2019s overhead of 15% and profit at 10% on the work.' The contracting officer allowed 15% for both asserting only the conclusion that this was \u201creasonable.\u201d The plaintiff complains that it was arbitrary. Article 36b (3) of the contract applies to changes of this type and provides that \u201cthe cost may include an allowance for overhead and profit not to exceed 15% of the net cost.\u201d The contracting officer\u2019s decision can hardly be held to be arbitrary in this respect, as a more liberal decision would have been beyond his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The third item disallowed was plaintiff\u2019s supplemental request for $1.72 per unit for items inadvertently omitted from the original estimate. The contracting officer ruled that the \u201clate submittal * * * did not convince the contracting officer that the actual value of the work * * * was over $15.00 per unit.\u201d There is no indication here that the contracting officer gave more than passing notice to this supplemental estimate. No findings were made that the extra material included by the contractor was not needed or that the price was out of line. The contracting officer merely stated that he was not convinced \u2014 no other reason was given for the decision. Such an unsupported decision and evidence of lack of willingness to consider a claim upon its merits is not a ruling or decision entitled to finality under Article XV of the contract and must be set aside. We hold that the bid price of $1.72 per unit for the supplemental materials was reasonable and that plaintiff is entitled to' recover this sum for each of the 800 units in which the change was effected \u2014 a total of $1,376.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiffs\u2019 claim under this count is barred because of failure to appeal in time from the contracting officer\u2019s decision is without merit, because the contracting officer did not, until April 9, 1946, make a formal denial of plaintiff\u2019s claim based upon written findings of fact. Before this decision plaintiff had nothing to appeal from and, indeed, carried the case to the head of the department before a formal decision was ever made by the contracting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">Count III of the petition has been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">Plaintiffs have admitted defendant\u2019s counterclaim in the sum of $666.40. Interest on this amount from the date the indebtedness arose through overpayment by the Government of bond premium cost cannot be allowed. Standard Steel Car Co. v. United States, 67 Ct.Cl. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">Through administrative decisions, plaintiffs have already received $15,381.94 upon the claim set forth in Count I, and this amount has been credited against the judgment entered herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">Judgment will be entered for plaintiff for $70,131.21, less $666.40 (the amount of defendant\u2019s counterclaim). It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">JONES, Chief Judge, and MADDEN, WHITAKER and LITTLETON, Judges, concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\">.

When it became obvious that delivery to individual building sites could not be made on schedule under Part I, the Government waived its right to require delivery to the individual sites before paying plaintiffs' under Part I, and made payments upon the basis of delivery to stockpiles on the project site. The Government was not obligated to do this, no consideration for the change passed, and no change order issued. The reason for the waiver seems to have been'a feeling that the contractor should be given every possible 'assistance in view of his difficult position and-in recognition that the Government was remiss in not furnishing adequate site preparation.
