The degree is to be conferred jointly with Middlesex County College (MCC) pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding between MCC and the University. Appellant and the <em>amicus, </em>New Jersey State Nurses Association, contend that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:64G-3.2 (hereinafter \u00a7 3.2) prohibits the University from conferring undergraduate degrees. Section 3.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">It is declared to be the public policy of the State that the use of the title university by the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey does not imply a future change in its institutional mission to permit the granting of undergraduate degrees or the expansion of its graduate degree programs beyond the biomedical science fields now authorized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">It was adopted in 1981 as part of chapter 325 which amended the Medical and Dental Education Act of 1970 (the 1970 Act).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Respondents contend that \u00a7 3.2 does not prevent the granting of undergraduate degrees in \u201cthe biomedical science fields.\u201d In effect, respondents argue that the phrase \u201cbeyond the biomedical science fields\u201d in \u00a7 3.2 modifies the phrase \u201cundergraduate degrees\u201d as well as the phrase \u201cgraduate degree programs.\u201d Respondents also contend that \u00a7 3.2 does not preclude the University\u2019s participation in a joint undergraduate degree program with another institution of higher education.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">In construing a statute we must give effect to the legislative intent. <em>Monmouth County v. Wissell, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>35, 342 <em>A.</em>2d 199 (1975). Sources of that intent are the language of a statute, the policy behind a statute, concepts of reasonableness and legislative history. <em>Shapiro v. Essex County Free</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>holder Board, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super., </em>87, 424 A.2d 1203 (Law Div. 1980), aff'd. 183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>24, 443 A.2d 219 (App.Div.1982), aff\u2019d 91 <em>N.J. </em>430, 453 A.2d 158 (1982); <em>Coletti v. Un. Co. Freeholders, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 524 A.2d 1270 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Prior to the 1981 amendments the 1970 Act did not contain an express limitation on the University's power to confer undergraduate degrees. The 1970 Act stated that the Legislature and the Governor found \u201cthat the establishment and operation of a program of medical and dental education is in the best interest of the State to provide greater numbers of trained medical personnel to assist in the staffing of the hospitals and public institutions and agencies of the State and to prepare greater numbers of students for the general practice of medicine and dentistry____\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>L. </em>1970, c. 102, \u00a7 2; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:64G-2. The 1970 Act empowered the Board of Trustees to \u201c[djetermine the educational curriculum and program of the college\u201d and to \u201c[gjrant diplomas, certificates or degrees.\u201d <em>L. </em>1970, <em>c. </em>102, \u00a7 6(b) and (k); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:64G-6(b) and (k). The trustees were also authorized to exercise implied powers and powers \u201cincident to the proper government, conduct and management of the college____\u201d <em>L. </em>1970, <em>c. </em>102, \u00a7 7; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:64G-7. Although the statutes are not without ambiguity, the primary purpose of the 1964 and 1970 Acts was to establish an institution to educate and train physicians and dentists.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">We must construe \u00a7 3.2 to resolve the issue in this case. Section 3.2\u2019s structure strongly suggests that the phrase \u201cbeyond the biomedical science fields\u201d modifies only \u201cthe expansion of its graduate degree programs.\u201d The legislative history supports this construction of \u00a7 3.2. The statement of the Senate Education Committee to the bill that became chapter 325 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>indicates that the bill\u2019s purpose was to provide \u201cfor a greater degree of administrative autonomy for the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.\u201d Despite this avowed purpose, the Senate Education Committee expressed its intent that the University\u2019s mission</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">is, and shall continue to be, the offering of the graduate degrees programs in the biomedical science fields now authorized or authorized in the future by the State Board of Higher Education. Moreover, the committee endorses the State Board resolution of June 19, 1981 which states, \u201cthat it is in the best interests of a coordinated and effective system of higher education that the [University] not offer undergraduate degrees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The State Board of Higher Education (State Board) resolution of June 19, 1981, referred to by the Senate Education Committee, contained two paragraphs particularly pertinent to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">RESOLVED: That the Board unequivocally affirms its position that the use of a \u201cuniversity\u201d title by the CMDNJ does not imply a future change in its institutional mission to permit the granting of undergraduate degrees or the expansion of its graduate degree programs beyond the biomedical science fields now authorized; and be it further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">RESOLVED: That in accordance with the principles outlined in the recently adopted Statewide Plan for Higher Education, and the 1978 study on the Future Scope and Cost of Health Professions Education, the Board of Higher Education states that it is in the best interests of a coordinated and effective system of higher education that the CMDNJ not offer undergraduate degrees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">The first paragraph is the source of \u00a7 3.2\u2019s language. The second paragraph explains the first paragraph by stating \u201cthat the CMDNJ not offer undergraduate degrees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">The State Board\u2019s resolution relied in part on the 1981 Statewide Plan for Higher Education and on the June 18, 1981 memorandum (the memorandum) from its Special Committee on CMDNJ Operational Flexibility. The memorandum stated in part that the committee \u201ccould not accept the original proposal to change the College\u2019s name to the New Jersey Health Sciences University given the fact that the College is not authorized to grant undergraduate degrees in the health professions.\u201d The memorandum did express support for the amendment which would change the college\u2019s name to The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey but stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>while we support the proposed name change, we share the higher education community\u2019s concern that the use of the word \u201cuniversity\u201d in the institution\u2019s name should not be interpreted to imply the right to grant undergraduate degrees or to expand graduate degree offerings beyond the biomedical science fields now authorized. Such an implication is clearly at odds with the Board of Higher Education\u2019s position concerning the appropriate mission for the CMDNJ. Therefore, in order to properly and forcefully address this valid concern, we recommend that the Board of Higher Education clearly and publicly affirm its position that the use of a \u201cuniversity\u201d title of CMDNJ does not imply a future change in its institutional mission to permit the granting of undergraduate degrees or to expand its graduate degree offerings in the biomedical sciences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We therefore conclude that the phrase \u201cbeyond the biomedical science fields now authorized\u201d does not modify the prohibition against \u201cthe granting of undergraduate degrees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">However, respondents\u2019 contention that the University may participate in joint undergraduate degree programs with other institutions presents a closer question.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The impetus to amend the 1970 Act came from the University with State Board support. Thus, the University and the State Board jointly crafted chapter 325. Moreover, the State Board authored \u00a7 3.2 in reliance on the memorandum of its special committee and on the 1981 Statewide Plan for Higher Education. Consequently, the Board, its special committee and the Statewide Plan are rich sources of material for a complete understanding of \u00a7 3.2\u2019s impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The memorandum stated that the committee\u2019s recommendations were based upon certain \u201cguiding observations and precepts,\u201d including the observation that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiLq\">Through its School of Allied Health Professions, the CMDNJ shares responsibility for allied health professions education with two- and four-year colleges throughout the State, although the College <em>itself </em>is not authorized to grant undergraduate degrees. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The committee identified, with approval, the role of the School of Allied Health Professions as one of the four major components of \u201cthe College\u2019s institutional mission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">The Statewide Plan commented extensively and favorably on the College\u2019s joint degree programs. It noted that the College \u201c[tjhrough its School of Allied Health Professions ... engages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>in joint programs with degree-granting colleges in areas of allied health education,\u201d <em>State of New Jersey Board of Higher Education, The Statewide Plan for Higher Education, </em>1981, p. 34, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">The CMDNJ also shares responsibility for allied health professions education with two and four year colleges throughout the State. In addition to the administration of CMDNJ\u2019s own hospital-based certificate programs, the School of Allied Health Professions was established to create a core of administrative, curriculum planning, and instructional services at CMDNJ aimed at maximizing regional coordination and sharing of resources through the development of joint programs with other collegiate institutions. The concept of cooperative arrangements between CMDNJ and two and four year colleges was developed to avoid duplication and fragmentation of educational effort, to foster the creation of educational programs that permit upward and lateral career mobility, and to use the clinical resources at CMDNJ more efficiently by offering joint programs in the health professions. <em>[Id. </em>at p. 35.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Finally, the Statewide Plan expressed its conclusions regarding the College\u2019s mission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">As the State\u2019s only public medical and dental school, the CMDNJ should carry out its mission in the following ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">1. The College should continue to provide programs for the professional education of physicians and dentists and should offer first professional degrees in medicine and dentistry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">2. It should continue to provide, through its Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, graduate and postgraduate programs focused on human medicine. CMDNJ and Rutgers University should continue their joint degree programs and should develop formal agreements defining the relationship between programs conducted by the respective institutions in related fields, particularly those offered in the Newark area, with a view toward avoiding duplication of efforts and sharing resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">3. The CMDNJ should continue its programs of continuing education for physicians, dentists, and allied health professionals except in the areas of pharmacy and social work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">4. It should continue to assume its role as a major center for research in the biomedical sciences and, as such, should aggressively seek outside funds for the support of such research and for the recruitment of outstanding scientists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">5. The College should continue to recognize its position as a major provider of health care in areas of need, including the development of tertiary referral centers, and its commitment to the training of practitioners, particularly in primary care fields.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">6. <em>The CMDNJ should continue to offer programs of education and training in selected allied health professions as outlined by the Health Professions Education Master Plan of the State of New Jersey. This should be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>accomplished primarily through joint programs with two and four year colleges and general university campuses in the State.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">7. The CMDNJ should not, <em>itself </em>offer undergraduate degree programs. <em>[Id., </em>at pp. 35-36; emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">These sources establish that joint programs with two and four-year colleges and universities constituted an important segment of the University\u2019s mission as perceived by the State Board at the time it drafted \u00a7 3.2. We are also satisfied that the use of the word \u201citself\u201d in the Statewide Plan and by the special committee to describe the restriction on the granting of undergraduate degrees was designed to differentiate the University acting alone from its acting through joint programs with other schools.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">We conclude that \u00a7 3.2 prohibits the granting of undergraduate degrees in any field by the University acting alone, but does not preclude the University\u2019s participation in joint degree programs in collaboration with other colleges and universities. In this manner the Legislature substantially mitigated the \u201chigher education community\u2019s concern\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> regarding competition from the University while allowing appropriate use of the University\u2019s resources and expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">The context of \u00a7 3.2\u2019s adoption supports our conclusion. As previously indicated, the 1970 Act did not expressly prohibit the granting of undergraduate degrees. Section 3.2 was adopted because chapter 325 changed the school\u2019s name from College to University. The education community became concerned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the term \u201cUniversity\u201d might connote enhanced degree-granting authority. Section 3.2 was drafted to allay those concerns. It expressly states that the new title \u201cdoes not imply a <em>future change </em>in its institutional mission <em>to permit </em>the granting of undergraduate degrees____\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, \u00a7 3.2 does not expressly or impliedly prohibit or disapprove of the college\u2019s programs in existence as of the day \u00a7 3.2 was enacted. As we have seen, some of those programs were joint undergraduate degree programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The program at issue is a joint degree program offered by MCC and the University\u2019s School of Health Related Professions. The program is comprised of general education courses and nursing courses at the MCC campus. University faculty will teach only the nursing courses. The Memorandum of Understanding contains other provisions regarding the program\u2019s administration. Based on our review of it we are satisfied that as a joint degree program it is within the University\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The State Board of Higher Education\u2019s resolution of April 27, 1990 authorizing the joint program and the provisional accreditation of the New Jersey State Board of Nursing is affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\"><em> L. </em>1970, <em>c. </em>102.
