Haines in Parts I, II and VI of his August 31, 1989, opinion, which is reported at 243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>656, 581 A.2d 125. Parts III, IV, V and VII concern the manner in which the Assignment Judge may proceed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>face of a disagreement with the Surrogate over their respective authority. Those matters are moot and are not the subject of the appeal. For that reason we do not comment on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">We have studied the recent opinion in <em>CWA Local 1044 v. The Honorable Chief Justice, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>495, 572 <em>A.2d </em>613 (1990). We find nothing in it inharmonious with Judge Haines\u2019 opinion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
