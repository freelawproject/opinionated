Prior to entering the order, Judge Harding took testimony at a hearing to resolve a preliminary question as to the applicability of the \u201cmerchant\u2019s exception\u201d under the Uniform Commercial Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-201(2). The judge concluded that the purported contract between the parties involved an \u201copen-ended option\u201d and not a \u201csale\u201d as defined by the Code and therefore the \u201cmerchant\u2019s exception\u201d did not apply. Consequently, he applied the general statute of frauds, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-5, and concluded that since the \u201clife span\u201d of the purported agreement exceeded one year, the contract was unenforceable to the extent it had not been performed by Eastman Kodak.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">On appeal, Madison argues that its contract with Eastman Kodak involved the \u201csale\u201d of zinc hydroxide sludge and therefore fell within the \u201cmerchant\u2019s exception\u201d to the Code\u2019s statute of frauds. Alternatively, it contends that the agreement was sufficiently \u201csigned\u201d by Eastman Kodak to satisfy the statute of frauds requirements under the Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-201(1) and (3)(b). It also asserts that Eastman Kodak should be estopped from raising the bar of the statute of frauds and that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Madison\u2019s motion to amend its complaint. Finally, it argues that the trial judge improperly considered oral testimony on Eastman Kodak\u2019s summary judgment motion. We reject each contention and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>The essential facts are not in dispute. Madison manufactures zinc salts. Eastman Kodak manufactures vitamin E at its Rochester, New York plant, using zinc to process the biologically non-active vitamin E to active vitamin E. The process generates a liquid waste stream of zinc chloride solution. Eastman Kodak converted the zinc chloride solution into zinc hydroxide sludge and, in the 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s, disposed of the sludge by paying chemical waste handlers to remove it to a landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In December 1981, Madison offered to purchase Eastman Kodak\u2019s zinc chloride solution for 10&lt;t per pound of zinc. In early 1982, the parties made an arrangement whereby Madison began removing the zinc chloride solution from Eastman Kodak\u2019s Rochester plant and transporting it to Madison\u2019s plant in Old Bridge, New Jersey, with Madison billing Eastman Kodak for the freight charges incurred by it and giving Eastman Kodak a credit for each pound of zinc it recovered from the waste solution. On February 22, 1982 Eastman Kodak forwarded a draft agreement under which it proposed that the sale and transportation arrangement continue for a one-year period, with an extension for an additional two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On March 5, 1982, Madison\u2019s representative, Hyman Bzura, wrote to Eastman Kodak suggesting an alternate pricing scheme based upon a concentration of zinc chloride ranging from 30% to 46%. In response, Eastman Kodak forwarded a second revised agreement on April 15, 1982 which incorporated Bzura\u2019s suggested alternate pricing scheme, changed the term of the contract from one to three years (with a provision for an automatic three-year extension), and stated that New Jersey law was to govern the agreement\u2019s interpretation. After discussing the second draft with Bzura, Dennis Zink, Eastman Kodak\u2019s sales supervisor, advised Bzura that he had to secure the formal approval of his supervisor before the agreement could be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>In April 1982, it was determined that the zinc chloride solution had caused damage to the rubber lining of Madison\u2019s tank wagons. As a result, the parties agreed that Madison would no longer remove the liquid solution, but would only take zinc hydroxide sludge. On May 27, 1982, Madison sent a revised draft agreement to Eastman Kodak which provided for a term of five years, with an option for an additional three-year term. The agreement contained the following reference to zinc hydroxide sludge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">Madison shall have the right of first refusal to purchase any zinc hydroxide in Kodak\u2019s possession. Kodak will do its best to rid the zinc hydroxide of chlorides (in any event no higher than 5% chloride contained). The purchase price shall be a loading charge of $200.00 per dump trailer load.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">On June 14, 1982, Eastman Kodak\u2019s attorney forwarded a revised draft of the agreement to Bzura which Bzura executed on September 16, 1982. However, Bzura added a sentence requiring Eastman Kodak to guarantee that its sludge would be 40% zinc, and asked Eastman Kodak officials to initial the addition. According to Madison, this sentence was a confirmation of Eastman Kodak\u2019s oral agreement regarding the purity of the sludge.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Eastman Kodak did not execute the revised draft because it knew that the waste sludge could not consistently contain 40% zinc. Although the agreement was not executed, Madison continued to receive zinc hydroxide sludge from Eastman Kodak until October 12, 1984. On that date, Eastman Kodak advised Madison that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">In light of the reduced volume of zinc hydroxide, it has been necessary to re-evaluate the present outlets of this by-product. Due to the limited amount of material it is necessary to reduce the number of our present outlets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">While service involving the pick ups of material has improved dramatically since January, I regret to inform you we have decided to discontinue supplying zinc hydroxide to your company at this time. Madison pays the lowest price per pound of zinc of any of our customers. This along with the continuing problem of a \u201cpast due account\u201d were the major consideration [sic] in reaching this decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">If production levels increase and the fore mentioned <em>[sic </em>] items can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties, we would again look forward to supplying your company zinc hydroxide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Madison thereupon instituted the present breach of contract suit. Eastman Kodak counterclaimed charging that Madison had caused additional handling expenses because of delays and had taken unauthorized deductions. Eastman Kodak moved for summary judgment and plaintiff cross-moved seeking leave to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, Judge Harding conducted a hearing to determine the intent of the parties as to the meaning of the term \u201cright of first refusal\u201d under the contract draft. Hyman Bzura testified on Madison\u2019s behalf that in the metal business a \u201cright of first refusal\u201d meant that the buyer would purchase the metal regardless of what happened, and if the price went up and the seller could sell to a third party at a higher price, then the buyer had the right of first refusal to meet the increased price or not buy the material.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">For the purpose of making his findings, Judge Harding assumed that \u201cthe letter and contract executed by Madison and returned to Kodak on September 16, 1982, confirm and embody a prior oral agreement between the parties, sufficient to comply with the terminology of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-201(2),\u201d the \u201cmerchant\u2019s exception\u201d to the Code\u2019s statute of frauds. That section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against such party unless written notice of objection to its contents is given within ten days after it is received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The judge recognized that in order for the \u201cmerchant\u2019s exception\u201d to apply, the contract between the parties must be a \u201csale\u201d as defined by the Code. In granting summary judgment in Eastman Kodak\u2019s favor, the judge concluded that while the term \u201cright of first refusal\u201d is used in the agreement, \u201cthe arrangement is more similar to an open-ended option granted to Madison.\u201d He reached this conclusion by noting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">The expressed terms and clear meaning regarding the zinc sludge transactions required Kodak to offer Madison all the zinc hydroxide produced from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>plant. It is an output obligation on Kodak\u2019s part and the only way to avoid the requirement is not to have a waste stream, an unlikely contingency. But according to the contract, Madison had no obligation to buy. It merely had a first right to purchase the output at $200. per load.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The judge rejected the testimony of Madison\u2019s witnesses at the hearing, first because the contract provided that it could not be supplemented or modified by testimony as to usage of the trade, and second, because even if the Code applied, the clear and unambiguous language of the agreement precluded parol evidence as to its meaning. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>12A:1-205(4). He concluded that since an \u201coption\u201d is not a \u201csale\u201d under the Code, the \u201cmerchant\u2019s exception\u201d did not apply and thus the agreement was governed and barred by the statute of frauds, <em>N.J. S.A. </em>25:1-5. He therefore dismissed Madison\u2019s complaint and granted summary judgment on Eastman Kodak\u2019s counterclaim in the amount of $818.10. He also denied Madison\u2019s motion to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> Preliminarily, we find no error in Judge Harding having conducted a fact-finding hearing prior to the summary judgment motion. The fact finding was essential to resolve the legal question of whether the \u201cmerchant\u2019s exception\u201d applied to the transaction. Ultimately, the judge was required to determine whether the contract was for the \u201csale\u201d of goods under the Code. To make that determination, he chose to explore the intent of the parties, at Madison\u2019s request, in their use of the term \u201cright of first refusal.\u201d We agree with the judge\u2019s observation that the hearing was akin to that conducted under <em>Lopez v. Swyer, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>267, 275-276, 300 A.2d 563 (1973), where the court addressed the question whether the discovery rule requires relief from the statute of limitations in a personal injury case. In any event, even if conducting the hearing was error, it was clearly harmless since the judge excluded the testimony and decided the legal issues based solely on the uncontradicted facts before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Madison argues that the \u201cuncontroverted testimony\u201d and summary judgment proofs establish that the \u201cright of first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>refusal\u201d constituted a \u201csale\u201d under the Code. It therefore reasons that since Eastman Kodak made no objection to the agreement within ten days after its receipt, it was an enforceable agreement under the \u201cmerchant\u2019s exception.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-201(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-106(1) defines \u201csale\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">In this Chapter unless the context otherwise requires \u201ccontract\u201d and \u201cagreement\u201d are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. \u201cContract for sale\u201d includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A \u201csale\u201d consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (12A:2-401). A \u201cpresent sale\u201d means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Clearly, a \u201csale\u201d involves \u201cthe <em>passing of title </em>from the seller to the buyer for a price[.]\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>[emphasis added]. This may be accomplished by both a \u201cpresent sale of goods,\u201d or by a \u201ccontract to sell goods at a future time.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In either case, the transaction contemplates a transfer of property from one person to another for a consideration of value, without reference to the mode by which the consideration is payable. <em>See State v. Weissman, </em>73 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 281, 179 A.2d 748 (App.Div.), certif. den. 37 <em>N.J. </em>521, 181 A.2d 782 (1962). Simply stated, a \u201csale\u201d under the Code is a transfer of title to goods for consideration. <em>Amer. Container Corp. v. Hanley Trucking Corp., </em>111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 328, 268 A.2d 313 (Ch.Div.1970). Implicit is the unconditional obligations of the seller to pass title, and of the buyer to pay a valuable consideration therefor. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-301 (\u201c[t]he obligation of the seller is to transfer and deliver and that of the buyer is to accept and pay in accordance with the contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Whether the pertinent term in the contract here is a \u201cright of first refusal,\u201d as the plain language suggests, or an \u201copen-ended option\u201d to purchase, as found by Judge Harding, the transaction cannot be deemed a \u201csale\u201d of goods. A privilege of first refusal does not give the holder of the privilege the power to compel the owner to sell. It merely requires the owner, if and when he decides to sell, to offer the property to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the holder at a stipulated price. <em>Wellmore Builders, Inc. v. Wannier, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>456, 464, 140 A.2d 422 (App.Div.), certif. granted 27 <em>N.J. </em>320, 142 A.2d 710 (1958); <em>and see Mazzeo v. Kartman, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>223, 229, 560 A.2d 733 (App.Div.1989). Conversely, the holder is not compelled to buy at the designated or other price. <em>Wellmore, supra, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 464, 140 A.2d 422. Madison at best had a right to purchase all the zinc hydroxide sludge Eastman Kodak processed and tendered for sale. Eastman Kodak, however, had no unconditional obligation to sell the sludge, or even to process it. Indeed, Eastman Kodak had the right not to sell the sludge at all, and dispose of it by some other environmentally acceptable method. Nor did Madison have an unconditional obligation to buy all of the sludge Eastman Kodak tendered. Madison simply could have declined to buy all or part of the by-product for whatever reason. Clearly, the requisite elements of a \u201csale\u201d are absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The same is true if we deem the clause as being an \u201copen-ended option.\u201d An option is a binding <em>unilateral </em>contract whereby the owner offers to sell to the optionee at a specified price in the event the latter exercises the option, whether the owner is willing to part with ownership or not. <em>See State v. N.J. Zinc Co., </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>560, 576, 193 A.2d 244 (1963); <em>Wellmore, supra, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 464, 140 A.2d 422. The option is unilateral because the owner is bound by his offer, but no obligation is imposed upon the optionee. <em>State v. N.J. Zinc Co., supra, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 193 A.2d 244. Plainly the clause here is not a \u201csale\u201d because no bilateral obligation is created to compel Madison to purchase the sludge tendered by Eastman Kodak at a designated price.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In deciding whether the transaction involved a \u201csale\u201d of goods, Judge Harding properly rejected the parol evidence presented by Madison. A court may exclude parol evidence as to the meaning of a term if it finds that the parties intended the writing to be a <em>\u201ccomplete and exclusive </em>statement of the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>of the agreement[.]\u201d <em>See </em>White &amp; Summers, 1 <em>Uniform Commercial Code, </em>\u00a7 2-9 at 104 (3rd Ed.1988) [emphasis in original]. The purported agreement here stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">No terms, conditions, prior course of dealings, course of performance, <em>usage of trade, </em>understandings, purchase orders, or agreement purporting to modify, vary, supplement or explain any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, signed by representatives of both parties authorized to amend this Agreement. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Absent written acquiescence by Eastman Kodak, this clause barred Madison from modifying or explaining the terms of the purported agreement by parol evidence as to usage of the trade. Further, even if the Code applied, the parol evidence must be excluded since it was incompatible with the express terms of the agreement. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>12A:1-205(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Since the transaction did not involve a \u201csale\u201d of goods, the \u201cmerchant\u2019s exception\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-201(2) does not apply. Therefore, the purported agreement is unenforceable under the general statute of frauds, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-5, since it was not to be performed within one year from the making thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We agree with Eastman Kodak that even if the transaction here involved a \u201csale,\u201d Madison failed as a matter of law to satisfy the requisites of the \u201cmerchant\u2019s exception.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-201(2) contemplates a \u201cwriting in confirmation of the <em>contract </em>[.]\u201d [Emphasis added]. Hence, the section presupposes that an underlying oral agreement for the sale of goods had been reached by the parties. Stated differently, the writing which is enforceable against the party who receives it and does not object to it within ten days, must \u201cconfirm\u201d a previously concluded agreement as to all essential terms of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Here, Madison sent the signed contract draft back to Eastman Kodak on September 16, 1982 with an added sentence indicating that the zinc hydroxide must have a minimum content of 40%, and requested that Eastman Kodak initial the change when it executed the contract. In sending the revised contract back to Eastman Kodak, Madison made no reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>a previously concluded contract, or to a prior approval by Eastman Kodak of the added clause regarding 40% minimum content. Further, this proposed agreement, as amended, was never presented to Eastman Kodak\u2019s supervisor who, according to the record, was the only officer with authority to execute it. Because an essential term of the agreement was never agreed to by Eastman Kodak, the predicate \u201ccontract\u201d which is \u201cconfirmed\u201d in writing under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-201(2) was never reached. Therefore, the \u201cmerchant\u2019s exception\u201d would not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We have considered Madison\u2019s other contentions and find them without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E). We add only that Judge Harding properly rejected Madison\u2019s argument that the requisite \u201cwriting\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-201(1) was satisfied by Eastman Kodak\u2019s reference in its correspondence to the \u201csigned hydroxide contract.\u201d As the judge pointed out, the correspondence was not an admission, but simply acknowledged receipt of Madison\u2019s signed contract. Indeed, Eastman Kodak wrote to Madison on September 22, 1982 stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">Also, we have just received your copy of the signed zinc hydroxide contract and <em>we will be taking it up with DPI management in the very near future. </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Further, there is no basis to conclude that Eastman Kodak admitted that a contract was made in its \u201cpleading, testimony, or otherwise in court.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-201(3)(b). Finally, Madison has failed to satisfy the factual elements for a <em>prima facie </em>case of promissory estoppel. <em>See Royal Associates v. Concannon, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 91-92, 490 A.2d 357 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
