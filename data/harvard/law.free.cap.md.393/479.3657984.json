We shall hold that, under these circumstances, all of the relief sought by the complaint is available to a complainant and, therefore, the complaint in this case should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The appellant, Robert M. Ricketts, Jr. (sometimes, \u201cthe appellant\u201d or \u201cMr. Ricketts\u201d), and Mary C. Ricketts, the appellee (sometimes, \u201cthe appellee\u201d or \u201cMrs. Ricketts\u201d), were married on June 13, 1981 and that union produced three children: Robert III, now emancipated and, thus, not subject to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, Kathryn, who was born in 1987 and is emancipated, and Lawrence, who was born in 1989. It is unclear from the record when the parties\u2019 relationship began to deteriorate, but at some point, according to Mr. Ricketts, Mrs. Ricketts \u201cforced [him] out of the bedroom, thus terminating their marital relationship.\u201d Since that time, he alleges, the parties have not had marital relations, although they have continued to reside in the marital household with their children, albeit in separate bedrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">On July 16, 2002, Mr. Ricketts filed a complaint seeking a limited divorce and custody of their two minor children. He alleged, as grounds for the divorce, constructive desertion, offering in support, Mrs. Ricketts\u2019s alleged denial of marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>relations. On October 16, 2002, Mrs. Ricketts filed a Motion to Dismiss,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arguing that because the parties continued to live under the same roof, had not separated and, therefore, were not living separate and apart,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Ricketts\u2019s complaint for divorce was \u201cfatally defective\u201d and, thus, \u201cmust be dismissed.\u201d She made the same argument with regards to Mr. Ricketts\u2019s complaint for custody, stating that it too was \u201cfatally defective ... because the parties had not separated and were not living apart at the time of the filing of the Complaint.\u201d Responding to the appellee\u2019s motion, the appellant admitted that the parties were still living together in the same house, under the same roof,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but stated that this did not affect the validity of his complaint or the availability of the relief sought, i.e. limited divorce and custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The Circuit Court for Carroll County held a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss and the Response to the Motion to Dismiss. The court granted the appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Mr. Ricketts timely noted an appeal of the judgment dismissing his complaint to the Court of Special Appeals. While the case was pending in that court and prior to any proceedings, this Court, on its own initiative, issued the writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>certiorari. <em>Ricketts v. Ricketts, </em>380 Md. 230, 844 A.2d 427 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">A limited divorce,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which may be decreed for a limited or an indefinite period, Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 7-102(c) is \u201cone from bed and board. It grants unto the injured spouse the right to live separate and apart from the one at fault. However, the parties remain <em>man </em>and <em>wife, </em>and there is no severance of the marital bonds.\u201d <em>Courson v. Courson, </em>213 Md. 183, 188, 129 A.2d 917, 920 (1957). <em>See Thomas v. Thomas, </em>294 Md. 605, 609, 618, 451 A.2d 1215, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>1217, 1222 (1982), noting, in addition, that \u201c[t]his Court has said that \u2018a divorce a mensa et thoro is practically nothing more than judicial permission to live separate and apart,' \u201d quoting <em>Dougherty v. Dougherty, </em>187 Md. 21, 31, 48 A.2d 451 (1946). This is in contrast to an absolute divorce,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which effects a complete severance of the marital bond and entitles either of the parties, or both, to remarry. <em>Crise v. Smith, </em>150 Md. 322, 326, 133 A. 110, 111 (1926) (divorce a vinculo matrimonii ends all rights of either spouse dependent on marriage). <em>See also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Divorce, (8th Ed.2004), equating an absolute divorce with a divorce a vinculo matrimonii.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Among the grounds for a limited divorce is desertion. Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 7-102(a)(3) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Desertion may be constructive or actu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>al. <em>See, e.g., Walker v. Walker, </em>209 Md. 428, 431, 121 A.2d 195, 198 (1956). We have defined actual desertion as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201cthe voluntary separation of one of the married parties from the other, or the refusal to renew suspended cohabitation, without justification either in the consent or the wrongful conduct of the other party ... [Furthermore,] the separation and intention to abandon must concur, and desertion does not exist without the presence of both. The two need not begin at the same time, but desertion begins whenever to either one the other is added.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\"><em>Boyd v. Boyd, </em>177 Md. 687, 688, 11 A.2d 461, 464 (1940) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">What is required to constitute constructive desertion was addressed in <em>Scheinin v. Scheinin, </em>200 Md. 282, 89 A.2d 609 (1952). In that case, we said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">\u201cIt is accepted that any conduct of a husband that renders the marital relation intolerable and compels the wife to leave him may justify a divorce on the ground of constructive desertion, even though the conduct may not justify a divorce on the ground of cruelty. <em>Sullivan v. Sullivan, </em>[199 Md. 594, 600], 87 A.2d 604, 607 [(1952)]. Any misconduct of the husband will justify the wife in leaving him when it makes it impossible for her to live with him without loss of her health or self-respect, or gives her reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. If the husband\u2019s misconduct has been such as to render continuance of the marriage relation unbearable, justifying the wife in leaving him, he is the one who is guilty of desertion. <em>Polley v.

Gold, </em>191 Md. 533, 539, 62 A.2d 540[, 543 (1948)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 290, 89 A.2d at 612-13. <em>See Murphy v. Murphy, </em>248 Md. 455, 460, 237 A.2d 523, 525-526 (1968); <em>Ballan v. Ballan, </em>251 Md. 737, 740-743, 248 A.2d 871, 872 (1969), both cited by <em>Deckman v. Deckman, </em>15 Md.App. 553, 560, 292 A.2d 112, 115-116 (1972), for the proposition that it is constructive desertion when the misconduct of one spouse \u201cmakes it impossible for the other to continue to live with the erring spouse without loss of his or her health, or self respect or gives reasonable apprehension of bodily injury will justify the innocent spouse in leaving the other on the grounds of \u2018constructive desertion.\u2019 \u201d Unlike actual desertion, where it is the party deserted who has the cause for divorce, in instances of constructive desertion, it is the departing party who has the cause of action for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">To be sure, both actual desertion and constructive desertion generally require that one of the spouses physically leave the marital home. We have held, however, that constructive desertion may occur where both parties continue to live under the same roof. In <em>Scheinin, </em>we were emphatic and clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cIt is beyond question that there may be a desertion although the husband and wife continue to live under the same roof. For desertion, as applied to husband and wife, signifies something more than merely ceasing to live together. It means ceasing to live together as husband and wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aug\"><em>Id., </em>at 290-91, 89 A.2d at 613. <em>See Mower v. Mower, </em>209 Md. 413, 417, 121 A.2d 185, 186-187 (1956); <em>Kelsey v. Kelsey, </em>186 Md. 324, 326, 46 A.2d 627, 628 (1946); <em>Dotterweich v.

We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">\u201cthe true doctrine is believed to be that the statutory term \u2018desertion,\u2019 as applied to husband and wife, means a cessa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>tion of the marital relation; and this doctrine is in accord with the general principles of the divorce law ... [d]esertion implies something more than merely ceasing to cohabit or live together; for, as applied to husband and wife, it means the ceasing to live together as husband and wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\"><em>Fleegle, </em>136 Md. at 634, 110 A. at 890. <em>See also Crumlick v. Crumlick, </em>164 Md. 381, 381, 165 A. 189, 189 (1933). Thus, \u201cit is unquestionably the law in this State that permanent refusal of either the husband or the wife to have sexual intercourse with the other spouse, from no consideration of health or other good reason, constitutes matrimonial desertion although the parties continue to live in the same house.\u201d <em>Mower v. Mower, </em>209 Md. 413, 417, 121 A.2d 185, 186-187 (1956) (citations omitted). The fact that the spouses sleep in separate bedrooms or that they have ceased engaging in sexual relations does not per se establish constructive desertion, however. <em>Whitehurst v. Whitehurst, </em>257 Md. 685, 690, 264 A.2d 822, 825 (1970); <em>Parsons v. Parsons, </em>255 Md. 602, 604, 258 A.2d 437, 438 (1969); <em>Fortman v.

Additionally, when a husband and wife continue to live together without marital relations and yet neither makes any effort towards reconciliation, it is presumed that both spouses prefer to live under such circumstances, and, therefore, neither has a cause for divorce on the grounds of constructive desertion. <em>Davey v. Davey, </em>202 Md. 428, 432, 96 A.2d 606, 608 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">In the instant case, it is alleged by the appellant that Mrs. Ricketts denied him marital relations and forced him from the marital bedroom. Under Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 7-102(a)(3) of the Family Law Article and, pursuant to the aforementioned case law, if those allegations are established, the appellant is able to prove that they are true, Mr. Ricketts has cause for a limited divorce, notwithstanding that he and Mrs. Ricketts are still living under the same roof, those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>allegations, and the necessary inferences, may sufficiently establish, for pleading purposes, constructive desertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">To be sure, as we have seen, Mrs. Ricketts disputes Mr. Ricketts\u2019s entitlement to a limited divorce on the grounds of constructive desertion. It is her view and position that there is a \u201cfatal flaw\u201d in the appellant\u2019s allegations. That flaw is, she submits, the allegation that the parties are living under the same roof, not, therefore, separate and apart.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Constructive desertion, the appellee contends, in other words, may only be established when the parties are living separate and apart, that, in the absence of separation, there is no ground for divorce on that ground. Accordingly, her motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">This is thus an appeal from a judgment granting a motion to dismiss. As we made clear in <em>Afamefune ex rel. Afamefune v. Suburban Hosp., Inc., </em>385 Md. 677, 683, n. 4, 870 A.2d 592, 595 n. 4 (2005),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201cA motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim tests the sufficiency of the pleadings. Md. Rule 2-322(b)(2); <em>see Converge Services Group, LLC v.

Nor is there any contention made that the allegations are not well-pled. Accordingly, viewing the wellpled allegations and the permissible inferences as true and in the light most favorable to the appellant, the appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>complaint should not have been dismissed. The trial court erred in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The appellant does, however, have the burden of proving the facts he has alleged, <em>Owings v.

Indeed, prior to the amendment of the statute in 1929, the issue in this case would appear to have been decided. In <em>Barnard, supra, </em>referring to Md.Code (1924) Art. 16, \u00a7 80,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">\u201cFrom this language it will be seen that courts of equity in this state have full power, and it is their duty, to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>who shall have the custody, control and guardianship of minor children, and who shall be charged with their maintenance and support, when applied to by any of the persons mentioned in the statute; and this without regard to the question of whether or not the parents of said child or children have been divorced or are living apart.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>Id., </em>at 267, 145 A. at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Pertinent to the issue of parental custody over minor children, a provision addressing the subject was added to the Maryland Code in 1929.

As pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>to the issue this case presents for decision, \u00a7 5-203(d)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">\u201c(d)(1) If the parents live apart, a court may award custody of a minor child to either parent or joint custody to both parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\u201c(2) Neither parent is presumed to have any right to custody that is superior to the right of the other parent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">It is the fact that \u00a7 5-203(d)(1) uses the proviso, \u201cif the parties live apart,\u201d when addressing a court\u2019s award of custody to a parent that is at the heart of the appellee\u2019s argument and, apparently, was the basis for the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to dismiss the appellant\u2019s complaint for custody. The appellee thus argues that this introductory proviso limits the court\u2019s power to award custody to one parent over the other to those situations in which the parents are living apart, i.e those in which they are actually separated and not living under the same roof. She maintains this position notwithstanding \u00a7 1-201 and its clear and simple, though general, statement of the court\u2019s jurisdiction in parent-to-parent custody matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The appellant sees the matter quite differently. He submits, on the contrary, that \u00a7 1-201 does more than simply describe the court\u2019s jurisdiction; it instead is a grant of power, imbuing the courts with the responsibility to determine custody, visitation, and support regardless of whether the parents are divorced or physically separated. He relies on this Court\u2019s cases, decided both before and after the passage of Acts of 1929, ch. 561, reviewing the Circuit Courts\u2019 decisions with respect to parental custody where the parents were still living under the same roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The appellant has the better of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>As we have seen, it cannot be doubted that the fact that the parties are living under the same roof, have not physically separated, is not, alone, sufficient to justify the court in refusing to grant either party a divorce. On the contrary, as we have also seen, this Court has held, <em>see Kelsey, </em>186 Md. at 326, 46 A.2d at 628:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">\u201cAbandonment, within the contemplation of the divorce statute means something more than merely ceasing to live together; it means a cessation of the marital relation. Thus we recognize that a desertion may exist although the husband and wife live under the same roof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">If a divorce may be decreed when the parties are living under the same roof, it would make no sense, indeed, it would be illogical, to deny the court the right to determine the custody, and support of the children of that marriage and, to the extent required, establish visitation with respect to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\"> To be sure, \u00a7 5\u2014203(d)(1) unmistakably contains the requirement that \u201cthe parents live apart\u201d as a condition of the court awarding custody to either parent. And, viewing the statute in this context, as a self contained unit, that condition is both clear and unambiguous. It is well settled that when that is the case, we give effect to the words of the statute as written, we do not seek meaning or intent from any other source. Where, in other words, a statute is clear and unambiguous, logic will not substitute for, or trump, the clarity of the words. <em>Stanley v.

We also acknowledged that section \u201cas declaratory of the inherent power of courts of equity over minors, and [that] in the exercise thereof it should be exercised with the paramount purpose in view of securing the welfare and promoting the best interest of the children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Legislature did not disturb the courts\u2019 right to determine custody, support or visitation when a divorce was not decreed, even though, when it enacted Acts of 1929, ch. 561, it knew that it was the law that parties living under the same roof could be divorced. <em>Klein v.

Roth, </em>145 Md. 74, 125 A. 556 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">When so viewed, rather than clear and unambiguous, the phrase is ambiguous. <em>Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 689, 861 A.2d 727, 730 (2004); <em>Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. 642, 648, 689 A.2d 610, 613 (1997)(\u201c[s]tatutes that are clear when viewed separately may well be ambiguous where their application in a given situation, or when they operate together, is not clear.\u201d). <em>See also Sullins v.

Given the purpose of the courts\u2019 power over minors, to promote their best interest, and the connection between custody decisions and divorce, the logic of the result the legislation will effect may be considered when trying to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">This approach is consistent with the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scheinin v. Scheinin, </em>200 Md. 282, 89 A.2d 609 (1952). There, Mrs. Scheinin filed a complaint for a divorce a mensa et thoro, now a limited divorce pursuant to \u00a7 7-102, on the grounds of desertion and cruelty of treatment and, in addition, alimony, for custody of the children of the marriage, support, and counsel fees. <em>Id. </em>at 285, 89 A.2d at 610. There was much dissatisfaction between Mr. and Mrs. Scheinin. At the center of the dissatisfaction was Mr. Scheinin\u2019s relationship with his secretary, which Mrs. Scheinin alleged was the cause of his abandonment and ill-treatment of her. After her insistence that the secretary leave the marital home gained success, Mr. Scheinin, she stated, treated her \u201cwith great cruelty,\u201d spoke abusively to her, ridiculed her in front of the children and struck her \u201cmany times.\u201d Subsequently, Mr. Scheinin told Mrs. Scheinin that \u201che did not want to have anything more to do with her,\u201d whereupon Mrs. Scheinin, \u201cin consequence of that demand,\u201d moved to a back bedroom which she used as her bedroom, thereafter. She remained under the same roof with Mr. Scheinin, however, but without co-habitation, <em>id. </em>at 286-287, 89 A.2d at 611, and despite Mr. Scheinin\u2019s cruelty and disregard. <em>Id. </em>When asked why she did not leave with her children, Mrs. Scheinin stated that \u201cshe had no place to go.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291, 89 A.2d at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The chancellor granted Mrs. Scheinin a limited divorce on the ground of constructive desertion and awarded her alimony, custody of the children, and child support. <em>Id. </em>at 290-291, 89 A.2d at 612-613. We affirmed the decree granting Mrs. Scheinin a limited divorce, noting that \u201c[i]t is beyond question that there may be a desertion although the husband and wife continue to live under the same roof.\u201d Without referring to Art. 75A, \u00a7 1, which then prescribed the \u201cliving apart\u201d requirement, but defining desertion in the marital context in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>terms of \u201cceasing to live together as husband and wife,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 290-91, 89 A.2d at 613, the Court also affirmed the custody and support decision, thus sanctioning the determination of custody and support where the parents, rather than living apart, are living under the same roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\"><em>Mower v. Mower, </em>209 Md. 413, 121 A.2d 185 (1956), though by no means identical, is nevertheless instructive.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In that case, Mrs. Mower sought a limited divorce from Mr. Mower, pendente lite alimony, custody of their child, child support, and attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 415, 121 A.2d at 185. When Mrs. Mower filed for divorce and also when the case was tried, both parties were living under the same roof, but had not had marital relations in several years. <em>Id. </em>at 416, 121 A.2d at 185. Since neither party had made an effort at reconciliation, the trial court refused to grant a divorce to either party, finding that both of them were at fault, as they were content to live in a state of animosity and estrangement and that, therefore, no desertion had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 416-17, 121 A.2d at 186. It then dismissed the bill of complaint. This Court agreed that neither party was entitled to a divorce, <em>id. </em>at 417-19, 121 A.2d at 186-87; however, it reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Mrs. Mower\u2019s bill of complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 121 A.2d at 187. Referring to Art. 16, \u00a7 34, empowering the equity courts to decide custody issues presented in a divorce action, whether a divorce is decreed or not, the Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201cWhere a bill for divorce <em>a mensa et thoro </em>also prays for custody of a minor child and for its support and maintenance, and the divorce is denied, the bill should not be dismissed but custody should be awarded and jurisdiction should be retained for the purpose of awarding support and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>maintenance if the circumstances should warrant such action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 419-20, 121 A.2d at 188. The record does not reflect that the parties\u2019 living arrangements changed during the proceedings. Consequently, it must be presumed that this Court, in directing the trial court to consider the wife\u2019s bill for custody, did so notwithstanding that Mr. and Mrs. Mower were living under the same roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">This result and this approach are consistent with the primacy of the interests of the child and the courts\u2019 paramount concern \u201cto secure the welfare and promote the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Stancill v.

Before enactment of the Family Law Article, <em>see </em>Acts 1984, ch. 296, \u00a7 2, eff. Oct. 1, 1984, a limited divorce was denominated a divorce a mensa et thoro. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957) Art. 16, \u00a7 25. That section provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">\"Divorces a mensa et thoro may be decreed for the following cases, to wit: First, cruelty of treatment; secondly, excessive vicious conduct; thirdly, abandonment and desertion; and the court may decree such divorces forever, or for a limited time; and in all cases where divorce a mensa et thoro is decreed, it may be revoked at any time thereafter by the court granting the same, upon joint application of the parties to be discharged from the operation of the decree; and the court may decree a divorce a mensa et thoro in cases where a divorce a vinculo matrimonii is prayed, it the causes proved to be sufficient to entitle the party to the same; and in all cases where a divorce is decreed, the court passing the same shall have full power to award the wife such property or estate as she had when married, or the value of the same, or of such part thereof as may have been sold or converted by the husband, having regard to the circumstances of the husband at the time of the divorce, or such part of any such property as the court may deem reasonable; and shall also have power in all cases in which the care and custody of the children of parties forms part of the relief prayed whether a divorce a divorce is decreed or denied to order and direct who shall have the guardianship and custody of the children pendente lite or permanently, and be charged with their support and relation to the children\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">A divorce a mensa et thoro has been defined by Black's Law Dictionary 431 (5th ed.1979) as a \"partial or qualified divorce, by which the parties are separated and forbidden to live or cohabit together, without affecting the marriage itself.\u201d The 8th Edition notes that \"a mensa et thoro\u201d is derived from the Latin, \"from board and hearth,\u201d thus, such a divorce is the forerunner of the judicial separation, \"A partial or qualified divorce by which the parties were separated and allowed or ordered to live apart, but remained technically married.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b523-6\">. Prior to enactment of the Family Law Article, the term used to refer to an absolute divorce was \"a vinculo matrimonii.\u201d <em>See </em>Art. 16, \u00a7 24 (as pertinent, \u2018\u2018Upon a hearing of any bill for a divorce, the court may decree a divorce a vinculo matrimonii for the following causes.... \u201d).

This section addresses only the issue of the custody of the minor child or children, not support or visitation.
