Although we determine that flight instructions are not <em>per se </em>improper, we conclude, nevertheless, that the trial judge abused his discretion in the case at bar in providing a flight instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">On July 17, 2002, Noah Gottesman, William Beaver, and Bradley Kelly were walking back to their hotel near the Inner Harbor in Baltimore City after dinner. On the 1300 block of East Pratt Street, two men <em>on </em>bicycles approached the trio. One of the men said, \u201cI\u2019ll make this easy. Put your wallets on the ground.\u201d Messrs. Gottesman, Beaver, and Kelly did not stop. The would-be robber pulled a gun, and Messrs. Gottesman, Beaver, and Kelly ran as at least five shots were fired, one of which hit Mr. Gottesman in the right arm. At the end of the block, two men in a sports utility vehicle stopped and offered to take Messrs. Gottesman, Beaver, and Kelly to the hospital, an offer which was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Police officers met them at the hospital. After interviewing Messrs. Gottesman, Beaver, and Kelly, the officers broadcast-ed that they were looking for an African-American male with corn rows, who was approximately twenty-five years old, wearing a baggy white t-shirt and jeans or jean shorts on a bicycle accompanied by another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Detective Frank Mundy arrived at the location of the shooting and saw Warren Thompson, the Petitioner, who fit the broadcast description, on a bicycle. Detective Mundy ran toward him, identified himself as a police officer, and yelled for him to stop. Mr. Thompson saw Detective Mundy and continued to pedal faster away from him. Detective Mundy lost sight of him, but within five minutes, other police officers caught Mr. Thompson within a mile. When he was apprehended, the police recovered a significant quantity of cocaine on Mr. Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Mr. Thompson was charged with three counts each of attempted first degree murder, attempted second degree murder, first degree assault, second degree assault, use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, reckless endangerment, and one count each of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun illegal possession of a regulated firearm, possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to manufacture and distribute, and possession of a controlled dangerous substance</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">At a pretrial hearing held on July 15, 2003 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Mr. Thompson argued that, due to some anomalies in the chain of custody of the cocaine recovered from him when he was arrested, the drugs, the results of the chemical analysis conducted by the police and any statements made by Mr. Thompson concerning the drugs should be suppressed. The State opposed Mr. Thompson\u2019s motion and asserted that the drugs were admissible, regardless of any issues in the chain of custody, because Mr. Thompson made statements to the police acknowledging his possession of the drugs. The Circuit Court took the matter under advisement and two days later, immediately prior to the impaneling of the jury, ruled that the cocaine, the results of the chemical analysis, and those portions of Mr. Thompson\u2019s statement to police regarding his possession of the drugs were inadmissible. The court also dismissed the charges arising out of his possession of controlled dangerous substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">During the trial, the prosecution called Messrs. Gottesman, Beaver, and Kelly, each of whom testified concerning the events on July 17, 2002 and identified Mr. Thompson as the shooter. The prosecution also called Baltimore City Detective Frank Mundy, who interviewed the victims and Mr. Thompson after his arrest. Detective Mundy testified that Mr. Thompson fled on his bicycle when Detective Mundy approached and identified himself as the police. The prosecution also played a redacted version of a tape recording of Detective Mundy and Baltimore City Detective Mike Debord\u2019s conversation with Mr. Thompson. The defense called Detective Debord, who testified concerning Mr. Gottesman\u2019s failure to identify Mr. Thompson as the shooter after viewing a photo array. Mr. Thompson also called Mr. Joseph Harant, a criminalist with the Baltimore City Police Department Laboratory in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Trace Analysis Unit, who testified that there was no gunshot residue on Mr. Thompson\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">At the close of the case, included in the instructions given to the jury was the following instruction on flight:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">A person\u2019s flight immediately after the commission of a crime or after being accused of committing a crime is not enough by itself to establish guilt, but it is a fact that may be considered by you as evidence of guilt. Flight under these circumstances may be motivated by a variety of factors, some of which are fully consistent with innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">You must first decide whether there is evidence of flight. If you decide there is evidence of flight, you must then decide whether the Defendant\u2019s flight shows consciousness of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">On July 21, 2003, the jury acquitted Mr. Thompson of the counts of first degree assault and second degree assault relating to Messrs. Beaver and Kelly, but was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining counts of attempted murder, assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, reckless endangerment, wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, and illegal possession of a regulated firearm with respect to Messrs. Beaver and Kelly. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on any of the charges concerning Mr. Gottesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">The State elected to retry Mr. Thompson only with respect to the charges relating to Mr. Gottesman, which included one count of: attempted first degree murder, attempted second degree murder, first degree assault, second degree assault, reckless endangerment, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, and possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying crime. As with the first trial, the tape recording of Mr. Thompson\u2019s statements to the police that he fled was played again for the jury and a transcript of the statement also was provided, without objection. The State also called Detective Mundy to testify, which he did as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>[THE STATE]: Where were you when you first saw the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\">[DETECTIVE MUNDY]: I was in the 1100 block of East Pratt Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">[THE STATE]: Where was he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">[DETECTIVE MUNDY]: He was on a bicycle heading\u2014I guess it would be westbound on the 1100 block of East Pratt Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">[THE STATE]: If you could help us out, is that towards the Inner Harbor or away from the Inner Harbor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"And\">[DETECTIVE MUNDY]: It would be towards the Inner Harbor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">[THE STATE]: What did you personally do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">[DETECTIVE MUNDY]: I attempted to approach the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">[THE STATE]: Okay. Did you walk toward him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adb\">[DETECTIVE MUNDY]: Well, I had to run up to him because he was pedaling a bicycle away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">[THE STATE]: Okay. Did you say, \u201cStop, police\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASx\">[DETECTIVE MUNDY]: Well, what happened was, when I started running up towards him, he turned around and saw me, and he started to pedal away faster, and I did yell at that point to stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-13\">[THE STATE]: Okay. Before he saw you\u2014I mean, before he started to pedal away, when you first approached him, did you have your gun drawn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-14\">[DETECTIVE MUNDY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-15\">[THE STATE]: Did you say, \u201cStop, police\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-16\">[DETECTIVE MUNDY]: No, I don\u2019t think I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-17\">[THE STATE]: Okay. As he pedaled away, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-18\">[DETECTIVE MUNDY]: What, after he saw me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-19\">[THE STATE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>[DETECTIVE MUNDY]: After he saw me and he pedaled away, I called it out to try to get him stopped.

He started pedaling faster away and I yelled, \u201cStop, police!\u201d I don\u2019t know for certain that he heard me, but ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">Mr. Thompson did not object to the admission of the evidence concerning his flight from police, although he did object to the form of the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">During the bench conference preceding the jury instructions, the State requested a flight instruction and the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-13\">[THE STATE]: The State would also ask for [Maryland Pattern Jury Instruction\u2014Criminal] 3:24,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>], which is flight of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would like to be heard on that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>THE COURT: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, the previous motion suppressed drugs that allegedly were found on Mr. Warren\u2019s person\u2014Mr. Thompson\u2019s person\u2014and in his statement, which was redacted from the jury, he says basically, \u201cI ran because I was dirty.\u201d That was redacted. Now, if you let this flight instruction in front of the jury, they\u2019re going to think that he ran because he committed the shooting, not perhaps the real reason: he ran because he was dirty. That was kept from the jury and I think this is misleading, given the facts that the jury actually did hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">THE COURT: Well, the instruction says, \u201cFlight under these circumstances may be motivated by a variety of factors, some of which are fully consistent with innocence,\u201d or at least innocence of this crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I can\u2019t think, even though you are reading that in a light that\u2019s helpful to the defense, if any defense attorney has ever asked for a flight instruction, Your Honor. I definitely believe\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">THE COURT: No, why would the defense ask for a flight instruction. No, I know, that\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, I think the State wants this because it\u2019s going to say he ran because he\u2019s the shooter and that\u2019s not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">THE COURT: Well, that is a permissible inference that they could draw from the evidence, but there\u2019s other inferences and that\u2019s explained right in there. I mean, frankly, it\u2019s a judgment call. I mean, you could have let go into evidence this other issue as an explanation for why he ran away. I mean, you balance the equities and you make a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I just said if this jury instruction is taken in the light of the facts this jury has actually heard, it\u2019s misleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>THE COURT: I don\u2019t think so. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The court gave the following instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">A person\u2019s flight or concealment immediately after the commission of a crime or after being accused of committing a crime is not enough to establish guilt, but it is a fact that may be considered by you as evidence of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">Flight under these circumstances may be motivated by a variety of factors, some of which may be fully consistent with innocence. You must' first decide whether there\u2019s evidence of flight. If you decide there\u2019s evidence of flight, you must then decide whether this flight shows a consciousness of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">At the close of the instructions to the jury, the defense counsel objected to the giving of the flight instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The jury in the second trial acquitted Mr. Thompson of attempted first degree murder and attempted second degree murder, but convicted him, with respect to Mr. Gottesman, of first degree assault, second degree assault, reckless endangerment, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, and possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying crime. On May 14, 2004, the court denied Mr. Thompson\u2019s motion for a new trial and sentenced him to a forty-year term of imprisonment, with the first five years without eligibility for parole. On May 20, 2004, Mr. Thompson noted his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, concluded that flight instructions given in criminal cases are not <em>per se </em>improper and have consistently been upheld by this Court. <em>Thompson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 652, 673-74, 884 A.2d 678, 691 (2005). Moreover, the intermediate appellate court determined that the evidence of flight was sufficient to support the giving of the instruction in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">On November 18, 2005, Mr. Thompson filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court and presented the following issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>1. Should this Court join the growing number of jurisdictions which have held that a flight instruction should never be given in a criminal case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">2. Assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that it is not improper <em>per se </em>to give a flight instruction, did the trial court err in instructing the jury that it could consider petitioner\u2019s flight as evidence of guilt where the court knew of a probable alternative explanation for the flight of which the jury was unaware?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">On January 9, 2006, we granted the petition and issued the writ. <em>Thompson v. State, </em>890 Md. 500, 889 A.2d 418 (2006). We determine that flight instructions are not <em>per se </em>improper in criminal cases, but we conclude, however, that the trial judge abused his discretion in providing a flight instruction to the jury in the case at bar. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Mr. Thompson argues that there is no legitimate reason for instructing jurors that they can consider flight as evidence of guilt. He asserts that the other jury instructions concerning evidence adequately inform the jury that it may make inferences from circumstantial evidence. According to Mr. Thompson, when a trial court gives a jury the flight instruction, that evidence is impermissibly emphasized by the court, which results in the prosecution receiving an unfair advantage. He further contends that giving a flight instruction is misleading because it improperly strengthens the questionable value of evidence of flight. Mr. Thompson argues that the flight instruction is inherently confusing for jurors because they would most likely not understand the distinction between \u201cevidence of guilt\u201d and \u201cnot enough to establish guilt.\u201d Therefore, Mr. Thompson urges this Court to join with those jurisdictions that have disallowed the use of flight instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Alternatively, Mr. Thompson asserts that if this Court were to conclude that it is not <em>per se </em>improper to give a flight instruction, the trial court should not have given the instruction in the present case. He claims that because the parties and the court knew of circumstances that did not support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>inference that Mr. Thompson fled because he was guilty of the shooting, the trial court should not have encouraged that jury to make such an inference. Mr. Thompson argues that the evidence presented in the case <em>sub judice </em>does not support the giving of the flight instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Conversely, the State contends that this Court should reaffirm its acceptance of flight instructions under proper circumstances and remain in agreement with the majority of other jurisdictions. Moreover, the State argues that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by instructing the jury on flight. Furthermore, the State notes that Thompson did not object to the introduction of the evidence of his flight and therefore, the record contained sufficient evidence to support a flight instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\n<em>Flight Instructions Are Not Per Se Improper</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Mr. Thompson urges this Court to overrule our precedent approving jury instructions on flight and determine that such instructions are <em>per se </em>improper. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Maryland Rule 4-325 governs the giving of instructions to the jury. Specifically, Section (c) of the Rule addresses instructions that are requested by the parties; that section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">(c) How given. The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">Md. Rule 4-325. We have interpreted Rule 4-325(c) as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">requiring] the trial court to give a requested instruction under the following circumstances: (1) the requested instruction is a correct statement of the law; (2) the requested instruction is applicable under the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the requested instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in the jury instruction actually given. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Md. Rule 4-325(c); <em>Evans v. State, </em>333 Md. 660, 691, 637 A.2d 117, 132, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 833, 115 S.Ct. 109, 130 L.Ed.2d 56 (1994).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><em>Ware v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 58, 702 A.2d 699, 718 (1997). Only the first factor is independent of the facts of the case in which it is given, which results in it being determinative of whether the instruction on flight is <em>per se </em>improper. Therefore, we shall examine whether the flight instruction as given in the case <em>sub judice, </em>which is identical to Maryland Pattern Jury Instruction\u2014Criminal 3:24, accurately reflects the law of the State of Maryland.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">The instruction at issue in the present case provided: A person\u2019s flight or concealment immediately after the commission of a crime or after being accused of committing a crime is not enough to establish guilt, but it is a fact that may be considered by you as evidence of guilt....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">Flight under these circumstances may be motivated by a variety of factors, some of which may be fully consistent with innocence. You must first decide whether there\u2019s evidence of flight. If you decide there\u2019s evidence of flight, you must then decide whether this flight shows a consciousness of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">We have consistently held that although \u201c[f]light by itself is not sufficient to establish the guilt of the defendant,\u201d <em>Sorrell v. State, </em>315 Md. 224, 228, 554 A.2d 352, 353 (1989), it \u201cis a factor that may be considered in determining guilt.\u201d <em>Davis v. State, </em>237 Md. 97, 105, 205 A.2d 254, 259 (1964). Moreover, we have noted that flight may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt by the defendant. <em>Westcoat v. State, </em>231 Md. 364, 368, 190 A.2d 544, 546 (1963). Concomitantly, we have recognized that a defendant\u2019s flight may be motivated by reasons unconnected to the offense at issue in the case and that the determination as to the motivation for flight is properly entrusted to the jury. <em>See Hunt v. State, </em>312 Md. 494, 508-09, 540 A.2d 1125, 1132 (1988). Thus, based on the foregoing cases, the instruction is substantively accurate with respect to the law of the State of Maryland on flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>We have consistently upheld the propriety of flight instructions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See e.g., Sorrell v. State, </em>315 Md. 224, 554 A.2d 352 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>(1989); <em>Young v. State, </em>234 Md. 125, 130, 198 A.2d 91, 94 (1964). As we have previously noted, \u201cWe are cognizant of the importance of <em>stare decisis </em>and the resulting certainty, definition, and dependability it gives the law.\u201d <em>Willey v. State, </em>328 Md. 126, 137, 613 A.2d 956, 961 (1992), quoting <em>B &amp; K Rentals v. Universal Leaf, </em>324 Md. 147, 158, 596 A.2d 640, 645 (1991); <em>Conteh v. Conteh, </em>392 Md. 436, 448, 897 A.2d 810, 817 (2006) (discussing the application of <em>stare </em>decisis); <em>Livesay v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 1, 15, 862 A.2d 33, 41 (2004) (observing that under <em>stare decisis </em>principles \u201cdeparture from the rule should be the extraordinary case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>In support of his position that the instruction should be held <em>per se </em>improper, Mr. Thompson argues, nonetheless, that in giving the flight instruction to the jury, the judge is impermissibly emphasizing one piece of circumstantial evidence over the remainder of the prosecution\u2019s case. Moreover, he asserts that the general instructions on direct and circumstantial evidence and what constitutes evidence, which were given in this case, adequately address the issues delineated in the flight instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"> As Judge Learned Hand observed in <em>United States v. Heitner, </em>149 F.2d 105, 107 (2d Cir.1945), \u201cflight is a circumstance from which .. . everyone in daily life inevitably would infer (guilt),\u201d so that the instruction serves as a reminder to the jury that it would be inappropriate to presume guilt from the act of flight. Similarly, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Miller v. United States, </em>320 F.2d 767 (D.C.Cir.1963), described the purpose of the instruction as, \u201cto caution against the dangers of drawing conclusions from superficial consideration of experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 773, n. 14. We agree and conclude that the instruction does not impermissibly emphasize the importance of evidence of flight; rather, it attempts to insure that the jury does not imbue evidence of flight with more weight than it deserves.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The substance of the flight instruction is not adequately covered by the two other instructions highlighted by Mr. Thompson. The evidence instruction, Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions\u2014Criminal 3:00, informs jurors that they \u201cmay draw any reasonable inferences or conclusions from the evidence that [they] believe to be justified by common sense and [their] own experiences;\u201d likewise, the instruction on circumstantial evidence, Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions\u20143.01, explains to the jury that circumstantial evidence should be given the same weight as direct evidence. Although these instructions address the issue of the jury\u2019s ability to draw inferences from the evidence and the weight to be given to circumstantial evidence, they do not encompass the entirety of the flight instruction\u2019s admonition to the jury that the defendant\u2019s flight may not have been motivated by a consciousness of guilt, which might be the general conclusion of people as noted in <em>Heitner, </em>149 F.2d at 107. Therefore, the general jury instructions regarding inferences from the evidence generally, and the appropriate weight to be given to circumstantial evidence in particular, are not adequate to render the flight instruction superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Moreover, there are circumstances in which flight evidence and a flight instruction are necessary. In <em>Sorrell, </em>we concluded that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the permissible inferences from the defendant\u2019s flight in the midst of his trial where the circumstances indicated that the absence was voluntary and an attempt to evade conviction. 315 Md. at 229-32, 554 A.2d at 354-55. We further concluded that the state could discuss the defendant\u2019s absence to avoid prejudice to its case, and as such the court could, in its discretion, give the instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 229, 554 A.2d at 354. Flight evidence and a jury instruction on flight also are particularly appropriate in circumstances where a defendant places his or her mental status at the time that the crime was committed in issue. In <em>People v. Moon, </em>37 Cal.4th 1, 32 Cal.Rptr.3d 894, 117 P.3d 591 (2005), Richard Moon was charged with the first degree murders of his former girlfriend and her mother. <em>Id. </em>at 596. At trial, the prosecution intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>duced evidence that Moon observed police converging on his motel room and fled. <em>Id. </em>at 598. When police arrested him, Moon confessed to killing the two women. <em>Id. </em>at 597. The trial court instructed the jury that it could \u201cconsider defendant\u2019s flight after the crime as circumstantial evidence of his guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608. Before the California Supreme Court, Moon argued that the court erred in giving the instruction because the inference \u201cthat he suffered a guilty conscience and thus probably killed the victims, was irrelevant because he admitted having killed them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although he admitted to the murders, Moon contested his mental state at the time of the killings. <em>Id. </em>The California Supreme Court determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">[e]ven if he conceded at trial his guilt of some form of criminal homicide, \u2018the prosecution is still entitled to prove its case and especially to prove a fact so central to the basic question of guilt as intent.\u2019 We have previously rejected the notion that the flight instruction is improper when an accused concedes the issue of identity and merely contests his mental state at the time of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>Id. </em>Therefore, the court concluded that flight instructions are proper not only because flight evidence is relevant to the ultimate issue of guilt, but also because it is circumstantial evidence of intent. <em>Id. </em>Thus, because flight evidence may be probative with respect to intent as well as guilt, we decline to hold that giving a flight instruction is <em>per se </em>improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The position urged upon this Court by Mr. Thompson has been adopted by a minority of our sister states. <em>See Hadden v. State, </em>42 P.3d 495, 508 (Wyo.2002) (determining that the giving of a flight instruction is reversible error because it impermissibly emphasizes a single piece of circumstantial evidence); <em>Dill v. State, </em>741 N.E.2d 1230, 1233 (Ind.2001) (concluding that the flight instruction should not be given because it is \u201cconfusing, unduly emphasizes specific evidence, and is misleading\u201d); <em>State v. Hall, </em>297 Mont. 111, 991 P.2d 929, 937 (1999) (holding that flight instructions should not be given because of the limited probative value of the evidence); <em>Fenelon v. State, </em>594 So.2d 292, 295 (Fla.1992) (determining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201cthe better policy in future cases where evidence of flight has been properly admitted is to reserve comment to counsel\u201d due to the disagreement over what kind and what amount of evidence will support the giving of a flight instruction); <em>Renner v. State, </em>260 Ga. 515, 397 S.E.2d 683, 686 (1990) (holding that \u201cwhile the state may offer evidence of and argue flight, it shall be reversible error for a trial court in a criminal case to charge the jury on flight\u201d because the instruction could be interpreted by the jury as implying that the trial court believes there to be evidence of flight that indicates a consciousness of guilt of the defendant); <em>State v. Cathey, </em>241 Kan. 715, 741 P.2d 738, 748-49 (1987) (disapproving of flight instructions because it \u201cemphasize[s] and single[s] out certain evidence admitted at a criminal trial\u201d); <em>State v. Grant, </em>275 S.C. 404, 272 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1980) (holding that flight instructions are either an unnecessary \u201csanction [of] the use of circumstantial evidence\u201d or improper comment that \u201cplacets] undue emphasis upon that evidence\u201d); <em>State v. Stilling, </em>285 Or. 293, 590 P.2d 1223, 1230 (1979) (stating that the \u201csignificance of flight should be left to argument\u201d); <em>State v. Reed, </em>25 Wash.App. 46, 604 P.2d 1330, 1333 (1979) (observing that evidence of flight should be \u201creserved for counsel\u2019s argument, with little if any comment by the bench\u201d because of the danger of \u201cplac[ing] undue emphasis upon that evidence.\u201d); <em>State v. Fleming, </em>523 S.W.2d 849, 854 (Mo.Ct.App.1975) (noting that the Missouri Supreme Court had prospectively barred flight instructions). Because we have determined that the flight instruction may be appropriate under certain circumstances, and that, as the instruction appears in the Maryland Patter Jury Instructions, the flight instruction does not impermissibly emphasize the value of flight evidence, we decline to adopt the position that flight instructions are <em>per se </em>improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\n<em>The Flight Instruction Was Improper In The Case Sub Judice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Mr. Thompson argues that even if this Court concludes that flight instructions are not <em>per se </em>improper, the trial judge abused his discretion in giving the flight instruction in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>present case because the necessarily circumscribed universe of facts presented to the jury rendered the instruction misleading. Conversely, the State contends that because Mr. Thompson did not object to the admission of the flight evidence, although he knew that the jury would not be informed of his asserted alternate motivation for fleeing from the police, the instruction was proper. We conclude that the trial judge abused his discretion in giving the flight instruction under the circumstances presented in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We review a trial judge\u2019s decision whether to give a jury instruction under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 177, 729 A.2d 910, 934 (1999); <em>Gunning v. State, </em>347 Md. 332, 353-54, 701 A.2d 374, 384 (1997). In <em>Thomas v. State, </em>372 Md. 342, 812 A.2d 1050 (2002), we adopted the four-prong test set forth by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States v. Myers, </em>550 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir.1977), with respect to the probative value of evidence indicating consciousness of guilt and the rubric for assessing the propriety of jury instructions based on such evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In <em>Myers, </em>the defendant was charged with three counts of armed bank robbery and was subsequently convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 1039. On appeal, Myers argued that the trial court erred \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>instructing the jury concerning the proper use of evidence indicating that he fled from FBI agents on two occasions ... subsequent to the commission of the robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1048. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that the probative value of flight evidence as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOS\">circumstantial evidence of guilt depends upon the degree of confidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (1) from the defendant\u2019s behavior to flight; (2) from flight to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1049. Moreover, the Court held that \u201ca flight instruction is improper unless the evidence is sufficient to furnish reasonable support for all four of the necessary inferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1050, citing <em>Morris v. United States, </em>326 F.2d 192, 195 (9th Cir.1963); <em>State v. Bruton, </em>66 Wash.2d 111, 401 P.2d 340, 341-42 (1965); E. Cleary, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 271 at 655 n. 3 (rev. ed.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">We agree with those jurisdictions which have determined that a flight instruction should not be given unless the four inferences explicated in <em>Myers </em>reasonably may be drawn. Therefore, for an instruction on flight to be given properly, the following four inferences must reasonably be able to be drawn from the facts of the case as ultimately tried: that the behavior of the defendant suggests flight; that the flight suggests a consciousness of guilt; that the consciousness of guilt is related to the crime charged or a closely related crime; and that the consciousness of guilt of the crime charged suggests actual guilt of the crime charged or a closely related crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">It is the third inference, that the consciousness of guilt was consciousness of guilt of the crimes for which he was on trial, that is at issue in the case <em>sub judice. Myers, </em>550 F.2d at 1049; <em>Thomas, </em>372 Md. at 352, 812 A.2d at 1056. In <em>Thomas, </em>we examined the effect of the third <em>Myers </em>prong:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">It is the <em>Myers </em>third prong, from consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged, that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the instant case is particularly important. Knowledge that the person is suspected of the charged crime is important because the value of the conduct lies in the culprit\u2019s knowledge that he or she has committed the charged offense and in his or her fear of apprehension. In the context of flight, one court noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u2018From this analysis of the reasons for the admissibility of such evidence, the force of the rule that evidence of flight because of one crime cannot be considered on the trial of another and entirely different offense is apparent, as in such case the flight does not disclose any guilty conscience in regard to the offense in question.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\n<em>Thus many courts emphasize the importance of connecting a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt to a consciousness of guilt for the specific crime alleged. There must be an evidentiary basis, either direct or circumstantial, to connect a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt to the particular crime charged.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\"><em>Thomas, </em>372 Md. at 354-55, 812 A.2d at 1057 (citations and footnote omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The gravamen of the issue is whether Mr. Thompson fled in an attempt to avoid apprehension for the crimes for which he was on trial. In the present case, the jury was not presented with evidence of what may have been an alternative and at least a cogent motive for Mr. Thompson\u2019s flight, specifically that drugs were found on his person.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During his interview with police, Mr. Thompson asserted that he ran from them because he had drugs in his possession, which, according to the State, amounted to eighty-six vials of crack cocaine at the time of his arrest. He was in essence arrested <em>in flagrante </em>delicto<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with respect to the crime of possession of controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>dangerous substances. We find that this fact, which was known to all parties involved although not revealed to the jury, undermines the confidence by which the inference could be drawn that Mr. Thompson\u2019s flight was motivated by a consciousness of guilt with respect to the crimes for which he was on trial in the present case; it provides a foundation for the alternate, and equally reasonable, inference that Mr. Thompson fled due to the cocaine in his possession, an action a person in his position may have taken irrespective of whether he also shot and attempted to rob Mr. Gottesman. Mr. Thompson thus was placed in a difficult situation where he must either not object to the highly prejudicial evidence concerning his possession of a significant amount of cocaine being introduced to the jury to explain his flight (or perhaps forced to make a Hobson\u2019s choice to introduce such evidence himself), or decline to explain his flight and risk that the jury would not infer an alternative explanation for his flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The Mississippi Supreme Court in <em>Fuselier v. State, </em>468 So.2d 45 (Miss.1985), addressed a similar. situation. In that case, the defendant, an escapee from the Louisiana State Penitentiary, was charged with the murder of a woman as well as the theft of her car. At his trial, the prosecution presented evidence that when police arrived at the house where the defendant was staying, he jumped out of a back window and attempted to run toward some woods. <em>Id. </em>at 57. During the guilt phase of the defendant\u2019s trial the fact that he was an escapee from the Louisiana State Penitentiary was not presented to the jury, and at the close of the trial, the trial court gave a flight instruction. The defendant argued that the evidence of his flight did not support the flight instruction because, \u201cas an escapee, he had an independent sufficient cause to flee.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The Mississippi Supreme Court determined that the defendant \u201cwas obviously put in a no-win situation by either being required to explain his flight by the fact that he was a prison escapee or not explaining the flight and subjecting himself to a flight instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that \u201cbecause the court was aware of an explanation for [the defendant\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>flight, which was at that time inadmissible, we are of the of the opinion that the flight instruction should not have been granted.\u201d <em>See also Young v. State, </em>601 So.2d 636, 638 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1992) (\u201c[T]he admission of evidence of flight from one crime scene during a short period of time when several crimes have been committed make it difficult, if not impossible, to determine that the flight resulted from feelings of guilt attributable to a particular crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Where the defendant possesses an innocent explanation that does not risk prejudicing the jury against him, it would be expected that the defendant would present his purported reasons for his flight to the jury. It is error, however, for the trial judge to give such an instruction in a case like the case <em>sub judice </em>where the defendant would be prejudiced by the revelation of the \u201cguilty\u201d explanation for his flight. The circumstances of the case at bar impaired the confidence with which the inference that Mr. Thompson fled from police due to a consciousness of guilt with respect to the crimes charged could be drawn and rendered the instruction misleading as to the existence of an alternative basis for Mr. Thompson\u2019s flight from the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Because Mr. Thompson could not be expected to introduce the independent basis for his flight, at the risk of prejudicing his position through the admission of being in possession of crack cocaine, no evidence was adduced concerning the other motivations that \u201cmay be fully consistent with innocence\u201d of the crimes for which he was being tried. We cannot be sure whether this silence on his part in the face of the flight instruction impacted the jury\u2019s perception of the evidence of flight, such that we cannot assert a belief beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneous flight instruction did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict. Therefore, we conclude that giving the flight instruction constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Based on our prior holdings concerning evidence of flight, we determine that it is not <em>per se </em>improper to instruct the jury on the inferences that could be drawn from a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>flight. We conclude, however, that based on the facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>the trial judge abused his discretion in giving a flight instruction in the present case. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
