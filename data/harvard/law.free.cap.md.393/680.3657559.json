On April 27, 2004, Tony Eugene Blickenstaff, appellant, entered a guilty plea to the crime of first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>escape.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to a plea agreement, he was sentenced to eighteen months in the local detention center, to run consecutive to the one-year sentence he was serving at the time of the escape. On May 20, 2005, appellant filed a Motion for Modification to Correct Illegal Sentence. On May 25, 2005, the motion was denied by the Circuit Court for Frederick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Appellant timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court, on its own initiative and prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, granted certiorari. <em>Blickenstaff v. State, </em>390 Md. 500, 889 A.2d 418 (2006). Appellant submits one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">\u201cDid the trial court illegally sentence appellant to serve more than eighteen months in a local correctional facility?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apg\">We hold that the plain language of the pertinent statute in the case <em>sub judice </em>does not prohibit a trial judge from sentencing an individual to serve more than a total of eighteen months in a local correctional facility based upon the aggregation of a prior sentence on an unrelated offense with the \u201cthen executed\u201d sentence. Therefore, the trial court did not illegally sentence appellant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">On July 9, 2004, appellant received a one-year sentence to be served in the Frederick County Adult Detention Center (\u201cFCADC\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court\u2019s commitment order authorized work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>release. On November 2, 2004, appellant failed to return to the FCADC from his work release assignment. A warrant was issued by the Circuit Court for Frederick County and on November 22, 2004, appellant was arrested in Florida and subsequently returned to the FCADC. On April 27, 2005, appellant pled guilty to first degree escape based on his failure to return to the FCADC pursuant to the terms of his work release. Appellant was offered a plea agreement providing for either a sentence of eighteen months in a local correctional facility or three years in the Division of Corrections. Appellant requested that he be sentenced to eighteen months in FCADC to run consecutive to his original one-year sentence. The trial judge then imposed that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The case <em>sub judice </em>was tried without a jury. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(c), this Court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. We will not set aside the trial court\u2019s judgment based upon the evidence unless we find it to be clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>We recently stated in <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">\u201cThe clearly erroneous standard does not apply to legal conclusions. <em>Nesbit v. GEICO, </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879, 883 (2004). \u2018When the trial court\u2019s order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u2019 <em>Nesbit, </em>382 Md. at 72, 854 A.2d at 883 (quoting <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-8\"><em>Gray, </em>388 Md. at 374-75, 879 A.2d at 1068. We shall address the legal issue of the sentencing in the case at bar under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Maryland Code (1999), \u00a7 9-105 of the Correctional Services Article as relevant here provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-11\">\u201c \u00a7 9-105. Sentencing to local correctional facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Notwithstanding any other law, a judge may sentence an individual to a local correctional facility if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">(1) the sentence to be <em>then </em>executed is for a period of not more than 18 months.... \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Appellant argues that the trial judge illegally sentenced him to serve more than eighteen months in a local correctional facility\u2014a violation of \u00a7 9-105\u2014by making the eighteen-month sentence run consecutive to his original one-year sentence, thereby causing appellant\u2019s total incarceration time to exceed eighteen months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State argues that \u00a7 9-105 does not require a trial judge to consider previously imposed sentences for unrelated convictions. The State contends that \u201cthe sentence to be <em>then </em>executed\u201d refers to the sentencing for the criminal conviction or convictions before the trial judge at a particular time, rather than previously imposed sentences for unrelated convictions. \u00a7 9-105 (emphasis added). We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">It is first necessary to examine the language of \u00a7 9-105. As we recently stated in <em>Toth v. State, </em>393 Md. 318, 901 A.2d 820 (2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the Legislature. <em>Mackey v. Compass Mktg., Inc., </em>391 Md. 117, 141, 892 A.2d 479, 493 (2006); <em>Kushell v. DNR, </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005). If the statute is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then we give effect to the statute as it is written. <em>Mackey, </em>391 Md. at 141, 892 A.2d at 493; <em>Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 689, 861 A.2d 727, 730 (2004).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-9\"><em>Toth, </em>393 Md. at 324-25, 901 A.2d at 824 (2006). The plain language of \u00a7 9-105 is clear and unambiguous. A trial judge may sentence a defendant to a local correctional facility if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>sentence \u201cto be <em>then </em>executed is for a period of not more than 18 months.\u201d \u00a7 9-105 (emphasis added). The word \u201cthen\u201d contemplates sentencing at that particular disposition, not the aggregation of previous sentences for unrelated convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Appellant bases his argument solely on language contained in an opinion issued by the Attorney General which stated: \u201cIn our opinion, the law does not permit a judge to commit a defendant to a local detention facility for more than eighteen months, even if that period of confinement derives from consecutive sentences, rather than a single sentence.\u201d 81 Op. Att\u2019y Gen., No. 96-029 (Sept. 13, 1996) (unpublished). Appellant\u2019s reliance on this language is misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The question presented to the Attorney General in 1996 was: \u201c[Wjhether a defendant can be sentenced to a local detention facility for consecutive sentences under the following circumstances: no single sentence exceeds eighteen months, but the total time to be served exceeds eighteen months.\u201d 81 Op. Att\u2019y Gen., No. 96-029 (Sept. 13, 1996) (unpublished).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This question does not address the particular factual situation extant in the case <em>sub judice. </em>As the State posits: \u201cThis question does not address the sentence at issue in the present case as the response contemplates that the consecutive sentences \u2018to be then executed\u2019 derive from the same disposition. Th[e] opinion does not call for the aggregation of unrelated sentences received at different times and for separate convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Discussing the sentencing limit, the 1996 Attorney General opinion looked to an earlier opinion: \u201cIn 68 Opinions of the Attorney General 194 (1983), Attorney General Sachs interpreted the predecessor to Article 27, \u00a7 705(g). At the time, the provision was codified as \u00a7 705F, applicable to \u2018regional detention centers,\u2019 but was otherwise identical.\u201d 81 Op. Att\u2019y <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Gen., No. 96-029 (Sept. 13, 1996) (unpublished). Addressing the 1983 opinion, the Attorney General stated in 1996:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">\u201cThe Attorney General was asked whether \u2018the law permitted] a court to sentence an offender to a regional detention center for a period in excess of 18 months\u2014the limit specified in Article 27, \u00a7 705F.\u2019 Discussing the legislative history, Attorney General Sachs noted that language in question differed from that in the statute when it was originally enacted in 1968:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">The language then was a[s] follows: \u2018[A] judge ... may sentence a convicted offender to a Regional Detention Center ... provided the <em>sentence imposed </em>is for a period of not more than 18 months.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">This change in \u00a7 705F was effected by\u2014and was the express purpose of\u2014Chapter 205, Laws of Maryland 1975. The title of the Act states its purpose, in relevant part, as follows: \u2018F[or] the purpose of repealing the provision that the length of the sentence imposed is a basis for determining that a convicted offender may be sentenced to a regional detention center; [and] <em>providing that the length of the sentence to be executed is a basis for determining that a convicted offender may be sentenced to a regional detention center.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">68 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>at 203. In concluding that no law permits a judge to commit an offender to a regional detention center for more than eighteen months, the Attorney General observed \u2018that, by placing an 18-month limit on the sentence \u201cto be then executed,\u201d the General Assembly intended the commitments to regional detention centers be limited to 18 months or less of <em>actual confinement.\u2019 Id. See also Minovich v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 368, 375, 306 A.2d 642 (1973). We are aware of no development in the law since 1983 that would cause us to reach a different conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>\u201cHowever, <em>the eighteen-month limit on sentence length in \u00a7 705(g) applies only to the act of sentencing. </em>68 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>at 204. <em>This limit, Attorney General Sachs wrote, is not \u2018a flat prohibition against the incarceration of an offender with a sentence of more than 18 months in a [local] detention center.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">Indeed, \u00a7 705E [now \u00a7 705(f) ] provides that State prisoners may be housed in [local] detention centers pursuant to agreement between the Commissioner of Correction and the jurisdictions administering the regional detention center. <em>Nothing in \u00a7 705 imposes any limit\u2014as to length of sentence or otherwise\u2014on the category of State prisoners that may, by agreement, be housed in [local] detention centers. Similarly, State inmates with sentences of more than 18 months actual confinement may be transferred to regional detention centers pursuant to the provisions of Article 27, \u00a7 690(e) or \u00a7 700(c).\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">81 Op. Att\u2019y Gen., No. 96-029 (Sept. 13, 1996) (unpublished) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s opinion upon which appellant bases his entire argument clearly does not attempt to opine that the holding of inmates in local correctional facilities for periods in excess of eighteen months is entirely proscribed. It simply clarifies that, pursuant to \u00a7 9-105, a trial judge may not sentence a convicted individual to a local correctional facility if the sentence to be <em>then executed </em>is for a period of more than eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The sentencing in the case <em>sub judice </em>was made pursuant to a plea agreement between appellant and the State. As stated <em>supra, </em>appellant pled guilty to first degree escape\u2014a violation of \u00a7 9-404 of the Criminal Law Article. The penalty on conviction for such a violation is up to ten years. The sentence <em>then executed, </em>based upon the plea agreement was eighteen months\u2014within the provisions of \u00a7 9-105. Maryland Code (2002), \u00a7 9-407 of the Criminal Law Article, however, stipulates that \u201c[a] sentence imposed for a violation of \u00a7 9-404</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>... :(1) shall be consecutive to any term of confinement being served or to be served at the time of the escape.\u201d Therefore, the trial judge was mandated to run the eighteen-month sentence for first degree escape consecutive to appellant\u2019s one-year unrelated sentence for violation of probation in relation to the prior second degree assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">We hold that \u00a7 9-105 of the Correctional Services Article, by its plain language, provides that trial judges may sentence an individual to a local correctional facility if the sentence to be <em>then executed </em>is for a period of not more than eighteen months. Section 9-105 does not prohibit a trial judge from imposing a sentence consecutive to a sentence for a prior unrelated conviction and sentence. Therefore, we hold that the eighteen-month sentence to run consecutive with appellant\u2019s prior unrelated one-year sentence in the local correctional facility was proper. We affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Frederick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-9\">. Maryland Code (2002, 2005 Supp.), \u00a7 9-404 of the Criminal Law Article states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-10\">\u201c(a) <em>Prohibited\u2014In </em>general.\u2014A person may not knowingly escape from a place of confinement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-11\">(c) Penalty.\u2014A person who violates this section is guilty of the felony of escape in the first degree and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 10 years or a fine not exceeding $20,000 or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-12\">. With our resolution of the issue presented we need not address other arguments put forth by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b718-13\">. This sentence was due to appellant's violation of probation which was imposed for a June 3, 2002, guilty plea to second degree assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\">. As evidenced in oral argument, appellant does not argue that the sentence itself is illegal, just that he cannot be sentenced to serve the eighteen months\u2014consecutive to the one-year term already imposed for a previous offense\u2014in a local correctional facility. Appellant contends that he should be in a Department of Corrections facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\">. The opinion of the Attorney General discussed Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 705(g), the predecessor rule to \u00a7 9-105, however, the language is the same in both provisions considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\">. We include a significant part of the Attorney General\u2019s opinion on the issue because it is the sole stated basis for the appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
