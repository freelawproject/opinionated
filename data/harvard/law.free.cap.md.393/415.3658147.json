Lacer, Respondent, to inquire in depositions into discussions held during a closed executive session of the St. Mary\u2019s County Board of County Commissioners (the \u201cBoard\u201d), Petitioner, as those discussions related to Lacer\u2019s employment contract with the Board and its subsequent termination of Lacer.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">In January 2002, Lacer entered into a written employment contract with the Board which provided that Lacer would act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>as the Chief Executive Officer of the County government, in the position of County Administrator, for a period of 4-1/2 years, subject to certain conditions. At that time, the then-members of the five-member Board were serving their second four-year term following election by the voters of St. Mary\u2019s County. The terms of the then-members of the Board expired in November 2002. Subsequently, a new five-member Board (the Board as composed and involved in the present action) was elected and seated in December 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">On 1 April 2003, after meeting for a public hearing and a scheduled executive session, the Board members convened a closed executive session, during which Lacer was not present. The meeting minutes indicate that the Board met in the closed executive session to discuss personnel issues and to give direction to staff. The meeting minutes indicate also that only the five Board members and the recorder were present. Following the closed session, the Board assembled in an open session and voted 3-2 to proceed on the personnel issues discussed in the closed executive session. In a letter-dated 28 April 2003, the Board terminated Lacer from his position as County Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">On 14 May 2003, Lacer filed a Complaint against the Board in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County alleging breach of contract, wrongful discharge, a violation of the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law, Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), Labor and Employment Article, \u00a7\u00a7 3-502 and 507.1, and a violation of the St. Mary\u2019s County Open Meetings Act, Maryland Code (1957, 2001 Repl. Vol.), Article 24, \u00a7 4-201, <em>et seq. </em>Lacer filed additionally a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment with regard to his claim for breach of contract. The Board filed its owm Motion for Summary Judgment, in addition to its opposition to Lacer\u2019s motion. Then, in response to Lacer\u2019s Notice of Taking Oral Deposition of the five Board members, the Board filed a Motion for Separation of Questions For Decision and for Stay of Discovery, as well as a Motion for Protective Order on the ground that the Board\u2019s substantive discussions during the closed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>executive session regarding Lacer\u2019s termination were protected from discovery by the attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Following a hearing on the motions before the court, the Circuit Court issued two separate orders. In the second order, entered on 15 September 2003 (the order in question in the present case), the Circuit Court: (1) permitted discovery by Lacer into discussions of the closed executive session, yet stayed its effect to allow for any immediate appellate review that might be sought by the Board; (2) granted Lacer partial summary judgment, while denying the Board\u2019s summary judgment motion, as to liability only on the breach of contract claim; and (3) deferred decisions on various other discovery motions until resolution on appellate review of its order permitting discovery of the Board members. Also in its order, the Circuit Court purported to make the necessary certification for immediate appellate review and directed the entry of a final judgment under Maryland Rule 2-602(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">ORDERED that with respect to <em>Lacer\u2019s Request for Relief under the St. Mary\u2019s County Open Meeting Act, that Lacer shall be entitled to inquire of the Board\u2019s agents as to all of the discussions held during the \u201cExecutive Session\u201d conducted by the Board on April 1, 2003, as said discussions relate to Lacer\u2019s Contract of Employment, this Court having expressly found that Lacer was entitled to receive prior notice from the Board if the Board intended to discuss or consider Lacer\u2019s resignation or dismissal at any executive session, and this Court having expressly found that no legislative privilege applied to said discussions, </em>and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">ORDERED that the effect of the aforesaid Order is hereby stayed to allow the Board to file an appeal to the appropriate appellant court, if it so desires, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ORDERED that with respect to Lacer\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and that Lacer is entitled to said Partial Summary Judgment as a matter of law, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">ORDERED that the Court hereby declares the following issues or facts are not in genuine dispute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">1.

Trial of the remaining issues raised by the Complaint shall be resolved by the finder of fact, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">ORDERED that with respect to the Board\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, that the Board is not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, and that therefore, the Board\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, be and the same is hereby denied, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">ORDERED that with respect to the Board\u2019s Motion for Protective Order and Lacer\u2019s Motion for Immediate Sanctions for Failure to Respond to Interrogatories and to Request for Production of Documents, or in the alternative, Motion to Compel Discovery, that said Motions, be and the same are hereby deferred until the resolution of any appeal the Board may file to this Order, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">ORDERED that this Court hereby determines, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-502, that it would be convenient to have the issues decided by this Order finally resolved by the appropriate appellate court before proceeding further, <em>and this Court does further hereby expressly determine, pursuant to Rule 2-602, that there is no just reason for delay and this Court hereby directs this to be a final judgment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">The Board appealed. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, determined that, based upon its review of the record, the Circuit Court erred in its effort to expedite appellate review of the determinations reached in the order, save the discovery provisions, when it entered a final judgment under Maryland Rule 2-602(b). The intermediate appellate court, as to the discovery aspect, however, concluded that the collateral order doctrine enabled appellate review of that disposition. The court affirmed the provision of the Circuit Court\u2019s order permitting depositions of the Board members. In determining that all four elements of the collateral order doctrine were satisfied, the court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7d\">[ajccording to [Lacer], he was wrongfully terminated as a result of what occurred when the Board chose to meet in an Executive Session that violated the St. Mary\u2019s County Open Meetings Act. The discovery provisions in the order at issue provides for the ascertainment of \u201ccritical facts\u201d that are of consequence to the ultimate outcome of the case. <em>See In re Foley, supra, </em>373 [Md. 627, 635, 820 A.2d 587 (2003)]. Those provisions, however, (1) conclusively determine that high level (local) government decision makers must appear for depositions, and (2) present the important question of whether \u201cdisruption of the government process\u201d will result from discovery into the decision making process of high level government officials. Because [Lacer\u2019s] entitlement to judicial relief may be completely distinct from the Board\u2019s opinion as to whether it was entitled to terminate [Lacer\u2019s] contract, the discovery provisions are sufficiently \u201cseparate\u201d from the merits of the action. Finally, if the discovery provisions could not be reviewed at this point, the Board\u2019s right to protect its members against \u201cextensive probing of their individual decision thought processes would irretrievably be lost.[\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The Board filed with us a Petition for Writ of Certiorari. We granted the petition to determine (1) whether the Court of Special Appeals properly declined appellate review of the Circuit Court\u2019s order, save the discovery provision, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>certified as a final judgment under Maryland Rule 2-602(b), and (2) whether, under the collateral order doctrine, the Court of Special Appeals correctly affirmed the discovery provision of the Circuit Court\u2019s order. <em>St. Mary\u2019s County v. Lacer, </em>389 Md. 398, 885 A.2d 823 (2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Ordinarily, appellate review is available only after the entry of a final judgment where all claims against all parties are resolved. <em>Shoemaker v. Smith, </em>353 Md. 143, 165, 725 A.2d 549, 560 (1999); <em>Sigma Repro. Health Cen. v. State, </em>297 Md. 660, 664-65, 467 A.2d 483, 485 (1983); <em>see also </em>Maryland Rule 2-602(a). The fundamental objective of this principle is \u201cto prevent piecemeal appeals and to prevent the interruptions of ongoing judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Sigma Repro. Health Cen., </em>297 Md. at 665, 467 A.2d at 485 (Citations omitted). In <em>Smith v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., </em>386 Md. 12, 21, 871 A.2d 545, 550 (2005),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we recently re-emphasized that there are three limited exceptions to the general requirement of awaiting a final judgment before seeking appellate review: (1) appeals from interlocutory rulings specifically allowed by statute, Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl. Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-303; (2) immediate appeals permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>ted under Maryland Rule 2-602(b); and (3) appeals from interlocutory rulings allowed under the common law collateral order doctrine. We shall revisit the second and third exceptions in the context of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"> Maryland Rule 2-602(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">If the court expressly determines in a written order that there is no just reason for delay, it may direct in the order the entry of a final judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">(1) as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">(2) pursuant to Rule 2\u2014501(f)(3), for some but less than all of the amount requested in a claim seeking money relief only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">We have stated that an appeal under 2-602(b) should be allowed in only the \u201cvery infrequent harsh case.\u201d <em>Diener Enterprises v.

While the Circuit Court\u2019s discretionary authority to direct the entry of a final judgment under Maryland Rule 2-602(b) is reviewable by an appellate court under an abuse of discretion standard, <em>see Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Commission v. Smith, </em>333 Md. 3, 7, 633 A.2d 855, 857 (1993), \u201can order which disposes of only part of a single claim is not certifiable under Rule 2-602.\u201d <em>Planning Board v. Mortimer, </em>310 Md. 639, 649, 530 A.2d 1237, 1242 (1987) (Citations omitted); <em>see also Medical Mutual v. Evander, </em>331 Md. 301, 309, 628 A.2d 170, 174 (1993). <em>Cf. Snowden v.

Thus, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>this Court stated in <em>Medical Mutual Liability Insurance Society of Maryland v. Evander, supra, </em>331 Md. at 308, 628 A.2d at 173,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">although the trial court in the present case expressly determined that there was no just reason for delay and purported to direct the entry of a final judgment, <em>the trial court would not be authorized to finalize an order unless, by its nature, that order was final as to a single claim or party. </em>\u201c \u2018Such a finding only makes a final order appealable.

Furthermore, \u201can order which decides that there is liability, or which resolves some liability issues in favor of a party seeking damages, but fails to make a determination with regard to the amount of damages, does not dispose of an entire claim and cannot be made final and appealable under Rule [2-]602(b).\u201d <em>Shenasky v.

In its order entered on 15 September 2003, the Circuit Court did not settle completely any of the matters in controversy or adjudicate completely the rights and liabilities of the parties. <em>See Mortimer, </em>310 Md. at 653, 530 A.2d at 1244. Further, none of the pending claims were withdrawn by Lacer. We need not determine presently the total number of wholly separate claims that Lacer asserted because none of the asserted theories were resolved finally by the 15 September 2003 order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The theory of recovery seemingly closest to being settled by the order\u2014breach of contract, was still incompletely resolved because a determination regarding the amount of damages remained open. <em>See Shenasky, </em>339 Md. at 638, 664 A.2d at 883. Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals was correct in declining appellate review of those portions of the Circuit Court\u2019s order, certified as a final judgment under Maryland Rule 2-602(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded, however, that the collateral order doctrine enabled appellate review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the discovery portion of the Circuit Court\u2019s order. The collateral order doctrine was recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corporation, </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). This doctrine treats a \u201cnarrow class\u201d of interlocutory orders as final judgments regardless of the posture of the case. <em>In re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. 306, 326, 783 A.2d 673, 685 (2001); <em>Harris v. Harris, </em>310 Md. 310, 315, 529 A.2d 356, 358 (1987). This reprieve from the final judgment requirement, however, is a \u201cvery narrow exception.\u201d <em>Pittsburgh Corning v.

As we have noted repeatedly, for a non-final judgment to be appealable under the collateral order doctrine each of the four elements must be satisfied. <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. 627, 634, 820 A.2d 587, 591 (2003) (quoting <em>In re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. at 327, 783 A.2d at 686, and citing <em>Jackson v.

Because [Lacer\u2019s] entitlement to judicial relief may be completely distinct from the Board\u2019s opinion as to whether it was entitled to terminate [Lacer\u2019s] contract, the discovery provisions are sufficiently \u201cseparate\u201d from the merits of the action.

While we appreciate the sensitivity of the Court of Special Appeals that a meaningful challenge to the allowed probing of the Board members\u2019 thought processes might be lost if such a contention were not resolved on appeal until following a trial, <em>see Montgomery Co., </em>337 Md. at 479-80, 654 A.2d at 881; <em>Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. at 207, 477 A.2d at 763, we perceive that the more limited inquiry permitted by the Circuit Court\u2019s order, with respect to Lacer\u2019s requested relief under the St. Mary\u2019s County Open Meetings Act, pertains to functional aspects of the closed session discussion and not the thought processes of the decision-makers. Thus, unlike the discovery orders in <em>Montgomery County </em>and <em>Patuxent Valley, </em>which would have permitted inquiry into the mental processes of high level government decision-makers in the very limited circumstances there presented, the discovery provision of the Circuit Court\u2019s order here permits only an objective investigation into the facial statements and actions of the Board during the closed session meeting, but not the subliminal thoughts of the speakers or actors. The decision whether to admit into evidence the fruit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>of this type of inquiry and response would be reviewable adequately upon the conclusion of trial and entry of final judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because all four of the elements must be met before an appeal may proceed under the collateral order doctrine, we conclude that the discovery provision of the Circuit Court\u2019s order, entered on 15 September 2003, is not reviewable at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO DISMISS THE APPEAL.
