Thus, we must decide whether a temporary gratuitous exchange or loan of a regulated firearm constitutes a \u201ctransfer\u201d under \u00a7 442(d). In addition, we will discuss Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 449,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which establishes the penalty for a violation of \u00a7 442(d), to determine the proper <em>mens rea </em>for such violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>On July 31, 2003, petitioner, Todd Lin Chow, a District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department officer and non-dealer of firearms, was charged with illegally transferring a regulated firearm pursuant to \u00a7 442. On November 25, 2003, a bench trial was held in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. On December 1, 2003, the court issued its ruling, finding petitioner guilty. The court sentenced petitioner to sixty (60) days, suspended the sentence and imposed a two hundred dollar ($200) fine. A timely appeal was made to the Court of Special Appeals and on June 2, 2005, after hearing arguments, the court filed its decision affirming the decision of the Circuit Court. <em>Chow v. State, </em>163 Md.App. 492, 881 A.2d 1148 (2005). Petitioner then timely filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied on October 4, 2005. On October 19, 2005, petitioner timely filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals. We granted certiorari on December 19, 2005. <em>Chow v. State, </em>390 Md. 284, 888 A.2d 341 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Petitioner presented three questions in his Petition for Writ of Certiorari<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which we rephrase to consolidate and clarify the issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>I. Whether the temporary gratuitous exchange or loan of a regulated firearm between two adult individuals, who were otherwise permitted to own and obtain a regulated firearm, constitutes an illegal \u201ctransfer\u201d of a firearm in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 442, as \u201ctransfer\u201d is utilized in subsection (d)(1), \u201cA person who is not a regulated firearms dealer may not sell, rent, <em>transfer, </em>or purchase any regulated firearm ... ?\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">II. Whether Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 449(f), which states, \u201cany dealer or person who <em>knowingly </em>participates in the illegal ... transfer ... of a regulated firearm in violation of this subheading ...,\u201d establishes a general intent or specific intent <em>mens rea? </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In response to the first question we hold that the plain language and legislative history of the \u201cRegulated Firearms\u201d subheading indicates that the word \u201ctransfer,\u201d as used in \u00a7 442(d), is used in an ownership context and does not apply to the situation extant in the case <em>sub </em>judice\u2014that of a gratuitous temporary exchange or loan between two adults who are otherwise permitted to own and obtain regulated firearms. Although we need not reach the second question because of our disposition in regards to the first question, we will discuss the requisite <em>mens rea </em>required by \u00a7 449(f) because of the likelihood that the issue may come before the Court again. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the word \u201cknowingly\u201d in \u00a7 449(f), in the particular circumstance of the applicable statutory scheme at issue here, indicates a specific intent <em>mens </em>rea\u2014which we find the petitioner not to have possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We adopt, in part, the facts as stated by the Court of Special Appeals in its opinion below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">\u201c[Petitioner\u2019s] friend, Man Nguyen, was the State\u2019s main witness at trial. Nguyen testified that, while driving his car on April 1, 2003, he was stopped by the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department for a broken taillight. At that time, the police searched Nguyen\u2019s vehicle, and discovered a Glock semi-automatic pistol (not the weapon that is the subject of this appeal). The pistol was properly registered in Nguyen\u2019s name, but he did not have a permit to carry it. The police confiscated it in connection with their investigation of a recent murder of one of Nguyen\u2019s friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">\u201cThe following day, Nguyen contacted [petitioner]. Nguyen explained to [petitioner] that this gun and other guns at his home had been confiscated by the police, and he was \u2018anxious\u2019 to buy another gun. He told [petitioner] that he needed to purchase a gun for protection, by which he meant \u2018[h]ome security,\u2019 \u2018[s]o, [petitioner] offered me his gun.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP2\">\u201cThe two men arranged to meet later that day for lunch at a restaurant in Bowie, Maryland. Sometime during this meeting, [petitioner] gave Nguyen a nine millimeter, semiautomatic handgun that he had owned since 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">\u201cNguyen told [petitioner] that he wanted to test fire the weapon before purchasing it. The pair got into Nguyen\u2019s vehicle and headed to a firing range in Upper Marlboro. En route, Nguyen received a business call on his cellular telephone, requiring that he abort the trip to the firing range. Nguyen drove [petitioner] back to the restaurant where [petitioner\u2019s] car was parked and dropped him off. [Petitioner\u2019s] weapon remained in Nguyen\u2019s car. No money was exchanged between Nguyen and [petitioner].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">\u201cSoon thereafter, Nguyen contacted [petitioner] by telephone. Nguyen testified: T was interested in buying it and I called him, and, you know, I told him I\u2019d give it back to him but he said, that\u2019s cool, just keep it in the house and he\u2019ll pick it up.\u2019 Nguyen further testified that he anticipat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ed the weapon would be returned to appellant \u2018as soon as possible.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">\u201cDetective Donnie Judd testified as a State\u2019s witness. He reported that, on April 4, 2003, he and other members of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department stopped Nguyen on a warrant to arrest him for having illegally carried the gun that was found in his car three days earlier. In the ensuing search of Nguyen\u2019s car, the police discovered [petitioner\u2019s] loaded handgun in the car\u2019s center console. Detective Judd ran an NCIC[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] check and determined that the handgun had not been reported stolen. The gun was test fired and determined to be operable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201cNguyen was arrested and taken to the police station, where he gave a four-page statement. The first paragraph of the statement addressed how he had obtained [petitioner\u2019s] handgun, and that portion of the statement was admitted into evidence. It varied from Nguyen\u2019s trial testimony. Ngyuen wrote:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">I know [sic] [petitioner] for 2-3 [years]. I was detain [sic] on 4-1-03 and PGPD took all my guns. Next [d]ay, I called [petitioner] and asked him if I could hold on to his gun until I can get my guns back in a week or two because I felt uncomfortable without a gun[.] We then met at Olive Garden att [sic] 4pm in Bowie and had lunch and after that he give [sic] me his 9mm, out of a bag in the front Passengers [sic] seat[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u201cSergeant William Szimanski, of the State Police Licensing Division, Firearms Registration Section, performs background checks on persons purchasing regulated firearms in Maryland and deals with records concerning firearms purchases. He testified that the records related to [petitioner\u2019s] handgun reflect that [petitioner] bought the handgun in November 1996, and it was formally transferred to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>on the 27th of that month, after completion of the weapon registration process. The records show no subsequent transfer of the handgun, and no application for a transfer of the gun from [petitioner] to Nguyen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cSergeant Guillermo Rivera, of the Office of Internal Affairs of the District of Colombia Metropolitan Police Department, also testified. He stated that appellant had not filed a stolen weapon report between November 17, 2001 and November 17, 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201cAt the close of the State\u2019s case, [petitioner] made a motion for judgment of acquittal. [Petitioner] argued that \u00a7 442(d) does not cover his conduct, which was simply a temporary exchange of the handgun. In the alternative, [petitioner] argued that he did not \u2018knowingly\u2019 violate the statute, as required by \u00a7 449(1), because the State did not prove that he knew the transferee, Nguyen, had not filed the application required by \u00a7 442(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201cThe State countered that [petitioner\u2019s] leaving the gun with Nguyen was a \u2018transfer\u2019 of it, and therefore was covered by \u00a7 442(d). The State further argued that [petitioner] was aware of the requirements for transferring a handgun, because he had fulfilled those requirements himself when he purchased the gun in 1996. The State finally argued that the \u2018plain meaning\u2019 of transfer does not necessarily include the conveyance of title, and encompasses a mere loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201cAfter hearing from counsel on both issues, the [Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County] denied the motion. [Petitioner] then rested without putting on any evidence, and the court issued its ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-9\"><em>Chow, </em>163 Md.App. at 497-500, 881 A.2d at 1151-52 (some footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">The Circuit Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\u201cThe Court having reviewed the statute [\u00a7 442(d) ] and now the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court finds based upon the testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>State\u2019s witnesses that there was in fact a transfer in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">\u201cThe Court also finds that based upon the facts that it was a <em>temporary </em>transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\"><em>\u201cIt is the Court\u2019s assessment of the testimony of the State\u2019s witness that it was in fact a loan, </em>although he has testified to two totally opposite things; he testified that it was in fact an anticipated purchase, and on the other hand, there was testimony or at least\u2014yeah, there was testimony that it was in fact a loan. So, we have two inconsistent statements by the State\u2019s witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">\u201cAnd the State asks the Court or states to the Court\u2014 argues to the Court that under either theory, that there was an illegal transfer in this case. The court agrees that there was an illegal transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u201cAnd [petitioner\u2019s counsel], I understand your argument with respect to temporary transfer, and I\u2019ll leave it to the higher courts to tell me that a temporary transfer is not a transfer under the law, <em>I believe under the facts and circumstances of this case it is in fact a temporary transfer.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">\u201cAnd whether the legislature intended a transference to be a part of this statute, this Court finds it\u2019s not clear, but I\u2019ll wait for direction from the higher court with that.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The trial court judge then found petitioner guilty and sentenced him to sixty (60) days\u2014with the sentence suspended\u2014 and a fine of two hundred dollars ($200). In doing so, the trial judge stated: \u201cAnd the reason why I\u2019m giving you the disposition is <em>I believe that it was a temporary transfer, </em>it was illegal, but, what the transferee did with it [the regulated firearm] was not within your control, and he clearly stated on the record that you told him to put it in the house, and he chose not to.\u201d [Emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Petitioner timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On June 2, 2005, The Court of Special Appeals filed its opinion. The court affirmed the decision of the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Court. Specifically, in reference to the interpretation of the word \u201ctransfer,\u201d the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201c[W]e hold that plainly included within the meaning of \u2018transfer\u2019 of a regulated firearm, in \u00a7 442(d), is lending a firearm. The plain construction of the term is confirmed by an examination of the general purpose of the regulated firearms [subheading], and by the rule that the remedial portions of a statute are to be liberally construed. Therefore, a person violates \u00a7 442(d) by lending a regulated firearm to another person without there first being compliance with the application process and seven-day waiting period set forth in that section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\"><em>Chow, </em>163 Md.App. at 509-10, 881 A.2d at 1158 (footnote omitted). The court, however, failed to address the entire issue of what <em>would </em>constitute a transfer: \u201cWe need not decide in this case what other facts would support a transfer, for purposes of \u00a7 442(d). It is therefore unnecessary to address the scenario postulated by [petitioner], i.e., a mere momentary exchange of a regulated firearm between the lawful possessor and another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510 n. 7, 881 A.2d at 1158 n. 7. In addition, in respect to the <em>mens rea </em>requirement of \u00a7 449(f), the court held \u201cthat \u2018knowingly participates\u2019 in a violation of \u00a7 442(d) means participation with knowledge of the facts that make out a violation of that subsection\u201d and that \u201c[t]he State, then, need only prove that the defendant participated in a transfer of a regulated firearm with the knowledge that a firearm (as opposed to some other item) was being intentionally (as opposed to accidentally) transferred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513, 881 A.2d at 1160 (citing <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 651, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The case <em>sub judice </em>was tried in the circuit court without a jury, thus our standard of review is dictated by Maryland Rule 8-131(c). We recently stated in <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">\u201cAccording to Maryland Rule 8-131(c) \u2018when an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 The clearly erroneous standard does not apply to legal conclusions. <em>Nesbit v. GEICO, </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879, 883 (2004). \u2018When the trial court\u2019s order \u201cinvolves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nesbit, </em>382 Md. at 72, 854 A.2d at 883 (quoting <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>Gray, </em>388 Md. at 374-75, 879 A.2d at 1068. Therefore, we shall review the legal questions presented as to the interpretation of \u201ctransfer\u201d in \u00a7 442(d) and the <em>mens rea </em>element of \u00a7 449(f) <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">A. The Meaning of \u201cTransfer\u201d in the Context of \u00a7 442(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Section 442(d) of the Regulated Firearms subheading governs the sale or \u201ctransfer\u201d of regulated firearms by an individual that is not a regulated firearms dealer. As stated <em>supra, </em>the statute states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">\u201c(d) <em>Sale by other than regulated firearms </em>dealer.\u2014(1) A person who is not a regulated firearms dealer may not sell, rent, <em>transfer, </em>or purchase any regulated firearm until after 7 days shall have elapsed from the time an application to purchase or transfer shall have been executed by the prospective purchaser or transferee, in triplicate, and the original copy is forwarded by a regulated firearms dealer to the Secretary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">\u00a7 442(d)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Petitioner contends that the legislative intent of using the term \u201ctransfer,\u201d as found in \u00a7 442(d), was to mean a permanent exchange of title or possession of a regulated firearm, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>in a gift or bequeathment, rather than a mere loan or temporary exchange of such firearm. The State, in opposition, argues that \u00a7 442(d) prohibits <em>all </em>exchanges of regulated firearms, temporary or permanent, whether by sale, rental, gift, loan, exchange or otherwise and no matter how temporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In order to divine the meaning of \u201ctransfer\u201d in \u00a7 442(d) we look to the canons of statutory interpretation, which we recently expressed in <em>Kushell v. Department of Natural Resources, 38</em>5 Md. 563, 870 A.2d 186 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>See Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 688, 861 A.2d 727, 730 (2004). Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology. <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201cIn construing the plain language, \u2018[a] court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u2019 <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003); <em>County Council v. Dutcher, </em>365 Md. 399, 416-417, 780 A.2d 1137, 1147 (2001). Statutory text \u2018should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins, </em>383 Md. at 691, 861 A.2d at 732 (quoting J<em>ames v. Butler, </em>378 Md. 683, 696, 838 A.2d 1180, 1187 (2003)). The plain language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation. Rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect. <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223, 858 A.2d at 487; <em>Navarro-Monzo v. Washington Adventist, </em>380 Md. 195, 204, 844 A.2d 406, 411 (2004).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201cIf statutory language is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then we give effect to the statute as it is written. <em>Collins, </em>383 Md. at 688-89, 861 A.2d at 730. If there is no ambiguity in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends; we do not need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for \u2018the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u2019 <em>Arundel Corp. v. Marie, </em>383 Md. 489, 502, 860 A.2d 886, 894 (2004) (quoting <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 576-77, 870 A.2d at 193-94. Furthermore, as we stated in <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cIn some cases, the statutory text reveals ambiguity, and then the job of this Court is to resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal. However, before judges may look to other sources for interpretation, first there must exist an ambiguity within the statute, i.e., two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute. Where the statutory language is free from such ambiguity, courts will neither look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent nor add to or delete words from the statute. Only when faced with ambiguity will courts consider both the literal or usual meaning of the words as well as their meaning in light of the objectives and purposes of the enactment. As our predecessors noted, \u2018We cannot assume authority to read into the Act what the Legislature apparently deliberately left out. Judicial construction should only be resorted to when an ambiguity exists.\u2019 Therefore, the strongly preferred norm of statutory interpretation is to effectuate the plain language of the statutory text.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\"><em>Price, </em>at 387-88, 835 A.2d at 1226 (citations omitted); <em>Goff v.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>term itself is not defined within the subheading. <em>See Chow, </em>163 Md.App. at 502, 881 A.2d at 1154 (\u201cNeither \u00a7 442 nor any other section within that subheading defines the word \u2018transfer.\u2019 \u201d). Therefore, we look to the ordinary and popular understanding of the word \u201ctransfer\u201d to determine its meaning. <em>Kushell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">There are a number of sources from which we can obtain definitions of the word \u201ctransfer\u201d and it is proper to consult a dictionary or dictionaries for a term\u2019s ordinary and popular meaning. <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Taxation v.

A similar first definition of the verb \u2018transfer\u2019 is found in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary: \u2018To convey or remove from one place or one person to another; to pass or hand over from one to another, esp. to change over the possession or control of.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1536 (8th ed. 2004) (\u2018Black\u2019s\u2019).

And Black\u2019s lists, as its second definition, \u2018To sell or give.\u2019 Black\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 1536. Similarly, Random House defines the noun form of the word \u2018transfer\u2019 as, <em>inter alia, \u2018Law, </em>a conveyance, by sale, gift, or otherwise of real or personal property, to another.\u2019 Ran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>dom House, <em>supra, </em>at 2009.

Utilizing these definitions and the context in which \u201ctransfer\u201d appears in \u00a7 442(d), the Court of Special Appeals decided to \u201cdecline [petitioner\u2019s] invitation to ascribe to the verb \u2018transfer,\u2019 in \u00a7 442(d), a definition suggestive only of a permanent exchange of title or possession.\u201d <em>Chow, </em>163 Md.App. at 503, 881 A.2d at 1154. We, however, disagree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 determination in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">As stated <em>supra, </em>there are different sources from which definitions of a word may be obtained.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner points out a number of definitions from dictionaries which were available in the Maryland State Law Library prior to the initial 1941 enactment of the predecessor statute to the Regulated Firearms subheading.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All of the definitions define \u201ctransfer\u201d as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>permanent exchange of title or possession.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> From the time of its initial enactment in 1941, through its evolution to the present day, the statute has always contained a form of the term \u201ctransfer.\u201d It is persuasive that the use of the term \u201ctransfer\u201d has remained consistent throughout the evolution of the statute\u2014always in the context of a transfer of all of the rights of the transferor to the transferee, either permanently or for an extended period of time if a gun is \u201crented.\u201d Thus, the meaning and context of the term have not been altered over the course of the years, even though other definitions may have changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">The Court of Special Appeals found that an interpretation of \u201ctransfer\u201d as suggestive only of a permanent exchange of title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>or possession \u201cwould run afoul of the rule that \u2018[ojrdinary and popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of terminology within legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chow, </em>163 Md.App. at 503, 881 A.2d at 1154 (citing <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223, 858 A.2d 484). The court, however, provides no support for this conclusion other than what can be inferred from its discussion of the two dictionary definitions it provided, <em>supra, </em>which arguably supported both the petitioner\u2019s and the State\u2019s arguments. Analyzing \u201ctransfer\u201d in light of the definitions in effect at the time of the legislative enactment of \u00a7 442(d), we do not find petitioner\u2019s interpretation of \u201ctransfer\u201d to run afoul of the ordinary and popular understanding of the English language.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Words can have multiple meanings and often do. And the numerous meanings of a particular word may each satisfy the ordinary and popular understanding of that word. In order to interpret a word\u2019s specific meaning in a particular statute we look to the context in which the word is used. As we stated <em>supra, </em>\u201cThe plain language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation. Rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect. <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223, 858 A.2d at 487; <em>Navarro-Monzo v. Washington Adventist, </em>380 Md. 195, 204, 844 A.2d 406, 411 (2004).\u201d <em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 577, 870 A.2d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">2. <em>\u201cTransfer\u201d in the Context of the Regulated Firearms Subheading.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">While the Regulated Firearms subheading does not specifically define the term \u201ctransfer,\u201d it does use the term several times throughout its various sections. Section 441 provides the definitions for the subheading. In particular, \u00a7 441(f) states that: \u201c \u2018Dealer\u2019 means any person who is engaged in the <em>business </em>of: (1) Selling, renting, or <em>transferring </em>firearms at wholesale or retail.\u201d (Emphasis added). Transfer, as used in this section, obviously concerns transfers for consideration (\u201cwholesale\u201d and \u201cretail\u201d are business terms). Section 441 (t) states that: \u201c \u2018Rent\u2019 means the <em>temporary transfer </em>of a regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>lated firearm <em>for consideration </em>where the firearm is taken from the firearm owner\u2019s property.\u201d (Emphasis added). Finally, \u00a7 441(w) states that: \u201c \u2018Straw purchase\u2019 means any sale of a regulated firearm where the individual uses another person (the straw purchaser) to complete the application to purchase a regulated firearm, take initial possession of that firearm, and subsequently <em>transfer </em>that firearm to the individual.\u201d (Emphasis added). This section also obviously concerns transfers for consideration. In all of the above instances (except where \u201cRent\u201d is specifically defined and delineated as a temporary transfer for consideration) the word \u201ctransfer\u201d is used in the sense of a permanent exchange of title or possession of the regulated firearm for consideration. A dealer is a person engaged in the business of permanently exchanging title or possession of a firearm. In the context of \u00a7 441(f), transfer logically means a permanent exchange. In the case of a straw <em>purchase, </em>there is a sale of a regulated firearm to the strawperson, who then <em>transfers </em>(permanently exchanging possession of) the firearm to another individual. The use of transfer in \u00a7 441(w) also contemplates permanent exchange of possession for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Section 442, entitled \u201cSale or transfer of regulated firearms,\u201d utilizes \u201ctransfer\u201d in several instances, including subsection (d), the subject provision in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Subsection (b)(8)(i) states that \u201c[a]n application [<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] to purchase or <em>transfer </em>a regulated firearm shall be completed by the recipient and forwarded to the Secretary within 5 days of receipt of the regulated firearm.... \u201d Reference to the application form itself (MSP 77R-1) is reflective of \u201ctransfer\u201d having a \u201cpermanent exchange\u201d connotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The form is entitled: \u201cMARYLAND STATE POLICE APPLICATION AND AFFIDAVIT TO PURCHASE A REGULATED FIREARM.\u201d The first section provides instructions, which begin: \u201cThe <em>transferee (purchaser) </em>or voluntary registrant <em>must complete Part 1 of this application prior to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>completing Part 2.\u201d </em>[Italics added for emphasis]. The rest of the page composes Part 1 of the application and, following the instruction block, fifteen questions are listed with yes or no (and sometime N/A) circles to be filled in by the applicant, along with a space for the applicant to initial for each question\u2019s answer. At the bottom of the page there is a signature box. The box is labeled \u201cSignature of <em>Transferee/Voluntary </em>Registrant and <em>Transferor.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added]. Two lines are provided for signatures: (1) labeled <em>\u201cTransferee/Voluntary </em>Registrant\u201d and (2) <em>\u201cDealer/Transferor.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The second page of the application composes Part 2. Located at the top <em>of </em>the <em>page </em>are four check boxes, respectively labeled: \u201cDealer Sale,\u201d \u201cSecondary Sale,\u201d \u201cGift,\u201d and \u201cVoluntary Registration.\u201d Below that is an instruction box which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201cThe <em>transferee </em>(purchaser) or voluntary registrant <em>must complete Part 1 of this application prior to completing Part 2. </em>Licensed dealers or <em>transferors </em>(sellers) <em>must </em>visually inspect an official document provided by the <em>transferee </em>to verify that the <em>transferee </em>has either completed a certified firearms safety training course ... or an official document that indicates that the <em>transferee </em>is a current law enforcement officer.... \u201d [Italics added for emphasis.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Following the instruction box, the page is broken into six sections with section two composed of an A and B. Each individual section is entitled as follows: 1. <em>\u201cTRANSFEREE (PURCHASER </em>VOLUNTARY REGISTRANT INFORMATION,\u201d 2a. \u201cDEALER INFORMATION (* * <em>For Licensed Dealer Sales Only </em>* *),\u201d 2b. <em>\u201cTRANSFEROR (,SELLER) </em>INFORMATION (For Secondary Sales, Gifts, and Voluntary Registration Only),\u201d 3. \u201c (THIS SECTION FOR MARYLAND STATE POLICE USE ONLY),\u201d 4. \u201cGUN INFORMATION (Must Be Completed By <em>Transferor),\u201d </em>and signature blocks 5. <em>\u201cSign </em>upon Application or Voluntary Registration\u201d and 6. <em>\u201cSign </em>upon Transfer of Firearm.\u201d [Italics added for emphasis].</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>It is evident that the application, referenced by \u00a7 442(b)(3)(i), to purchase or transfer regulated firearms was only designed for permanent \u201ctransfers\u201d of such firearms.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In fact, the only options available, as indicated at the top of the second page of the application, are for \u201cDealer Sale,\u201d \u201cSecondary Sale,\u201d \u201cGift,\u201d and \u201cVoluntary Registration.\u201d With the exception of \u201cVoluntary Registration,\u201d each option evinces a permanent exchange of title or possession between two individuals. \u201cVoluntary Registration\u201d is indicative of an individual already in possession of a regulated firearm, not of any type of exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Section 442(d)(2) states: \u201cAs an alternative to completing a secondary sale of a regulated firearm through a regulated firearms dealer, the prospective seller or transferor and the prospective purchaser or transferee may complete the transaction through a designated law enforcement agency.\u201d This section provides an alternative to \u00a7 442(d), the pertinent section in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The use of \u201ctransfer\u201d in \u00a7 442(d)(2) distinctly refers to a permanent exchange. This is evident through the introductory language of the section, \u201cAs an alternative to completing a secondary <em>sale </em>. ... \u201c \u00a7 442(d)(2) (emphasis added). Transferor (in conjunction with seller) and transferee (in conjunction with purchaser) in this context is concerned with completing a secondary <em>sale </em>(permanent exchange) of a regulated firearm through a designated law enforcement agency rather than through a regulated firearms dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Section 443, entitled \u201cRegulated firearm dealer\u2019s license,\u201d states in subsection (a), that \u201c[n]o person shall engage in the <em>business </em>of selling, renting, or <em>transferring </em>regulated firearms unless he lawfully possesses and conspicuously displays at his place of business, in addition to any other license required by law, a regulated firearms dealer\u2019s license issued by the Secre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tary.\u201d (Emphasis added). Again, similar to \u00a7 441(f), the use of \u201ctransfer\u201d in the context of a person engaging in the firearms business provides a connotation of permanent exchange of title or possession generally for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The context in which the term \u201ctransfer\u201d is used in the Regulated Firearms subheading\u2019s statutory scheme as a whole must be harmonized with its use in \u00a7 442(d). <em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 577, 870 A.2d at 193 (citing <em>Navarro-Monzo, </em>380 Md. at 204, 844 A.2d at 411; <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223, 858 A.2d at 487).

The court expounded upon this, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u201cSection 442(d) refers to three forms of firearm exchange: \u2018sell [or purchase],\u2019 \u2018rent,\u2019 and \u2018transfer.\u2019 \u2018Rent\u2019 is defined in \u00a7 441(t) as the \u2018temporary transfer of a regulated firearm for consideration where the firearm is taken from the firearm owner\u2019s property.\u2019 \u2018Sell\u2019 and \u2018purchase\u2019 are not defined in the subheading, but we assume they carry their ordinary and popular meaning, and contemplate a permanent transfer for consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\u201c \u2018Transfer,\u2019 then, must contemplate something different from \u2018sell\u2019 or \u2018rent\u2019; otherwise, those terms would be surplusage.

We disagree, however, with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 analysis that \u201ctransfer\u201d must be construed with a broad meaning to avoid being considered surplusage. To the contrary, it is when \u201ctransfer\u201d is considered in its broad meaning that surplusage language is created. if \u201ctransfer\u201d includes everything then the words \u201csell,\u201d \u201crent\u201d and \u201cpurchase\u201d are surplus words.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 apparent presumption is that a \u201cgift\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is the only form that a \u201cpermanent exchange of title or possession\u201d can assume. <em>See Chow, </em>163 Md.App. at 504, 881 A.2d at 1155 (\u201c[W]e cannot ascribe to the term, as it is used in \u00a7 442(d), a narrow meaning restricted essentially to \u2018gift\u2019. ...\u201d). The Court of Special Appeals argues that \u201ctransfer\u201d cannot simply mean \u201cgift.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201cElsewhere in \u00a7 442 itself, the General Assembly used \u2018gift\u2019 to exclude (with certain conditions) those forms of exchange from the prohibitions against straw purchases. <em>See </em>\u00a7 442(b)(2), (3) (providing that \u2018[t]he prohibitions of this [straw purchase] subsection do not apply to a person purchasing a regulated firearm as a gift,\u2019 so long as there is compliance with the application requirement).

We, however, disagree with this reasoning. \u201cTransfer,\u201d as defined at the time of the enactment of \u00a7 442(d) and read in harmony with the rest of the Regulated Firearms subheading, has the meaning of a <em>permanent </em>gratuitous transfer, rather than a temporary transfer. And we will not \u201c \u2018construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 576-77, 870 A.2d at 193 (quoting <em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 387, 835 A.2d at 1226); <em>County Council v. Dutcher, </em>365 Md. 399, 416-417, 780 A.2d 1137, 1147 (2001). \u201cTransfer\u201d can be ascribed the meaning of \u201ca permanent exchange of title or possession\u201d and not be rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Each term in the litany laid out in \u00a7 442(d) has its own meaning. The term \u201csell\u201d contemplates a permanent exchange <em>for consideration </em>from a seller or transferor of a regulated firearm to a <em>buyer. </em>Conversely, the term \u201cpurchase\u201d contemplates a permanent exchange <em>for consideration </em>to a buyer or transferee of a regulated firearm from a <em>seller. </em>\u201cRent,\u201d as discussed above and defined in \u00a7 441(t), contemplates a temporary transfer <em>for consideration. </em>None of these words, \u201csell,\u201d purchase,\u201d or \u201crent\u201d can be defined to include the permanent gratuitous transfer of a firearm. That type of <em>permanent </em>exchange is covered by the word \u201ctransfer\u201d and that is its purpose in the statute, i.e., a <em>permanent </em>gratuitous transfer. Read in context with the rest of the Regulated Firearms subheading, the term \u201ctransfer,\u201d as used in \u00a7 442(d), is distinguishable from the words \u201csell,\u201d \u201crent\u201d and \u201cpurchase\u201d in that it means any other <em>permanent </em>exchange of title or possession of a firearm even if it is without consideration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This covers situations of permanent exchange that the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>terms fail to address, i.e., in the case of a gift or bequeathment. Therefore, \u201ctransfer,\u201d as used in \u00a7 442(d), is not surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory. It is the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation that makes the other language of the relevant litany surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">While modern day definitions of \u201ctransfer\u201d may, in some instances, attribute to the word a broader meaning, they also provide a more narrow definition. That narrow definition of \u201cpermanent exchange of title or possession\u201d is more in harmony with the statutory scheme of the Regulated Firearms subheading, as a whole. Thus, we attribute that narrow meaning to \u201ctransfer\u201d as it is used in \u00a7\u00a7 442(d) and 449(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">3. <em>Even if \u201cTransfer\u201d Can Be Said to Be Ambiguous, the Application of Statutory Construction and a Review of Legislative Intent Reflect that its Meaning in the Context of \u00a7 442(d) is One of Permanent Exchange of Title or Possession.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">While we find that \u201ctransfer,\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 442(d) and 449(f), is unambiguous and refers to a <em>permanent </em>gratuitous exchange of title or possession, it is useful for confirmatory reasons to look to the purpose of the Regulated Firearms subheading as intended by the General Assembly.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Prior to enacting the predecessor statute to the Regulated Firearms subheading, the General Assembly enacted the Uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>form Machine Gun Act.

It is instructive to look at some of the documentation surrounding the Act. In 1996, then-Governor Parris N. Glendening proposed two \u201cAdministration\u201d bills, cross-filed as Senate Bill 215 and House Bill 297. The Act was \u201ca comprehensive proposal aimed at reducing the epidemic of gun violence\u201d in Maryland. Briefing Statement Before the Senate Judicial Proceeding Committee and the House Judiciary Committee (1996) (statement of Bonnie A. Kirkland, Chief Legislative Officer, Governor\u2019s Legislative Office and Colonel David B. Mitchell, Superintendent, Department of State Police), at 2 (\u201cBriefing Statement\u201d). As the Court of Special Appeals points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">\u201cThe Briefing Statement explains: \u2018To help accomplish this goal, the Maryland Gun Violence Act focuses on reducing the availability of handguns and assault weapons, which are defined in the bill as regulated firearms, to prohibited persons by diminishing the proliferation of illegal sales and transfers of firearms.\u2019 <em>Id.; see also Valentine v. On Target, Inc., </em>353 Md. 544, 564, 727 A.2d 947 (1999) (Raker, J., concurring) (recognizing that the regulated firearms provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>sions are part of an \u2018elaborate statutory scheme [ ] designed to regulate the transfer of handguns[,]\u2019 which, like the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act passed by Congress in 1968, has the purpose of \u2018controlling] and, if possible, eliminating] gun violence\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\"><em>Chow, </em>163 Md.App. at 507, 881 A.2d at 1157. As used in the Briefing Statement its purpose was to reduce the proliferation of <em>illegal sales </em>and <em>illegal transfers. </em>The Court of Special Appeals refers to the Briefing Statement\u2019s analysis, stating: \u201cSection 442(d) in particular has the purpose of \u2018disrupting] established gun trafficking patterns by reducing the supply of regulated firearms to the illegal market.\u2019 To read \u00a7 442(d) as exempting the loan of a regulated firearm would undermine the laudable purpose of the legislative scheme.\u201d <em>Chow, </em>163 Md.App. at 508-09, 881 A.2d at 1158 (citation omitted). The Briefing Statement, however, in no way alludes to the imposition of restrictions upon the temporary exchange or loan of regulated firearms between two adults that are not legally prohibited from possessing such firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The particular section from which the quote is taken in the Briefing Statement is more properly read when placed in its entire context. The paragraph reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">\n<em>Key features of Senate Bill 215 and House Bill 297</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">II. Requires <em>sales </em>between individuals to go through the same scrutiny as initial purchases from a gun dealer: a background check and a seven-day waiting period. (Article 27 Sec. 442E). The required application/registration of <em>secondary sales </em>coupled with the prohibition of multiple <em>purchase </em>transactions will disrupt established gun trafficking patterns by reducing the supply of regulated firearms to the illegal market.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4G\">Briefing Statement, at 5 [emphasis added]. The purpose of the legislative scheme is to regulate <em>sales, </em>secondary <em>sales, </em>and to prohibit multiple permanent <em>purchase </em>transactions of regulated firearms in order to disrupt gun trafficking in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>illegal market, not temporary exchanges or loans of regulated firearms between adults legally permitted to possess regulated firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In fact, the Briefing Statement enumerates what the Act proposes to regulate: \u201cAmong other things, the Act proposes to limit the <em>-purchase </em>of regulated firearms to one in a thirty-day period; treat <em>secondary sales </em>of firearms like <em>sales </em>by dealers; prohibit straw <em>purchases; </em>and require a license to <em>purchase </em>a regulated firearm.\u201d Briefing Statement, at 2 [emphasis added]. In addition, the Briefing Statement\u2019s Conclusion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201cMaryland residents throughout the state favor stricter handgun regulation. These citizens, and those testifying in support of this Legislation, represent a broad array of people throughout the State. Supporters include members of the medical, business and religious community. Supporters also include the increasing number of victims whose lives have been shattered by gun violence, as well as their family and friends. Even many of those traditionally thought to be opposed to any gun control measures, such as gun owners and enthusiasts, support this legislation. <em>They understand that this Act imposes no restrictions on the use of firearms for lawful purposes such as hunting and sport shooting, and imposes reasonable regulations aimed at reducing the gun violence epidemic by reducing the availability of guns to minors and criminals.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Briefing Statement, at 6 [emphasis added]. This is exactly what the Act and \u00a7 442(d) do if \u201ctransfer\u201d is construed narrowly to mean \u201ca permanent exchange of title or possession.\u201d If we, however, adopt the broad meaning that the State requests and the Court of Special Appeals adopted, then the Act and \u00a7 442(d) would be interpreted to impose additional restrictions upon the use of firearms for lawful purposes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Our review of the legislative intent suggests that this was not the intent of the Legislature. Furthermore, a look at the Fiscal Note to House Bill 297 (both the original and revised versions) suggests the scope of the bill. The Fiscal Note, in discussing state expenditures, states, \u201cUnder current law, only a transaction involving a licensed gun dealer is subject to a waiting period and approval by the State Police. This bill extends that requirement to <em>sales </em>between individuals.\u201d Fiscal Note, at 2 [emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Upon review of the legislative intent involving \u00a7 442(d) we find that \u201ctransfer,\u201d in the context of the statute, is properly defined as a \u201cpermanent exchange of title or possession\u201d without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Pursuant to our determination of the contextual meaning of \u201ctransfer\u201d in \u00a7 442(d), we hold that \u201ctransfer\u201d does not apply to the temporary exchange or loan of a regulated firearm between two adult individuals, without consideration passing between them, who are otherwise permitted to own, obtain, possess, and use a regulated firearm. We give due regard to the Circuit Court\u2019s fact finding in the case <em>sub judice </em>that the exchange in question was temporary in nature, as in a loan. The Circuit Court stated that it found \u201cthat based upon the facts that it was a <em>temporary </em>transfer.\u201d [Emphasis added]. In addition, <em>\u201cIt [was] the [Circuit] Court\u2019s assessment of the testimony of the State\u2019s witness that it was in fact a loan </em>____\u201c [Emphasis added]. The trial judge stated: \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to the higher courts to tell me that a temporary transfer is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>a transfer under the law. <em>I believe under the facts and circumstances of this case it is in fact a temporary transfer.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">As discussed <em>supra, </em>a <em>temporary </em>gratuitous<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> exchange of a regulated firearm between persons legally permitted to possess firearms is not the type of \u201ctransfer\u201d contemplated by the framers of \u00a7 442(d). Petitioner did not violate the provisions of the Regulated Firearms subheading, in particular \u00a7 442(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">B. The Requisite <em>Mens Rea </em>Required by \u00a7 449(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 449(f) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201c(f) <em>Knowing participants in sale, rental, </em>etc.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this section, any dealer or person who <em>knowingly </em>participates in the illegal sale, rental, transfer, purchase, possession, or receipt of a regulated firearm in violation of this subheading shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than 5 years or both. Each violation shall be considered a separate offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The State argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 449(f), a violation of \u00a7 442(d) requires only the general intent to knowingly and intentionally transfer a regulated firearm. The petitioner argues that the term \u201cknowingly\u201d in \u00a7 449(f) establishes a <em>mens rea </em>equivalent to specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Every crime is generally composed of two aspects; the <em>actus reus </em>(guilty act) and the <em>mens rea </em>(culpable mental state) accompanying a forbidden act. <em>Harris v.

To break and enter requires a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>mere general intent but to commit burglary requires the additional specific intent of committing a felony after the entry has been made. A trespassory taking requires a mere general intent but larceny (or robbery) requires the specific <em>animus furandi </em>or deliberate purpose of depriving the owner permanently of the stolen goods. <em>This is why even voluntary intoxication may negate a specific intent though it will not negate a mere general intent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">The larger class \u2018specific intent\u2019 includes such other members as 1) assault with intent to murder, 2) assault with intent to rape, 3) assault with intent to rob, 4) assault with intent to maim, 5) burglary, 6) larceny, 7) robbery and 8) the specifie-intent-to-inflict-grievous-bodily-harm variety of murder.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] Each of these requires not simply the general intent to do the immediate act with no particular, clear or undifferentiated end in mind, but the additional deliberate and conscious purpose or design of accomplishing a very specific and more remote result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">307 Md. at 62-63, 512 A.2d at 366 (emphasis added). Chief Justice Traynor, writing for the Supreme Court of California, explained the difference between specific intent and general intent crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">When the definition of a crime consists of only the description of a particular act, without reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence, we ask whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act.

In contrast, subsections (b), (d) and (f) of \u00a7 449 specifically include the terms \u201cknowingly\u201d or \u201cknowing.\u201d The sale of handguns is not itself illegal. It is the manner of the sale or rental, etc., that may make it illegal. The phrase used here \u201cknowingly participates in the illegal sale ...\u201d contemplates that the actor must know that he or she is committing an \u201cillegal sale.\u201d We find this to be indicative of a <em>mens rea </em>requirement of specific intent for violations of \u00a7 449(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">As commented upon above, \u00a7 449 is further distinguishable from the statute addressed in <em>Bryan. </em>There are two types of contrasting provisions in \u00a7 449; subsections with no specific <em>mens rea, </em>mentioned and those subsections with \u201cknowingly\u201d included in the language. The subsections that include \u201cknowingly,\u201d in particular \u00a7 449(f), provide a greater <em>mens rea </em>requirement than the subsections that do not mention <em>mens rea. </em>While the Supreme Court may have concluded in <em>Bryan </em>that, in some instances, \u201cthe term \u2018knowingly\u2019 does not necessarily have any reference to a culpable state of mind or to knowledge of the law,\u201d our interpretation of \u00a7 449(f) comports more with the Supreme Court\u2019s finding in <em>Liparota. </em>Though the <em>Bryan </em>Court decision is more recent than <em>Liparota, </em>it specifically provided an exception for such circumstances, specifically not overruling <em>Liparota\u2019s </em>holding. <em>Bryan, </em>524 U.S. at 193 n. 15, 118 S.Ct. at 1946 n. 15, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (stating that \u201cunless the text of the statute dictates a different result\u201d and footnoting <em>Liparota </em>as an example). Therefore, we find that a violation of \u00a7 442(d) and imposition of a penalty under \u00a7 449(f) requires that one have a specific intent and requires that a defendant \u201cknows\u201d that the sale, rental, transfer, purchase, possession, or receipt of a regulated firearm of which they are a participant in is in a manner that is illegal and not a legal sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Even if it were the case that the <em>mens rea </em>element of \u00a7 449(f), as indicated by \u201cknowingly,\u201d could be construed to be ambiguous, pursuant to the rule of lenity, the statute must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>normally be construed in favor of the defendant. In <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 842 A.2d 743 (2004), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201cIn discussing what the rule of lenity requires ..., this Court has stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u2018an enhanced penalty statute, is highly penal and must be strictly construed so that the defendant is only subject to punishment contemplated by the statute.

Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">We find that the temporary gratuitous exchange or loan of a regulated handgun between two adult individuals, who are otherwise permitted to own and obtain a regulated handgun, does not constitute an illegal \u201ctransfer\u201d of a firearm in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 442, in particular, subsection (d). The plain language of \u00a7 442(d), when construed in harmony with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>rest of the subheading, reveals that \u201ctransfer\u201d can only refer to a <em>permanent </em>exchange of title or possession and does not include gratuitous temporary exchanges or loans. Legislative history further supports our interpretation. We also conclude that the inclusion of the term \u201cknowingly\u201d in \u00a7 449(f) creates a specific intent <em>mens rea </em>for violations of that subsection. Thus, in order to be in violation of \u00a7 449(f), a person must know that the activity they are engaging in is illegal. This ruling does not place any undue burden on the State. \u201cRather, as in any other criminal prosecution requiring <em>mens rea, </em>the [State] may prove by reference to facts and circumstances surrounding the case that [the defendant] knew that his conduct was unauthorized or illegal.\u201d <em>Liparota, </em>471 U.S. at 434, 105 S.Ct. at 2092-98, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The Court of Special Appeals' analysis is disingenuous of petitioner's proposed construction.

Under the State's interpretation, any temporary exchange or loan of a regulated firearm would constitute a violation of \u00a7 442(d).

If a spouse has a properly registered hand gun that is kept in the house for protection and permits the other spouse to use it to protect herself from a burglar/assailant, under the State\u2019s interpretation, a crime is committed by both spouses\u2014they become misdemeanants. This type of scenario can be repeated in numerous situations in which regulated firearms may be lawfully used. It would be unreasonable to require people to fill out an application, which, as discussed <em>supra, </em>doesn\u2019t even encompass such temporary exchanges, in triplicate, and then wait 7 days before being able to engage in the lawful use of a regulated firearm, i.e., wait seven days to confront the burglar in one\u2019s own house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b499-11\">.

I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The Court defines the word \u201ctransfer\u201d as requiring a permanent exchange of title or possession of the firearm, but that would render the term essentially meaningless, and we do not read statutes, especially regulatory statutes of this kind, to render terms deliberately used by the Legislature meaningless. The Court goes through an analysis of dictionary definitions in an effort to determine what \u201ctransfer\u201d means. Such definitions are often helpful, because words used in a statute are ordinarily given their plain meaning, but the ultimate issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>is not how the lexicographers define the word but what the Legislature intended to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The provision in question was added to the law as part of what the Legislature called the Maryland Gun Violence Act of 1996, which was a comprehensive law designed to place additional limits on the trafficking in regulated firearms. Prior to that law, a <em>dealer, </em>who was then defined as a person engaged in the business of \u201cselling\u201d or \u201crepairing\u201d firearms, was not permitted to \u201csell or transfer\u201d a regulated firearm until seven days had elapsed from the time an application to \u201cpurchase or transfer\u201d the weapon was filed by the prospective \u201cpurchaser or transferee\u201d with the Secretary of State Police. <em>See </em>former Md.Code, art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 441, 442 (1987 Repl.Vol. and 1995 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The purpose of the waiting period was, and remains, to give the Secretary an opportunity to make an investigation and determine whether the prospective transferee is eligible to own and possess the weapon. <em>See </em>former \u00a7 442; current PS \u00a7\u00a7 5-121, 5-122. Although the former law spoke in terms of the dealer not selling or transferring the firearm until the waiting period expires, (and the current law speaks in terms of the dealer not selling, renting, or transferring the firearm until that period has expired), both laws obviously were intended to preclude any actual <em>delivery </em>of the firearm until that time. <em>See </em>current PS \u00a7 5-123(b), (c), and (d), requiring the dealer to \u201ccomplete\u201d the sale, rental, or transfer within 90 days after notice that the application was not disapproved and to notify the Secretary of the completed transaction within seven days after \u201cdelivery\u201d of the firearm; <em>also </em>former \u00a7 442(j). Read in a sensible way, the law prohibited a dealer from delivering a regulated firearm to another person, pursuant to a sale or transfer agreement (and currently a rental agreement as well), until the expiration of the waiting period.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In limiting the waiting period to transactions with licensed dealers, the former law contained an obvious and enormous loophole. Totally unregulated were secondary transactions, in which any person, other than a dealer, who happened to be in possession of a regulated firearm could transfer it to someone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>else, including a person not legally eligible to own or possess the weapon. The 1996 law clearly was intended to close that loophole. Not only did the 1996 law (current PS \u00a7 5-123) preclude dealers from renting firearms prior to the expiration of the waiting period but, more significantly, in what is now PS \u00a7 5-124, captioned \u201cSecondary Transactions,\u201dit applied the same seven-day waiting period applicable to dealers to sales, rentals, and transfers by persons who are not dealers. That was certainly a major and important extension of the effort to control the trafficking in these weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The terms \u201csell\u201d and \u201crent\u201d have a fairly clear and restrictive meaning. The term \u201ctransfer\u201d is obviously a broader term, meaning something beyond a sale or rental; otherwise, there would have been no reason for the General Assembly to place and leave it in the statute. The Court seems to accept that \u201ctransfer\u201d would include a gift, at least a permanent gift. The real question is whether it includes a loan. Keeping in mind that the prohibition against transferring a firearm until expiration of the waiting period applies to both dealers and non-dealers, I cannot imagine that the Legislature, in its effort to <em>close </em>a loophole, intended to open one even larger than the one it closed, by allowing <em>both dealers and non-dealers </em>to <em>lend </em>regulated firearms to persons without complying with the seven-day waiting period, but that is precisely what the Court seems to be saying. Does the Court really mean to hold that a dealer and a non-dealer, through the fiction of a loan, can lawfully deliver possession and control of a regulated firearm to a person without regard to the waiting period? <em>If so, the Court will have absolutely eviscerated the law, at least with respect to secondary transfers, and to what end\u2014for what purpose?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">I would hold that \u201ctransfer\u201d includes a loan\u2014at least one in which possession and control of the firearm is relinquished for anything more than a momentary period. Like all statutory language, the word should be given a reasonable meaning. I agree with the Court that the Legislature did not intend the word \u201ctransfer\u201d to prohibit a firearm owner from allowing a prospective purchaser, lessee, or transferee to test fire the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>weapon before deciding whether to purchase, rent, or otherwise acquire possession or control of it, any more than it would prevent the owner from allowing the prospective customer to hold and examine the weapon in the owner\u2019s presence. Nor would it prohibit an owner from allowing another competent person, at a firing range, to shoot the weapon in the presence of the owner. Those kinds of circumstances do not constitute a transfer of the weapon; to give that kind of expansive meaning to the term would be wholly unreasonable and would extend the term well beyond what could possibly have been intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">But that is <em>not </em>what occurred in this case. If the original objective of the parties had been implemented\u2014test firing of the weapon at a range to see if Nguyen was truly interested in buying it\u2014there would have been no violation of the statute. When Chow allowed Nguyen to retain the gun in his exclusive possession and control for some indefinite time, however, there <em>was </em>a transfer\u2014an unlawful one.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Judge RAKER and Judge BATTAGLIA have authorized me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
