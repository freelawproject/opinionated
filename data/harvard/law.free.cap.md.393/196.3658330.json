He was subsequently sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the first degree murder conviction and a concurrent twenty-year term for the burglary conviction. Petitioner timely filed an appeal with the Court of Special Appeals and that court affirmed the convictions. <em>Bryant v. State, </em>163 Md.App. 451, 881 A.2d 669 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari on November 15, 2005. We granted <em>certiorari </em>on December 19, 2005. <em>Bryant v. State, </em>390 Md. 284, 888 A.2d 341 (2005). Petitioner presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">\u201c1. Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s status as an inmate deprives him of the statutory privilege for communications related to his mental or emotional disorder to a nurse conducting a mental health assessment for diagnostic and treatment purposes at a county detention facility?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">\u201c2. Whether a criminal defendant must waive his constitutional right against self-incrimination as a condition prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>dent to the introduction of expert testimony rebutting or explaining evidence that the state relies upon to establish the <em>mens rea </em>element of the offense charged?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We shall not address the first question as it is written because it makes an assumption not supported by the record. Instead, for the reasons that follow, we hold that petitioner\u2019s statements during the intake process are not privileged. We further hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting petitioner\u2019s expert witness from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The Court of Special Appeals provided a summary of the facts that led to the present appeal from which we present the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">\u201cOn July 20, 2002, [petitioner]^ ex-wife, Donna Martin, was fatally stabbed at her townhouse located on Merust Lane in Gaithersburg. The victim sustained numerous stab and cutting wounds, and was pronounced dead soon after she was transported to the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">\u201cThe State presented evidence that [petitioner] had threatened Ms. Martin a year before she was killed. Specifically, at a court proceeding held on April 9, 2001, Ms. Martin was speaking to a judge in the presence of [petitioner].[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] A tape of [petitioner\u2019s comments was admitted in evidence, and showed that he made threatening comments to Ms. Martin at that time.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] In addition, Cynthia Sargeant, a registered nurse, came into contact with [petitioner] on April 9, 2001, during an intake medical screening at the Montgomery County Detention Center. Sargeant testified: \u2018[petitioner] indicated that he had a definite plan to kill her. He indicated that he enjoyed seeing her blood. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>indicated that he was obsessed with killing her and that she messed with him.\u2019 Sargeant added that [petitioner] also stated that the \u2018[t]hought of killing her won\u2019t go away.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">\u201cSeveral witnesses; from the victim\u2019s neighborhood testified that they saw a man, not specifically identified as [petitioner], near the victim\u2019s home on July 20, 2002. For example, Mary Freckleton testified that on July 20, 2002, between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., she was visiting her sister, who lived in an apartment on Merust Lane in Gaithersburg, when she looked out the window and noticed a man \u2018walking back and forth.\u2019 Freckleton, who visited her sister nearly every day, did not recognize the individual as someone who lived in the neighborhood. Later, between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m., Freckleton again saw the man. Thereafter, between 3:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., Freckleton saw the man \u2018sitting on the side of the embankment looking down at the apartments[.]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">\u201cWhen asked to describe the man, Freckleton responded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5R\">\u2018He was brown skin, short hair. I remember his lips was full. I say he was maybe six, five feet, something and he weighed about 200 and some pounds. He had real short close\u2014short close hair. His hair was cut real close. He was brown skin....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">\u201cWhen I seen him the first time, he had a tee-shirt on. It wasn\u2019t\u2014it was not white. If it was white, it was dirty. It was dirty, dirty. It wasn\u2019t white. He had ... I don\u2019t if it was jeans. I can\u2019t recall if it was blue jeans or black jeans.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">\u201cStanley Bradley testified that, at 5:00 p.m. on the date in question, he was working with Joseph Hammond, a friend, on Hammond\u2019s car, which was parked on Merust Lane. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>that time, he noticed a woman with a baby in her arms and a little boy walking toward the door to a townhouse. When the woman was at the door, Bradley heard a bang followed by the woman \u2018hollering.\u2019 Upon looking toward the house, Bradley saw the arm of an African-American male grab the woman by the hair and he also \u2018vaguely\u2019 saw a knife. The woman yelled: \u2018Somebody help me. He is going to kill me.\u2019 He saw a man drag the woman, who was still holding the baby, into the house, leaving the boy outside. Bradley also heard yelling coming from inside the house. A woman went to the door and took the child, who had been left outside. The police were called and, when they arrived approximately five minutes later, Bradley related what had occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">\u201cMs. Martin sustained multiple stab and cutting wounds. She was flown to Suburban Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. An autopsy performed by Dr. Zabiullah Ali revealed that Ms. Martin received eight stab wounds and nine cutting wounds. Two of the stab wounds injured Ms. Martin\u2019s left lung and one of them injured her heart.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201cOn the morning of July 24, 2002, [petitioner] was arrested in an apartment on North Summit Drive in Gaithersburg. The police found him sitting in a bedroom closet behind a closed door. A wristwatch that appeared to have dried blood on it was recovered from [petitioner]^ wrist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201cIn the defense case, counsel read the following statement to the jury: On February 14th of 2002, the defendant made the following statement to a physician, quote: T don\u2019t have the urge to kill any more like before.\u2019 [Petitioner] did not testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-8\"><em>Bryant, </em>163 Md.App. at 455-62, 881 A.2d at 672-76 (some footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The first question presented for our review requires our interpretation of Maryland Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-109(a)(3) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\u201c\u2018Patient\u2019 means a person who communicates or receives services regarding the diagnosis or treatment of his mental or emotional disorder from a psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or any other person participating directly or vitally with either in rendering those services in consultation with or under direct supervision of a psychiatrist or psychologist.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">We have often stated that \u201cthe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 476, 842 A.2d 743, 746 (2004) (quoting <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>364 Md. 354, 364, 772 A.2d 1240, 1245-46 (2001)). The first step in our analysis is to examine the plain language of the statute. <em>Grandison v. State, </em>390 Md. 412, 445, 889 A.2d 366, 385 (2005). We will not look beyond the plain meaning of the statute when the words used are unambiguous. <em>Grandison, </em>390 Md. at 445, 889 A.2d at 385; <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 858 A.2d 484 (2004); <em>Melton, </em>379 Md. at 477, 842 A.2d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">When the statute provides definitions of a particular term, we use the statutory definition in determining the scope of the specific words used. <em>Gilmer v. State, </em>389 Md. 656, 667, 887 A.2d 549, 556 (2005). Furthermore, each word of the statute must be read so as to not render it \u201csurplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>Gilmer, </em>389 Md. at 663, 887 A.2d at 553; <em>Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 583, 886 A.2d 876, 883 (2005); <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 453, 879 A.2d 1111, 1115 (2005). The Court has also stated that privilege statutes are interpreted narrowly. <em>E.I. du Pont de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 406, 718 A.2d 1129, 1134 (1998) (\u201cThe attorney-client privilege as applied in judicial proceedings is narrowly construed.... \u201d); <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Gussin, </em>350 Md. 552, 562, 714 A.2d 188, 192 (1998) (stating that the statutorily created accountant-client privilege is narrowly construed because it is in derogation of the common law).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The second question presented for our review requires the Court to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in excluding petitioner\u2019s expert witness testimony. We have often stated that \u201c \u2018the admissibility of expert testimony is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial court, and its action in admitting or excluding such testimony will seldom constitute a ground for reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clemons v. State, </em>392 Md. 339, 359, 896 A.2d 1059, 1071 (2006); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>370 Md. 191, 200, 803 A.2d 1034, 1039 (2002) (quoting <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 659, 612 A.2d 258, 273 (1992)); <em>Hartless v. State, </em>327 Md. 558, 576, 611 A.2d 581, 590 (1992); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 515, 495 A.2d 1, 15 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986); <em>Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 350, 473 A.2d 903, 912, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 900, 105 S.Ct. 276, 83 L.Ed.2d 212 (1984); <em>but see Kelly v. State, </em>392 Md. 511, 898 A.2d 419 (2006) (stating that the trial court has limited discretion in excluding all testimony from all factual witnesses of a particular party); <em>Redditt v. State, </em>337 Md. 621, 655 A.2d 390 (1995) (same); <em>Void v. State, </em>325 Md. 386, 601 A.2d 124 (1992) (same); <em>McCray v. State, </em>305 Md. 126, 501 A.2d 856 (1985) (same). We have further held that \u201c[i]n exercising the wide discretion vested in the trial courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>concerning the admissibility of expert testimony, a critical test is \u2018whether the expert\u2019s opinion will aid the trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rollins v. State, </em>392 Md. 455, 897 A.2d 821 (2006) (quoting <em>I.W. Berman Properties v. Porter Bros. Inc., </em>276 Md. 1, 12-14, 344 A.2d 65, 73-74 (1975)). We must, therefore, also determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the petitioner\u2019s expert witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">A. The Psychotherapist/Psychologist-Patient Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">While not specifically privileged under the common law, communications between a patient and his or her psychotherapist or psychologist are now statutorily privileged. The privilege was created by the legislature and is codified in C.J. \u00a7 9-109, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">\u201cUnless otherwise provided, in all judicial, legislative, or administrative proceedings, a <em>patient </em>or the patient\u2019s authorized representative has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent a witness from disclosing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">(1) Communications relating to diagnosis or treatment of the patient; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">(2) Any information that by its nature would show the existence of a medical record of the diagnosis or treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">C.J. \u00a7 9-109(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">Petitioner contends that he is a \u201cpatient\u201d as contemplated under the aforesaid subsection (a)(3), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">\u201c \u2018Patient\u2019 means a person who communicates or receives services regarding the diagnosis or treatment of his mental or emotional disorder from a psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or any other person participating directly or vitally with either in rendering those services in consultation with or under direct supervision of a psychiatrist or psychologist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">C.J. \u00a7 9-109(a)(3). In petitioner\u2019s view, the communications made to Ms. Sargeant as a part of the intake medical screening at the time of the prior proceeding on April 9, 2001, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>made for diagnosis or treatment and nurse Sargeant qualified as \u201cany other person participating directly or vitally\u201d in petitioner\u2019s diagnosis or treatment. As a consequence of what he deems his status as a \u201cpatient\u201d at the prior intake screening, petitioner argues that his comments to the nurse at that time were privileged and that the court erred in allowing the State to elicit those statements during the subsequent trial for the present offenses for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Petitioner\u2019s initial argument is not based upon a reading of C.J. \u00a7 9-109, but upon a general overview of Maryland\u2019s public policy of providing mental healthcare services to inmates. Petitioner points to the thousands of inmates and parolees who are in need of mental healthcare. He contends that as a result of such a great number of people in need of attention, the State has adopted a policy of providing mental healthcare services for all inmates who need it. This policy, petitioner posits, had its origin in the case of <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); where the Supreme Court of the United States held that the government has an \u201cobligation to provide medical care for those whom it is punishing by incarceration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 97 S.Ct. at 290, 50 L.Ed.2d 251. Furthermore, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has held that the medical treatment to which inmates are entitled includes mental healthcare services. <em>Bowring v. Godwin, </em>551 F.2d 44, 47 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Based upon the public policy he proffers exists, petitioner reasons that the communications between an inmate and any nurse or other person interviewing a potential inmate as to health conditions, during all intake screenings must be privileged. He alleges support exists in Maryland Code (1999), \u00a7 11-203 of the Correctional Services Article (\u201cC.S.\u201d), which requires local correctional facilities to provide for the safety, health, and welfare of inmates. The statute requires the local facility to provide (i) food and board, and (ii) \u201cany article of comfort that is considered necessary for a sick inmate by the physician attending the inmate.\u201d C.S. \u00a7 ll-203(a). Petitioner also points to COMAR 12.14.04.02(15), which requires local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>facility managers to \u201chave a written policy\u201d that includes, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cidentification, housing, treatment, supervision, and referral of a mentally ill inmate.\u201d Finally, petitioner states that Montgomery County Code Part 2 \u00a7 13-9, which requires the correctional facility to provide a medical examination and access to daily medical or sick call facilities, brings the intake screening within the scope of C.J. \u00a7 9-109. The State does not dispute that public policy requires correctional facilities to provide mental healthcare services to inmates. It argues, however, that the intake screening process is not part of the mental health <em>treatment </em>provided by these institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We first turn to the meaning of the word \u201cpatient\u201d in C.J. \u00a7 9-109. The statute itself provides the definition of \u201cpatient\u201d and, therefore, as we stated earlier, we need not go beyond that language in order to determine petitioner\u2019s status. <em>Gilmer, </em>389 Md. at 667, 887 A.2d at 556. Section 9-109(a)(3), provides the definition of \u201cpatient\u201d as stated <em>supra, </em>and for the purpose of this case, it can be reduced to two specific requirements: First, there must be a communication regarding the <em>diagnosis </em>or <em>treatment </em>of the person\u2019s mental or emotional disorder; second, the communication must be with a psychiatrist, licensed psychologist or \u201cany other person participating <em>directly </em>or <em>vitally </em>with either in rendering those services in consultation with or under direct supervision of a psychiatrist or psychologist.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Our inquiry focuses on the purpose of the communication: Is the exchange between the inmate and the screener \u201cregarding diagnosis or treatment?\u201d In order to answer this question we look to the purpose of the intake screening. Petitioner argues that the intake screening is an integral part of the inmate\u2019s treatment. He relies on the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (\u201cNCCHC\u201d) <em>Standards for Health in Jails </em>(2003).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Montgomery County follows the NCCHC standards. Both petitioner and the State rely on these standards in support of their respective positions. One of the requirements for NCCHC accreditation, which Montgomery County Correctional Facilities has achieved, is that the institution must provide mental healthcare services for all inmates who require them. NCCHC standard J-G-04. NCCHC has also provided guidance on what is required for providing mental healthcare services to inmates. In 1992, it issued a <em>Position Statement, Mental Health Services in Correctional Settings. </em>The statement provided that based upon the decision in <em>Ruiz v. Estelle, </em>503 F.Supp. 1265, 1339 (S.D.Tex.1980), <em>rev\u2019d in part, </em>679 F.2d 1115 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1042, 103 S.Ct. 1438, 75 L.Ed.2d 795 (1983), the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">\u201cminimum requirements for mental health services in correctional settings must include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u2022 screening and evaluation to identify those needing mental health care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u2022 a treatment plan for identified problems;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u2022 qualified mental health staff sufficient to treat the population;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">\u2022 a health records system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">\u2022 a suicide prevention and treatment program; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\u2022 the appropriate use of behavior-altering medications.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">The position letter further provided a standard for mental health evaluations that is very similar to Montgomery County Code Part 2 \u00a7 13-9. It requires an inmate examination <em>within fourteen days of admission </em>for evaluation of that inmate\u2019s mental healthcare needs. Petitioner asserts that NCCHC standard J-H-02 requires that health records and information must be kept in confidence and that staff must be trained to maintain the confidentiality of inmates\u2019 records and information. Furthermore, petitioner contends, NCCHC standard J-A-09 requires that all <em>\u201cclinical encounters </em>\u201d be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>conducted in private and must encourage the inmate to participate in subsequent healthcare services. In petitioner\u2019s view, the entire process, including the intake screening, is for the purpose of providing mental healthcare services to the inmate and that any communication relating to that process is for the diagnosis or treatment of the inmate. Hence, he asserts, it must be privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The State also relies on the NCCHC standards, but it gives them a narrower reading. It points to NCCHC J-E-02 entitled \u201cRECEIVING SCREENING,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"AL3\">\u201cStandard</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">Receiving screening is performed on all inmates <em>immediately upon arrival </em>at the intake facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Compliance Indicators</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">2. Qualified health care professionals or health-trained personnel perform the receiving screening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">3. The receiving screening takes place <em>immediately </em>for all inmates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">5. Reception personnel, using a health-authority-approved form, inquire about [the inmate\u2019s medical and mental history] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Discussion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">Receiving screening is a process of structured inquiry and observation <em>designed to prevent newly arrived inmates who pose a threat to their own or others\u2019 health or safety from being admitted to the facility\u2019s general population, </em>and to get them rapid medical care. It is intended to identify potential emergency situations among new arrivals to the facility, and also to ensure that those patients with known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>illnesses and currently in medication are identified for <em>further </em>assessment and continued treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">... [T]his standard allows receiving screening to be conducted by <em>health-trained comctional staff members. </em>The training correctional officers are given depends upon the role they are expected to play in the receiving screening process. At a minimum, they receive instruction on how to take a medical history; how to make the required observations; how to determine the appropriate disposition of an inmate based on responses to questions and observations; and how to document their findings on the receiving screening form. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">We can gather a number of insightful points from the NCCHC\u2019s description of the intake screening process. First, it is immediately given to every inmate without regard to their actual medical or mental needs. Second, it can be conducted by a healthcare professional or \u201chealth-trained\u201d personnel, it does not require that the person doing the intake screening be a mental healthcare provider or be associated with any psychiatrist or psychologist. Third, the intake follows a specific form designed to determine any possible concerns about the inmate. Finally, the screening is <em>\u201cdesigned to prevent newly arrived inmates who pose a threat to their own or others\u2019 health or safety from being admitted to the facility\u2019s general population </em>....\" (Emphasis added.) The NCCHC\u2019s own standards, which are utilized in Montgomery County, provide that the primary purpose of the screening is to protect not only the individual inmate but the general population from the inmates\u2019 possible physical and mental issues and not for diagnosis or treatment of the inmates. Although the screening may ultimately lead to diagnosis or treatment, such a result is only incidental at the time the immediate intake screening is conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the communication was for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of the inmate, the person with whom the inmate communicates, at the time of intake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>screening, must be \u201cparticipating <em>directly </em>or <em>vitally </em>... in consultation with or under direct supervision of a psychiatrist or psychologist,\u201d in order for the inmate to be a \u201cpatient.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 9-109(a)(3) (emphasis added). In construing the statute we must give force to each word and not make any word superfluous or nugatory. <em>Gilmer, </em>389 Md. at 663, 887 A.2d at 553; <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 583, 886 A.2d at 883; <em>Moore, </em>388 Md. at 453, 879 A.2d at 1115. The words \u201cdirectly\u201d and \u201cvitally\u201d modify the statement \u201cwith either in rendering those services,\u201d i.e., diagnosis or treatment. They play a significant role in our interpretation because under the plain understanding and use of the English language they serve to narrow the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We will briefly discuss the statute\u2019s legislative history. The psychiatrist/psychologist-patient statutory privilege was first enacted as Chapter 503 of the Acts of 1966. The stated purpose of the statute was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\u201cAN ACT ... providing that certain disclosures and communications between a patient and a certified psychologist or a person licensed to practice medicine while acting in the capacity of a psychiatrist shall be privileged communications under certain circumstances and relating generally to the terms and conditions for this privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The act went on to define the word \u201cpatient,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">\u201cAs <em>used in this section \u2018patient\u2019 means a person who communicates regarding or receives services for the diagnosis or treatment of his mental or emotional disorder from a psychiatrist, certified psychologist, or other persons participating </em>DIRECTLY AND VITALLY <em>with either in rendering such services in consultation with, or under the direct supervision and direction of a psychiatrist or psychologist</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-9\"><em>Italicized </em>text in the statute indicated new matter added to existing law. Thus, Chapter 503, an addition to Article 35 of the 1957 Code, was new law. Moreover, text set in ALL CAPITALS indicated amendments to the bill. It is clear, then, that the words \u201cdirectly and vitally\u201d were specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>added to the proposed bill during the Legislative process. As a result, it is reasonable to infer that the General Assembly intended those words to play a specific role in the effect of the law, i.e., limiting the scope of the privilege and who qualifies as a recipient of privileged information.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The words \u201cdirectly\u201d and \u201cvitally,\u201d are not defined in the statute. We can ascertain their common every day meaning through the use of a dictionary. <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Taxation v. Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Md. 2, 14, 702 A.2d 690, 696 (1997) (\u201c[l]n deciding what a term\u2019s ordinary and natural meaning is, we may, and often do, consult the dictionary.\u201d). In using dictionaries to interpret the intent of the legislature we have further stated: \u201cBecause we are attempting to ascertain the intent of the Legislature in choosing certain language at a point in time, resort to a dictionary, legal or otherwise, should logically include consultation of those editions (in addition to current editions) of dictionaries that were extant at the time of the pertinent legislative enactments.\u201d <em>Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 260-61 n. 11, 884 A.2d 1171, 1181 n. 11 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u201cDirectly\u201d means: \u201cwithout any intervening space or time: next in order[,] ... without divergence from the source or the original,] ... in close relational proximity[,] ... without any intervening agency or instrumentality or determining influence: without any intermediate step.... \u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>641 (Unabridged ed. 1961)(\u201cWebster\u2019s\u201d); <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>407 (Unabridged ed. 1983)(\u201cRandom House\u201d) (\u201cin a direct line, way, or manner; straight....\u201d); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>492 (8th ed.2004) (\u201c1. In a straightforward manner. 2. In a straight line or course. 3. Immediately.\u201d). In the context of C.J. \u00a7 9-109, \u201cdirectly\u201d means that there cannot be an intermediate or intervening step between the person receiving the information and the diagnosis or treatment. In the present case, as explained <em>supra, </em>the communication is not \u201cdirectly\u201d related to the diagnosis or treatment of the inmate. Furthermore, the nurse\u2014at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>intake screening-\u2014does not work \u201cdirectly\u201d with a psychiatrist or psychologist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u201cVitally\u201d is the adverb of the word \u201cvital,\u201d which means: \u201c[0]f the utmost importance: essential to the continued existence, vigor, efficiency, independence, or value of something expressed or implied ...; <em>often: </em>taking priority in consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ation over other factors or elements.... \u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2558; <em>Random House </em>at 1597 (\u201cnecessary to the existence, continuance, or well-being of something; indispensable; essential .... \u201d). The use of the word \u201cvitally\u201d in C.J. \u00a7 9-109 means that the person receiving the information must be essential or indispensable for the diagnosis or treatment of the individual. The intake nurse, (or other intake screener), does not meet either of these requirements. Her role in the diagnosis or treatment of the inmate, at that time, ends with a referral for further evaluation prior to actual treatment being rendered. Her function, at that point, does not include treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In light of the clear meaning of the statute, the terms \u201cdirectly or vitally\u201d must be read as narrowing the scope of the privilege (even if it were to apply generally to all intake proceedings). The statute restricts the privilege to those communications taking place between an individual and someone who is intimately related to that individual\u2019s psychological or psychiatric treatment and additionally is directly associated with a psychiatrist or psychologist. Were we to interpret this section as allowing the privilege to cover <em>any </em>communication that might ultimately lead to treatment as privileged, the words \u201cdirectly\u201d and \u201cvitally\u201d would be rendered superfluous. Had that been the intent of the Legislature, it could have enacted the statute as it was originally presented in the bill. The General Assembly, however, expressly added these two qualifiers and they must be given the effect intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The trial court, in accordance with this interpretation, properly stated: \u201cThe intake screener\u2019s duties are to take information from recent inmates concerning their <em>whole medical condition. </em>Information concerning their mental health status is just one of [many] topics about which the inmate is queried.... \u201d [Emphasis added.] As a result, \u201cThe intake screener at MCDC cannot be construed as <em>\u2018a person participating directly or vitally with [a psychiatrist or psychologist] ....\u2019\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Petitioner claims that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 and the trial court\u2019s decisions, in effect, make an inmate\u2019s mere status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>as a detainee determinative of his right to claim the privilege afforded by the statute. It is not the status of the inmate as a detainee, however, that is determinative. It is the status of the person to whom he communicated his remarks that normally will determine whether the privilege applies. Whether the individual is an inmate or not, he or she must be able to show that the person to whom the communication is directed belongs to one of the statutory classifications in order to claim the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Lastly, petitioner argues that such narrow interpretation of the statute is contrary to holdings from other courts. We disagree. Petitioner offers the following examples: <em>United States v. Lincoln, </em>403 F.3d 703, 705 (9th Cir.2005) (the federal patient-psychotherapist privilege protected contents of a workbook written by an inmate as part of anger management classes, thus it was related to treatment); <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>271 Conn. 165, 180, 856 A.2d 383, 392 (2004) (statutory privilege protects \u201cIn-Patient Mental Health Nursing Assessment\u201d of inmate); <em>In re Joy P., </em>200 Wis.2d 227, 234, 546 N.W.2d 494, 498 (Ct.App.1996) (communications with jail psychologist are privileged); <em>State v. Langley, </em>314 Or. 247, 264, 839 P.2d 692, 703 (1992) (written assignments, i.e., treatment, in a program for mentally and emotionally disturbed inmates are privileged). The fatal flaw in petitioner\u2019s argument is that all these cases refer to activities involving individuals who would likely qualify under C.J. \u00a7 9-109 in light of our interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Our analysis of C.J. \u00a7 9-109 leads to the conclusion that the trial court in the present case properly admitted nurse Sargeant\u2019s testimony, as to the petitioner\u2019s statements at an intake screening in relation to a prior incident. That intake screening was not conducted for the purpose of communicating information relating to the diagnosis or treatment of the inmate, but to protect the inmate and the general population of the facility. Furthermore, the evidence in the record does not reflect that nurse Sargeant was \u201cdirectly or vitally\u201d related to diagnosis or treatment generally, or of the petitioner specifically; nor does the evidence indicate that at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>she conducted petitioner\u2019s intake screening, she was then acting in concert with a psychiatrist or psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">B. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Petitioner was convicted of premeditated first degree murder under Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Article 27 \u00a7 407, which states: \u201cAll murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or lying in wait, or by any kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing shall be murder in the first degree.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury found that petitioner\u2019s actions were premeditated. In <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>363 Md. 130, 767 A.2d 844 (2001), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">\u201cThe element that distinguishes this form of second degree murder from first degree murder is that of deliberation and premeditation. For murder \u201cto be \u2018deliberate\u2019 there must be a full and conscious knowledge of the purpose to kill; and to be \u2018premeditated\u2019 the design to kill must have preceded the killing by an appreciable length of time, that is, time enough to be deliberate.\u2019 <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830, 842 (1980). We added in <em>Tichnell, </em>however, that \u2018[i]t is unnecessary that the deliberation or premeditation shall have existed for any particular length of time.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 717-18, 415 A.2d at 842. \u2018Appreciable length of time\u2019 simply means \u2018any amount of time sufficient to convince the trier of fact that the purpose to kill was not the immediate offspring of rashness and impetuous temper,\u2019 but was the product of a mind \u2018fully conscious of its own design.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willey v. State, </em>328 Md. 126, 133, 613 A.2d 956, 959 (1992). Quoting from <em>Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88, 108, 472 A.2d 953, 963, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873, 105 S.Ct. 226, 83 L.Ed.2d 155 (1984), we confirmed in <em>Willey </em>that \u2018[i]f the killing results from a <em>choice made as the result of thought, however short the struggle between the intention and the act, </em>it is sufficient to characterize the crime as deliberate and premeditated murder.\u2019 <em>Willey, supra, </em>328 Md. at 133, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>613 A.2d at 959. Indeed, a delay between firing a first and second shot \u2018is enough time for reflection and decision to justify a finding of premeditation.\u2019 <em>Hunt v. State, </em>345 Md. 122, 161, 691 A.2d 1255, 1274, <em>cert. denied, </em>521 U.S. 1131, 117 S.Ct. 2536, 138 L.Ed.2d 1036 (1997) and cases cited therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 148-49, 767 A.2d at 854. Petitioner claims that he should have been allowed to present testimony from an expert witness to the effect that he suffered from an impulse control disorder, which resulted in his inability to form the required <em>mens rea </em>of premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Before trial, petitioner informed the State that he would seek to introduce the testimony of two experts, Susan Fiester, M.D., and Michael O\u2019Connell, Ph.D. The experts were to testify that petitioner suffered from an impulse control disorder and that, due to this ailment, petitioner was unable to form the required <em>mens rea </em>for premeditated murder. The State moved to exclude the testimony, arguing that a condition such as impulse control disorder was not relevant unless the defendant admitted that he had committed the crime. The trial court denied the motion, stating that it would revisit the issue during trial and evaluate whether the defense had provided a sufficient factual basis for admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">When the State closed its case, petitioner\u2019s counsel attempted to have one of the expert witnesses, Dr. Fiester, testify. The expert witness offered her testimony outside of the presence of the jury. During that direct examination, the expert testified that petitioner had impulse control disorder. She explained that this condition consisted of \u201cthe occurrence of discrete episodes of a failure to control or resist aggressive impulses.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>163 Md.App. at 466, 881 A.2d at 678. She also testified that \u201cthe ability to have that intent and the ability to control one\u2019s behavior can vary from moment-to-moment, day-to-day, month-to-month, or year-to-year in any given individual, even with a baseline set of personality or psychiatric symptoms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 881 A.2d at 678-79. During cross-examination, Dr. Fiester further testified that \u201c[t]he disorder is present all the time, but the ability of the individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>al to resist those impulses can vary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470, 881 A.2d at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The trial court questioned the expert witness when the State completed its cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: You are not saying, are you, that every person or even this person who has impulse control disorder isn\u2019t capable of controlling his actions, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">THE WITNESS: At all points in time, no. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVs\">THE COURT: So, anyone with this disorder is capable of planning a future action. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">THE WITNESS: Yes. Just the presence of the disorder itself, without further information, would [lead] me to say that it\u2019s possible an individual that carries this diagnosis could plan a crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 470, 881 A.2d at 680. After petitioner\u2019s counsel and the State completed their examination of the witness, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">\u201cI am holding that [Dr. Fiester\u2019s] testimony is not competent and is not relevant to this case. There is no evidence that there was an absence of a particular mental element of the crimes charged in this case. At the most, we have testimony from Dr. Fiester that the defendant suffers from impulse control disorder, which affects him from time-to-time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-11\">\u201cWhether that disorder affected him at the time of the crimes committed here would be completely speculative. This testimony would not assist the jury, but would rather confuse them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 470-71, 881 A.2d at 680. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision, the Court of Special Appeals found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AES\">\u201cDr. Fiester\u2019s testimony was not relevant to the issues in the case. The doctor\u2019s testimony would merely have presented evidence that [petitioner] suffered from an impulse control disorder, which sometimes prevented him from controlling his aggressive impulses. There was simply no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>evidence that Ms. Martin\u2019s murder was the result of an impulsive act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 482, 881 A.2d at 687. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Petitioner argues that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision required the petitioner to testify in order to present evidence refuting the <em>mens rea </em>of premeditated murder. In support of this contention, petitioner points to the intermediate appellate court\u2019s statement that: <em>\u201cAmong other things, </em>[petitioner] never acknowledged that he murdered Ms. Martin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 881 A.2d at 686 (emphasis added). It is clear, however, that petitioner\u2019s failure to testify was but one of a number of reasons for which the Court of Special Appeals found that the trial court properly excluded the expert witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The admissibility of expert testimony is governed by Maryland Rule 5-702, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\u201cExpert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">We have previously described the basic standard for the initial inquiry into the admissibility of expert testimony in <em>State v. Smullen, </em>380 Md. 233, 844 A.2d 429 (2004), where Judge Wilner, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">\u201cEven reliable evidence is admissible only if it is relevant in the particular case, <em>i.e., </em>if it has a tendency to make the existence of a fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Maryland Rules 5-401 and 5-402. The requirement of relevance applies not just to factual evidence but to expert testimony as well. Testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>by experts is admissible only if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, and, in making that determination, the court must decide, among other things, \u2018whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\u2019 Maryland Rule 5-702. The question, in this regard, is whether an issue of consequence in this case was sufficiently generated to which the proposed evidence would be relevant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 268-69, 844 A.2d at 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The Court of Special Appeals appropriately relied on <em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 536 A.2d 622 (1988), for the proposition that evidence negating the <em>mens rea </em>of an alleged offense is relevant and admissible for that purpose. <em>Bryant, </em>163 Md. App. at 474, 881 A.2d at 682. As the intermediate appellate court pointed out, <em>Hoey </em>was followed by <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988), where this Court determined that expert testimony is admissible for showing that a defendant had a subjective belief that the use of force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury in support of the defendant\u2019s imperfect self-defense claim. <em>Id. </em>at 48, 542 A.2d at 1258. These opinions did not, however, hold that expert testimony offered to negate the <em>mens rea </em>of an alleged offense was admissible without a proper foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We find <em>Hartless v. State, </em>327 Md. 558, 611 A.2d 581 (1992), to be on point. David Andrew Hartless was convicted of the premeditated first degree murder of a 20-year-old clerk at a High\u2019s Dairy store. Before trial, the defense informed the State that it intended to provide expert psychiatric testimony negating the <em>mens rea </em>of premeditated murder. At trial, the defense attempted to introduce the psychological profile of Hartless through the testimony of his psychiatrist, Dr. McDaniel. The testimony was to point out that Hartless was subject to a high level of stress from his father. The trial court then stated that such testimony alone would not be sufficiently relevant to be admissible. The following colloquy, relevant to the case at bar, ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: ... What we\u2019re saying is here we have the right to show that a particular mental element of a crime did not exist. If we put on Dr. McDaniel to testify as to what a psychological profile was, what his state of mind was, what stress was there, what other matters were brought to bear on him, they\u2019re subject not only to my direct examination but to the State\u2019s cross-examination.... She\u2019s also subject to the State\u2019s rebuttal witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">THE COURT: Wfiiat would be the conclusion of the doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa-\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, the conclusion is the psychological profile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">THE COURT: What would be the conclusion? The conclusion is that he has a psychological profile\u2014so does everyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: And that\u2019s a factor to be taken into determination by the ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">THE COURT: For what purpose, Mr. Kraft?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: To determine whether he had the sufficient <em>mens rea </em>to create the intent. It\u2019s all done by inference, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 575-76, 611 A.2d at 589-90. The trial court then found that the defense had failed to provide an appropriate factual foundation for the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">We affirmed the trial court decision in <em>Hartless; </em>Judge McAuliffe, writing for the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">\u201cIn Hartless\u2019 case, the psychological testimony, standing alone, had little or no rational nexus to the issues of premeditation and intent. It is thus unclear how a jury could have found the profile helpful in determining those issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-13\">\u201cThe absence of a nexus between a psychological profile of the defendant that Dr. McDaniel might have been able to relate and the issues before the jury resulted, at least in part, from the absence of an adequate evidentiary foundation. As the trial judge noted, the defendant failed to produce admissible evidence of some facts that Dr. McDaniel wished to rely on in determining the defendant\u2019s psycho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>logical background, and failed to produce evidence of particular facts relating to the occurrence of the criminal event, <em>i.e., </em>the defendant\u2019s version of what happened, that were essential, not only to the formation of the expert\u2019s opinion but to the relevance of that opinion to the issues in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 577, 611 A.2d at 590. As <em>Hartless </em>demonstrates, although expert testimony can be admitted to negate the <em>mens rea </em>element of a specific intent crime, a proper evidentiary foundation normally must be laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Petitioner contends that such a foundation was properly established in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In his view a proper inference can be drawn that the killing was impulsive. First, he contends, that \u201cthe manner of Ms. Martin\u2019s death is entirely consistent with an explosive act of rage; she was stabbed multiple times in an apparently impulsive manner .... \u201d According to petitioner because there was \u201cno clear \u2018execution style\u2019 stab or cut\u201d the killing must have been impulsive. Second, he states that the killer\u2019s apparent exit through a window, broken in the process, was indicative of a state of panic after the stabbing. Finally, petitioner contends, that the presence of male clothing and a picture of petitioner with Ms. Martin and their children found in the apartment suggested that the couple had reconciled. These inferences, which arguably may be proper, do not adequately support petitioner\u2019s contention that a proper foundation had been laid to admit the expert testimony. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201cthe objective evidence clearly showed that the murderer acted with premeditation. We note, for example, that an individual was seen pacing near Ms. Martin\u2019s residence for hours before the murder, and the same person questioned a boy to learn where Ms. Martin lived. Inside Ms. Martin\u2019s residence, the cord to one telephone was cut and the other was missing. Two knives were found, as was a stick used to sharpen knives. <em>This conduct is the antithesis of an impulsive act. Therefore, Dr. Fiester\u2019s testimony would not have </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>made it more likely that the murderer acted without premeditation. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\"><em>\u201cIn addition, </em>although [petitioner] sought to admit expert testimony that he suffered from an impulse disorder, <em>Dr. Fiester indicated that, even with the disorder, [petitioner] was still sometimes able to control his impulses and he would be capable of planning a crime. Accordingly, the effect of the disorder on [petitioner]\u2019s ability to form the requisite mens rea, and in explaining his earlier threats against Ms. Martin, was speculative.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\"><em>Bryant, </em>163 Md.App. at 481, 881 A.2d at 686-87 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">We are not holding, and neither did the Court of Special Appeals, that a defendant must testify in order to introduce expert testimony in respect to the <em>mens rea </em>for premeditated first degree murder. There must be sufficient evidence on the record, however, of whatever nature, supporting the expert witness\u2019s testimony. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>as the trial court pointed out, there is insufficient foundational evidence to support petitioner\u2019s argument that he suffers from impulse control disorder and that the death of the Ms. Martin was the result of that affliction. In fact, as the Court of Special Appeals recognized, the totality of the evidence points towards premeditation. We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied petitioner\u2019s request to allow his expert to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">We hold that a criminal defendant\u2019s status as an inmate does not deprive him or her of the statutory privilege for communications related to his mental or emotional disorder. The privilege, however, does not extend to communications to a person, nurse or otherwise, conducting an intake screening at a county detention facility for the purpose of \u201cpreventing] newly arrived inmates who pose a threat to their own or others\u2019 health or safety to be admitted to the facility\u2019s general population.\u201d As a result, the trial court properly admitted the nurse\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>We also hold that, although a defendant does not have to waive his right of self-incrimination as a condition precedent to the introduction of expert testimony rebutting or explaining evidence that the State relies upon to establish the <em>mens rea </em>element of the offense charged, there must be a proper factual foundation supporting the expert testimony proffered. Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding petitioner\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-10\">. The prior proceeding was a bond review hearing stemming from the alleged prior stabbing of Ms. Martin by petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-11\">. \"The tape was not transcribed in the record.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>163 Md.App. at 456 n. 1, 881 A.2d at 672 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\">. It is unclear whether the word \"either\u201d in the statute refers to \"diagnosis or treatment\u201d or whether it refers to \"a psychiatrist [or] licensed psychologist.\u201d Our analysis and holding are the same under both interpretations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\">. Petitioner argues that the psychiatrist/psychologist-patient privilege is analogous to the attorney-client privilege and that the statements made to the nurse should be equated to those made to a paralegal during an intake interview of a potential client for a lawyer. The statutory language governing attorney-client privilege, codified under C.J. \u00a7 9-108, however, is completely different than that of C.J. \u00a7 9-109. While C.J. \u00a7 9-108 codifies the common law attorney-client privilege, C.J. \u00a7 9-109 is an entirely statutory construct. As a result, C.J. \u00a7 9-109\u2019s interpretation must be restricted to the statutory language used in that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">.

Nurse Sargeant, during a hearing on a defense's motion <em>in limine </em>to suppress her testimony at the murder trial (as to what had been said at the intake screening relating to the prior stabbing incident), stated that she was an employee of the Montgomery County Department of Corrections and provided the following explanation of the intake process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ane\">\u201cI think I was working in the medical [department] that afternoon, and people come to the medical service after they\u2019re processed through the other services in the jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\"It\u2019s on a first come first serve in terms of new lockups. They are brought up and put into, we sort of call it the bull pen, waiting to be meeting with a nurse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\"And then one of us nurses just grabs the new lockup, screen, introduces himself and asks the person to come into the exam room.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aee\">In addition, Arthur M. Wallenstein, the director of the Montgomeiy County Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, at the same hearing testified that the intake screening is conducted by community health registered nurses, not mental health specialists. He pointed out that referrals from the intake screening are not to the jail psychiatrist, but to the Crisis Intervention Unit (\"CIU\u201d), which then refers the inmate to the appropriate specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Ms. Sargeant also explained that in addition to conducting intake screenings she also subsequently worked with the jail psychiatrist and transcribed orders for medications. She further testified that after petitioner was referred to the CIU, as a result of the intake screening at issue here, she eventually participated in the petitioner's psychiatric treatment. She stated, however, that <em>at the time of the intake screening </em>she was not providing medical care or treatment to the petitioner. Neither at the hearing, nor at the subsequent trial for the murder of Ms. Martin, was the nurse asked to reveal any communications that may have taken place during petitioner's treatment after the intake screening. The nurse's subsequent role in the diagnosis or treatment of an inmate does not change the purpose of the intake screening, which, as already stated, is to protect the inmate and the general population of the jail from the inmate\u2019s possible physical and mental issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">When Ms. Sargeant testified at trial, the defense attempted to elicit information regarding her subsequent treatment of the petitioner. The trial court, upon the State\u2019s objections, did not allow Ms. Sargeant to mention her participation in petitioner\u2019s treatment after the intake screening was conducted and petitioner was referred to the jail psychiatrist. Petitioner has not appealed the trial court's ruling on the exclusion of that testimony and, therefore, the propriety of that ruling is not before the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\">.
