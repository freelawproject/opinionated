Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-18\">Mayard was involved in the purchase of one ounce of cocaine and in the simultaneous planning of another transaction in a shopping mall parking lot in Gretna, Louisiana. Unfortunately for Mayard his \u201cbusiness\u201d associates turned out to be undercover special agent Ronnie Ebright of the Drug Enforcement Administration and a confidential informant who was \u201cwired\u201d for sound. Agent Ebright was conducting an ongoing investigation of the cocaine trafficking activities of Ashton Joe O\u2019Brien. Mayard drove a truck for O\u2019Brien\u2019s marine supply business and had been tagged by two reliable informants as a cocaine deliveryman for O\u2019Brien.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-19\">Mayard was indicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and one count of distribution, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), respectively. He first pleaded not guilty but, at a rearraignment, changed his plea to guilty. There was no plea agreement. During his Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 guilty plea allocution Mayard disputed the government\u2019s contention that he had implicated O\u2019Brien during the parking lot transaction. In his testimony pursuant to a subpoena at O\u2019Brien\u2019s trial Mayard again denied cocaine-related involvement with O\u2019Brien. The court ordered a presentence investigation (PSI) of Mayard. The probation officer recommended an upward adjustment in the offense level for obstruction of justice and the refusal of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. During his sessions with the probation officer Mayard denied O\u2019Brien\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-20\">Mayard challenged the factual basis of the PSI. The trial court conducted a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ing at which agent Ebright testified and the tape recording of the parking lot conversation was played. Mayard maintains that the tape was garbled and that in referring to \u201cJoe\u201d he was simply \u201cgoing with the flow\u201d of the conversation. He insists that his relationship with O\u2019Brien was strictly legitimate. He further contends that by pleading guilty he had accepted responsibility for his crimes entitling him to a reduction in the Sentencing Guidelines offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">After listening to the tape and hearing the testimony of agent Ebright the trial court credited the agent\u2019s testimony and concluded that the finding was \u201cinescapable that [Mayard was] not telling the truth, that he did indeed obstruct justice\u201d and that he had failed to accept responsibility for his actions. The court increased the offense level by two for obstruction of justice and declined to reduce for acceptance of responsibility. The court then sentenced Mayard in accordance with the Sentencing Guidelines to a fine, 27 months imprisonment, and three years supervised release on each count, ordering that the two sentences run concurrently. Mayard timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Mayard contends that the trial court erred in increasing his offense level by two for obstruction of justice for refusing to implicate Joe O\u2019Brien, and further contends that the court should have adjusted his offense level down to 12 which, in category I, would have mandated a sentencing range of 10-16 months. Our review of the record is guided by the congressional mandate that we \u201cgive due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and ... accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e); <em>United States v. Tellez, </em>882 F.2d 141 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">In the case at bar the trial judge expressly concluded that, even absent the tape, he would credit the testimony of agent Ebright that Mayard had repeatedly mentioned Joe O\u2019Brien as his cocaine supplier during their conversation. Based on this credibility determination the trial judge found that Mayard had accounted falsely to the probation officer and had testified falsely as to the nature of his relationship with O\u2019Brien, thus warranting an upward adjustment of the offense level for obstruction of justice. <em>See </em>Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">Finding \u201csufficient evidence in the record to permit the sentencing judge to conclude that [Mayard] obstructed the administration of justice,\u201d <em>United States v. Franco-Torres, </em>869 F.2d 797, 800 (5th Cir.1989), we will not disturb that assessment. Our conclusion is not altered by Application Note 2 to \u00a7 3C1.1, which suggests that \u201csuspect testimony and statements should be evaluated in a light most favorable to the defendant.\u201d As we noted in <em>Franco-Torres, </em>this Note \u201csimply instructs the sentencing judge to resolve in favor of the defendant those conflicts about which the judge, after weighing the evidence, has no firm conviction.\u201d 869 F.2d at 801. In Mayard\u2019s case, the trial judge\u2019s conviction as to the weight of the evidence was firm indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Having affirmed the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Mayard obstructed justice from his rearraignment through his sentencing, it would be inconsistent for us to honor Mayard\u2019s second contention that he accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct. The sole evidence that Mayard accepted responsibility is his guilty plea. Guideline \u00a7 3El.l(c) expressly mandates that a guilty plea does not entitle a defendant to a sentencing reduction as a matter of right. Although this plea may \u201cprovide some evidence\u201d of the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, Application Note 3 to Guideline \u00a7 3E1.1, in light of our conclusions as to the factual basis for the obstruction of justice element, Mayard has not carried his burden of establishing the applicability of this mitigating factor to his offense level. <em>See United States v. Urrego-Linares, </em>879 F.2d 1234 (4th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, - U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 346, </em>107 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">The sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
