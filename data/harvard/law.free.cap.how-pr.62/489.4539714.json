In the regular course of the calendar this cause could not be reached in eighteen months at least, thus giving ample time for the return of the commission from Shanghai. Second. The plaintiff has not complied with the statute relating to preferences. Rule 36' is founded on subdivision 10 of sections 791 and 793 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the Oode of Civil Procedure, which provides that where the right to a preference does not appear in the pleadings, the order giving the preference should be obtained before notice of trial, and should be served either before or with the notice. The plaintiff having noticed the cause for the May and October circuits, he has waived his right to a preference. Unless the pleadings show sufficient facts to give the cause perference, the preliminary order is required <em>(Code of Civil Pro., see. </em>793). Third. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure <em>(seo. </em>17) authorizing a convention of the general term justices to establish rules of practice, does not empower them to make rules which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Code <em>(Gormerly </em>agt. <em>McGlynn, </em>84 <em>N. Y., </em>284). Fourth. Inasmuch as the plaintiff did not avail himself of the statute in serving his order for a preference, he should be stayed until the return of the commission as the defendant\u2019s motion is made in good faith, and they cannot be charged with laches.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b496-5\">Barrett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3U\">\u2014 The motion for a commission is granted, with stay until the 1st Monday of March, 1882, and the cause set down for trial on day subsequent to the expiration of stay.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
