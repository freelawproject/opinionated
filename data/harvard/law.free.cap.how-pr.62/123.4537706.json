There were also several suits pending in the circuit court of Christian county, Missouri The parties entered into an agreement to submit all their matters in difference to two arbitrators for settlement, \u201csaid arbitrators finding an award to be final, and conclusive on the parties hereto.\u201d The submission also contained a clause, that \u201c all suits now pending\u201d are hereby suspended until the award of said arbitrators is made, when the same shall be dismissed:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b129-8\"><em>Held, </em>that this language indicates an intention upon the part of both parties that the submission should not operate as an absolute discontinuance of the several actions.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b129-9\">The suits were simply suspended during the time required to execute the arbitration, and when the award was made then the actions were to be dismissed.

Day, which set\" out an agreement between the parties to arbitrate all matters and differences between them, applied for the stay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">The plaintiff read his affidavit in opposition to the motion, in which he set out several new matters, and upon which he asserts the motion should have been denied. The defendant had no opportunity to answer the new matter so set out in plaintiff\u2019s affidavit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-7\"><em>A. B.

If these three allegations be true, the orderly course for the plaintiff to pursue would be to make a motion or bring a suit to set aside the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The defendant ought to be given an opportunity to meet such averments before the court passes upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The form of the revocation is not before us ; we express no opinion as to its validity <em>(Jacoby </em>agt. Johnston, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">It is also said that the defendants have waived the submission by admitting service of notice of hearing of these cases before the referee, and by moving the cases in the circuit court of Christian county, Missouri, and taking judgments therein since the submission. These questions can be considered when proceedings are taken to vacate or set aside the submission. We should affirm the order staying proceedings without prejudice, however, to the right of the plaintiff to take such steps as he shall be advised to vacate the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The order should be affirmed, with ten dollars costs in one case only, and disbursements in all the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Talcott, P. J., and Smith, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
