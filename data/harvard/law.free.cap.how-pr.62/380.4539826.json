Sheridan on the 16th and 22d days of June, 1881, respectively; the first denied defendant\u2019s motion to open his default, with ten dollars costs; the second denied defendant\u2019s motion to vacate and set aside the first mentioned order, with ten dollars additional costs, and vacating and setting aside the stay of proceedings granted in the action. A summons and complaint were served on the defendant personally, in the city of New York, on the 26th day of April, 1881, the defendant at that time being a resident of the city of Watertown, Jefferson county, and casually in the city of New York, who, on his return home, handed the papers to Dennis O\u2019Brien, Esq., his attorney, with instructions to appear and defend the action. By a misapprehension, the attorney supposing the action to be in the supreme court, omitted to appear or answTer in time, and judgment was docketed against the defendant by default May 3, 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-14\">A motion was then made for leave to appear in and defend said action, and the same was denied by Mr. justice Nehbbas, \u201c with ten dollars costs to plaintiffs, unless said defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>within ten days from the date of the order, pay to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney ten dollars costs of that motion, and filed with the clerk of said court an undertaking in the penalty of two hundred and fifty dollars, with two sufficient sureties, conditioned for the payment of any judgment that might be recovered by said plaintiffs in this action; \u201d and the sureties upon said undertaking were thereby required to justify within two days after service thereof. A copy of said undertaking, with notice of filing, was served upon the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney June 11, 1881, the same being within said ten days; also a notice that the sureties in said undertaking would appear before the county judge of Jefferson county, at his chambers in the city of Watertown, on Monday, the 13th of June, 1881, at 4 p. m. of- that day, to justify under and in pursuance of the terms of the order. The ten dollars costs required to be paid by said order were duly paid to plaintiffs\u2019 attorney; but though said attorney accepted the costs he insisted the sureties must justify before a judge of the marine court of the city of Mew York; and to compel such justification in said city of Mew York he obtained an order from said justice Sheeidab restraining the defendant from justifying under the notice served in accordance with the terms of said order, and to show cause why plaintiffs should not enter an order denying defendant\u2019s motion to open his default. Mo one appearing to oppose this motion on behalf of defendant, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney took an order denying defendant\u2019s motion to open his default with ten dollars further costs against him. After the entry of this order, and on June <em>11, </em>1881, defendant procured an order to show cause why the order of J une sixteenth should not be vacated as <em>irregularly </em>entered, which was denied by justice Sheridae, with ten dollars further costs, and the stay of plaintiffs\u2019 proceedings vacated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-5\"><em>Anson B.

The order rejects the undertaking because not justified before a justice of the court in New York.
