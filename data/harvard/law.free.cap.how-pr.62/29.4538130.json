The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure <em>(secs. </em>1000 <em>and </em>1005) have effected a much needed and most salutary change in the old practice, vesting in the trial justice an extended discretion in the sending of exceptions to general term, <em>&amp;e., </em>not requiring that the judgment should be there given, but authorizing the entry of judgment upon the verdict, unless the trial judge directs that judgment upon the verdict be suspended until the decision oE the general term granting or refusing a new trial (the order herein does not contain any such provision), when, in case such motion be denied, judgment may be entered then upon the verdict, if it had been suspended. And section 1000 <em>(id.) </em>also required the entry of a formal order embodying the direction of the court <em>(Seo. </em>1000, <em>id). </em>Any claim that sending exceptions to general term in first instance, for motion for a new trial thereon, effects a stay of proceedings <em>ipso facto, </em>is effectually disposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>of by the further recent provisions of the new Code <em>(Sec. </em>1005, <em>Code of Gi/cil Procedure). \u201c </em>The entry of final judgment, and the subsequent proceedings to collect or enforce it, are not stayed by an exception or * * * motion for a new trial, unless an order for such a stay is procured and served \u201d (no exception is made on behalf of motion for new trial on exceptions at general term). \u201cAnd the entry, collection, &amp;c., of a judgment does not prejudice a motion for a new trial. When a new trial is granted, the court may direct and enforce restitution as when a judgment is reversed upon appeal.\u201d All of which goes to show that there cannot be a stay or suspension of judgment unless so ordered. Independent of the sending exceptions to general term for motion for new trial thereon, this section in effect says that that does not of itself suspend judgment, &amp;c. It is not stayed thereby, \u201cunless an oi\u2019der for such a stay is procured and served \u201d <em>(Sec. </em>1005, <em>id). </em>It also so indicates by providing for restitution, after collection of judgment, in case a new trial should be granted. It seems as if it were intended to temper justice and favor to the defeated party, with mercy, justice and security to the victor, by sending exceptions to be disposed of quickly, and to secure the fruits of his' victory to the successful party in case his judgment be sustained. Unlike the old Code, in its phraseology, substance and purpose, it lets the exceptions go to general term, and yet does not work a stay unless so especially ordered. It vests power in the court to do perfect justice in disposing of the motion for a new trial, and yet allowing the entry of judgment upon conditions, or compelling defeated party to give security to avoid entry thereof, in other words, it authorizes an exercise of discretion, upon such facts as the particular case may disclose, in preservation of the rights of all parties. The hardship of the former practice to the successful party, and the effect it had often in defeating him upon his execution, called for the unfavorable comment of the courts upon so hard and unbending a rule, and resulted, as we submit, in the new statutory provisions under discussion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>It seems to us that it -is \u201c the other things \u201d besides the entry of formal order referred to by Talcott, J., in <em>Cole </em>agt. <em>Webster </em>(17 <em>Him, </em>507). It cannot be anything else. If the new Code was not intended to change the old harsh practice, why the change in the phraseology and restraint of its provisions ? That this is a very important point of practice arising under the new Code not yet adjudicated upon, and that the views here presented are concurred in by some of the ablest lawyers at this bar, must be my apology for presenting and further urging these considerations upon the court. Of course, the direction of the court and not its intention must govern. It is easy to see how a party entitled to a stay could secure the order of the court therefor. In any event, it is hard for us to see why, in case of a result unfavorable to plaintiff upon this motion, she should be charged with costs for following the stenographer\u2019s minutes, those of the clerk, the directions of the court (as she understood them), and the order as entered.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b39-5\">Barker, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A1G\">\u2014 The defendant\u2019s motion is granted, without costs, and the order entered by the clerk is to be amended so that it will in terms provide for a stay until decision of exceptions at general term.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">There can be no fair doubt but that the defendant\u2019s attorneys understood that the effect of the order was to stay all proceedings upon the verdict until the exceptions were heard and decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">It was intended by the court that judgment be suspended, and I am unwilling that such intention be frustrated by an erroneous entry of the order by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Mr. Hubbell should not have entered a formal order in the form which he did, reciting that it was done on the motion of the defendant\u2019s attorneys. That action was an interference, and the terms of the order is not in strict conformity to entry in clerk\u2019s minuies. But Mr. Moot seemed to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>acquiesced in the act done, by Hr. Hubbell, in his name, which mitigates this feature of irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">I am inclined to the opinion that an order sending the exceptions to the general term, there to be heard in the first instance, does not suspend the entry of judgment unless the order as entered also provides for the suspension of judgment upon the verdict. Section 1000 <em>[Code of Gvoil Procedure) </em>is in the article entitled <em>\u201c </em>Exceptions, Case and Motion for a <em>New </em>Trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The motion to be made in the general term is- for a new trial on the exceptions, and all that court has power to do is to grant or refuse the motion;</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">If the opposing aifidavits had contained facts showing the judgment could not be collected, if the motion for a new trial is denied, I should have sought to make an order retaining the lien now secured by the entry of judgment, but it would be contrary to the express understanding on the trial to allow this verdict to be collected before the decision of the general term It was the very object and purpose of the order to. have the law of the case settled before further proceedings on the verdict were had.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
