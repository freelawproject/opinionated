No stay of execution is desired, and the respondent is at liberty to issue execution if so advised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Second. </em>There is no such permission or requirement of law as an undertaking to be filed, or that the appellant make a deposit in lieu thereof as desired by the respondent. By section 3047 the appellant at the time of serving the notice of appeal must pay to the justice, or if he be dead to the clerk, the costs of the action included in the judgment and the sum of two dollars as the fee of the justice for making the return. By section 3050 the justice must, after ten and within thirty days from the service of the notice of appeal and the payment of the costs and fees as prescribed in section 3047, make a return to the appellate court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b265-5\">J.

Daly, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AWY\">\u2014 The moving papers do not show that appellant has failed to pay to the justice or the clerk of this court the costs of the action as required by section 3047 of the Code. The affidavit merely states that \u201c no undertaking on said appeal has ever been approved, filed or served, and that said appellant has not given the security on appeal by deposit or otherwise as required by the rules and practice of this court.\u201d l\u00edo undertaking or deposit is required to perfect an appeal. The section cited provides for the manner of perfecting the appeal so far as service on the justice is concerned, and that only requires the payment of the costs of the action. The motion is evidently not based on a failure to comply with that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Motion denied with five dollars costs, to abide event of appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
