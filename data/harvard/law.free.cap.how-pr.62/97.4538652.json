The plaintiff omitted to notice it because of the serious illness of the plaintiff. About one week before the court convened the defendant\u2019s attorney stated to plaintiff\u2019s attorney that plaintiff\u2019s physician had informed him that \u201c she was ill, and that he would not be surprised if she did not live many months.\u201d Defendant\u2019s attorney further stated that he should try the case at the approaching term. By the ninth of May plaintiff had so far recovered as to attend the term. Defendant placed the cause on the day calendar for the tenth, and on the morning of the tenth plaintiff\u2019s attorney called upon defendant\u2019s attorney for the purpose of making some arrangement with him (the attorneys for plaintiff and defendant residing at Rome, and the court being in session at Utica), when defendant\u2019s attorney informed him that \u201che would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>be responsible for a default; that when the case was reached it would be moved.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s attorney, in company with plaintiff, who was very feeble, and her witnesses, then attended the term at Utica daily, until the twenty-fourth of June, when the case was reached and passed, defendant making no appearance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">After plaintiff\u2019s attorney had been in attendance upon the .term for four days, defendant\u2019s counsel asked plaintiff\u2019s attormey if he was ready for trial, and stated that he did not think \u25a0defendant\u2019s attorney intended to try the case; that he told him if-plaintiff\u2019s attorney was not ready; to move it, otherwise not. Defendant\u2019s attorney also stated to another attorney that his readiness to try the case would depend upon the readiness \u25a0of plaintiff\u2019s attorney; that plaintiff had not noticed it, and \u25a0could not move it, and he should default him if he was not \u25a0ready. The attorney for the defendant did not deny any of the above statements, but claimed that he intended to try the case, but was prevented by other engagements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">Plaintiff received no notice that defendant did not intend to try the case except as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-7\"><em>Oswald Prentiss Backus, </em>for motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-u\">Defendant should have countermanded his notice of trial if he did not intend to try the case; not having done so he is chargeable with the costs of the teim (3 <em>Wait\u2019s Supreme (Jou/rt Pr., </em>37). Under the practice as it existed prior to the Code, the plaintiff only could give notice of trial in personal actions. If he did so, and brought defendant and his witnesses into court, and then failed to try the case, he was obliged to pay the costs of the term (1 <em>Dwnlap\u2019s Pr., </em>553, 585). In actions of replevin, writs of prohibition and writs of error, where error in fact was assigned as the 'ground of error, and where a feigned issue was awarded from -chancery, either party might notice for trial as under the \u00a1Code, and if the defendant gave notice of trial, and after such notice failed to proceed or countermand his notice\" in due time, he was liable to pay the plaintiff the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>costs of the term (1 <em>Dunlaps Pr., </em>553 ; <em>Townsend </em>agt. <em>Cowen, </em>19 <em>Wend., </em>639 ; 1 <em>Sellon\u2019s Pr., </em>413 ; 2 <em>Str., </em>797 ; 2 <em>Sound., </em>336 ; 2 <em>Archbold\u2018s Pr., </em>242 ; <em>Potter </em>agt. <em>Lewis, </em>18 <em>Wend., </em>159, <em>note ; </em>9 <em>Wend., </em>497 <em>; Dauchy </em>agt. <em>Allen, </em>3 <em>How.

Stevens,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abs\">opposed, argued that it was not the practice under the Code to grant motions of this character, and no decisions since the Code could be found authorizing it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b105-6\">Churchill, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AY\">\u2014 I think I shall he obliged to deny this motion. It is entirely new in the practice, which has covered the whole period of the Code, for the plaintiff to make a motion of this kind. Litigation is war. Parties occupy, as the courts recognize, hostile positions; each man is expected to put himself into position to protect his rights. The court will see that the parties do not exercise any fraud, either upon the other, but will not compel a party who has himself noticed a case for trial, but for some reason does not move it, to pay costs to another party who has not put himself in the same position. By noticing a case he keeps for himself control of it at the circuit. The fact that neither party has been able to find any cases in the numerous volumes of reports of practice which have appeared since the adoption of the Code, would seem to he sufficient reason to presume that it was not the practice in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">If the plaintiff does not move after he has brought the defendant into court, he may be punished by a motion under the Code to dismiss the case for want of prosecution. But no similar remedy is given by the rules of- practice, or by the Code, or by the acknowledged practice of the court, to the plaintiff, where the defendant having noticed the case for trial does not move it when the case is reached upon the calendar. It might be very proper \u2014 I think it would he \u2014 that the rules of the court regulating the day calendar should compel the party who puts a cause upon the day calendar to move it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>when reached, whether noticed by the other side or not. But in the absence of any rule to that effect, I know of no power to grant the motion. It is a novel question and I will deny it, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
