Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>681 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011) (quotations omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cWe may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">The ALJ is to consider a number of factors in determining how much weight to give to each medical opinion: (1) whether the doctor has examined the claimant; (2) the length, nature, and extent of a treating doctor\u2019s relationship with the claimant; (3) the medical evidence and explanation supporting the doctor\u2019s opinion; (4) how consistent the doctor\u2019s \u201copinion is with the record as a whole\u201d; and (5) the doctor\u2019s specialization. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c), 416.927(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">The ALJ must give a treating physician\u2019s opinion \u201csubstantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). Good cause exists where .the: \u201c(1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">Here, there is substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that there was good cause to afford more weight to the opinion of Dr. Goren, a nonexamining board-certified neurologist, than to the opinions of Dr. Vernacchio and Dr. Kantor, who were Forsyth\u2019s treating physicians. As explained by the ALJ and the magistrate judge, Vernacchio did not conduct a proper neurological exam of Forsyth, and Kantor relied too significantly on For-syth\u2019s subjective reports. Additionally, Kantor\u2019s own observations of Forsyth were materially inconsistent. Goren had expertise in this field, had studied the entire record, and was subjected to questioning by the ALJ and Forsyth\u2019s attorney. Given all of these facts, the ALJ did not err by giving more credence to Goren\u2019s conclusions than to those of Vernacchio and Kantor. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">While Vernacchio and Kantor both offered conclusory opinions that Forsyth was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>disabled and unable to work, the resolution of that issue is reserved for the Commissioner. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d), 416.927(d). \u201cA statement by a medical source that [a claimant is] \u2018disabled\u2019 or \u2018unable to work\u2019 does not mean that [the Commissioner] will determine that [the claimant is] disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(1), 416.927(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Forsyth also claims that the ALJ erred by rejecting Dr. Chodosh\u2019s opinion that Forsyth would be unable to work up to 30 percent of the time when her MS was relapsing. Chodosh did not explain how he came to this conclusion, and his own examination of Forsyth revealed that she had normal motor function, strength, balance, and gait and that she was able to squat and rise. The ALJ did not err by concluding that Chodosh\u2019s opinion was not supported by his treatment records. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c), 416.927(c); <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-11\">.
