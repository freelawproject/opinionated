United Parcel Service, </em>695 F.3d 354 (5th Cir. 2012). We withdraw our prior ruling with respect to Defendants-Appellees Ceres Gulf and West Gulf Maritime Association, and we now REVERSE that part of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">In <em>Ibarra, </em>this Court held that in order for a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) to \u201cclearly and unmistakably\u201d waive a union member\u2019s right to a judicial forum for statutory discrimination claims, that CBA must \u201cspecifically identify\u201d the relevant statute or otherwise \u201cstate that statutory discrimination claims shall be subject to the [CBA\u2019s] grievance procedure.\u201d 695 F.3d at 358. The CBA at issue here does not specifically identify the relevant statute, Title VII, nor does the CBA state that statutory discrimination claims shall be subject to its grievance and arbitration procedure. Therefore, in light of <em>Ibarra, </em>the CBA on its own cannot bar Anglin\u2019s standing to file suit under Title VII against Ceres and WGMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">There remains a factual question as to whether a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) entered into between the Union and WGMA is binding on Anglin. The MOU specifically identifies Title VII, indicating <em>inter alia </em>that complaints brought under that statute are subject to the CBA\u2019s grievance and arbitration provisions. Thus, if the MOU is binding on Anglin, the MOU and CBA together would appear to satisfy this Court\u2019s requirements in <em>Ibarra. </em>However, Anglin has testified that the MOU was rejected by local union members and that its provisions were voluntary. Her testimony appears to be un-controverted. Further, the copy of the MOU provided in the trial record was never executed. In its Opinion on Motions for Summary Judgment, the district court discussed this question only in passing.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">REVERSED IN PART and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
