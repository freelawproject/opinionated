She argues that the district court erred by enhancing her sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) based on a finding that she intentionally or recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to the aliens by transporting them in the trunk of her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-21\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo and reviews the district court\u2019s fact findings relative to the \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6) enhancement for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>630 F.3d 377, 380 (5th Cir.2011). The transportation of aliens in the trunk of a vehicle is specifically listed in the comments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6) as the type of conduct contemplated by the Sentencing Commission in drafting the guideline provision. \u00a7 2L1.1, comment, (n.5). The district court thus did not err by enhancing Loerwald\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
