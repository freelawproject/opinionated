He contends that the district court erred when it enhanced his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(1) for making a ransom demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Section 2A4.1(b)(l) provides for a six-level increase if a ransom demand was made. Although \u00a7 2A4.1 does not define what constitutes a ransom demand, the term \u201cransom\u201d is defined as \u201ca consideration paid or demanded for the release of someone or something from captivity.\u201d Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, http://www.merriam-webster.com.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The record reflects that on or about February 2, 2011, Andrews and his co-defendants, Athena Marie Byrd and Patrick Hollowell, devised a scam to obtain money from Oliver Eugene Anderson, an older friend of Byrd. As part of this scam, Byrd proceeded to Anderson\u2019s residence. She then telephoned Andrews and Hollo-well and asked them to come to the residence. When they arrived, Andrews and Hollowell held Anderson and Byrd at gunpoint, demanding money from Byrd. When Anderson asked what it would take for them to leave, Byrd told Anderson that she owed Andrews and Hollowell $2,000. Byrd and Andrews put Anderson in Byrd\u2019s car and drove him at gunpoint to a casino for the purpose of cashing a $2,000 check. Anderson made a scene at the teller\u2019s window, causing Byrd and Andrews to flee the casino.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">To the extent Andrews argues that the \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(l) enhancement does not apply when the amount of money demanded was owed to the kidnapper, we need not resolve the issue because there is no factual support for such an argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">There is no evidence that Anderson owed Andrews, Hollowell, or Byrd any money. Further, although Byrd told Anderson that she owed Andrews and Hollowell $2,000, the record reflects that this was part of the defendants\u2019 scam to obtain money from Anderson, and there is no evidence that Andrews believed he was actually owed the $2,000. Because Andrews demanded $2,000 from Anderson in exchange for Anderson\u2019s and Byrd\u2019s release, the district court\u2019s determination that Andrews made a ransom demand is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err when it enhanced Andrews\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(l). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
