Render argues that the state trial court violated his constitutional rights by not sufficiently inquiring into a juror who stated she felt ill before taking the verdict in his original trial. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-24\">In 1990, Michael Render was charged with one count of attempted first-degree murder, one count of robbery, two counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>of armed burglary, and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm while engaged in a criminal offense. In 1992, Render' was convicted on the first four counts. As a habitual offender, the state court sentenced him to a term of natural life imprisonment on each of the four counts, set to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">During the trial that led to his conviction, a juror felt ill and asked to be excused. The state court and attorneys discussed available options and instructed the bailiff to inquire about the nature of the juror\u2019s illness. When the bailiff returned from attempting to retrieve the jury, he noted that the jury foreman had asked for a little more time. Shortly thereafter, the jury returned, indicating it had reached a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Render argued that the court should not proceed given the ill juror\u2019s request. The state court, however, decided to accept the verdict and poll the jury afterwards. After announcing the guilty verdict, the jury was polled and confirmed that the verdict was supported by each member, including the ill juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus before this Court, Render argues that the state court committed constitutional error in failing to hold a hearing to determine whether the ill juror should have been retained. According to Render, federal law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires courts to inquire into a juror\u2019s illness. Additionally, Render argues that prejudice should be assumed because the verdict was rendered soon after the ill juror asked to be excused. In Render\u2019s view, the close proximity in time between the verdict and the ill juror\u2019s request demonstrates the juror was forced to surrender her honest belief in Render\u2019s innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">We disagree. Habeas corpus relief \u201cis a guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice system, not a substitute for ordinary error correction through appeal.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) of AEDPA, the petitioner must prove that a state court adjudicated the merits of his claim in a manner that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see also Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 24, 123 S.Ct. 357, 360, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam) (establishing that petitioner carries the burden of proof for habeas claims brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>First, \u00a7 2254(d)(l)\u2019s phrase \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d refers to Supreme Court holdings that were in effect at the time of the relevant state court decision. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law, only when it either (1) applies a rule \u201cthat contradicts the governing law set forth by Supreme Court case law,\u201d or (2) reaches a different result from the Supreme Court \u201cwhen faced with materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Ward v. Hall, </em>592 F.3d 1144, 1155 (11th Cir.) (internal quotation marks omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, Hall v. Ward, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 647, 178 L.Ed.2d 513 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Second, under \u00a7 2254(d)(1), an \u201cunreasonable application of ... Federal law\u201d occurs (1) when the state court\u2019s decision does not square with Supreme Court rulings on \u201cmaterially indistinguishable facts,\u201d <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 413, or (2) or when the state court \u201cunreasonably extends or fails to extend a clearly established legal principle to a new context,\u201d <em>Ward, </em>592 F.3d at 1155 (internal quotation marks omitted). An application of federal law is not unreasonable simply because an appellate court thinks it incorrect or erroneous. <em>Id. </em>Rather, an unreasonable application must be \u201cobjectively unreasonable,\u201d <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 409, such that there is \u201cno possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court\u2019s decision conflicts with [the Supreme] Court\u2019s precedents,\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Here, Render has not met the requirements for habeas relief articulated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). First, the state court did not violate \u201cclearly established Federal law.\u201d When the jury convicted Render in 1992, Supreme Court precedent did not clearly require an inquiry into the juror\u2019s illness beyond that which the state court performed. Hence, the state court did not violate \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d on that issue. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>462 F.3d 1319, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Render, however, argues that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green v. Zant </em>established clear federal law requiring the state court to determine in greater depth whether the ill juror could continue. In <em>Green, </em>a state trial court discharged and replaced a juror without inquiry three hours into jury deliberations when she fell to the floor and repeatedly cried, \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d <em>Green v. Zant, </em>715 F.2d 551, 554-56 (11th Cir.1983). We vacated the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief and remanded for the purpose of conducting an evidentiary hearing on whether the juror had been capable of continuing prior to her dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 555-59. But in concluding that a hearing on remand was appropriate, <em>Green </em>did not articulate a principle of federal law requiring state courts to conduct searching inquiry into the capabilities of jurors who wish to be excused. Rather, <em>Green </em>held that substitution of a juror during deliberations, if done for improper reasons, may constitute a due process violation. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Render\u2019s reliance on <em>Green </em>is misplaced. Because no potentially improper juror substitution occurred in Render\u2019s case, the state court did not violate \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">Second, the state court did not \u201cunreasonably apply\u201d federal law as it stood in 1992. The state court instructed the bailiff to ask members of the jury whether they were capable of proceeding. They were. The state court also polled the jury after the verdict was announced to ensure each member stood by the verdict. They did. Federal law, as it existed in 1992, did not demand a specific or more elaborate type of inquiry in order to retain a juror under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>these circumstances. <em>Cf. Green, </em>715 F.2d at 556 (\u201cWhere the disability of the juror is less certain or obvious ... <em>some </em>hearing or inquiry into the situation is appropriate to the proper exercise of judicial discretion.\u201d (emphasis added)). The record shows that the state court conscientiously inquired into the capacities and convictions of all members of the jury, and thus did not unreasonably apply federal law in Render\u2019s 1992 trial. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The district court\u2019s decision denying Render\u2019s petition for habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-15\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination of whether the state court decision contravened clearly established federal law or unreasonably applied federal law under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Smith v. Sec'y, Dep\u2019t of Con., </em>572 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-27\">. Render's motion to submit his reply brief out of time is granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\">. Specifically, Render relies on the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution for his federal law habeas claims. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. VI (\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a ... trial, by an impartial jury....\u201d); U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1 (\"No state shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\">. Appellant also alleged a violation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2) at the conclusion of his opening brief. There, he asserted that the state court's decision was \"based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the State court.\u201d Appellant, however, has not supported his \u00a7 2254(d)(2) contention with any legal or factual argument, and thus we do not consider it. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>United States v. Jemigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (\"[A] party seeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal must plainly and prominently so indicate. Otherwise, the issue ... will be considered abandoned.\u201d); <em>Creenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (concluding that because a party \"elaborated] no arguments on the merits as to this issue in its initial or reply brief,\" the \"issue is deemed waived\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
