Rodriguez and Francisco Javier Toledo Hernandez appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, in favor of their former employer Pure Beauty Farms, Inc. and its owner Enrique A. Yanes, disposing of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for unpaid overtime wages under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). The district court ruled that Plaintiffs Rodriguez and Hernandez, as agricultural workers, were exempt from the FLSA\u2019s overtime provisions. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-19\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b795-20\">Pure Beauty Farms (\u201cthe Farms\u201d), a commercial nursery-farming operation, cultivates and grows plants on land owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>by the Farms in Florida. The Farms transports its plants to Home Depot sites where employees of the Farms continue to care for the plants. The Farms\u2019 plants are kept in staging areas within the stores\u2019 lawn and garden departments. The plants remain the property of the Farms until they are scanned at Home Depot\u2019s register as part of a customer\u2019s purchase. Home Depot then pays the Farms an agreed upon price for the plant. Unsold plants are returned to the Farms. And, the Farms bears the loss if one of its plants dies on the shelf before sale or is returned by the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Plaintiffs Rodriguez and Hernandez worked for the Farms as \u201cmerchandisers\u201d or \u201cmerchants.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 job was to make sure that the Farms\u2019 plants, while located in Home Depot stores, remained healthy, attractive, and in a sellable condition until they were purchased. To keep the plants well-maintained at the Home Depot sites, Plaintiffs\u2019 duties included inspecting the plants for insects, ensuring they were watered and, if necessary, watering them, arranging them in the store so that they would get the right amount of sunlight or shade, and removing dead flowers, leaves, thorns, branches or rotted buds. Plaintiffs also kept the plant staging areas clean, sent unsaleable plants back to the Farms and requested more plants. Plaintiffs took care of and handled only plants belonging to the Farms.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Both Plaintiffs Rodriguez and Hernandez averaged over forty hours of work per week. For those hours in excess of forty, the Farms paid Rodriguez and Hernandez straight time, rather than overtime, wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">An employee is exempt from the FLSA\u2019s overtime provisions if he is \u201cemployed in agriculture.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The FLSA defines \u201cagriculture\u201d two ways: (1) \u201cprimary agriculture\u201d and (2) \u201csecondary agriculture.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.105; <em>see also Sariol v. Fla. Crystals Corp., </em>490 F.3d 1277, 1279 (11th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the FLSA, \u201cprimary agriculture\u201d includes specific farming activities, such as cultivation or tillage of the soil. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">The FLSA provides a much broader definition of \u201csecondary agriculture.\u201d <em>Sariol, </em>490 F.3d at 1279. Under the FLSA, \u201csecondary agriculture\u201d consists of \u201cany practices ... performed by a farmer or on a farm as incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for market, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(f); <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.105 (explaining that \u201csecondary\u201d agriculture has a \u201csomewhat broader\u201d meaning than \u201cprimary\u201d agriculture).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">We agree with the district court that the work Plaintiffs Rodriguez and Hernandez performed for the Farms falls within the meaning of \u201csecondary agriculture.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The definition of secondary agriculture has three requirements: (1) the \u201cpractice must be performed either by a farmer or on a farm\u201d; (2) it must \u201cbe performed either in connection with the farmer\u2019s own farming operations or in connection with farming operations conducted on the farm where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>the practice is performed\u201d; and (3) it must be \u201cperformed \u2018as an incident to or in conjunction with\u2019 the farming operations.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.129; <em>see also Sariol, </em>490 F.3d at 1279-80.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">As to the first requirement, to be a \u201cfarmer\u201d within the meaning of the agricultural exemption, \u201cthe employer must be engaged in activities of a type and to the extent that the person ordinarily regarded as a \u2018farmer\u2019 is engaged.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.130. A farmer also generally \u201cperforms his farming operations on land owned, leased, or controlled by him and devoted to his own use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.131. However, the term \u201cfarmer\u201d is \u201can occupational title\u201d and broadly includes an employer who grows his own agricultural products but whose \u201conly purpose is to obtain [those] products useful to him in a non-farming enterprise which he conducts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The regulation even gives the example of <em>\u201can employer engaged in raising nursery stock.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The Farms, a commercial nursery that grows and cultivates plants, is a \u201cfarmer\u201d for purposes of the exemption. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.130 (explaining that it is the employer\u2019s status as a farmer that matters, and that the term may apply to corporations as well as individuals). Further, as employees of the Farms, Rodriguez and Hernandez were also \u201cfarmers.\u201d <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.132 (\u201c\u2018Farmer\u2019 includes the employees of a farmer.\u201d). Thus, the practices Rodriguez and Hernandez performed at the Home Depot sites were performed \u201cby a farmer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">In addition, those practices were performed \u201cin connection -with the farmer\u2019s own farming operations.\u201d <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.129, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 780.137 (explaining that \u201cthe requirement is not met\u201d when employees are engaged in practices performed in connection with the farming operations of <em>another </em>farmer). It is undisputed that Rodriguez and Hernandez maintained only plants owned and grown by the Farms; therefore, their work was in connection with the Farms\u2019 own farming operations. Thus, the first two requirements of the secondary definition of agriculture are easily met.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">The parties\u2019 dispute focuses primarily on the third requirement \u2014 whether the practices Rodriguez and Hernandez performed for the Farms, but on Home Depot store-sites, were \u201cincident to or in conjunction with\u201d the Farms\u2019 farming operations. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.129. \u201cGenerally, a practice performed in connection with farming operations is within the statutory language only if it constitutes an established part of agriculture, is subordinate to the farming operations involved, and does not amount to an independent business.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.144. When, as here, the practice is performed on \u201cagricultural or horticultural commodities,\u201d to determine whether \u201cthe practice is conducted as a separate business activity rather than as a part of agriculture,\u201d consideration is given to, among other things: (1) whether \u201cthe type of product resulting from the practice\u201d remains in its raw or natural state or changes; (2) \u201cthe value added to the product as a result of the practice and whether a sales organization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>is maintained for the disposal of the product\u201d; and (3) whether the product is \u201csold under the producer\u2019s own label rather than under that of the purchaser.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.147. A farmer or his employees selling the farmer\u2019s own agricultural commodities is also a practice \u201cincident to or in conjunction with the farming operations\u201d as long as \u201cit does not amount to a separate business.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.158(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">In addition, the Department of Labor has specific regulations addressing employees of nurseries. If nursery employees are engaged in \u201c [planting, cultivating, watering, spraying, fertilizing, pruning, bracing, and feeding the growing crop,\u201d they are employed in agriculture. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.205. \u201cEmployees of a grower of nursery stock who work in packing and storage sheds sorting the stock, grading and trimming it, racking it in bins, and packing it for shipment are employed in \u2018agriculture\u2019 provided they handle <em>only products grown by their employer </em>and their activities constitute an established part of their employer\u2019s agricultural activities and are subordinate to his farming operations.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.209 (emphasis added). However, if the \u201cgrower of nursery stock operates, as a separate enterprise, a processing establishment or an establishment for the wholesale of retail distribution of such commodities, the employees in such separate enterprise are not engaged in agriculture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cAlthough the handling and the sale of nursery commodities by the grower at or near the place where they were grown may be incidental to his farming operations, the character of these operations changes when they are performed in an establishment set up as a marketing point to aid the distribution of those products.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Section 780.209 cites as contrasting examples <em>Walling v. Rocklin, </em>132 F.2d 3 (8th Cir.1942), and <em>Mitchell v. Huntsville Wholesale Nurseries, </em>267 F.2d 286 (5th Cir.1959).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Walling, </em>the employees worked at a flower shop owned by a nearby greenhouse, and ninety percent of the flowers they sold to both the wholesale and retail trade were cultivated at the greenhouse. The Eighth Circuit concluded that the flower shop was not a separate enterprise, but instead was maintained \u201cin connection with and incidental to\u201d the greenhouse and that its employees were exempt under the secondary definition of agriculture. <em>Walling, </em>132 F.2d at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">In contrast, in <em>Mitchell, </em>the employees worked at a packing and storage warehouse of a large plant wholesaler. The employees handled primarily nursery stock from <em>other, </em>out-of-state growers, not from the wholesaler\u2019s <em>own </em>nearby farm, which had its own warehouse for its nursery stock. The Fifth Circuit concluded that the work performed at the warehouse was \u201cincidental to, or in conjunction with,\u201d the farming operations of <em>the other growers, </em>and thus that the warehouse employees were not exempt. <em>Mitchell, </em>267 F.2d at 290-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Here, the Farms handles and sells only its own plants, and Rodriguez and Hernandez watered, pruned, and cared for only the Farms\u2019 plants situated at the Home Depot stores. Unlike the employees in <em>Mitchell, </em>Rodriguez and Hernandez did not work in a wholesale distribution center <em>for other growers\u2019 </em>horticultural products. <em>Cf. Mitchell, </em>267 F.2d at 290-91; <em>see also Adkins v. Mid-American Growers, Inc., </em>167 F.3d 355, 357 (7th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>1999) (explaining that when an employer \u201cbuys plants and then resells them without doing significant agricultural work it is operating as a wholesaler rather than as a grower, and wholesalers of agricultural commodities are not exempt from the Act\u201d); <em>Wirtz v. Jackson &amp; Perkins Co., </em>312 F.2d 48, 51 (2d Cir.1963) (stating that \u201c[w]ere any significant portion of the stock handled in defendant\u2019s storages purchased from ... independent sources\u201d the agricultural exemption would not apply because it \u201cis inapplicable to services performed by employees of mere distributors of agricultural products\u201d). Rodriguez and Hernandez are more akin to the flower shop employees in <em>Walling, </em>who handled and sold only their employer\u2019s own nursery stock. <em>See Walling, </em>132 F.2d at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In any event, the kind of work Rodriguez and Hernandez performed on the Farms\u2019 plants is explicitly identified in the regulations as \u201cagricultural,\u201d such as watering them, pruning away dead limbs, leaves and buds and preparing them for market by handling, inspecting and sorting them. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.205. Nothing Rodriguez and Hernandez did to the plants changed them from their natural state, such that they could be said to be engaged in the separate enterprise of processing or manufacturing. <em>Cf. Mitchell v. Budd, </em>350 U.S. 473, 480-82, 76 S.Ct. 527, 532, 100 L.Ed. 565 (1956) (concluding that workers at tobacco-bulking plant, where a lengthy fermentation process substantially changed the tobacco\u2019s physical properties and chemical content, were not exempt as agricultural workers). Indeed, by ensuring that the Farms\u2019 plants continued to receive adequate water and light and were pruned and insect-free while in the staging areas, Rodriguez and Hernandez\u2019s work was directly connected with and subordinate to the Farms\u2019 own nursery-farming operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">We are not persuaded by the Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the FLSA\u2019s agricultural exemption does not apply to them merely because the Farms uses independent contractors to transport its plants to the Home Depot stores. The only authority Rodriguez and Hernandez cite for this proposition is 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.154. However, that regulation applies only when the farmer uses an independent contractor to transport his agricultural products to a wholesaler or processor and relinquishes ownership or control of the agricultural products at the receiving platform of a wholesaler or processor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">In contrast, here the Farms retains ownership of the plants not only while they are transported from the farm but also while the plants are displayed for sale in the Home Depot stores. The Farms\u2019 employees receive the plants when they are delivered by the independent transport contractors and then continue to care for the plants until they are sold. Under the particular facts of this case, the mere fact that the Farms used independent contractors to transport its plants did not end its status as a farmer and render non-exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Rodriguez and Hernandez\u2019s work caring for the plants before a purchaser buys them at the Home Depot stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\">We also reject the Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they were engaged in a separate business enterprise of selling plants because their job was to make the plants aesthetically pleasing. First, there is no evidence that Rodriguez and Hernandez sold the plants. Rather, they watered, pruned, and cared for the plants until they were sold. Second, even if Rodriguez and Hernandez\u2019s duties could be characterized as \u201cselling\u201d the plants, so long as they sold only the Farms\u2019 plants, their work would be exempt. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.158(a) (including as an agricultural practice a farmer\u2019s employees selling the farmer\u2019s own agricultural commodities); <em>see also Walling, </em>132 F.2d at 6. The Farms did not operate a plant marketing business separate and distinct from its nursery-farming operations, and any \u201cselling\u201d Rodriguez and Hernandez were doing was incident to or in conjunction with the Farms\u2019 nursery-farming operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">For all these reasons, we agree with the district court that Plaintiffs Hernandez and Rodriguez\u2019s job duties for the Farms fell within the FLSA\u2019s definition of secondary agriculture and that they therefore were exempt from the FLSA\u2019s overtime provisions. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment to Defendants the Farms, Inc. and Yanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standards as the district court and viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Sariol v.
