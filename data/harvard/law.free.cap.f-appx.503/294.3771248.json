He contends that the sentence, which was within the pertinent guideline range, is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than needed to achieve the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. Arriaga-Rangel argues that the guidelines give too much weight to his conviction of manslaughter and that the district court improperly assessed the effect that his cultural assimilation has on his likelihood to reoffend, particularly with respect to its decision to impose supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-24\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), and we consider whether the sentence is an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiapo, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). Under that standard, Arriaga-Rangel has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guideline term. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Rather, he has shown no more than a disagreement with the propriety of the sentence, which does not suffice to establish error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>connection with it. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 890, 398 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Insofar as Arriaga-Rangel challenges the propriety of the district court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to impose supervised release, that challenge is likewise unavailing. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 329-30 (5th Cir. 2012). Our examination of \u201cthe district court\u2019s particularized remark at sentencing\u201d shows no error in connection with the disputed decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
