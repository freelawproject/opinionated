The district court sentenced him to 120 months in prison, after granting a Government motion based on substantial assistance pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Pando appeals, arguing that the district court erred by failing to grant him a minor role reduction, failing to depart more than three levels for substantial assistance, and improperly considering his prior convictions in determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Whether a defendant is a minor participant is a factual determination that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir. 2005). A minor role reduction applies only \u201cwhen a defendant is substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203-04 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">According to the record, Pando introduced a Confidential Source (CS) to a methamphetamine supplier, Adrian Garcia Baeza; Pando was present during at least two drug transactions involving the CS; and he provided the CS with scales to weigh drugs. Those facts would be enough to support the district court\u2019s determination. <em>See United States v. Tremelling, </em>43 F.3d 148, 153 (5th Cir.1995). In addition, Pando twice traveled to Virginia with Baeza to distribute drugs and collect money, and he drove vehicles containing drugs or money for Baeza. According to the factual r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Pando, Bae-za, and another conspirator used a leased house to store, package, and distribute drugs. Although Pando later denied this in unsworn objections, his signed factual r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is entitled to great evidentiary weight. <em>See United States v. Abreo, </em>30 F.3d 29, 32 (5th Cir.1994). Despite Pando\u2019s assertions that he was merely a flunky, the district court\u2019s determination that he was not a minor participant is plausible in light of the record as a whole and, therefore, is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-17\">Pando next argues that the district court should have granted a greater departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 in light of the danger he and family members face as a result of his cooperation. As Pando did not make these arguments in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>(2009); <em>United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 880 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Given the near complete discretion courts have in deciding the extent of a departure under \u00a7 5K1.1, a defendant cannot appeal that decision \u201cunless the departure was made in violation of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>51 F.3d 36, 39 (5th Cir.1995). Nevertheless, we have reviewed \u00a7 5K1.1 departures to ensure that the district court has based its decision on legally acceptable reasons and performed the appropriate independent inquiry into the particular case. <em>See United States v. Desselle, </em>450 F.3d 179, 182 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Pando offers only conclusional assertions that the extent of the departure is not sufficient to reflect the danger to him or his family based on his assistance. The Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion noted that Pando and his family could be in danger, and that retaliation is always possible in cases involving large sums of money and drugs. The Government nevertheless recommended a departure to a range of 97 to 121 months, which was entitled to substantial weight. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>33 F.3d 8, 10 (5th Cir.1994). We see no clear or obvious error in the court\u2019s consideration of the departure. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Finally, Pando argues that the court improperly relied on his DWI convictions to determine his sentence because they were already accounted for in his criminal history score. We again review for plain error. Courts may consider factors already accounted for by the Guidelines in determining a sentence outside the guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2008). Thus, Pando has shown no clear or obvious error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. To the extent that the district court erred by considering a factor unrelated to assistance, <em>see Desselle, </em>450 F.3d at 182, an issue that Pando does not raise, we discern no effect on his substantial rights given the court\u2019s reliance on the proper factors set out in the Government\u2019s motion. <em>See United States v. Duhon, </em>541 F.3d 391, 397 (5th Cir.2008). Further, as the Government points out, the three-level departure the Government recommended in this case should have resulted in a range of 121 to 151 months, not the lower range of 97 to 121 months calculated by the Government in its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
