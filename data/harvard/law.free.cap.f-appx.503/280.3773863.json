Douglas Murrell, on the ground that Plaintiff-Appellant Rodney R. Schoemann, Sr.\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim against Murrell was prescribed by Louisiana\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. Schoe-mann appeals, arguing that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he knew or should have known of Murrell\u2019s alleged misrepresentation more than one year before he filed suit against Murrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The alleged misrepresentation was made in connection with Murrell\u2019s sale of stock to Schoemann in 2004. Schoemann alleged that Murrell negligently misrepresented that Murrell\u2019s son ran the company, that Murrell was not affiliated with the company, and that the stock was, therefore, \u201cfreely tradable.\u201d Schoemann sought to recover from Murrell over $400,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees that he incurred during a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation and administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">In opposition to Murrell\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Schoemann contended that he first discovered the alleged misrepresentation on February 7, 2008, when he read the SEC\u2019s complaint against Murrell, and that his complaint, filed on January 29, 2009, was therefore timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">The district court held that the prescriptive period commenced in 2007, when Schoemann first sustained the damages that he claims (attorneys\u2019 fees). The district court concluded that Schoemann knew, or could with reasonable diligence have learned, about the alleged misrepresentation more than one year before he filed his complaint. As the district court noted, on August 16, 2007, in a document filed with the SEC, Schoemann argued that the stock he purchased from Murrell, and later sold, was freely tradable because Murrell was not affiliated with the company and Murrell\u2019s son independently ran the company. The district court concluded that it was thus evident that Schoemann knew, as of August 2007, that the SEC questioned Murrell\u2019s representations regarding his relationship to the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">Based on our review of the record and briefs, we hold that the district court did not err by concluding that Schoemann knew or should have known about his cause of action in 2007, and that his claims were prescribed by the time he filed suit against Murrell in 2009. Accordingly, the summary judgment in favor of Murrell is AFFIRMED, essentially for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
