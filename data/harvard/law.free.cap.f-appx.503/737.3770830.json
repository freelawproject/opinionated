Second, he argues that the district court erred by giving basic instructions on conspiracy and attempt in addition to instructions on the substantive elements of each charge. Third, he argues that the district court abused its discretion during jury selection by limiting voir dire questions. Lastly, Holland argues that his sentence was proeedurally and substantively unreasonable because the government engaged in sentencing-factor manipulation and because there was an unreasonable disparity between Holland\u2019s sentence and the sentences his co-defendants received. After a thorough review of the record and briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Holland, along with James George and Darius Gatlin, entered into an agreement with undercover special agent Patrick Collins of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to rob a shipment of cocaine from a stash house in Broward County, Florida. Holland believed that there were armed guards at the stash house and that each shipment to the house contained at least 15 kilograms of cocaine. On July 28, 2010, Holland told Collins that he would bring an AK47 firearm to the robbery, assuring Collins that he had experience with that type of robbery. On August 5, 2010, Holland, George and Gatlin met with Collins to tell Collins about their plan for the robbery. Gatlin stated, \u201c[W]e going to have to tie them boys up,\u201d and Holland agreed. Holland stated, \u201c[T]his ain\u2019t the first time anyway,\u201d and added that he had \u201cbeat a murder and a home invasion\u201d in 2008. When Collins asked him if he had ever \u201cdone a house,\u201d Holland said, \u201c[Ejverything, man, that\u2019s what we do.\u201d Holland also talked about obtaining \u201ca little deuce deuce,\u201d referring to a .22-caliber firearm. Holland, George, and Gatlin discussed obtaining various types of firearms, including a .85-caliber pistol and a pump action shotgun. Holland indicated that these weapons were necessary \u201cjust in case we got to squeeze.\u201d Holland also stated that he knew \u201cbig peoples in Miami and Palm Beach\u201d who could help move the cocaine they would get from the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">On August 17, 2010, Collins met with Holland, George, and Gatlin at a park in Tamarac, Florida, and the three men got into Collins\u2019s car and drove to the \u201cundercover warehouse.\u201d Collins asked them to put their guns in the trunk of the car, but George indicated that they had left a gun back at the park \u201cwhere no one can touch it.\u201d When they arrived at the warehouse, Collins gave Gatlin and Holland access to a rental car they were to use for the robbery. Collins remained at the warehouse with George, while Holland and Gatlin drove back to the park. When Holland and Gatlin returned to the warehouse, Collins gave a signal to the arrest team. Among the items recovered at the warehouse were a .40-caliber High Point pistol and eight rounds of .40-caliber ammuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>tion. After the gun was impounded, ATF performed a \u201cgun trace\u201d revealing that the gun originally was purchased by a man named David Deshomme, an acquaintance of Holland\u2019s. Deshomme testified that he owned a .40-caliber pistol, and that Holland had asked to purchase it from him, but he had refused. Deshomme discovered that the gun was missing when law enforcement officials inquired as to its whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Holland, George and Gatlin with Counts 1 through 6. In addition, Holland was individually charged with Count 7. George and Gatlin entered into plea agreements with the government, pleading guilty to counts charged in a superseding information that reduced the drug quantity. Holland proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Prior to trial, Holland\u2019s counsel submitted a list of proposed voir dire questions containing 14 numbered topics. Relevant to this appeal, Holland\u2019s submission included questions regarding his status as a convicted felon, the presumption of innocence, and the burden of proof. The court did not explicitly adopt any of Holland\u2019s proposed voir dire questions. Rather, at the beginning of jury selection, the court informed the jury of the charges against Holland, and asked whether any of the potential jurors had any reason to doubt their ability to be impartial. The court explained the presumption of innocence and the government\u2019s burden of proof, and asked the prospective jurors whether they accepted those principles. The court excused several jurors for cause, and allowed each side to exercise peremptory challenges. After the jury was sworn, the court gave preliminary instructions to the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">At trial the government and Holland entered into a stipulation regarding Holland\u2019s prior felony conviction. The stipulation was read to the jury, and stated that, prior to August 17, 2010, Holland had been convicted of a felony offense. At the conclusion of the testimony, Holland made a motion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The court denied Holland\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">Before closing arguments, the court discussed jury instructions with Holland\u2019s counsel and provided counsel with an opportunity to object. The jury instructions included specific instructions on conspiracy and attempt, which were to be given before the instructions on the elements of each substantive offense. Holland objected to providing the jury with separate instructions on conspiracy and attempt, arguing that the instructions were duplica-tive because the language in the substantive counts already included the elements of each crime, and that the jury was likely to be confused about what the government was required to prove. The district court disagreed, and stated that it would give the instruction over defense counsel\u2019s objection. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Holland moved for a new trial, asserting that the court\u2019s general conspiracy and attempt instructions violated his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, because they omitted essential elements of the substantive offenses. Additionally, Holland noted that, if the jury instructions were defective, the court would also be required to grant a new trial as to Count 6, because a conviction on that count required the jury to find that Holland committed at least one of the other crimes charged in the indictment. The district court denied Holland\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">The probation officer prepared a Pre-sentence Investigation Report (PSI), stating that Holland\u2019s combined adjusted of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>fense level was 34, the level applicable to drug offenses involving at least 15 but less than 50 kilograms of cocaine, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5). With no further adjustments, Holland\u2019s total offense level was 34, and his criminal history category was IV. His advisory Guideline range therefore, was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. The statutorily mandated minimum term of imprisonment for Count 6 was 60 months, consecutive to any other term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Holland filed a motion for a downward departure, arguing that because the government both \u201cinvented the amount of drugs which it knew would directly impact the Guideline calculations,\u201d and \u201ccreated the fiction of two armed guards\u201d in order to induce the use of a firearm, it had engaged in sentencing-factor manipulation. At sentencing, Holland reiterated the arguments in his motion, and further emphasized his lack of education, impoverished background, lack of parental guidance, and other hardships in support of a downward departure. He also noted that the court had varied downward in sentencing George and Gatlin. Noting that the minimum mandatory sentence for Holland\u2019s convictions was 15 years, with 10 years being the minimum mandatory sentence for the drug offense involving more than 15 kilograms and 5 years for the \u00a7 924(c) charge, Holland asked that the court impose a sentence of 15 years\u2019 incarceration, or 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The court stated in imposing Holland\u2019s sentence that it had considered \u201cthe statements of all the parties, the presentence report which contains the advisory Guidelines[,] and the statutory factors.\u201d The court further found that a \u201csentence at the low end of the advisory Guideline range is sufficiently punitive to deter the defendant from further criminal conduct,\u201d and stated that it would impose a sentence \u201cwithin and at the bottom of the advisory Guideline range.\u201d The court imposed a total sentence of 270 months\u2019 imprisonment, which included the 60 months\u2019 mandatory consecutive sentence for Count 6. Based on their guilty pleas to the two counts of the superseding indictment, George received a sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment and Gatlin received a sentence of 132 months\u2019 imprisonment. Holland now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">I. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">\n<em>a. Rule 29 Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Holland argues that there was insufficient evidence of an interstate nexus to support his conviction for violating the Hobbs Act, because the conspiracy\u2019s objective was to steal drugs before they left Florida and crossed state lines. Second, Holland argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the element of possessing a firearm, in Counts 5, 6, and 7, because \u201cthere were three codefendants who were ... equally likely to have handled the firearm.\u201d Lastly, Holland contends that because there was no evidence of intent to use a firearm, acquittal on Counts 5 and 6 was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal based on the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Tampas, </em>493 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where, as in this case, the jury convicted the defendant, we will affirm the conviction \u201cif a reasonable juror could have concluded that the evidence established [the defendant\u2019s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">\u201cThe Hobbs Act prohibits robbery or extortion, and attempts or conspiracies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>commit robbery or extortion, that in any way or degree obstruct, delay, or affect commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1084 (11th Cir.2001) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). To establish a Hobbs Act conspiracy, \u201cthe government must prove that: (1) two or more persons agreed to commit a robbery or extortion encompassed within the Hobbs Act; (2) the defendant knew of the conspiratorial goal; and (3) the defendant voluntarily participated in helping to accomplish the goal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1084. When a defendant is charged with conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act, \u201cthe interstate nexus may be demonstrated by evidence of potential impact on interstate commerce or by evidence of actual, de minimis impact.\u201d <em>United States v. Le, </em>256 F.3d 1229, 1232 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis omitted). \u201c[Pjossession and sale of illegal drugs impacts upon interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Bernard, </em>47 F.3d 1101, 1103 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam). Finally, a conspiracy to obstruct drug trafficking establishes a sufficient interstate nexus to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of the Hobbs Act, even where the intended victims and drugs are fictitious. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>480 F.3d 1025, 1027 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Next, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) makes it a crime for a convicted felon to possess any firearm that in any manner affects interstate commerce. The law recognizes several kinds of possession, including actual possession, constructive possession, and joint possession. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also United States v. Crawford, </em>906 F.2d 1531, 1536 (11th Cir.1990) (recognizing that \u201cthere may be joint possession of a firearm\u201d). \u201cConstructive possession exists when the defendant exercises ownership, dominion, or control over the item or has the power and intent to exercise dominion or control.\u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1271 (11th Cir.2006). Further, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) makes it illegal for a person to possess a firearm \u201cin furtherance\u201d of a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. The \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 prong of the statute requires the government to prove that the firearm \u201chelped, furthered, promoted, or advanced\u201d the drug trafficking or crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th Cir.2002) (addressing a firearm used in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime). Finally, factors that may be considered when determining if possession was \u201cin furtherance\u201d of the crime include the following: the type of activity that was being conducted, the accessibility of the firearm, the type of weapon, whether the weapon was stolen, whether the possession of the firearm was legal, whether the gun was loaded, the gun\u2019s proximity to drugs or drug profits, and the time and circumstances under which the gun was found. <em>United States v. Suarez, </em>313 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Here, sufficient evidence supports Holland\u2019s convictions for conspiracy and attempt to commit a Hobbs Act robbery. This case involved the planned robbery of a cocaine stash house, inherently satisfying the requirement of an interstate nexus. <em>See Bernard, </em>47 F.3d at 1103 (holding that the sale and possession of illegal drugs effects interstate commerce). In <em>Taylor, </em>when called upon to decide whether the jurisdictional requirement of the Hobbs Act was satisfied in a reverse-sting case based on a conspiracy to rob fictitious drug dealers, we began with the premise that \u201c[i]f the cocaine in this case actually existed, a sufficient interstate nexus would exist to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of the Hobbs Act.\u201d 480 F.3d at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>In this case, Holland, <em>George </em>and Gatlin were expressly told that Collins was a drug courier for a drug trafficking operation between Puerto Rico and Florida. Holland\u2019s contention that the cocaine would have \u201clost its interstate character\u201d once it arrived at its destination in Florida is based upon dicta in a case that involved a stolen shipment of electronics goods, and is inapposite in the context of narcotics trafficking. <em>United States v. Petit, </em>841 F.2d 1546,1551-52 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The theory of constructive possession supports Holland\u2019s firearms convictions. Holland told Collins that he would bring an AK47, talked about finding a .22-caliber firearm, and discussed obtaining other types of weapons \u201cjust in case we got to squeeze.\u201d Further, on the date of the attempted robbery, Holland confirmed a previous statement made by George that they had left the gun back at the park where they met Collins. Sufficient evidence supports this statement. The day of the robbery, an aerial surveillance officer observed Holland and Gatlin driving back to the park, while Collins waited in the warehouse with George. Upon returning to the warehouse, the passenger in the car went to the bushes where the .40-caliber pistol was later found. Finally, Deshomme testified that the .40-caliber pistol disappeared after he refused to sell the gun to Holland. Based on these facts, the jury reasonably inferred that Holland constructively possessed the .40-caliber pistol found in the bush near the warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Similarly, applying the <em>Suarez </em>factors, sufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that Holland possessed the firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. 313 F.3d at 1292. The evidence established that the gun was loaded, had been stolen from Deshomme who stated that Holland had asked to buy the gun, and was hidden at a park, and ultimately placed in a bush just outside the warehouse where the conspirators met before they attempted to rob the stash house. Additionally, the conspirators discussed their plan for overcoming the armed guards at the stash house, and referred to various types of firearms, with Holland specifically mentioning the possibility of having to \u201csqueeze\u201d the trigger. Thus, the jury reasonably inferred that Holland intended to use the firearm in furtherance of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">\n<em>b. Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Holland argues that the district court\u2019s instructions on conspiracy and attempt were deficient because they did not include the necessary elements for conviction on the substantive charges, and appeared to the jury as alternative instructions for finding Holland guilty. We review jury instructions <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they misstate the law or mislead the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party. <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>580 F.3d 1229, 1233 (11th Cir.2009). Generally, district courts \u201chave broad discretion in formulating jury instructions provided that the charge as a whole accurately reflects the law and the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>253 F.3d 607, 609 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). On appeal, we consider \u201cwhether the jury charges, considered as a whole, sufficiently instructed the jury so that the jurors understood the issues and were not misled.\u201d <em>United States v. Starke, </em>62 F.3d 1374, 1380 (11th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). The jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>983 F.2d 201, 202 (11th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Here, the district court first provided general instructions regarding burden of proof, presumed innocence, types of evidence, and a limiting instruction regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>evidence of other acts. Then the court read out the seven counts charged against Holland and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">I will explain the law governing these offenses in a moment, but please note that the defendant is not charged in Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 with committing a substantive offense. He is charged with conspiring or attempting to commit those offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The court then gave basic instructions regarding conspiracy and attempt. The court next read the instructions pertinent to each count, specifying the elements and definitions for each crime, and instructed the jury that they could reach a guilty verdict \u201conly if all of the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The jury was also given the circumstances under which a defendant may be found guilty of a crime committed by a co-conspirator to advance the conspiracy towards its goals. Finally, the court instructed the jury on general definitions including possession, knowingly and willfully, and the proper use of exhibits and tape recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Holland has failed to demonstrate that the court\u2019s instructions on conspiracy and attempt misstated the law or misled the jury. Holland has offered nothing to rebut the presumption that the jurors followed the court\u2019s instructions that all of the elements of each count had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He has cited no case that supports his contention that giving separate instructions on attempt and conspiracy constitutes structural error, and independent research has revealed no such case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">c. <em>Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Holland argues that the district court abused its discretion during jury selection. We review a district court\u2019s conduct of voir dire for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vera, </em>701 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir. 1983). The district court\u2019s discretion includes whether to submit a party\u2019s proposed questions to the venire. <em>United States v. Tegzes, </em>715 F.2d 505, 507 (11th Cir.1983). \u201cThe purpose of voir dire is to enable the defendant to evaluate the prospective jurors and select a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>Vera, </em>701 F.2d at 1355. The proper inquiry is \u201cwhether the district judge\u2019s overall examination, coupled with his charge to the jury, affords a party the protection sought.\u201d <em>Tegzes, </em>715 F.2d at 507 (internal quotation marks omitted). A district court does not abuse its discretion unless it fails to reasonably assure that prejudice would be discovered if present. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">In this case, the district court acted within its ' discretion in conducting voir dire. While the court did not explicitly inquire as to bias toward convicted felons, the court advised the prospective jurors of the charges that Holland faced, and asked if they could be impartial. It explained the presumption of evidence and the burden of proof, and asked the prospective jurors whether they accepted those principles. After the jury was sworn, the court gave preliminary instructions to the jury, including instructions on the presumption of evidence and the government\u2019s burden of proof. At the close of evidence, the court again addressed these topics in specific jury instructions, and also gave a limiting instruction regarding the use of other acts. The voir dire process in this case provided reasonable assurance that any existing prejudices held by potential jurors were discovered, and, together with the court\u2019s instructions, adequately protected Holland\u2019s right to an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">\n<em>d. Holland\u2019s Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">Holland argues that the district court failed to recognize that, because the government controlled both the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>drugs in this case and the facts that induced the defendants to use a firearm, the government engaged in sentencing-factor manipulation. Holland also claims that his sentence was unreasonably disparate from those of his co-defendants, who both received downward variances.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe may set aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191. In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally sound, we examine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">This court has never applied the defense of sentencing-factor manipulation to a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1097-98 (11th Cir. 2009). If sentencing-factor manipulation were recognized, however, the district court would filter the manipulation out of the sentencing calculation, and thus, any mandatory m\u00ednimums that only applied because of the manipulation would no longer be applicable at sentencing. <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007). The standard for sentencing-factor manipulation is high. The government must engage in extraordinary misconduct for the standard to be satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 1271. \u201cThe fact that the government\u2019s fictitious reverse sting operation involved a large quantity of drugs does not amount to the type of manipulative governmental conduct warranting a downward departure in sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>138 F.3d 1410, 1414 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Here, Holland\u2019s argument that the government engaged in sentencing-factor manipulation by inventing the amount of cocaine is foreclosed by this court\u2019s holding in <em>Sanchez. Id. </em>Moreover, Collins\u2019s creation of an armed guard scenario does not rise to the level of extraordinary misconduct necessary to show sentencing-factor manipulation. Holland\u2019s argument that he was not willing and predisposed to commit the crime proposed by Collins is simply not compatible with the facts of this case, including Holland discussing the necessity of using a firearm, stating that he would bring an AK47 firearm to the robbery, and bragging that he had \u201cbeat a murder and a home invasion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">With regard to Holland\u2019s sentencing disparity claim, the district court is required to \u201cavoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). However, a sentencing disparity is not \u201cunwarranted\u201d if the individuals being compared are not similarly situated. <em>See United-States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1252 (11th Cir.2009). Holland has not shown that there was an unreasonable sentencing disparity as compared to George and Gatlin, because they were not similar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>ly situated for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Holland and his co-defendants, who pleaded guilty, were sentenced based on different charged conduct and 'their sentences do not reflect an unwarranted disparity. <em>Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Finally, Holland\u2019s argument that the district court treated the sentencing Guidelines as presumptively reasonable was raised for the first time in his reply brief, and therefore we need not address it. <em>See United States v. Oakley, </em>744 F.2d 1553, 1556 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (stating that arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are not properly before the reviewing court). Nevertheless, there is nothing in the sentencing transcript that suggests that the court treated the Guidelines as presumptively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In sum, Holland has not shown that his sentence was unreasonable based on sentencing-factor manipulation, or that there was an unreasonable sentencing disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
