On appeal, Rodriguez argues his sentence is unreasonable because it is based on the, fundamentally flawed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first ensure the sentence was procedurally reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Once we determine a sentence is procedurally sound, we examine whether the sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Rodriguez has challenged his sentence as procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court relied on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2. We have rejected the argument that \u00a7 2G2.2 is flawed. <em>See United States v. Wayerski, </em>624 F.3d 1342, 1354 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1212 n. 32 (11th Cir. 2010) <em>(en banc)-, United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1201 n. 15 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, Rodriguez\u2019s argument that the child pornography guidelines are inherently flawed is unavailing as it is foreclosed by prior precedent. <em>United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009). Moreover, Rodriguez\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Because Rodriguez has not met his burden of showing an abuse of discretion, we affirm his sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
