At the time of his arrest, Danford had four prior felony convictions for selling crack cocaine on four different dates in Alabama, but all four convictions resulted from one case, which was concluded in one sentencing proceeding. On appeal, Danford argues that his prior convictions did not qualify as the three prior convictions required under the ACCA because they were adjudicated in one case. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether crimes were committed on \u201coccasions different from one another,\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). Under the prior precedent rule, a prior panel\u2019s holding is binding on all subsequent panels of this Court unless the holding is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting en banc. <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>600 F.3d 1326, 1332 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-18\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), a person who violates \u00a7 922(g) and who \u201chas three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another\u201d is subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). To satisfy this requirement, the three pri- or convictions must be \u201cfor crimes that are temporally distinct,\u201d which requires that the government demonstrate that the previous convictions arose out of separate and distinct criminal episodes. <em>Sneed, </em>600 F.3d at 1329-30 (quotation and emphasis omitted). Even where the gaps are small, distinctions in time and place are typically sufficient to separate criminal episodes from one another, such that two offenses are distinct so long as \u201csome temporal break\u201d occurs between them. <em>Id. </em>at 1330 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-19\">Here, the district court did not err by concluding that Danford was subject to the \u00a7 924(e)(1) enhancement due to his prior felony convictions. Although he was convicted and sentenced at the same time for each of his crimes, Danford\u2019s prior convictions for the sale of cocaine arose out of separate and distinct criminal episodes, as they each involved the sale of cocaine on a different day. <em>See Sneed, </em>600 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>1329-30. The intervening days between each criminal episode constituted \u201ctemporal breaks,\u201d sufficient to separate them from each other. <em>See id. </em>at 1330. Dan-ford concedes that our binding caselaw required the district court\u2019s conclusion, but urges us to adopt a different holding in this case. Nevertheless, we are bound by the holding in <em>Sneed </em>until the holding is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting en banc. <em>Id. </em>at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
