Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473,176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), Hassun alleged ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial attorney\u2019s failure to advise him of the deportation consequences of pleading guilty to a cocaine possession offense in 1985. After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hassun\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-20\">A writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is \u201cavailable to vacate a conviction when the petitioner has served his sentence and is no longer in custody.\u201d <em>United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 712 (11th Cir.2002). The writ constitutes \u201can extraordinary remedy of last resort available only in compelling circumstances where necessary to achieve justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Mills, </em>221 F.3d 1201, 1203 (11th Cir.2000). A petitioner asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must show both that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Before the Supreme Court issued its 2010 decision in <em>Padilla, </em>most courts held counsel was under no constitutional obligation to advise a client of the possible deportation consequences of pleading guilty. <em>See Padilla, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1481 n. 9 (collecting cases). Our circuit adhered to this view. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>778 F.2d 764, 768-69 (11th Cir.1985) (holding that counsel is not ineffective for failing to advise a defendant of the deportation consequences of a guilty plea). In <em>Padilla, </em>the Supreme Court rejected this view, holding that an attorney renders deficient performance by failing to advise a non-citizen client that a guilty plea \u201ccarries a risk of deportation.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 1486.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Regardless of whether <em>Padilla </em>applies retroactively, Hassun cannot succeed on his underlying ineffective assistance of counsel claim. There is no indication counsel\u2019s performance was deficient when viewed in light of the professional standards in place in 1985. <em>See Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2066 (noting a court \u201cmust judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct ... viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct\u201d). Although Hassun argues his plea was entered eight months before our decision in <em>Campbell, </em>the district court did not deny his motion on the ground that <em>Campbell </em>had been decided at the time of Hassun\u2019s plea. Rather, the district court found Hassun\u2019s plea was \u201cessentially contemporaneous! ]\u201d with <em>Campbell, </em>and that the professional norms present in the mid-1990s, relied upon by the Supreme Court in <em>Padilla, </em>were not in place in 1985. Those findings are not clearly erroneous, and thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in making them. <em>See Peer v. Lewis, </em>606 F.3d 1306, 1311 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Furthermore, even if Hassun were able to show counsel\u2019s 1985 performance was deficient, he has failed to meet the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland. </em>Hassun\u2019s affidavit states only that, had he been informed of the consequences of his plea, he would not have pled guilty. <em>Padilla </em>requires a petitioner to show that a decision to reject the plea bargain \u201cwould have been rational under the circumstances,\u201d a showing Hassun has not provided. <em>See Padilla, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1485.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-14\">.
