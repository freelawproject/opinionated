Woods was sentenced to 92 months of imprisonment. Woods moves this court to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal following the denial of his motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). By doing so, he challenges the district court\u2019s IFP determination. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether an appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Contrary to Woods\u2019s assertion, the district court correctly concluded that Woods was not entitled to relief based on Amendment 750 because, even without consideration of the crack cocaine in this case, Woods was responsible for 662 grams of powder cocaine, which drug quantity alone results in the same base offense level, 26, and the same guidelines range of 92 to 115 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7). Because retroactive Amendment 750 did not result in a lower sentencing guidelines range in Woods\u2019s ease, the policy statements precluded the district court from modifying his sentence. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). As such, Woods\u2019s argument that the district court erred when it denied relief without considering the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) is unavailing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Woods has failed to demonstrate a non-frivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
