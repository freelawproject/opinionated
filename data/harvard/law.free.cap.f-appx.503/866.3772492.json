Saint Surin was charged in 12 of the counts. He was a fugitive until November 12, 2009, when he was arrested in Ecuador and brought to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-17\">On April 9, 2010, while represented by retained counsel, Joel DeFabio, he pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to Count 1 of the indictment, alleging a conspiracy to import five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a) and 963. The agreement called for the Government to dismiss the remaining counts against Saint Surin at sentencing because he agreed to assist the Government in its narcotics investigation. At the plea hearing, Saint Surin expressed complete satisfaction with DeFabio\u2019s representation, assuring the court that his attorney had done everything he could to defend him, and his guilty plea was therefore accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-19\">At sentencing, Saint Surin told the District Court that he had been kidnaped in Ecuador and brought to the United States illegally, that DeFabio had rushed him into signing the plea agreement, and that his plea had been coerced. He also said that DeFabio had labored under a conflict of interest because he had represented two codefendants who had plead guilty and been sentenced. He requested the appointment of new counsel. The District Court granted his request, appointed new counsel and continued the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-20\">New counsel thereafter moved the District Court to withdraw Saint Surin\u2019s guilty plea due to DeFabio\u2019s representation of the two codefendants. The court convened an evidentiary hearing on the motion, at which Saint Surin and DeFabio testified and DeFabio explained in detail how he came to represent Saint Surin\u2019s codefendants and Saint Surin. After hearing the testimony and argument of counsel, the court accepted DeFabio\u2019s version of the events and denied Saint Surin\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, finding that DeFabio\u2019s representation of the two code-fendants had caused Saint Surin no prejudice. The court then proceeded to sentence him to a prison term of 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-21\">On May 30, 2012, this court affirmed Saint Surin\u2019s conviction. <em>United States v. Saint Surin, </em>477 Fed.Appx. 683 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>2012) (unpublished). In doing so, we held that Saint Surin\u2019s argument that DeFa-bio\u2019s representation of the two codefen-dants prejudiced his case was no more than hypothetical speculation. We noted that, as part of the appeal, Saint Surin sought a stay of the appeal and a remand for an evidentiary hearing \u201con his separate claim that his signature on a legal services agreement was forged.\u201d We refused to grant the stay and remand the case for such hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">On January 20, 2012, while his appeal was pending, Saint Surin moved the District Court <em>pro se </em>to compel the production of certain documents from DeFabio and from the Government, arguing that he had new evidence that DeFabio had an actual conflict of interest due to DeFabio\u2019s previous representation of the two codefen-dants. The court denied the motion. Saint Surin appeals the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In <em>United States v. Saint Surin, </em>we held, as indicated above, that it was proper for the District Court to find that Saint Surin had shown no prejudice resulting from an actual conflict of interest, and that his guilty plea satisfied Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. 477 Fed.Appx. at 686. Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, we are bound by that holding, <em>see Alphamed, Inc. v. B. Braun Medical, Inc., </em>367 F.3d 1280, 1285-86 (11th Cir.2004), unless one of the exceptions to the doctrine applies, e.g., \u201csubstantially different evidence is produced, when there has been a change in controlling authority, or when the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would result in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Ala. State Tenure Com\u2019n, </em>405 F.3d 1276, 1283 (11th Cir.2005). We find no exception here.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
