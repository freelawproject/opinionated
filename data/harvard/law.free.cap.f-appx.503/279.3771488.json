Brown appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of his sentence based on the retroactive amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the guideline for crack cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(e)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">As the district court determined, Brown was subject to a mandatory 10-year minimum sentence under former 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). A mandatory minimum statutory penalty overrides the retroactive application of a new guideline. <em>See United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1994). Regardless of whether \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provided the district court with authority to reduce Brown\u2019s sentence to the 10-year floor, the Government did not file a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) requesting a sentence below the mandatory minimum; thus, the district court did not have the authority to impose a sentence below 10 years. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>382 F.3d 489, 499 (5th Cir.2004); <em>see also United States v. </em>Krum<em>now, </em>476 F.3d 294, 297 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-11\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
