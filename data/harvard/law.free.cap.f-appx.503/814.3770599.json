Plaintiff appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. Plaintiff also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his five motions for sanctions against Defendants. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">A.Pilots\u2019 Collective Bargaining Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Defendant Spirit Airlines, Inc. (\u201cSpirit\u201d) employed Plaintiff Stewart as an airline pilot. While employed by Spirit, Stewart became a member of a union, the Air Line Pilots Association (the \u201cpilots\u2019 union\u201d). Defendant Spirit and the pilots\u2019 union maintain a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Under Section 19 of that collective bargaining agreement, a Spirit pilot is entitled to an investigative fact-finding meeting with the chief pilot and the pilot\u2019s union representatives prior to receiving discipline. After the meeting, the chief pilot renders a decision in writing. The decision must state the facts, the precise charges, and the disciplinary action to be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">B. Stewart\u2019s January 5 Fact-Finding Meeting</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">On November 15, 2010, Plaintiff Stewart allegedly failed to comply with federal aviation regulations and company procedure during Flight 461. On January 5, 2011, Stewart was required to appear at a fact-finding meeting initiated to investigate those allegations. Stewart gave notice that he intended to record the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">Stewart alleges that: (1) Defendant Spirit\u2019s representatives at the meeting included Defendant Chief Pilot John Richard Dancaster; (2) Stewart\u2019s recording device was plainly visible on the table; and (3) thus Defendants, including Dancaster, impliedly consented to the recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">According to Stewart\u2019s complaint, a few days later Defendant Dancaster withdrew his consent to have the fact-finding meeting recorded and claimed the recording may have violated state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">On January 21, 2011, Defendant Chief Pilot Dancaster initiated a second disciplinary investigation as a result of Stewart\u2019s \u201calleged insubordination/refusal to follow instructions, possible violation of state laws, and violation of Spirit policies on employee conduct in connection with [Stewart\u2019s] unauthorized recording of discussions at the investigative meeting held ... on January 5, 2011.\u201d Dancaster\u2019s direct supervisor, Director of Operations Joe Houghton, agreed to Daneaster\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">C. Stewart\u2019s February 10 Fact-Finding Meeting</p>\n<p id=\"b838-17\">Subsequently, a second investigative fact-finding meeting took place on February 10, 2011. At the meeting, Defendant Dancaster \u201crefus[ed] to bargain while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Stewart and Union Representative Frank Hann sought a Letter of Agreement (\u2018LOA\u2019) to definitively dictate the manner in which a record could be made of [investigative fact-finding] meetings.\u201d Although the parties did not reach an agreement on how to memorialize the meeting, Plaintiff Stewart also recorded the February 10, 2011 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">On February 17, 2011, Defendant Spirit terminated Stewart\u2019s employment for insubordination and failure to adhere to management\u2019s directives stemming from his recording of the January 5 fact-finding meeting. Stewart, however, claims that he was actually terminated because his recording efforts were not only for his case but also intended to aid the pilots\u2019 union hearing procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">D. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">On July 5, 2011, Stewart filed a second amended complaint, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>retaliatory labor actions in violation of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Fourth of the RLA. He named as defendants Spirit, Dancaster, Houghton, and Labor Relations Manager Lucy Singleton. During the course of the litigation, Stewart filed five motions for sanctions against Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Defendants moved for dismissal. A magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (the \u201creport\u201d) that concluded: (1) Stewart\u2019s RLA claims constituted \u201cminor disputes,\u201d which must be litigated exclusively before a labor adjustment board, and (2) thus the federal court lacked jurisdiction, warranting dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). Alternatively, the magistrate judge found that Stewart\u2019s allegations did not rise above \u201cconjecture and bare-bones conclusions,\u201d warranting dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The magistrate judge also recommended that the district court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Stewart\u2019s remaining state tort claims. In separate reports, the magistrate judge recommended denying Stewart\u2019s motions for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">In an omnibus order issued on February 24, 2012, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report, concluded that Stewart\u2019s objections to that report lacked merit, and granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The district court also denied the sanctions motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">We first outline the nature of Stewart\u2019s statutory claims under the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">A. The Railway Labor Act</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">The RLA was designed to avoid interruptions to commerce or to the operation of the railway or airline industries caused by labor management disputes. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151a(l);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see also Geddes v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>321 F.3d 1349, 1353-54 (11th Cir.2003). The RLA sets up a comprehensive alternative dispute resolution framework, placing exclusive jurisdiction of many labor management disputes within a system of adjustment boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">Under the RLA, federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over disputes which are \u201cgrounded in the [collective bargaining agreement],\u201d <em>Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris, </em>512 U.S. 246, 256, 114 S.Ct. 2239, 2245, 129 L.Ed.2d 203 (1994), and \u201cinvolve controversies over the meaning of an existing collective bargaining- agreement in a particular fact situation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 253, 114 S.Ct. at 2244 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such disputes are labeled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>as \u201cminor disputes\u201d under the RLA and are subject to mandatory arbitration by the adjustment boards. <em>Id. </em>at 253, 114 S.Ct. at 2244. However, the RLA\u2019s alternative dispute resolution scheme does not preempt causes of action to enforce rights that are independent of the collective bargaining agreement, including statutory rights. <em>Id. </em>at 256,114 S.Ct. at 2246.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">One statutory right under the RLA is found in \u00a7 152, Fourth which grants employees the right to organize a union and to collectively bargain. Section 152, Fourth also provides, in pertinent part, that it is unlawful to \u201cinterfere in any way with the organization of its employees\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-5\">No carrier, its officers, or agents shall deny or in any way question the right of its employees to join, organize, or assist in organizing the labor organization of their choice, and it shall be unlawful for any carrier to interfere in any way with the organization of its employees....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAB\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Fourth. Some courts have interpreted this provision to grant employees an implied private cause of action to sue when wrongfully discharged for participation in activities to organize a union in the workplace. <em>See, e.g., Bensel v. Allied Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>387 F.3d 298, 318 (3d Cir.2004) (collecting cases in which courts have recognized an implied private cause of action under sections of the RLA).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">However, \u00a7 152, Fourth has been narrowly interpreted in two important respects. First, \u00a7 152, Fourth only protects employees in their efforts to join or organize a union. For instance, while the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d) specifically protects employees in efforts to seek improved terms and conditions of employment for \u201cmutual aid or protection,\u201d <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157; <em>New River Indus, v. N.L.R.B., </em>945 F.2d 1290, 1294-95 (4th Cir. 1991), the RLA does not. <em>Johnson v. Express One Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>944 F.2d 247, 251-52 (5th Cir.1991) (The RLA does not provide a basis for the plaintiff to have a coworker attend an investigatory interview because the RLA does not seek \u201cto preserve employees\u2019 rights to act in concert for \u2018mutual aid or protection.\u2019 \u201d In contrast to the NLRA, \u201cthe RLA protects the employees\u2019 right to establish a union.\u201d); <em>see also Indep. Union of Flight Attendants v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., </em>789 F.2d 139, 141 n. 2 (2d Cir.1986) (\u201c[T]he general restriction of the scope of the [RLA] to organizing and representational rights, as opposed to the broader \u2018concerted activity\u2019 rights ..., is clearly supported by the legislative history.\u201d). Thus, an employee\u2019s activities are protected under \u00a7 152, Fourth of the RLA only if the employee was attempting to \u201cjoin, organize, or assist in organizing [a] labor organization,\u201d or to exercise his right to \u201corganize and bargain collectively.\u201d \u00a7 152, Fourth; <em>see also, e.g., Johnson, 944 F.2d </em>at 252; <em>Herring v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>894 F.2d 1020,1023 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cNo private cause of action exists under the RLA for a group of employees who assert retaliatory conduct based upon employee activities which bear no relationship to establishing a union....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Second, courts have narrowly circumscribed the instances in which an employee may bring a \u00a7 152, Fourth statutory claim <em>after </em>a union has been certified. As the U.S. Supreme Court has noted, \u00a7 152, Fourth primarily addresses the \u201cprecertification rights and freedoms of unorganized employees.\u201d <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Indep. Fed\u2019n of Flight Attendants, </em>489 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>U.S. 426, 440, 109 S.Ct. 1225, 1284, 103 L.Ed.2d 456 (1989). This is because, once a union is certified, the RLA dispute resolution system is put in place and judicial intervention is generally unnecessary and undesirable. <em>Id. </em>at 441, 109 S.Ct. at 1234-35. Post-certification disputes are usually left to the alternative dispute resolution process described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Thus, our sister circuits have permitted judicial intervention in postcertification RLA cases in only limited circumstances. One circumstance includes \u201ca fundamental attack on the collective bargaining process\u201d or a \u201cdirect attempt to destroy a union.\u201d <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l v. Guilford Transp. Indus., Inc., </em>399 F.3d 89, 103 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). The other post-certification circumstance involves cases where the employer had anti-union animus and explicitly penalized an employee because of the employee\u2019s union activities. <em>Wight-man v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co., </em>100 F.3d 228, 234 (1st Cir.1996); <em>Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs v. Kan. City S. Ry. Co., </em>26 F.3d 787, 795 (8th Cir.1994); <em>see also, e.g., Atlas Air, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>232 F.3d 218, 223-26 (D.C.Cir.2000) (concluding \u00a7 152, Fourth was likely violated where the defendant carrier adopted a facially discriminatory policy that penalized employees by terminating their participation in a profit-sharing plan for no other reason than the employees\u2019 union participation); <em>Conrad v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>494 F.2d 914, 917-19 (7th Cir.1974) (concluding a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether the plaintiff was fired because of anti-union animus due to evidence that the defendant fired the plaintiff explicitly because of the plaintiffs over-activity with his union).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Accordingly, we must address two issues in order to resolve Stewart\u2019s RLA claims: (1) whether the district court lacked jurisdiction over the claims because they were \u201cminor disputes\u201d subject to mandatory arbitration; and (2) whether Stewart otherwise states a statutory cause of action under \u00a7 152, Fourth of the RLA. We turn to the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">B. Subject Matter Jurisdiction over the Railway Labor Act Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">On appeal, Stewart argues that the district court erred in dismissing his RLA claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report, determined that Stewart\u2019s claims were only \u201cminor disputes\u201d under the RLA, subject to mandatory arbitration and divesting the district court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Defendants argue, and the district court agreed, that Stewart\u2019s RLA claims are \u201cminor disputes\u201d because they are grounded in the collective bargaining agreement. We agree too.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Here, Section 19 of the collective bargaining agreement is entitled \u201cInvestigation, Discipline, and Disciplinary Grievances.\u201d Section 19 provides the specific and detailed procedures to follow in the event Spirit intends to discipline a pilot and the rights the employee has in those disciplinary hearings. For example, the agreement explicitly provides that the Chief Pilot will render a written decision after a fact-finding meeting is held. That decision must include the facts found at the meeting, the precise charges, and the disciplinary action that will be taken. The agreement also contains deadlines for the issuance of a notice of investigation and for the fact-finding meeting. However, See<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>tion 19 affords the pilots no individual right to record the fact-finding meeting. The pilots\u2019 union could have negotiated that term into the agreement, but it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Despite Stewart\u2019s attempt to characterize his termination as a major dispute, his dispute is only a minor one subject to the RLA\u2019s alternative dispute resolution scheme. To hold otherwise would allow any fired employee to recast his termination as a \u201cmajor dispute\u201d and avoid RLA\u2019s arbitration scheme so long as he says he was fired for asserting a new contractual right he desires under the collective bargaining agreement. This holding also accords with the general principle that \u201cif a reasonable doubt exists as to whether the dispute is major or minor, we will deem it to be minor.\u201d <em>CSX Tramp., Inc. v. Bhd. of Maint. of Way Emps., </em>327 F.3d 1309, 1321 (11th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we conclude that Stewart\u2019s RLA claims are minor disputes not within the jurisdiction of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">C. Rule 12(b)(6) Dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Even if we were to conclude that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over Stewart\u2019s claims, we agree with the district court\u2019s alternative conclusion that dismissal was appropriate because Stewart failed to state a statutory cause of action under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Fourth of the RLA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">As described above, some courts have permitted post-certification, antiunion animus claims under the RLA in limited circumstances. Defendants argue that Stewart\u2019s allegations fail to rise to the \u201csubstantial level\u201d of anti-union animus necessary to bring a post-certification dispute within the jurisdiction of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">In reviewing a motion to dismiss, courts must determine whether the pleadings contain \u201csufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949,173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible when the court can draw \u201cthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged\u201d from the pled facts. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949. We also must construe a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s pleadings liberally. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249,1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">Stewart argues that the standard governing retaliatory termination claims under the NLRA should apply to his anti-union animus claims under the RLA. <em>See, e.g., Lebow v. Am. Tram Air, Inc., </em>86 F.3d 661, 665-66 (7th Cir.1996); <em>Roscello v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>726 F.2d 217, 222 (5th Cir. 1984). Under that NLRA standard, Stewart would then need to show by a preponderance of the evidence that his protected conduct under the RLA \u2014 his union-organizing activity \u2014 was a substantial or motivating factor in his termination. <em>Lebow, </em>86 F.3d at 666. To establish a prima facie case, he must show that (1) he engaged in protected union activities; (2) the employer knew of his involvement in protected union activities; (3) the employer harbored animus toward those union activities; and (4) there was a causal connection between the anti-union animus and his termination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">We need not decide what standard applies because Stewart fails to state a claim even under the NLRA standard he suggests. First, his activity \u2014 an effort to initiate a new custom or practice within Spirit of allowing employees to record fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>finding meetings\u2014is not a union-organizing activity protected under \u00a7 152, Fourth. Second, even were his conduct protected, Stewart provides only conclusory allegations and no facts to support the proposition that any of the Defendants harbored anti-union animus. Such conclusory allegations are not sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1964-65 (\u201ca plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In sum, Defendants\u2019 actions did nothing to interfere with Stewart\u2019s right to organize or collectively bargain. Nor did Defendants\u2019 actions come anywhere near a \u201cfundamental attack on the collective bargaining process.\u201d Accordingly, Stewart\u2019s complaint dose not state a cognizable anti-union animus claim under \u00a7 152, Fourth of the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"AyA\">Stewart primarily relies on <em>Fennessy v. Southwest Airlines, </em>91 F.3d 1359 (9th Cir. 1996), in support of his claims. But that case is inapposite. <em>Fennessy </em>involved a major pre-certification dispute\u2014the plaintiff sought to replace the existing union with a new one. The plaintiffs conduct fell squarely within the protected activity described in \u00a7 152, Fourth: the plaintiff sought to create a new labor organization. The Ninth Circuit concluded that <em>Fennessy </em>\u201cwas one of those cases where \u2018but for the general jurisdiction of the federal courts there would be no remedy to enforce the statutory commands which Congress has written in to the [RLA].\u2019 \u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of Flight Attendants, AFL-CIO v. Horizon Air Indus., Inc., </em>280 F.3d 901, 905-06 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Fennessy, </em>91 F.3d at 1363). That is not the case for Stewart. By all accounts, he was able to utilize the grievance process afforded under the RLA and received effective union representation. That is all the RLA seeks to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"APv\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Stewart\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"Al5\">D. The Motions for Sanctions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABT\">On appeal, Stewart also argues the district court erred in denying his five motions for sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11.</p>\n<p id=\"AC8\">\u201cThe purpose of Rule 11 sanctions is to reduce frivolous claims, defenses, or motions, and to deter costly meritless maneuvers.\u201d <em>Kaplan v. DaimlerChrysler, AG., </em>331 F.3d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts assess such sanctions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap5b\">(1) when a party files a pleading that has no reasonable factual basis; (2) when the party files a pleading that is based on a legal theory that has no reasonable chance of success and that cannot be advanced as a reasonable argument to change existing law; or (3) when the party files a pleading in bad faith for an improper purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A94\"><em>Id. </em>(alterations omitted) (citing <em>Massengale v. Ray, </em>267 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir .2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"A9v\">The rule incorporates an objective standard. <em>Id. </em>at 1255. Hence, courts determine whether a reasonable attorney in like circumstances could believe his actions were factually and legally justified. <em>Riccard v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>307 F.3d 1277, 1294 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"A1QD\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying each of Stewart\u2019s five</p>\n<p id=\"AjC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>motions for Rule 11 sanctions. Stewart concedes that his first motion was properly denied as moot. His second and fifth motions both attacked arguments that, far from being frivolous, prevailed before the district court. Further, there is nothing to suggest that Spirit otherwise invoked these arguments in bad faith or for any improper purpose. Finally, Stewart failed to object to the magistrate\u2019s findings on his third and fourth motions, and is unable to demonstrate that these findings, which the record supported, resulted in manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s February 24, 2012 order dismissing Stewart\u2019s RLA claims and denying Stewart\u2019s motions for sanctions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-10\">.
