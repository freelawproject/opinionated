Citing \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines, which provides that supervised release \u201cordinarily\u201d should not be imposed \u201cin a case in which supervised release is not required by statute and the defendant is a deportable alien who likely will be deported after imprisonment,\u201d Martinez argues that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-23\">Although this court ordinarily reviews revocation sentences under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard, <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011), our review in this case is for plain error because Martinez failed to object to his sentence in the district court. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, Martinez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Considering the record before us, there is no indication that the district court accounted for or considered \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) in applying the guidelines for supervised release. The district court thus committed clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Blocker, </em>612 F.3d 413, 416 (5th Cir. 2010). However, Martinez cannot show that the error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The guidance against supervised release under \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) is hortatory rather than mandatory. <em>United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir.2012). Where \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) applies, \u201csupervised release should not be imposed absent a determination that supervised release would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>\u00a7 5D1.1, comment, (n.5). The district court\u2019s particularized statements concerning Martinez\u2019s history of repeated immigration violations, though brief, were adequate to explain why a supervised release term was appropriate to provide \u201can added measure of deterrence and protection\u201d in his case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5D1.1, comment, (n.5); <em>see Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 328-30. Thus, with respect to the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence, Martinez cannot satisfy his burden under plain error review of showing an effect on his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">With respect to substantive reasonableness, Martinez contends that the district court erred because it failed to account for the guidance under \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) against supervised release. One basis for error in a defendant\u2019s sentence is failure by the district court to account for a factor that should receive significant weight. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.Bd 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Here, the district court\u2019s reasons for the sentence indicated that the particular facts and circumstances of this case warranted the imposition of the punishment imposed, including the supervised release term. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5D1.1, comment. (n.5). \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Martinez has not demonstrated plain error regarding the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See Puckett, 556 U.S. </em>at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
