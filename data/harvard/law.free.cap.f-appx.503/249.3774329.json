She is challenging the district court\u2019s certifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>tion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 24(a), that any appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). The district court relied on its reasons for dismissing Lewis\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as grounds for its certification decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">A movant seeking leave to proceed IFP on appeal must demonstrate that she is a pauper and that her appeal is taken in good faith, i.e., that she will raise a non-frivolous issue on appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5); <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Our inquiry into whether an appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In her \u00a7 1983 complaint, Lewis alleged that the defendants, in various combinations, violated her constitutional rights in relation to a state court contempt proceeding and violated state laws prohibiting the intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation of character, libel, slander, fraud, and malicious prosecution. Lewis asked the district court to reverse her convictions of contempt and of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, expunge her record, and award her $10,000,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The district court dismissed Lewis\u2019s claims as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). The court held that Lewis\u2019s challenge to her convictions could be brought only in a habeas action, Lewis\u2019s request for expungement of her convictions was barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and Lewis\u2019s remaining constitutional claims were either frivolous and failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted or were barred because the respective defendants had immunity from suit. Because Lewis\u2019s federal claims were dismissed, the district court dismissed her state law claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">On appeal, Lewis restates the allegations she made in her \u00a7 1983 complaint. She argues that the district court erred in determining that her claims against Judges Calvert and Metcalf in their individual capacities were barred under the doctrine of judicial immunity. However, her argument-that the judges were not entitled to immunity because they exceeded their judicial capacity when they allegedly violated her constitutional rights-lacks merit. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 355-60, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978); <em>Malina v. Gonzales, </em>994 F.2d 1121, 1124 (5th Cir.1993). Judicial officers are entitled to absolute immunity from damages in civil actions arising out of all acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions. <em>Krueger v. Reimer, </em>66 F.3d 75, 77 (5th Cir.1995). A judge has no immunity, however, for \u201cactions taken outside of his judicial capacity\u201d or for \u201cactions that are judicial in nature, but occur in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Ma-lina v. Gonzales, </em>994 F.2d 1121, 1124 (5th Cir.1993). Lewis\u2019s allegations consist of challenges to the manner in which Judge Calvert and Judge Metcalf handled her contempt proceedings, acts that are judicial in nature and constitute \u201cnormal judicial function[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1124-25. Lewis alleges that Judge Calvert and Judge Met-calf violated her constitutional rights, but the doctrine of judicial immunity insulates judges from suit even in cases involving allegations of a constitutional violation. <em>See Stump, </em>435 U.S. at 355-60, 98 S.Ct. 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Lewis has not addressed the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing her remaining claims. By failing to identify any error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>in the district court\u2019s basis for dismissing those claims, Lewis has abandoned any challenge she might have raised regarding the district court\u2019s decisions. <em>See Brink-mann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Lewis has not demonstrated that she will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(a); <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, her motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
