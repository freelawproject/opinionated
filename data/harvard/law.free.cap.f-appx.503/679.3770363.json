On appeal, Cooper argues that the district court should have reduced her sentence under Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines because: (1) under <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), she is eligible for a reduction even though she was sentenced as a career offender; (2) the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d) changed the minimum sentence that she faced; (8) the district court counted her criminal history against her several times; and (4) the crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity is unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 8582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, state that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [the] amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to reduce offense levels in crack cocaine cases. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750. Amendment 759 made the drug quantity table amendment retroactive, and it became effective on November 1, 2011. <em>See id., </em>Amend. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In <em>Moore, </em>we addressed whether Amendment 706, which similarly reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, authorized reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for defendants who had been convicted of crack cocaine offenses, but had been sentenced under the career offender guidelines. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325-26. We explained that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only authorizes reductions to sentences that were \u201cbased on\u201d sentencing ranges that were subsequently lowered. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. As Amendment 706 did not lower the career offender offense levels, we concluded that it did not lower the sentencing range upon which a career offender\u2019s sentence had been based. <em>Id. </em>We also explained that the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 \u201c[made] clear\u201d that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was not authorized where an amendment lowered a defendant\u2019s base offense level for the offense of conviction, but not the career offender sentencing range under which the defendant was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Even after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman, Moore </em>remains binding precedent in our Circuit. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). <em>Freeman </em>had nothing to do with defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. Therefore, a defendant who was convicted of a crack cocaine offense but sentenced as a career offender was still not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">We recently have held that the FSA may not be used to reduce a sentence pursuant to a \u00a7 3582 motion because it is not a guidelines amendment issued by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374 (11th Cir.2012). Further, the FSA has not been made retroactively applicable to sentences imposed before its 2010 passage. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">Cooper\u2019s argument that she is entitled to a \u00a7 3582 reduction, despite her status as a career offender, is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Lawson. See Lawson, </em>686 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>F.3d at 1321. Cooper does not contest that she was sentenced as a career offender. <em>Lawson </em>confirms that <em>Moore </em>is still binding precedent, and, under <em>Moore, </em>Cooper is not eligible for a sentence reduction because she was sentenced as a career offender. <em>See id.; see also Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">None of Cooper\u2019s other arguments for a sentence reduction deal with a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines issued by the Sentencing Commission. This includes Cooper\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that the FSA should apply to her motion. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376-77. Accordingly, we hold that a sentence reduction is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, and we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying the motion to reduce sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
