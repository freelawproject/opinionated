Defendant contends: his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a); the advisory Guidelines sentencing range was too severe because the district court failed to consider his benign motive for returning, his stated intention not to return, or that his reentry offense was, at bottom, a mere trespass; he deserved a lesser sentence based upon the disparity in fast-track early disposition programs; and his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the illegal-reentry advisory sentencing Guideline, \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based, given that it double-counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly-preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th <em>Cir.2008); United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). Defendant does not claim procedural error. And, because he failed to object in district court to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, review of the numerous issues raised here is only for plain error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Defendant asserts plain-error review should not apply because no objection is required to preserve the issue of the substantive reasonableness of a sentence. As he acknowledges, this contention is foreclosed by <em>Peltier; </em>he raises it only to preserve it for possible further review. To show plain error, Defendant must establish that the district court committed a clear or obvious error, which affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>He fails to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">Defendant concedes his double-counting and fast-track contentions are foreclosed by our precedeht. <em>E.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir. 2009). He raises them only to preserve them for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">Our court has also rejected the contention that a within-Guidelines sentence under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because illegal reentry is a mere trespass offense. <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">Defendant\u2019s sentence, which is at the bottom of the applicable advisory Guidelines sentencing range, is presumed reasonable. <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). His disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut this presumption. <em>E.g., United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
