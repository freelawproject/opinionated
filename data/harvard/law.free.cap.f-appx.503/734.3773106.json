After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if it was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); see <em>also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l). If, however, the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is not lowered by the retroactively applicable guideline amendment, the district court has no authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Here, Miller is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because Amendment 750 did not lower his applicable guidelines range. At his 2009 sentencing, Miller was held accountable for 27.7 grams of cocaine base (converted to 554 kilograms of marijuana), 492.4 grams of powder cocaine (converted to 98.48 kilograms of marijuana), and 0.1196 kilograms of marijuana, for a total marijuana equivalent of 652.5996 kilograms of marijuana. This total amount set a base offense level of 26. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6) <em>&amp; </em>cmt. n. 10(D)(1) (2008) (setting base offense level at 28 for offenses involving at least 400 kilograms, but less than 700 kilograms, of marijuana, but then providing for a two-level reduction where the offense involved both cocaine base and other controlled substances). After applying other adjustments, Miller\u2019s total offense level of 30 and criminal history category of I resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment for his drug offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Amendment 750 became effective and retroactive on November 1, 2011, and is listed as an amendment that may serve as a basis for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) &amp; cmt. n. 4; U.S.S.G.App. C, amends. 750 &amp; 759. Among other things, Amendment 750: (1) changed the base offense levels for cocaine base offenses in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)\u2019s Drug Quantity Table; (2) changed the marijuana equivalency for 1 gram of cocaine base from 20 kilograms of marijuana to 3,571 grams of marijuana; and (3) eliminated the two-level reduction to the combined base offense level where the offense involved both cocaine base and other controlled substances. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 750 (making permanent Amendment 748\u2019s temporary, emergency amendment that modified the marijuana equivalency for cocaine base and striking Note 10(D) in the commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 10(B) (2011) (providing that, where different controlled substances are involved, the substances are converted to their marijuana equivalency and added together and then the sentencing court \u201clook[s] up the total in the Drug Quantity Table to obtain the combined offense level\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">Applying Amendment 750\u2019s new marijuana equivalency, Miller\u2019s cocaine base amount would now convert to 98.9167 kilograms of marijuana. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 10(D). Miller\u2019s total marijuana equivalency would be 197.5163 kilograms of marijuana, which would result in a base offense level of 26. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>\u00a7 ZDl.l(c)(7) &amp; cmt. n. 10(B) (2011) (setting base offense level at 26 for offenses involving at least 100 kilograms, but not more than 400 kilograms, of marijuana). Thus, even after Amendment 750, Miller\u2019s base offense level would remain level 26 and his advisory guidelines range would remain 97 to 121 months as to his drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">To the extent Miller argues that he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d), Miller\u2019s sentence was imposed in 2009, and thus the FSA does not apply to him. <em>See United States v. </em>Berry, 701 F.3d 374, 376-78 (11th Cir.2012) (concluding that the FSA does not apply retroactively to defendants sentenced prior to the FSA\u2019s August 3, 2010 effective date).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Miller devotes a substantial portion of his appeal brief to arguing that his convictions and sentences should be vacated for reasons already raised (and rejected) in a previously-filed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In particular, Miller argues that the district court erred at trial by admitting Miller\u2019s prior murder conviction in the United Kingdom and that Miller\u2019s counsel gave ineffective assistance by failing to object to the admission of his murder conviction and failing to raise the issue on direct appeal. These issues are outside the limited scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings to cases where retroactive amendment of the Sentencing Guidelines affects the applicable guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\">. We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009). We review <em>\"de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusion regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-14\">. Miller also received a consecutive 119-month sentence for his firearm offense, which is no implicated by this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b759-9\">. Both the district court and this Court denied Miller's request for a Certificate of Ap-pealability as to the issues raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion, and his separate appeal of the district court's denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion was dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
