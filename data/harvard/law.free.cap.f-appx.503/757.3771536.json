The indictment charged that Darlene, as Executive Director (\u201cED\u201d) of the Thomaston Housing Authority (\u201cTHA\u201d), conspired with her husband Lance to honor a previous ED\u2019s contracts between the THA and Steve Williams Painting (\u201cSWP\u201d). SWP was a \u201csubterfuge\u201d for Lance\u2019s painting company, and Lance received payment from the SWP contracts. These actions violated a conflict-of-interest provision located in the THA\u2019s annual contract with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) that provided that no officer of the THA Board could enter into a contract in which any member of the officer\u2019s immediate family had an interest. The evidence at trial showed that Lance and Darlene collaborated and agreed <em>to </em>create and maintain contracts with SWP in order to hide the fact that Lance was actually contracting with the THA, in violation of the relevant conflict-of-interest provision. At trial, the government also introduced evidence that some of the contracts between the THA and SWP were forged after the previous ED\u2019s death and violated a separate, more restrictive conflict-of-interest provision enacted by the THA itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">On appeal, the defendants each argue that: (1) there was a constructive amendment of the indictment because the indictment charged Lance and Darlene with conspiring to have the THA honor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>previous ED\u2019s pre-existing contracts, in contravention of the HUD conflict-of-interest provision, while the trial evidence showed that the contracts at issue were forgeries created after the prior ED\u2019s death and which violated the THA\u2019s conflict-of-interest provision, not HUD\u2019s provision, as charged; (2) the indictment was fatally deficient because the conspiracy count omitted the specific-intent elements of the underlying object offenses in the conspiracy count; (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the defendants\u2019 conspiracy convictions; (4) the defendants\u2019 sentences were procedurally unreasonable because the district court used the face amounts of the contracts between the THA and SWP to establish the loss amount under the Sentencing Guidelines; and (5) the district court erred by denying the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial because a juror\u2019s post-verdict statement that it was a waste of time to sit for a six-day trial when Lance and Darlene had been indicted by the federal government showed that the juror committed misconduct during <em>voir dire </em>by indicating that the indictment would not affect the juror\u2019s opinion of innocence or guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the defendants\u2019 convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">We review questions of constitutional law and denials of motions for judgment of acquittal <em>de novo. United States v. Ward, </em>486 F.3d 1212, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2007). A defendant cannot be tried on charges that are not made against him in the indictment, and when evidence at trial deviates from what is alleged in the indictment, either a constructive amendment or a variance can arise. <em>United States v. Flynt, </em>15 F.3d 1002, 1005 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The concepts of constructive amendment and variance are \u201coft-confused.\u201d <em>United States v. Narog, </em>372 F.3d 1243, 1247 (11th Cir.2004). A constructive amendment occurs \u201cwhen the essential elements of the offense contained in the indictment are altered to broaden the possible bases for conviction beyond what is contained in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Keller, </em>916 F.2d 628, 634 (11th Cir.1990)). In other words, jury instructions cannot allow a conviction on broader grounds than those alleged in the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 1248. \u201cThe danger that we are concerned with is that a defendant may have been convicted on a ground not alleged by the grand jury\u2019s indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Behety, </em>32 F.3d 503, 509 (11th Cir.l994)(in-ternal quotation marks omitted). The indictment can be expanded literally or in effect, by the prosecutor\u2019s actions or the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 508-09. A constructive amendment \u201cis <em>per se </em>reversible error.\u201d <em>Narog, </em>372 F.3d at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">On the other hand, a \u201cvariance occurs when the facts proved at trial deviate from the facts contained in the indictment but the essential elements of the offense are the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Keller, </em>916 F.2d at 634). The allegations in the indictment and proof at trial must correspond so that the defendant may present a defense and so that the defendant is protected against a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. <em>United States v. Reed, </em>887 F.2d 1398, 1403 (11th Cir.1989). Unlike a constructive amendment, a variance requires reversal only when the defendant can establish that his rights were substantially prejudiced. <em>Narog, </em>372 F.3d at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">The difference between the two concepts is illustrated in <em>Narog. </em>The defendants in <em>Narog </em>appealed their convictions of possession of pseudoephedrine with the intent to manufacture a controlled substance, where the indictment specifically charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>the defendants with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine. <em>Narog, </em>372 F.3d at 1244, 1246. The government put on evidence that showed that the defendants intended to manufacture methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>at 1246. In response to a jury question, the court instructed that the government only had to prove that the defendants intended to manufacture a controlled substance, not that they intended to manufacture methamphetamine specifically. <em>Id. </em>at 1246-47. We held that this was not a variance issue because \u201c[t]he facts proved at trial did not deviate from the facts alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1247. This was, however, a constructive amendment because the government had charged a subset of the statutory crime, methamphetamine, and the court\u2019s response to the jury question broadened the crimes charged in the indictment to include all controlled substances. <em>Id. </em>at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">\u201cThe elements of a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 are (1) an agreement among two or more persons to achieve an unlawful objective; (2) knowing and voluntary participation in the agreement; and (3) an overt act by a conspirator in furtherance of the agreement,\u201d <em>United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2003). Section 666(a)(1)(A) of Title 18 of the U.S.Code makes it illegal to steal from an organization receiving federal funds. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A). Section 641 <em>of </em>Title 18 of the U.S.Code makes it illegal to steal money from the United States. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>83 F.3d 371, 377 n. 6 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">First, because Darlene briefly mentions in her reply brief that a variance occurred, we will not consider this argument. <em>See id. </em>Second, Lance and Darlene have not shown that there was a constructive amendment of the indictment because the trial evidence showing that the SWP contracts were entered into after a prior ED\u2019s death was not inconsistent with the indictment\u2019s allegation that such contracts were entered into to hide the fact that Lance and Darlene had essentially contracted the work to Lance\u2019s company. Further, the evidence showed that Lance and Darlene violated the HUD conflict-of-interest provision listed in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">\u201cWhether an indictment sufficiently alleges a statutorily proscribed offense is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Steele, </em>178 F.3d 1230, 1233 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cAn indictment is sufficient if it: (1) presents the essential elements of the charged offense, (2) notifies the accused of the charges to be defended against, and (3) enables the accused to rely upon a judgment under the indictment as a bar against double jeopardy for any subsequent prosecution for the same offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233-34 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]f a general description of the offense is given then it is also necessary to allege facts and circumstances which will inform the defendant of the specific offense with which he is being charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1234 (quoting <em>Belt v. United States, </em>868 F.2d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.1989)). As noted above, \u201c[t]he elements of a conspiracy under \u00a7 371 are (1) an agreement among two or more persons to achieve an unlawful objective; (2) knowing and voluntary participation in the agreement; and (3) an overt act by a conspirator in furtherance of the agreement.\u201d <em>Hasson, </em>333 F.3d at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Darlene relies on <em>United States v. Fis-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number><em>chetti, </em>450 F.2d 34 (5th Cir.1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants in <em>Fischetti </em>were convicted on two counts of violating 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(b)(1), a labor relations provision, and one count of conspiracy to violate \u00a7 186. <em>Fischetti, </em>450 F.2d at 37. The former Fifth Circuit affirmed the conspiracy conviction and reversed the convictions on the substantive counts. <em>Id. </em>The defendants challenged the conspiracy count on appeal because it made reference only to the number of the statute the defendants were alleged to have conspired to violate. <em>Id. </em>at 40. The defendants argued that, because \u00a7 186 contained several prohibitions, they should have been apprised of exactly which provision of the statute they were charged with conspiring to violate. <em>Id. </em>Because defendants had not preserved the issue at trial, and it was not a jurisdictional defect, the former Fifth Circuit did not decide this issue. <em>Id. </em>The defendants also contended that the conspiracy count alleged the object of the conspiracy in the same language that was used in the substantive counts, and, because the latter were defective because of an omitted essential element of willfulness, the conspiracy count was likewise defective. <em>Id. </em>The former Fifth Circuit held that this argument was without merit, and stated that \u201c[i]n a conspiracy count the conspiracy is the gist of the offense,\u201d and that the object of the conspiracy does not need to be described in the same detail as would an indictment for the substantive offense itself. <em>Id. </em>\u201cEvery element of the substantive offense need not be alleged within the conspiracy count.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not err in refusing to dismiss the indictment because it correctly provided all of the essential elements of the conspiracy offense, and the indictment was not required to list the essential elements of the substantive offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Again, we review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction <em>de novo. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d at 1270. \u201cThe record is viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all questions of credibility in favor of the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will affirm the verdict \u201cif a reasonable juror could conclude that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">As noted above, the elements of a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 are (1) an agreement among two or more people to achieve an unlawful objective, knowing and voluntary participation in the agreement, and (3) an overt act by a conspirator in furtherance of the agreement. <em>Id. </em>In order to convict someone of fraudulently obtaining or misapplying funds from an organization receiving federal assistance, the government must prove: (1) the defendant converted property owned by, or under the care, custody, or control of an organization receiving federal assistance; (2) the defendant was an agent of such an organization; (3) that property was valued at $5,000 or more; and (4) the organization received in excess of $10,000 in federal funds during the 1-year period in which the defendant converted the property. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A); <em>see United States v. Tam-pas, </em>493 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2007)(holding that an embezzlement conviction under \u00a7 666 requires proof of conversion of property valued at greater than $5,000 from an organization that re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>ceives more than $10,000 in federal funds each year).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">We conclude from the record that the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Lance and Darlene were knowing participants in the conspiracy. The evidence showed that Lance (1) entered into an agreement with Darlene to steal from the THA, in violation of \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A); (2) received money from the checks written to SWP; and (3) urged the \u201cowner\u201d of SWP not to disclose the true nature of the SWP painting contracts. The evidence showed that Darlene (1) was the ED of the THA at the time of the charged conspiracy; (2) entered into an agreement with Lance to steal from the THA, in violation of \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A); and (3) as ED, requested that the THA Board honor its pre-existing contracts with SWP, despite knowing that doing so would violate the relevant conflict-of-interest provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">We review the district court\u2019s amount-of-loss determination for clear error. <em>United States v. Renick, </em>273 F.3d 1009, 1025 (11th Cir.2001). Section 2B1.1(b)(1) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a sentencing enhancement based on the amount of loss caused by the defendant\u2019s offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1). This section indicates that a defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased by 12 if the offense involved a loss amount of more than $200,000 but not more than $400,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(G). \u201cWhen calculating loss for sentencing purposes, the district court looks to the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d <em>United States v. Willis, </em>560 F.3d 1246, 1250 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Actual loss is \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense,\u201d and intended loss is \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(i) and (ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">The Guidelines do not require a precise determination of loss, and a court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information. <em>Renick, </em>273 F.3d at 1025. Upon challenge, however, the government bears the burden of supporting its loss calculation with \u201creliable and specific evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The district court should make a reasonable estimate of the loss amount, which cannot be mere speculation, but is not required to be completely precise. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>490 F.3d 1282, 1300 (11th Cir.2007). Loss can be estimated based on the fair market value of the stolen property, or, \u201cif the fair market value is impracticable to determine or inadequately measures the harm, the cost to the victim of replacing that property.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(C)(i)); <em>United States v. Cannon, </em>41 F.3d 1462, 1467 (11th Cir.l995)(affirming the district court\u2019s use of the contract value as the amount of loss in a conspiracy to defraud the government under previous \u00a7 2B1.1, which provided for a similar valuation of loss). We have recognized that \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon that evidence,\u201d and, thus, \u201cthe sentencing judge\u2019s determination of loss is entitled to appropriate deference.\u201d <em>Willis, </em>560 F.3d at 1251 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not clearly err by establishing the loss amount based on the gain to Lance and Darlene, measured by the face value of the contracts to SWP, where the loss was difficult to calculate in the absence of an honest and open bidding process.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a new trial or an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Quika-Carpio, </em>118 F.3d 719, 722 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cInvestigation of alleged juror misconduct is committed to the discretion of the district court and is reviewed only for an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Carpa, </em>271 F.3d 962, 967 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA court enjoys substantial discretion in choosing the investigative procedure to be used in checking for juror misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Because a \u201clitigant is entitled to a fair trial, but not a perfect one,\u201d courts should \u201cignore errors that do not affect the essential fairness of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 966 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Voir dire </em>protects \u201cthe right to a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it,\u201d and, thus, errors during <em>voir dire </em>can warrant a new trial. <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo invalidate the result of a long and burdensome trial because of a juror\u2019s mistaken, though honest, response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 966-67 (internal quotation marks omitted). A party challenging her trial must show, first, that a juror\u2019s answer to a material question on <em>voir dire </em>was dishonest, and second, that an honest answer would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. <em>Id. </em>at 967. There must be a showing of bias that would disqualify a juror, which can be shown by express admission or proof of specific facts showing such a close connection to the case at hand that bias is presumed. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA juror\u2019s dishonesty is a strong indication of bias.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">We conclude that the district court did not err by denying Lance and Darlene\u2019s motion for a new trial because there was no evidence that a juror committed misconduct during <em>voir dire </em>by denying that the indictment affected the juror\u2019s opinion of Lance and Darlene\u2019s innocence or guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the defendants\u2019 convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-5\">.
