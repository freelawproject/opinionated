James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cOnce it is established that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 984 n. 1. A district court abuses its discretion in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding if it fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making its determination. <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We may affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any basis supported by the record. <em>United States v. Acuna-Reyna, </em>677 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 342, 184 L.Ed.2d 204 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Parts A and C of Amendment 750 to the Guidelines may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). A proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and \u00a7 1B1.10 does not constitute a full resentencing, and the district court must maintain all original sentencing determinations, with the sole exception of applying the relevant amended guideline range. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). The policy statement for this type of sentence reduction provides that \u201c[i]n no event may the reduced term of imprisonment be less than the term of imprisonment the defendant has already served.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">District courts must engage in a two-part analysis when considering \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. First, a court must recalculate the applicable guideline range, using the amended guideline provisions. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Second, the court then must decide, in its discretion, whether to retain the existing sentence or impose a reduced sentence, within the new range, considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as public safety. <em>Id. </em>(citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. 1(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">At the latter stage, \u201ca district court commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997). In <em>Eggersdorf, </em>we found sufficient the district court\u2019s order stating that it had reviewed the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the government\u2019s response in opposition, the record, and was \u201cotherwise duly advised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322-23. We noted that the motion and response had discussed matters that were relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">While the two steps are required, the court is <em>not </em>required to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence at all, even if the defendant is eligible under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), because that sentence determination is discretionary. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe grant of authority to the district court to reduce a term of imprisonment [under 3582(c)(2) ] is unambiguously discretionary.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which was made retroactively applicable by Amendment 759, became effective on November 1, 2011. This amendment made permanent the temporary emergency Amendment 748, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend, <em>and </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. As a result of these amendments, under \u00a7 2D1.1(c), after incorporating the enhancements and reductions that Florence received, a total offense level of 34 is assigned in cases involving the marijuana equivalent of the 700 grams of powder cocaine and 700 grams of crack cocaine for which he was convicted \u2014 which falls into the category of at least 1,000 kilograms but less than 3,000 kilograms of marijuana. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (2011). This represents a decrease of two levels from 2008, when the court reduced Florence\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">The Federal Sentencing Guidelines provide enhanced punishment for defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>who, at the time of their sentencing for a violent felony, have two or more prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Defendants who fall within that category are considered \u201ccareer offenders,\u201d assigned a category VI criminal background, and are subject to offense-level enhancements determined by the severity of the current offense. <em>Id. </em>The current career offender base offense level for convictions carrying a statutory maximum of life imprisonment is 37. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), we held that defendants sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reductions because calculation of their guideline ranges did not involve the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28. In <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), which did not address career offenders, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded, in a plurality opinion, that when a district court accepted a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea based on the sentencing guidelines, the defendant was eligible to request a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if a retroactive amendment later lowered the applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2695. <em>See also Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 993, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (finding that, when a Supreme Court decision lacks a majority opinion, \u201cthe holding of the Court may be viewed as the position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds\u201d) (quoting <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 169 n. 15, 96 S.Ct.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">2909, 2923, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976)). We held in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012), that <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this Circuit because it was not overruled by <em>Freeman, </em>as that case did not address defendants whose total offense levels were calculated according to the career offender provision, so <em>Freeman </em>was not \u201cclearly on point\u201d with the issue in <em>Moore. See id. </em>at 1320-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">Even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Florence was eligible for relief here, we conclude that his appeal is meritless. Because the decision whether to reduce an eligible defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582 is entirely discretionary, and there is no indication that the court abused its discretion, Florence\u2019s challenge to the extent of the reduction that he received fails. First, the record shows that the court recalculated his base offense level, apparently relying on the probation officer and the government\u2019s representation that the correct guidelines provision was now the career offender<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provision because it yielded a higher base offense level than the amended \u00a7 2D1.1, then incorporated the relevant enhancements and reductions, to reach an amended offense level of 35. The court also properly concluded that Florence\u2019s amended guideline range was 292 to 365 months, which was lower than his pre-amendment range of 324 to 405 months, so he was eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).2011 Federal Sentencing Guidelines, Sentencing Table; <em>see Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">Second, even if a defendant is eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582, the court\u2019s decision regarding whether to reduce his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>sentence at all is entirely discretionary. <em>James, </em>548 F.3d at 984 n. 1; <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. There is no indication here that the court acted unreasonably or abused its discretion by failing to apply the proper legal standard or to follow the proper procedures. <em>Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42. Although the court did not expressly discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or public safety, it mentioned both parties\u2019 arguments and the probation office\u2019s supplemental memo, all of which discussed various \u00a7 3553(a) factors. This satisfies step two of the required \u00a7 3582(c)(2) analysis. <em>See Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"AOU\">While Florence argues that the court erred by not reducing his sentence to less than 292 months or tim\u00e9 served, the court could not have sentenced him to any less than 292 months, as that was the bottom of the amended guideline range. We have held that a court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended range unless the defendant has received the benefit of a substantial assistance motion filed by the government, which Florence did not. <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"AaW\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order refusing to further reduce Florence\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"A64\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-9\">. Florence designated only the denial of his 2011 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in his notice of appeal, so we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of any of his earlier \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 3.1(a), (c)(1)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-10\">. By failing to present argument regarding his motion for reconsideration in his initial brief, Florence has abandoned any challenge in that respect on appeal because a party seeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal must raise it \u201cplainly and prominently\u201d or the issue is deemed abandoned. <em>United States v. Jemigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1284 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b821-9\">. The government now contends that Florence was sentenced as a career offender and notes that career offenders are not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reductions. We find it unnecessary to address this contention, however, in light of our present disposition and the government's failure to cross-appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
