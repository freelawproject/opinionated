On March 16, 2012, Phillips moved the District Court pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36 to correct errors in the Government\u2019s enhancement information, filed pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, which notified him that, because he had two or more prior felony drug convictions, the mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) applied. If the court corrected the errors, he thought, it would have to vacate the life sentence he received and impose a new sentence. The court denied his motion, and he appeals its decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-19\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of Rule 36. <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>363 F.3d 1161, 1164 (11th Cir. 2004). Rule 36 provides that \u201cthe court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 36. However, Rule 36 \u201ccannot be used ... to make a substantive alteration to a criminal sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Pease, </em>331 F.3d 809, 816 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-20\">Because Phillips did not actually seek to correct a clerical error of the type within the scope of Rule 36, but instead was seeking to substantively modify his life sentence, the District Court correctly determined that he was not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
