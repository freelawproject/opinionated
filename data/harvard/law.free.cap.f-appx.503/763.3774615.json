Following his conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1) (A) (iii), and 846, and sentencing proceeding (resulting in a sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment), Smith filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, which was denied. He then filed the \u00a7 2241 petition at issue, asserting that he was actually innocent of the sentencing enhancement he received under \u00a7 \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 851, which subjected him to a 20-year mandatory minimum because of a prior felony drug conviction in a Florida state court. On appeal, Smith argues that he is entitled to relief under \u00a7 2241 through \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause based on <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>560 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010), because the government failed to prove that he had a prior conviction for a felony drug offense, as he received only probation for the Florida conviction. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003). Ordinarily, collateral challenges to the validity of a federal conviction and sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. Id. at 1365. When a federal prisoner previously has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must obtain prior authorization from a court of appeals to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h). Under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), however, a prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition if he establishes that the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1238 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation omitted). But the restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section inadequate or ineffective. <em>Id. </em>at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-15\">Rather, the savings clause applies to an otherwise barred claim only when (1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time that it otherwise should have been raised at trial, on appeal, or in a prior \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1244. The petitioner bears the burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A petitioner may not argue the merits of his claim until he has opened the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) applies to his claim. <em>See Wof-ford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">We recently addressed the issue of whether the savings clause permitted a federal prisoner to challenge his sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition when the \u00a7 2255(h) bar against successive \u00a7 2255 motions prevented him from raising that sentencing claim. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc) (\u201cGilbert II </em>\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012). We held that the savings clause \u201cdoes not authorize a federal prisoner to bring in a \u00a7 2241 petition a claim, which would otherwise be barred by \u00a7 2255(h), that the sentencing guidelines were misapplied in a way that resulted in a longer sentence not exceeding the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323. However, we specifically declined to address whether the savings clause would authorize a federal prisoner to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition if his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">We also noted in <em>Gilbert II </em>that certain language in <em>Wofford </em>was merely dicta because all of Wofford\u2019s claims were sentencing claims, none of which rested upon a circuit law-busting, retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1319 (referring to language in <em>Wofford </em>indicating that \u201cthe savings clause would permit a prisoner to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition claiming that a retroactively applicable, circuit law-busting decision of the Supreme Court established that he had been convicted of a nonexistent crime\u201d). Moreover, the actual holding of <em>Wofford </em>was that the savings clause does not cover sentence claims that could have been raised in earlier proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">In <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether a removable lawful permanent resident was eligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a), which turned on whether he had been convicted of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2580. The petitioner in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>had been convicted in state court for simple possession of Xanax and sentenced to 10 days in jail. <em>Id. </em>at 2580, 2583. He previously had been convicted for marijuana possession. <em>Id. </em>at 2580. The government initiated removal proceedings, and the immigration judge deemed him ineligible for cancellation of removal on aggravated-felony grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 2583. The BIA and the Fifth Circuit both affirmed, with the latter concluding that the conduct proscribed by his Xanax offense was punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d), which in turn qualified the conviction as an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>at 2583-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">The Supreme Court rejected the Fifth Circuit\u2019s use of a \u201chypothetical approach\u201d that rendered a state conviction an aggravated felony conviction wherever the conduct could possibly have received felony treatment under federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 2586. The Court held that second or subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>vated felonies under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) when, as in the petitioner\u2019s case, the state conviction was not based on the fact of a prior conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 2580. In so holding, the Court emphasized, in relevant part, the importance of the mandatory notice and process requirements contained in \u00a7 851. <em>Id. </em>at 2587-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Here, Smith challenges the validity of his federal sentence, and, thus, \u00a7 2255 was the proper vehicle for asserting his claim. <em>See Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. But Smith previously had filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, which was denied on the merits. Thus, he could not circumvent the limitation on filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion unless he could show that the remedy available under that statute was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">However, the statutory maximum sentence of imprisonment for a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(a)(1) and sentenced under \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) is life imprisonment, regardless of any aggravating sentencing factors. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Having received a sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, Smith was not sentenced above the statutory maximum. Because Smith\u2019s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, his attempt to challenge his sentence through \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause is foreclosed. <em>See Gilbert II, </em>640 F.3d at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-8\">.
