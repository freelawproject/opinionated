Thompson argues that \u00a7 3582(c)(2), an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that reduced the base offense levels for certain crack-cocaine crimes, gives the district court the authority to reduce his sentence because he was convicted of a crack-cocaine offense. Because Thompson was subject to a mandatory-minimum sentence and is ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a sentence reduction under this provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1218 n. 1 (11th Cir.2009). We review the district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence based upon \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300,1303 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Title 18, section 3582 of the United States Code provides that a district court may reduce the sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2002). However, \u201c[t]he law is clear that a sentencing court lacks jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, even when an amendment would lower the defendant\u2019s otherwise-applicable Guidelines sentencing range, when the defendant was sentenced on the basis of a mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1078 (11th Cir.2010). We have explained that this \u201cmakes sense\u201d because \u201can amendment that alters the initial calculation of a guidelines range is not to be applied in a case where the difference in the initial calculation would have made no difference because a mandatory minimum would have trumped the initial calculation and dictated the final guidelines range anyway.\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012). Here, as indicated in the presentence report, Thompson was subject to a mandatory-minimum sentence. As a result, Thompson is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582 sentence reduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">For this reason, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Thompson\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-18\">. The government argues that Thompson's \u00a7 3582(c)(2) appeal is untimely because his notice of appeal was not filed within fourteen days of the district court's denial of his motion for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that the rules governing criminal cases apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). Although the fourteen-day deadline to file a notice of appeal is not jurisdictional, these \"deadlines provide rules for processing claims that assure relief to a party properly raising them.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>562 F.3d 1309, 1311-13 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court denied Thompson\u2019s motion on March 7, 2012 and Thompson waited until July 10, 2012 to file his notice of appeal. While we reject Thompson\u2019s arguments on the merits, we also agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>government that Thompson\u2019s appeal is untimely under Rule 4(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-7\">. Thompson cites to <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. --, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), in arguing that the district court was authorized to reduce his sentence. In <em>Freeman, </em>a plurality of the Supreme Court held that a defendant who entered a plea agreement with an agreed-upon sentence or sentencing range pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) was eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 2695. However, Thompson did not enter into such an agreement. Instead, his plea agreement indicated \"that the sentence to be imposed is left solely to the discretion of the District Court.\u201d Thus, the holding of <em>Freeman </em>does not apply to Thompson.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
