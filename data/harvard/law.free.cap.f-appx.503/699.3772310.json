(\u201cAustal\u201d), an Australian shipbuilding company, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its 22 motions for attorneys\u2019 fees and sanctions against the Plaintiffs-Appel-lees and their counsel. Austal filed its motions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. After review, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the district court, and affirm the denial of Aus-tal\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b722-19\">This appeal arises out of a lawsuit filed by 23 African-American employees and former employees (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) against the Defendant Austal. Plaintiffs alleged various claims against Austal under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, including claims of racial discrimination, hostile work environment, retalia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>tion, and disparate impact, and at one point Plaintiffs sought to proceed as a class and sought class certification. Generally, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims concerned (1) Aus-tal\u2019s hiring, promotion, and compensation procedures, (2) racially hostile working conditions, and (3) unequal terms and conditions of employment. Some of the claims were voluntarily dismissed or abandoned by Plaintiffs. Some claims were decided in Austal\u2019s favor at the summary judgment stage. The remaining claims were decided by a jury in three separate trials, ending with verdicts in Austal\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">After the conclusion of the final trial, the district court entered judgment in Defendant Austal\u2019s favor as to all of the claims brought by all Plaintiffs. Thereafter, Aus-tal filed 22 separate motions for attorneys\u2019 fees and sanctions against Plaintiffs and their counsel, arguing that each of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims was frivolous and that Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys knowingly pursued these claims after learning of their frivolity.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In a single order, the district court denied all of Defendant Austal\u2019s motions for attorneys\u2019 fees and sanctions. Turning first to the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees, the district court determined that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not wholly groundless. Specifically, the district court, \u201cwith the benefit of almost four (4) weeks of trial testimony spanning three (3) trials ..., hundreds of pages of briefing and thousands of pages of deposition testimony,\u201d found that Plaintiffs\u2019 class action and disparate impact claims were not frivolous. The district court noted that \u201cthere was substantial testimony and other evidence\u201d that: (1) \u201cAfrican-Americans as a whole endured a significant amount of racial hostility from co-employees and supervisors, particularly in Austal\u2019s initial years in Mobile\u201d; and (2) \u201cAustal lacked structure in determining pay and promotions for all of its employees, and that this lack of structure most negatively affected the African-American employees.\u201d The district court observed that \u201cthe evidence presented at trial by Austal regarding its effort in <em>recent </em>years to address racial issues was Austal\u2019s strongest defense to the charges!\u201d The district court concluded that \u201c[t]he fact that these claims were not pursued after extensive discovery and investigation does not mean that they were initially groundless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The district court also stated that, as to the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims dismissed at the summary judgment stage, it had reviewed the claims and each summary judgment order and determined that \u201cthe evidence that was found not to support the claims on summary judgment was not so inadequate as to support a finding of frivolousness.\u201d As to the claims that Plaintiffs elected not to pursue after the summary judgment phase, the district court determined that it had already found many of these claims to be non-frivolous when it denied summary judgment on them. Additionally, the district court determined that Austal failed to carry its burden of showing that any of the remaining claims were frivolous. The district court concluded by stating that \u201cthis case is simply not an appropriate case to award attorneys\u2019 fees ... to Austal based on frivolity. While Austal was ultimately successful with regard to all of the [Pjlain-tiffs\u2019 claims, it was not because Austal had an airtight defense with settled law and facts securely on its side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Addressing the issue of sanctions, the district court stated that the evidence did not support an initial finding under \u00a7 1927 of unreasonable or vexatious conduct by Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. As to Rule 11, the district court found that there was no basis to conclude that counsel filed any of the claims without substantial justification or that the claims were objectively frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Accordingly, the district court denied all 22 of Austal\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Austal now appeals the denial of its 22 motions for attorneys\u2019 fees and sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">A. Austal\u2019s Motions for Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">On appeal, Austal argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motions for attorneys\u2019 fees because all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were frivolous. Austal asserts that Plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary dismissal of many of their claims is further evidence that the claims were frivolous. Austal also contends that the district court made clearly erroneous findings of fact as to the disparate impact claims. Additionally, Austal argues that the district court did not enter an order that allows for meaningful appellate review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, the prevailing party in an action brought under \u00a7 1981 and other civil rights statutes \u201cmay\u201d recover a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). Similarly, Title VII provides that the district court, \u201cin its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d <em>Myers v. Cent. Fla. Invs., Inc., </em>592 F.3d 1201,1225 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">For a defendant to obtain an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 1988 or \u00a7 2000e-5(k), the defendant must show that a plaintiffs claim \u201cwas frivolous, unreasonable, ... groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 15, 101 S.Ct. 173, 178-79, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980) (quoting <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 422, 98 S.Ct. 694, 701, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted)). It is important that courts avoid concluding that an action was unreasonable or without foundation simply because the plaintiff did not ultimately prevail, and frivolity determinations must be made on a case-by-case basis. <em>Head v. Medford, </em>62 F.3d 351, 355 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cWhere plaintiffs introduced evidence sufficient to support their claim[s], findings of frivolity generally do not stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">In making a determination on frivolity, courts also should consider: (1) whether the plaintiffs established a prima facie case; (2) whether the defendants offered to settle; and (3) whether the claims were dismissed prior to trial or a trial was held on the merits. <em>Id. </em>Allegations that prove legally insufficient to require a trial are not per se groundless or without foundation. <em>Hughes, 449 U.S. </em>at 15-16, 101 S.Ct. at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">Given the totality of the circumstances and the evidence in the record, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not frivolous and denying Aus-tal\u2019s motions for attorneys\u2019 fees. Of the 23 Plaintiffs, 14 survived summary judgment with at least one claim remaining and proceeded to trial. Further, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of racial discrimination related to their employment with Austal were not wholly groundless, even though some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>those allegations were legally insufficient to require a trial. <em>See Hughes, </em>449 U.S. at 15-16, 101 S.Ct. at 179. And Austal\u2019s arguments regarding the district court\u2019s factual findings and the sufficiency of the district court\u2019s order are not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">B. Austal\u2019s Motions for Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">On appeal, Austal further argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motions for sanctions against Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel because all of the claims were based entirely on speculation, which counsel could have discovered with a reasonable investigation. Austal also contends that Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the proceedings by pursuing the class action and disparate impact claims, and by filing multiple motions to extend the deadline to file an expert report.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Section 1927 provides that an attorney who unreasonably and vexatiously multiplies the proceedings in any case may be required by the court to pay for excess costs incurred because of such conduct. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. Thus, this Court has stated that an award of sanctions under \u00a7 1927 requires three elements: (1) the attorney must engage in unreasonable and vexatious conduct; (2) that conduct must multiply the proceedings; and (8) the dollar amount of the sanction must not exceed the costs incurred by such conduct. <em>Peterson v. BMI Refractories, </em>124 F.Bd 1386, 1396 (11th Cir.1997). An attorney \u201cunreasonably and vexatiously\u201d multiplies proceedings \u201conly when the attorney\u2019s conduct is so egregious that it is tantamount to bad faith.\u201d <em>Amlong &amp; Amlong, PA. v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1230, 1239 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). The attorney must knowingly or recklessly pursue a frivolous claim or engage in litigation tactics that needlessly obstruct the litigation of a non-frivolous claim to warrant sanctions under \u00a7 1927. <em>Id. </em>at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">Rule 11 sanctions are properly assessed when a party files a pleading: (1) \u201cthat has no reasonable factual basis\u201d; (2) \u201cthat is based on a legal theory that has no reasonable chance of success and that cannot be advanced as a reasonable argument to change existing law\u201d; or (3) \u201cin bad faith for an improper purpose.\u201d <em>Massengale v. Ray, </em>267 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). A court conducts a two-step inquiry when evaluating a motion for Rule 11 sanctions: (1) determining whether the non-moving party\u2019s claims are objectively frivolous; and (2) determining whether counsel should have been aware that they were frivolous. <em>Jones v. Int\u2019l Riding Helmets, Ltd., </em>49 F.3d 692, 695 (11th Cir.1995). In deciding whether the claims are objectively frivolous, the court must \u201cdetermine whether a reasonable attorney in like circumstances could believe his actions were factually and legally justified.\u201d <em>Kaplan v. DaimlerChrysler, AG., </em>331 F.3d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">As discussed above, the totality of the evidence does not support a conclusion that any of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were objectively frivolous. <em>See Amlong, </em>500 F.3d at 1242; <em>Kaplan, </em>331 F.3d at 1255. Further, there is no evidence that Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel pursued any of the claims in bad faith. <em>See Amlong, </em>500 F.3d at 1239. Plaintiffs\u2019 delay in submitting the expert report that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Austal complains about was due, in part, to Austal\u2019s failure to produce necessary evidence (pay data for Austal\u2019s employees, which Plaintiffs expert needed for purposes of statistical analysis). The district court ordered Austal to turn over the requested evidence and granted Plaintiffs extensions of the time in which to file the report. Because the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not frivolous, the district court did not commit a clear error in judgment in denying Austal\u2019s motions for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Austal\u2019s motions for attorneys\u2019 fees and sanctions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-10\">.
