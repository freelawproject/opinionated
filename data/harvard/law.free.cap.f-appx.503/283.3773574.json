Contesting that sentence, Mora contends: the district court\u2019s imposing enhancements under Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 3Bl.l(b) (supervisory role) and 3C1.1 (obstructing justice) was erroneous; the evidence of his previous marijuana trafficking was insufficient to support an increase to his base-offense level; and the duration of his imprisonment violates his Eighth Amendment right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-16\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-17\">Regarding the supervisory-role enhancement of his sentence under Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), Mora contends the evidence was insufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding he was a leader or organizer. A defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Rose, </em>449 F.3d 627, 633 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">Mora presented no evidence rebutting the presentence investigation report (PSR), which provided that Mora recruited, hired, transported, and paid three co-defendants for their participation in the offense. The district court was entitled to adopt those facts without further inquiry. <em>United States v. Ollison, </em>555 F.3d 152, 164 (5th Cir.2009). Because the district court\u2019s finding Mora was a leader or organizer is \u201cplausible in [the] light of the record read as a whole\u201d, its finding him eligible for an enhancement under Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>line \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) was not clear error. <em>Rose, </em>449 F.3d at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"AUP_\">Regarding the obstruction-of-justice enhancement of his sentence under Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1, Mora contends his recorded prison telephone conversations with his common-law wife were inadmissible as privileged marital communications and because he was not warned in Spanish they would be monitored and recorded. The admission of such evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>145 F.3d 345, 355 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"AB3\">Having heard Special Agent Flores testify at the sentencing hearing that 80 percent of the recordings contained warnings in Spanish that conversations were monitored, the district court found the privilege waived. In any event, Mora and his wife discussed plans to lie to federal agents and suborn a codefendant\u2019s perjury. Conversations between husband and wife, which relate to the joint commission of crime, are not protected by the marital-communications privilege. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the court\u2019s admitting the conversations was not an abuse of discretion, <em>id., </em>and its finding Mora eligible for an enhancement under Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1 was not clear error. <em>Rose, </em>449 F.3d at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"AKE\">Regarding his suffieieney-of-the-ev-idence challenge to the contraband attributable to him for purposes of calculating his base-offense level, Mora asserts the district court\u2019s findings were speculative. Drug quantities attributable to a defendant are findings of fact reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">A sentencing judge may consider acts \u201cthat [are] part of the same course of conduct ... as the offense of conviction\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2); <em>United States v. Wall, </em>180 F.3d 641, 644 (5th Cir.1999). Again, the court based its findings on the PSR, which Mora did not rebut. Additionally, Agent Flores and co-defendant Mendez-Flores testified that Mora was involved in at least ten prior marijuana loads, totaling approximately 7,634 kilograms. These findings were \u201cplausible in [the] light of the record\u201d. <em>Rose, </em>449 F.3d at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"Av4\">Regarding his Eighth Amendment claim, Mora contends the 262-month sentence is cruel and unusual because it is disproportionate to the offense, and because he is 22-years\u2019 old with no prior criminal convictions. Because he did not raise this claim in district court, review is only for plain error. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"A2A\">Under plain-error review, Mora must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>This he cannot do. The Eighth Amendment proscribes a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the offense. <em>McGruder v. Puckett, </em>954 F.2d 313, 315 (5th Cir.1992). Mora\u2019s sentence was at the bottom of the advisory Guidelines sentencing range, and the Guidelines are a \u201cconvincing objective indicator of proportionality\u201d. <em>United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1133-34 (5th Cir.1993) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A_s\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
