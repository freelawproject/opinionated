Stringer\u2019s amended complaint alleged constitutional violations, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as well as a variety of state law claims. The magistrate judge recommended dismissal of Stringer\u2019s complaint. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Stringer\u2019s case without prejudice. On appeal, Stringer argues the magistrate judge (1) acted beyond her authority in dismissing his complaint and ruling on his motions, and (2) should have recused herself from his case. Stringer also contends the district court (3) erred in dismissing his complaint for frivolity and failure to state a claim, and (4) abused its discretion in denying his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion to amend or alter the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">Stringer argues the magistrate judge acted <em>ultra vires </em>in dismissing his complaint and in ruling on his motions. However, the magistrate judge simply issued a recommendation that the district court dispose of the case, an action explicitly permitted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). Because the magistrate judge acted within the scope of her authority under, she was entitled to issue the recommendation without Stringer\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-18\">Stringer next claims the magistrate judge should have recused herself from his case because she (1) is from a different district from where his original complaint was filed, (2) cited cases that were irrelevant and/or nonexistent, (3) harassed him by making him fill out an amended complaint on a form intended for prisoners, and (4) was biased against him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>We review the denial of a motion for recusal for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Berger, </em>375 F.3d 1228, 1227 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cTo warrant recusal under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 144, the moving party must allege facts that would convince a reasonable person that bias actually exists.\u201d <em>Christo v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1333 (11th Cir. 2000). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), \u201cthe standard is whether an objective, fully informed lay observer would entertain significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Christo, </em>223 F.3d at 1333. Judicial rulings standing alone rarely constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion. <em>Draper v. Reynolds, </em>369 F.3d 1270, 1279 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Under either \u00a7 144 or \u00a7 455, Stringer must allege facts from which a reasonable person could conclude the magistrate judge\u2019s impartiality could be questioned, or that show a particular ground for recusal actually exists. <em>See Christo, </em>223 F.3d at 1333. Stringer has not included facts that meet either requirement. The record indicates the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of Stringer\u2019s complaint because she was fulfilling her statutory obligation to issue appropriate judicial rulings. <em>Draper, </em>369 F.3d at 1279. Accordingly, the magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion by declining to recuse herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Stringer argues the facts asserted in his pleadings were sufficient to maintain his causes of action. We disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), and view the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). <em>Pro se </em>pleadings are construed liberally. <em>Hughes, </em>350 F.3d at 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">For proceedings <em>informa pauperis, </em>\u201cthe court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that the action or appeal fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is governed by the same standard as a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). Dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate if the facts as pleaded fail to state a claim for relief that is \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (involving Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal). The \u201cplaintiffs obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of his \u2018entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Stringer is unable to state a \u00a7 1983 claim against any defendant. The Doe defendants and the dive shop manager are non-state actors who did not commit any acts under color of state law. <em>See Focus on the Family v. Pinellas Suncoast Transit Auth., </em>344 F.3d 1263, 1277 (11th Cir. 2003). Although it is unclear whether the off-duty deputy was acting under color of state law when he watched Stringer pack his belongings, the off-duty deputy did not deprive Stringer of any federal rights. <em>See, e.g., Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). Stringer also failed to state claims against the sher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>iff or deputy sheriff because Stringer did not have a substantive due process right to an internal investigation by the Sheriffs Department or law enforcement. <em>See Vin-yard v. Wilson, </em>311 F.3d 1340, 1356 (11th Cir.2002) (arrestee had no constitutional right to internal investigation of excessive force claim). Finally, Stringer\u2019s claim of failure to train or supervise against the sheriff fails because he was unable to state a constitutional claim against any non-supervisory state actor. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Stringer\u2019s claims pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Finally, Stringer argues the district court erred in denying his motion to amend or alter the judgment of dismissal. Stringer\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion recites the same arguments that were previously raised and rejected. Because the rule may not be used \u201cto relitigate old matters,\u201d the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Stringer\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion. <em>See Michael Linet, Inc. v. Vill. of Wellington, Fla., </em>408 F.3d 757, 763 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-13\">. Stringer also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the magistrate judge is under the control of organized crime and is conspiring with others to frame him for criminal perjury. We decline to address this argument. <em>See Baumann v. Savers Fed. </em>Sav. <em>&amp; Loan Assn, </em>934 F.2d 1506, 1510 (11th Cir. 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b912-8\">. Because Stringer's complaint fails to state a claim for relief against any defendant, it was not an abuse of discretion to dismiss his complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). <em>See Carroll v. Gross, </em>984 F.2d 392, 393 (11th Cir. 1993) (finding that a case is frivolous when it appears that the plaintiff has little to no chance of success).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b913-9\">. Because the district court properly dismissed Stringer's federal claims, it did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any remaining state law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Raney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>370 F.3d 1086, 1089 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
