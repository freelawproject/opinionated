He also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-21\">Omar makes only conclusional arguments that his removal was barred by the principle of res judicata and that he was prejudiced during his removal proceedings because documentary evidence he submitted in support of his claims was either not submitted to the IJ or not considered by the IJ. Omar does not address the BIA\u2019s reasons for rejecting his res judicata argument or its finding that he had a full and fair opportunity to present his claims and that the immigration proceedings were not unfair. In addition, he fails to address the BIA\u2019s findings with respect to his requests for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-22\">Omar\u2019s petitions for review do not provide \u201ceven the slightest identification of any error\u201d in the BIA\u2019s legal analyses or the application of the analyses to his claims. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Issues not raised and conclusional and inadequately briefed arguments are waived. <em>Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833; <em>Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, Omar\u2019s petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
