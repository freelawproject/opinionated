Leifert, Social Security Administration Office of the Regional Chief Counsel-Region VII, Kansas City, Mo, Peter G. Fisher, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Tallahassee, FL, Pamela C. Marsh, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Gainesville, FL, Pamela Adele Moine, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Pensacola, FL, for Defendant-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b715-11\">Before TJOFLAT, JORDAN and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b715-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">The crux of this appeal is whether the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), in denying appellant Freeman W. Stone\u2019s application for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405,1382, erred by relying on the Medical Vocational Guidelines (\u201cGrids\u201d) to determine whether appellant was disabled, rather than the testimony of a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d). We find no error, and because substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s determination that appellant was not disabled at any time through the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">In a social security case, we review the agency\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). Under this standard, \u201c[i]f the [agency]\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence we must affirm, even if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">The Social Security regulations establish a five-step, \u201csequential\u201d process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(1). Throughout the process, the burden is on the claimant to introduce evidence in support of his application for benefits. <em>Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003). If an ALJ finds a claimant disabled or not disabled at any given step, the ALJ does not go on to the next step. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4). At the first step, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(i), (b). At the second step, the ALJ must determine whether the impairment or combination of impairments for which the claimant allegedly suffers is \u201csevere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(ii), (c). At the third step, the ALJ must decide whether the claimant\u2019s severe impairments meet or medically equal a listed impairment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iii), (d). The ALJ must then determine, at step four, whether the claimant has the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform his past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iv), (e)-(f). \u201c[RFC] is an assessment ... of a claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ant\u2019s remaining ability to do work despite his impairments.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436,1440 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">At step five, once a claimant proves that he can no longer perform his past relevant work, \u201cthe burden shifts to the Commissioner to show the existence of other jobs in the national economy which, given the claimant\u2019s impairments, the claimant can perform.\u201d <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). One way for the Commissioner to carry this burden is through an application of the Grids. <em>Id. </em>at 1229; <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2. The Grids provide an algorithm to determine a claimant\u2019s ability to engage in employment other than their past work based on factors such as a person\u2019s age, education, previous employment, and maximum physical capabilities. <em>Gibson v. Heckler, </em>762 F.2d 1516, 1520 (11th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Exclusive reliance on the Grids is not appropriate when the \u201cclaimant is unable to perform a full range of work at a given residual functional level <em>or </em>when a claimant has non-exertional impairments that significantly limit basic work skills.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1242 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also Walker v. Bowen, </em>826 F.2d 996,1002-1003 (11th Cir.1987). Each variable on the appropriate Grid must \u201caccurately [describe] the claimant\u2019s situation.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>826 F.2d at 1003. If either of the above conditions exists, an ALJ is required to consult a VE. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1242. A medical condition that can reasonably be remedied by medication \u201cis not disabling.\u201d <em>Dawkins v. Bowen, 848 </em>F.2d 1211, 1213 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">When looking specifically at non-exer-tional limitations, an ALJ \u201cneed only determine whether [the] nonexertional impairments significantly limit [basic] work skills,\u201d which includes a wide range of work at a given work level. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1243. If the <em>ALJ </em>determines that nonexertional limitations do not significantly limit basic work skills at the assigned work level, the ALJ may rely on the Grids to determine if a claimant is disabled; otherwise, the ALJ must consult a VE. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Appellant challenges the ALJ\u2019s reliance, at step five, on the Grids to determine that he was not disabled. The ALJ considered the medical evidence on appellant\u2019s non-exertional limitations. He ultimately determined that appellant could perform basic work activities in a regular work setting, \u201cwithout significant interference from his non-exertional limitations.\u201d The ALJ also found that his non-exertional limitations were manageable with conservative medical care and medications. These finding were supported by medical testimony and other evidence. Accordingly, the ALJ was justified in relying solely on the Grids.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
