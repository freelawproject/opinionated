The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that he committed each of those offenses after he was hired by one Kenneth Daughton to kill the victim. Appellant does not argue to the contrary. He does contend, however, that he is entitled to a new trial and presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">I. Did the trial court err in admitting into evidence as part of Appellant\u2019s statement to police a)his invocation of the right to counsel and b) the opinion of an interrogating officer that Appellant was not telling the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">II. Did the trial court err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to strike a non-responsive answer to defense counsel\u2019s question, resulting in improper evidence that an alleged co-conspirator of Appellant had entered a plea of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-13\">III. Did the trial court erroneously permit improper prosecutorial closing argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-14\">IY. Did the trial court err in permitting the State to cross-examine Appellant concerning his hiring of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>counsel and information that he imparted or chose not to impart to counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">V. Did the trial court err in admitting into evidence certain aspects of the police investigation relating to William Haynes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">VI. Did the trial court err in refusing to compel the State to turn over statements of Detective Cole for the purposes of cross-examination at the hearing upon Appellant\u2019s motions to suppress evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">VII. Did the trial court err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">We answer \u201cyes\u201d to questions I, II, IV, and V, and must therefore reverse the judgments of the circuit court. We shall also address the remaining issues that are certain to arise when this case is tried again.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">On October 29, 1994, Michael Corey Allendorf was shot and killed outside his residence in Joppa, Maryland. On March 6, 1996, appellant was charged with Allendorfs murder. Kenneth Daughton, who had entered a guilty plea for his role in the murder, testified that he hired appellant and William Hynes to kill Allendorf for Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Daughton\u2019s credibility was attacked by several defense witnesses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Daughton knew many details surrounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the shooting, the defense argued that he may have been the shooter. Appellant testified that, although he did agree at one point to \u201cbeat (Allendorf) up,\u201d he played no role in the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Appellant argues that the circuit court erred when it admitted the following portion of a February 1, 1996 tape recorded statement he gave to the investigating officers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">[APPELLANT]: I never talked to [Daughton] about beating up the guy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">[OFFICER COLE]: Um you know we have too much information for you to sit here and tell us that you don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about. OK? Um and we\u2019re talking about something serious, OK. This isn\u2019t play time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiz\">[APPELLANT]: This is obviously serious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoV\">[OFFICER COLE]: This is obviously serious. Um I can see exactly what happened here.... Uhl think you knew about, you know, from what I\u2019m hearing you\u2019re the type of guy if somebody needs a hand you\u2019re glad to lend it. And uh I think that\u2019s what happened basically, is Daughton\u2019s [sic] were having a problem and they came to you and I think you have some, you know, you have loyalty to your friends and I think you got uh hooked into something you didn\u2019t want to be.... And um it, and it\u2019s up to you. You can sit and, you know, we, you can sit here and tell us you don\u2019t know anything about it and we know that\u2019s not true. Um we know some of the people. And it\u2019s not just what[Daughton] told us. We\u2019ve talked to [Gill] ... and we have some other records, you know, we have access to a lot of records that can back up some of the information that [Daughton] and [Gill] were telling us and uh so it\u2019s not just</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap9\">[APPELLANT]: For example?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">[OFFICER KECK]: Before [Daughton] and [Gill] were arrested there, there was a wire tap placed on [Gill\u2019s] phone and uh [Daughton\u2019s] phone</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>[OFFICER COLE]: Well, the point, yeah, the whole in this is that we\u2019ve been working on this year and a half and it\u2019s too long for you to sit here and tell us we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about, cause we know that\u2019s not true____ You can help us, you can. If not, then, you know, that\u2019s up to you. But don\u2019tsit here and tell us you don\u2019t know anything about it cause we know that\u2019s not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">[OFFICER KECK]: You know, you can set [sic] there all you want and deny you have any knowledge of what\u2019s going on, but we know different. This is your opportunity, your saving grace at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">[APPELLANT]: I think my best bet right now is from here on out end this conversation. Speak to a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Appellant\u2019s trial counsel interposed a timely objection to the introduction of this evidence. The circuit court overruled that objection, but did instruct the jurors that they should draw no inference of guilt from appellant\u2019s invocation of his right to counsel. We are persuaded that there are two reasons why the evidence at issue should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">It is well settled that evidence of an accused\u2019s intent to obtain the advice of counsel is inadmissible under Maryland Rule 5-401. In <em>Waddell v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 54, 582 A.2d 260 (1990), this Court reversed a first degree murder conviction because the jury received evidence of appellant\u2019s intent to obtain counsel. We rejected the State\u2019s argument that the jury would be unlikely to equate a request for counsel with evidence of guilt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">A juror, even without the prosecutor\u2019s suggestive comments, easily might infer from the witness\u2019s testimony that appellant planned to obtain counsel because he had done something for which he needed a lawyer to defend him. ... As an evidentiary matter, the testimony was irrelevant and should not have been admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 65, 582 A.2d 260, <em>citing Hunter v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 679, 690-691, 573 A.2d 85 (1990). In <em>Hunter, </em>this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>reversed a conviction for negligent homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated because the jury received evidence that appellant contacted his attorney immediately following the fatal accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">To draw an inference of consciousness of guilt from the seeking of such advice, then, is both illogical and unwarranted; the fact to be inferred \u2014 the consciousness of guilt \u2014 is not made more probable (or less probable) from the mere seeking of legal advice or representation,and so evidence of the predicate fact is simply irrelevant. On pure evidentiary grounds, it is inadmissable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 691, 573 A.2d 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">It is also well settled that the investigating officers\u2019 opinions on the truthfulness of an accused\u2019s statement are inadmissible under Maryland Rule 5-401. In <em>Crawford v. </em>State, 285 Md. 431, 404 A.2d 244 (1979), the Court of Appeals reversed a first degree murder conviction because the jury heard evidence of a tape recorded interrogation during which police officers expressed disbelief in the defendant\u2019s story. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">The credibility of the accused was all important in the determination by the jury of the validity of her claim throughout the interrogations that she killed in self-defense. There is no doubt that the challenged comments of the police which were heard by the jury, whether in the form of questions, assertions of disbelief, ... tended to seriously prejudice the defense. We think they did so improperly in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 451, 404 A.2d 244. <em>See also Snyder v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 533, 554, 657 A.2d 342 (1995) in which this Court reversed a murder conviction because the jurors heard an investigating officer\u2019s testimony that \u201cclearly brought out the obvious disbelief of the police in [appellant\u2019s] version of what happened.\u201d On remand, the above quoted portion of appellant\u2019s statement must not be presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The following transpired during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Kenneth Daughton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But during the wiretap neither you, nor [Gill] to you, mentioned the name Benjamin Casey; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">[DAUGHTON]: Because she probably forgot it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APA\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: She probably forgot it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG8\">[DAUGHTON]: She did make the statement when she made her plea that his name came up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Move that be stricken, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, he asked the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHI\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No. I didn\u2019t ask that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">We are persuaded that defense counsel\u2019s motion should have been granted. The State is not entitled to present evidence of an alleged co-conspirator\u2019s guilty plea. <em>Clemmons v. State, </em>352 Md. 49, 57-58, 720 A.2d 1170 (1998). \u2018When a factfinder is shown that the conspirator, with whom an accused has been charged with having conspired, has pled guilty, there is more than a \u2018reasonable possibility that the evidence ... may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carr v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 209, 211, 437 A.2d 238 (1981). On remand, unless Luana Gill\u2019s plea agreement becomes relevant to her credibility as a witness, the circuit court must not admit evidence of that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Appellant next argues that the circuit court erred when it allowed the prosecutor to express a personal opinion about Daughton\u2019s credibility. The following transpired during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-13\">[STATE]: I do know that [Daughton] is not lying. So, it\u2019s only going\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection to the State\u2019s opinion about any witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">[THE COURT]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">A prosecutor \u201chas a right to state his views as to what the evidence shows.\u201d <em>Riggins v. State, </em>125 Md. 165, 174, 93 A. 437 (1915). The prosecutor must, however, make it clear that this assertion is based on the evidence presented to the jury. <em>Williams v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 255, 266, 437 A.2d 665 (1981). We trust that on remand the circuit court shall prohibit any \u201cpersonal belief\u2019 argument that implies knowledge of Daughton\u2019s credibility based on evidence other than that presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">After appellant and Hynes were arrested, they were confined in different cell blocks at the Harford County Detention Center. While incarcerated, appellant wrote a letter to Kent Brewer, who was confined in the cell block to which Hynes had been assigned. This letter included the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgF\"><em>Listen, this is very important. Tell Bill, that apparently someone said that we told them, that we committed the crime. He probably will come up with same </em>[sic] <em>thought as me. Tell him, not to talk to anybody, including the cops or his attorney about it. I am going to bring the name and the situation up to my attorney when it is appropriate. The States Attorney is cooperating well with my lawyer, so I probably have more information than he does.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Instead of performing as requested, Brewer turned the letter over to Daughton, who then turned it over to the State. No objection was interposed when the letter was introduced into evidence during the State\u2019s case-in-chief. The following transpired during appellant\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">Q.... Why did you write that (letter)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-11\">A. Well, you have stated to me that there was a witness, and that the State\u2019s Attorney had told you who supposedly was saying that we told him that we had committed the crime. And, at least, that was the understanding which I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>had, and I wanted to let Bill know the information, for one thing, so he would know what was going on as far as why we \u2014 they just finally charged us with the crime. And also because I didn\u2019t want him speaking to his attorney or anyone, because, first of all, I had heard \u2014 I had been in jail for less than a week, and I heard all kinds of things,'rumors, and all the stories about Public Defenders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">Q. Let me stop you right there. Who did you believe was representing Bill at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">A. I hadn\u2019t had any clue whatsoever, and I figured it might be a Public Defender. And the stories I was being told by people within the jail, inmates, was Public Defenders, you really had to be careful what you said to them. They tend to take your evidence and use it against you, and rather than work for me, they work for the State and took a paycheck from the same people that the Prosecutors do. There\u2019s all kinds of crazy rumors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">Q. That\u2019s why you wrote the letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">A. That\u2019s why. That\u2019s the reason why I wanted to contact Kent, because I knew that Kent was in the same cell block as Bill. So, he would be able to get the information to him for me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Appellant does not challenge the admissibility of this letter. He does argue, however, that neither the letter nor his direct examination \u201copened the door\u201d to cross-examination about (1) the timing of his decision to obtain the services of a lawyer, or (2) his communications with counsel that were unrelated to the letter. We agree with that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">The following transpired during appellant\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: After you were stopped by the police in February of 1996, you retained an attorney rather early on, didn\u2019t you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-13\">THE COURT: Approach the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>[THE PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I know for a fact that Mr. Casey retained [Defense Counsel] early, because [Defense Counsel] called me and one of the issues is why this Defendant would keep any information from his attorney, and this letter that he wrote is \u2014 it\u2019s very apparent that he\u2019s in jail, and his attorney, who he hired prior to his arrest, and he still, at this point, was keeping information from his own attorney even before he was arrested. I think it shows an attempt to keep damaging information from his own lawyer, shows guilty knowledge, and also advising Bill Hynes to do the same thing also shows guilty knowledge. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">THE COURT: Okay, So it\u2019s been interjected into it, and I certainly will not allow any inferences or argument that the retention of an attorney is an inference of guilt, but I would allow questions as to whether or not he kept information from him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Following the bench conference, the prosecutor conducted a repetitive cross-examination that consumed 18 pages of trial transcript, and was punctuated with timely and appropriate objections of appellant\u2019s trial counsel, only one of which need be included in the following excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Mr. Casey, you retained an attorney at some point prior to your arrest \u2014 prior to your arrest in March of \u201996, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, Ma\u2019am, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: And that was [Defense Counsel] wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, ma\u2019am, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Mr. Casey, the way I read this letter, it appears that when [Defense Counsel] told you that he \u2014 the State had someone, a witness, that you didn\u2019t tell him, oh, yeah, it\u2019s Randy Ransom, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>[APPELLANT]: Umm, I told my attorney that I had a feeling that, the witness was Randy Ransom. I don\u2019t \u2014 I believe it was nearly immediately yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, let me ask you this. The next thing that you say is \u2014 -well, about two sentences down, you say, I\u2019m going to bring the name and the situation up to my attorney when it\u2019s appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, and I found it to be appropriate very soon after.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, you\u2019re stating that you\u2019re telling Bill that you\u2019re going to bring it up when it\u2019s appropriate, meaning that you didn\u2019t mention \u2014 you haven\u2019t done it yet, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">[APPELLANT]: That is reasonable, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, I know it\u2019s reasonable, but is it correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: So you didn\u2019t tell your lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZh\">[APPELLANT]: I told my attorney very shortly after. My actual meaning behind all of that was whether or not it was appropriate. Was it appropriate for me to go ahead and tell my attorney, but as I stated before, I had fear of his representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: You had fear of whose representation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGW\">[APPELLANT]: Mr. Hynes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: But you didn\u2019t have fear of [Defense Counsel\u2019s] representation did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-14\">[APPELLANT]: No, ma\u2019am, he was a paid lawyer, and all of the rumors that I heard within the facility were about Public Defenders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: And yet you\u2019re telling Bill in this letter through another inmate that you haven\u2019t told [Defense Counsel] about Randy and that you will do so when it\u2019s appropriate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-16\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, ma\u2019am, see, [Defense Counsel], after telling me about this, as I said, I had to ponder it for a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>moments. It wasn\u2019t very long. I gotten [sic] off the phone. I thought about it, realized who it probably was, and then I had written this letter, okay,and then there was a very short time thereafter \u2014 I probably would say, most likely, probably within the hour of writing the letter; I couldn\u2019t say specifically \u2014 that I made my attorney aware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: You\u2019re aware that certainly [defense counsel] told you what goes on between lawyers and client\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoS\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor, to anything concerning that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019ll rephrase it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Are you aware that what a person tells their attorney is kept confidential?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection. May we approach the bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">(Whereupon, Counsel approached the bench out of the hearing of the jury.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Move for mistrial. Again, she has had a whole line of questioning concerning privileges, skirting on the edges, and I think it\u2019s gone well over by now, and any conversation that I have with my client is privileged and any inference of what I have is maybe hot available to anyone else is privileged, and it all is to be used to infer guilt on the part of the Defendant, and I would make a motion for mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: What is your understanding, Mr. Casey, about what an attorney is permitted to reveal as far as information that comes from his client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">[APPELLANT]: An attorney is not permitted to, best of my knowledge, to reveal the information given to them to anyone. However, as I stated before, that was not the rumor that I was hearing....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">We agree with the circuit court that the State was entitled to question appellant about the text of his letter, about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>those conversations with his attorney disclosed in the letter, and about the fact that the letter contains a disclosure of his then existing intent to communicate information to his counsel. <em>Shawmut Mining Co. v. Padgett, </em>182 Md. 397, 404, 104 A. 40 (1918); <em>Fraidin v. Weitzman, </em>93 Md.App. 168, 228, 611 A.2d 1046 (1992), <em>cert. den., </em>329 Md. 109, 617 A.2d 1055 (1993). On the record before us, however, we are persuaded that appellant\u2019s letter did not open the door to cross-examination about anything else that appellant did not disclose to his attorney. The privilege at issue<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> protects against \u201ctestimony that no such communication was ever made between the client and the attorney.\u201d <em>Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 152, 345 A.2d 830 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The State argues that appellant\u2019s direct examination opened the door to the cross-examination about which he now complains. We are persuaded, however, that appellant\u2019s explanation for his limited disclosure of a single piece of information supplied by his counsel did not \u201copen the door\u201d to cross-examination about any other privileged communications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">We must emphasize that the \u201copening the door\u201d rule has its limitations. For example, it does not allow injecting collateral issues into a case or introducing extrinsic evidence on collateral issues. Such evidence is also subject to exclusion where a court finds that the probative value of the otherwise inadmissible responsive evidence \u201cis substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\"><em>Clark v. State, </em>332 Md. 77, 87, 629 A.2d 1239 (1993). Appellant was unfairly prejudiced by questions about when he obtained counsel, and by questions about privileged communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>cations unrelated to the limited disclosure made in his letter to Kent Brewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">When this issue arises at the next trial, the circuit court should resolve it in accordance with the procedure called for in <em>Harrison, supra, </em>276 Md. at 151, 345 A.2d 830, \u201ca preliminary inquiry out of the presence of the jury\u201d to identify the permissible and the prohibited areas of inquiry. The State is, of course, entitled to introduce appellant\u2019s letter to Brewer. If appellant testifies, the State will be entitled to establish on cross-examination (1) that he received from counsel the information disclosed in the letter, and (2) that the letter expressed his then existing intent. Unless appellant\u2019s direct examination \u201copens the door\u201d to other privileged communications, however, the circuit court must not allow the State to question appellant about (1) when he obtained counsel, (2) anything else that he said \u2014 and did not say \u2014 to his attorney, and (3) anything else that his attorney said \u2014 and did not say \u2014 to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We agree with appellant\u2019s contention that the circuit court should not have admitted evidence that the police interviewed William Hynes. The jury could have inferred from this evidence that Hynes implicated appellant as the murderer. In <em>Zemo v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 303, 646 A.2d 1050, (1994), this Court held that the investigating officer should not have been permitted to testify that \u201cthe informant\u2019s information put him on the trail of the appellant and other suspects ... and that acting on the informant\u2019s information, he arrested appellant.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 306, 646 A.2d 1050. In the present case, there was simply no need for the investigating officer to testify about the steps of his investigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">The jury, of course, has no need to know the course of an investigation unless it has some direct bearing on guilt or innocence. That an event occurs in the course of a criminal investigation does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>establish its relevance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0J\"><em>Id. </em>at 310, 646 A.2d 1050; <em>See also Hall v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 377, 705 A.2d 50 (1998), in which \u201cnone of the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>concerning the police investigations ... had any direct bearing on the guilt or innocence of appellant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 705 A.2d 50. Unless and until the defense accuses the investigators of doing a \u201csloppy job,\u201d what was done to solve the crime is inadmissible under Md. Rule 5-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">What a State\u2019s witness testifies to on direct examination controls the issue of which statements must be provided to defense counsel before cross-examination begins. It is obvious that, when an investigating officer\u2019s direct examination is limited to what occurred during an interrogation of the defendant, defense counsel is not entitled to inspect those portions of the officer\u2019s report that are unrelated to the interrogation. On the other hand, defense counsel is entitled to each portion of the report that contains or constitutes a statement of the officer/witness that would be admissible as a prior inconsistent statement under Md. Rule 5-613 \u2014 or as a prior consistent statement under Md. Rule 5-616(c)(2). To obtain appellate review of the circuit court\u2019s ruling on this issue, defense counsel must request that the material at issue \u201cgets in the record.\u201d <em>Leonard v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 631, 637, 421 A.2d 85 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Appellant is not entitled to a dismissal of the indictment, even though it was returned by a grand jury that received evidence from a wiretap conceded to have been unlawful.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">The grand jury is an inquisitional and accusatory body. It does not determine the guilt or innocence of the accused as that decision is vested in the petit jury or court, if there be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>a non-jury trial. That an indictment is founded on tainted evidence is no ground for dismissal as \u201c... [N]ormally,there is no limitation on the character of evidence that may be presented to a grand jury....\u201d <em>Gelbard v. United States, </em>408 U.S. 41, 60, 92 S.Ct. 2357, 2367, 33 L.Ed.2d 179, 193 (1972); <em>United States v. Blue, </em>384 U.S. 251, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16 L.Ed.2d 510 (1966). The rules of evidence are not applicable to grand jury proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><em>Hopkins v. State, </em>19 Md.App. 414, 426, 311 A.2d 483.

According to Daughton, he fell- in love with Luana Gill, who asked him to kill Allendorf because Allendorf had abused her. Daughton supplied appellant with a .32 caliber gun and a One Thousand Dollar ($1,000.00) advance. Gill provided Daughton with Allendorf's shotgun, which he gave to appellant and Hynes. Daughton then drove them to locations Allendorf frequented and suggested that the murder take place at one of those locations. On the night of the shooting, appellant paged Daughton and stated that he was following Allendorf. Appellant later paged Daughton to advise that he was going to commit the crime in front of Allendorf\u2019s house, because the locations suggested by Daughton were too public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-12\">.
