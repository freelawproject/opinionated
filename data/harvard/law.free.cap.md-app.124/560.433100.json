(hereinafter, the \u201cdealer\u201d or \u201cLoyola Ford\u201d), appellee, and Chrysler Credit Corporation (\u201cChrysler Credit\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The claims arose from appellant\u2019s purchase in December 1994 of a 1994 Ford Thunderbird, and his subsequent trade of that vehicle, in May 1995, for a 1995 Ford Taurus SHO. In particular, appellant alleged claims for usury, in violation of Maryland\u2019s Retail Installment Sales Act (hereinafter, the \u201cRISA\u201d), Md.Code (1975, 1990 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-609(a), (g) of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d), intentional misrepresentation, and unfair and deceptive trade practices, in violation of Maryland\u2019s Consumer Protection Act, Md.Code (1975, 1990 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.), C.L. \u00a7 13-301 et seq. (hereinafter, the \u201cCPA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d). After the circuit court granted Loyola Ford\u2019s motion for summary judgment, appellant timely noted his appeal. He presents several issues for our review, which we have reformulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">I. Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment as to appellant\u2019s claim of unfair and deceptive trade practices, in violation of the CPA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">II. Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment as to appellant\u2019s common law claim for intentional misrepresentation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">III. Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment as to appellant\u2019s usury claims under the RISA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">We answer the first two questions in the negative. As to the third question, for the reasons set forth in Section 111(B), we shall, in part, vacate the entry of summary judgment as to Count II, and remand for further proceedings. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">On December 27, 1994, appellant purchased a new 1994 Ford Thunderbird automobile from Loyola Ford. On the same date, he entered into a retail installment contract, by which the vehicle was financed at a rate of 16.88% per annum over a period of five years. In the weeks following the purchase, McGraw experienced a variety of difficulties with the car, including a faulty brake rotor, a defective light bulb, a squeaky window, and shaking of the steering wheel when the car was driven at low speeds. Because appellant was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the performance of the Thunderbird, he brought the vehicle back to Loyola Ford for repairs on several occasions. Appellant advised the dealer that \u201c[he] was considering legal action under Maryland\u2019s \u2018lemon\u2019 laws.\u201d He did not pursue his \u201clemon law\u201d claim, however. Instead, appellant chose to replace the Thunderbird with a 1995 Taurus SHO. The dealer\u2019s actions with respect to the Taurus are the focus of appellant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">On September 17, 1996, appellant filed a two-count complaint against Loyola Ford, arising from his purchase of the Taurus. In Count I, appellant alleged that Loyola Ford engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 13-301. The claim was based on Loyola Ford\u2019s alleged misrepresentation on the buyer\u2019s order that the Taurus was \u201cnew,\u201d and its assertion that the Taurus had \u201cthe most outstanding value ... in the dealership; every consideration in pricing and/or trade in allowance has been given to reduce the settlement price to its lowest\u201d. Count II alleged that the interest rate charged with respect to the financing of the Taurus was usurious, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a). Appellant sought damages of $24,288.68.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">On July 24, 1997, following the close of discovery on July 7, 1997, appellant amended his complaint to add Count III, which set forth a claim for intentional misrepresentation. Thereafter, on August 25, 1997, appellee moved for summary judgment. On October 7, 1997, one month before the scheduled trial date, and shortly before the summary judgment hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>appellant filed a Second Amended Complaint, supplementing his usury claim. He alleged that Loyola Ford violated C.L. \u00a7 12-609(g) when it failed to disclose a \u201csecret profit\u201d that it realized when it assigned the retail installment contract to Chrysler Credit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Some of the information obtained during discovery was presented to the court in support of appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion. The discovery, which included a deposition of appellant and documents relevant to the transactions, is pertinent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">At his deposition, appellant testified that, during one of his visits to Loyola Ford regarding the problems he experienced with the Thunderbird, he noticed the Taurus on the lot. Appellant decided to trade the Thunderbird for a different car, and expressed interest in the Taurus to Tony Smith, a Loyola Ford salesperson. According to appellant, Smith told him that Loyola Ford \u201chad a good deal\u201d on the Taurus. Smith also described the Taurus as a \u201ctop of the line car,\u201d which appellant took to mean that the car was \u201cloaded\u201d with extra features. The Taurus was equipped with several optional items, including a sunroof, compact disc player, leather seating, keyless entry, power seats, air conditioning, and paint and fabric protection. Appellant accompanied Smith on a test drive of the vehicle. When Smith drove the Taurus, appellant rode in the back seat, and he never looked to see how many miles were on the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">On May 25, 1995, appellant decided to purchase the 1995 Taurus. Accordingly, he signed a \u201cBuyer\u2019s Order\u201d form that indicated a \u201cbase price\u201d for the vehicle of $28,866.00, and a total price of $34,615.00, including options, delivery charge, taxes, and title service. Additionally, the document reflected an \u201callowance for trade in\u201d of the Thunderbird of $17,825.00, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>less the same amount as the \u201cbalance owing\u201d for that vehicle. The buyer\u2019s order also indicated that McGraw would pay a $3,000.00 down-payment and receive a $1,500.00 \u201cFord Rebate.\u201d After the down payment and the rebate, the document reflected a total balance due of $30,115.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The May 25 buyer\u2019s order also provided a box for the dealer to indicate whether the vehicle was \u201cnew,\u201d \u201cused,\u201d or a \u201cdemo.\u201d Loyola Ford checked the box denoting that the vehicle was \u201cnew.\u201d The form also provided a space adjacent to the box on which to write the specific mileage of the vehicle. Immediately under the word \u201cmileage\u201d, Loyola Ford wrote the following: \u201c(6161K)\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In addition, the buyer\u2019s order form contained a paragraph disclosing the dealer\u2019s policy regarding the sale of demonstrator vehicles. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">A demonstrator is the most outstanding value that we sell in the dealership; Every consideration in pricing and/or trade allowance has been given to reduce the settlement price to its lowest. However, every demonstrator sold may have paint touch-up, mouldings dented, an upholstery tear, wheel covers chipped, or other conditions considered visible at the time of sale. It is the policy of this dealership that no adjustments be made after the sale and after delivery, unless specifically stated on our sales contract. A squeak or touch up or mechanical adjustment will be made free of charge only within 10 working days of delivery date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Appellant testified at his deposition that he read the May 25 buyer\u2019s order, including the preprinted portion of the form. Moreover, he conceded that Smith told him the Taurus was a demonstrator vehicle. Further, appellant testified that he understood the phrase \u201cdemonstrator vehicle\u201d to mean a car that \u201chad been used\u201d by employees of the dealership to \u201cdrive back and forth to home.\u201d The following portion of appellant\u2019s deposition testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: Before you signed the contract of sale on the Taurus, did anyone actually say to you that the Taurus was new?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>APPELLANT: The\u201995?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">APPELLANT: No, nobody told me it was new.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5l\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: In fact, they told you it was a demonstrator, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: Did you read this buyer\u2019s order referring to the May 25, 1995 buyer\u2019s order before signing it, Mr. McGraw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">APPELLANT: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: Did you read everything on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap-M\">APPELLANT: Yes. Almost everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: Did you read the preprinted information? Do you understand what I mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACX\">APPELLANT: No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: There is a lot of preprinted text on the buyer\u2019s order, not something that the salesperson would have inserted in, but that would be on the document before writing it up for a particular customer. Do you understand what I\u2019m asking now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-14\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: And at the time that you signed this document on May 25 th, 1995, you understood that the car had 6,161 miles on it; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYp\">APPELLANT: At the time I purchased it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-15\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: At the time you signed this document, the buyer\u2019s order, on May 25th, 1995?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmE\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">The next day, May 26, 1995, appellant entered into a retail installment sales contract with Loyola Ford for the financing of the Taurus, by which he promised to pay $81,335.00 over 60 months, with interest charged at the rate of 16.75% per annum. Thus, the total obligation under the contract, including the finance charge, was $46,797.60. Loyola Ford arranged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>financing for the purchase through Chrysler Credit. A settlement sheet provided to appellant from Loyola Ford during discovery indicated that Chrysler\u2019s \u201cAPR buy rate\u201d was 9.85%, although the retail installment contract provided that appellant was charged the rate of 16.75%.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Apparently, appellant failed to pay the $8,000.00 down-payment reflected in the May 25 buyer\u2019s order. Consequently, on May 29, 1995, appellant signed a second buyer\u2019s order form, but not another financing agreement. Unlike the May 25 buyer\u2019s order form, the box labeled \u201cdemo\u201d was checked on the May 29 buyer\u2019s order form, rather than the box labeling the vehicle as \u201cnew.\u201d The notation \u201c(6161K)\u201d appeared next to the \u201cdemo\u201d box to indicate the car\u2019s mileage. In addition, a \u201cface up\u201d sheet signed by appellant on May 29 indicated that the Taurus was a \u201cdemo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The second buyer\u2019s order form contained a slightly different price calculation than the form prepared on May 25. The new form reflected a net trade-in allowance of $1000 for the 1994 Thunderbird. That amount resulted from the dealer\u2019s gross allowance for that vehicle of $18,825.00, minus the outstanding loan balance of $17,825.00. Although the space on the form labelled \u201cBase Price\u201d was left blank, the document reflected a total purchase price, including options, delivery charge, and taxes, of $33,615.00. After crediting appellant with the $1,500.00 \u201cFord Rebate\u201d and the $1,000 net trade-in allowance, the document showed a balance due of $31,115.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The Thunderbird, which the dealer accepted for the trade, had lost significant value between December 1994 and May 1995. Loyola Ford estimated the \u201ccash value\u201d of the Thun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>derbird at $12,500.00, but gave appellant a gross trade-in allowance of $18,825.00. The dealer accounted for the difference between the \u201ccash value\u201d and the gross trade-in allowance by adjusting the base price of the vehicle; the dealer increased the base price of the vehicle by $6,325.00, representing the amount of the \u201cover-allowance\u201d for the trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Both the May 25 and May 29 buyer\u2019s order forms contained a \u201cPurchase Price Clarification,\u201d which advised appellant of a possible adjustment of the base price of the vehicle in connection with a vehicle trade-in. In fact, the buyer\u2019s forms include two such statements, with almost identical language: First, the forms indicate that \u201cthe actual sales price may be higher than the advertised price due to an adjustment for trade in allowance or rebate.\u201d Second, the forms state that \u201cthe actual sales price may be higher due to an adjustment for trade in allowance or rebate.\u201d McGraw\u2019s signature appears under each statement on both forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">During his deposition, appellee\u2019s counsel questioned McGraw about the trade-in arrangement. McGraw acknowledged that he thought the trade-in was worth less than the dealer \u201cgave\u201d him. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFd\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: You didn\u2019t know the value of the Thunderbird at the time you traded it in, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac7\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: You did know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">APPELLANT: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: What did you think the value was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">APPELLANT: What did I think the value was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARq\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: Of the Thunderbird when you traded it in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">APPELLANT: I think it should have been less than what they charged me, what they gave me for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: You thought that it was worth less than what they gave you for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: Why do you think they gave you more than what you thought it was worth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">APPELLANT: I don\u2019t know why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL: Did you understand that the high value of the trade-in raised the price of the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">On October 27, 1997, the court held a hearing on appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and granted Loyola Ford\u2019s motion as to all counts. Regarding the dealer\u2019s alleged failure to disclose the profit derived from the assignment of the retail installment sales contract, the court determined that the RISA does not provide a private civil remedy for a violation of C.L. \u00a7 12-609(g). Moreover, the court agreed with appellee that the maximum allowable interest rate for the financing transaction is governed by C.L. \u00a7 12 \u2014 609(f), which permits an interest rate of up to 24%. Finally, the court rejected appellant\u2019s contention that Loyola Ford\u2019s representations on the buyer\u2019s order form were actionable under the CPA or at common law. After the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to alter or amend, McGraw timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">We will include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">Maryland Rule 2-501 provides that a trial court may grant a motion for summary judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Southland Corp. v.

Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to Count I, alleging unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the CPA. Specifically, appellant complains that the buyer\u2019s order of May 25, 1995 falsely represented the Taurus as \u201cnew,\u201d although it actually had 6,161 miles on it, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 13-301(1), (2), (3), and (9). McGraw also contends that the dealer violated C.L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u00a7 13-301(1), (2), (3), (6),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (9) by including in the buyer\u2019s order a false representation that \u201c[a] demonstrator is the most outstanding value that we sell in the dealership; Every consideration in pricing and/or trade allowance has been given to reduce the settlement price to its lowest.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Further, appellant argues to us that the dealer\u2019s \u201cmost significant\u201d misrepresentation was its failure to inform him that Loyola Ford received $4,780.00 when it assigned appellant\u2019s retail installment sales contract to Chrysler Credit. In his Second Amended Complaint, however, appellant asserted the \u201csecret profit\u201d argument only in connection with the usury claim in Count II; the claim was not asserted as part of the deceptive trade practices claim under the CPA or as a common law intentional misrepresentation. Thus, when the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>court considered the summary judgment motion, the \u201csecret profit\u201d issue was relevant only to appellant\u2019s claim for usury. Therefore, we will only address appellant\u2019s contention in the context of that claim. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Appellee asserts that summary judgment was appropriate because, as a matter of law, appellant was required to prove \u201cactual deception resulting in actual injury,\u201d and appellant was not \u201cactually deceived.\u201d Appellee points out that appellant admitted under oath that he was told, before signing the first buyer\u2019s order, that the Taurus was a demonstrator vehicle, and that it had been driven 6,100 miles. Moreover, both buyer\u2019s order forms expressly noted the vehicle\u2019s mileage at \u201c6161K.\u201d Further, appellee contends that Loyola Ford\u2019s statements about the value of a demonstrator vehicle, and the \u201cconsideration in pricing,\u201d were merely \u201cgeneral commendations\u201d that are not actionable under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The Legislature enacted the CPA in 1973 because of \u201cmounting concern over the increase of deceptive practices in connection with sales of merchandise, real property, and services and the extension of credit.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 13-102(a). <em>See Hartford Acc. and Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Associates, Ltd., </em>109 Md.App. 217, 241, 674 A.2d 106 (1996), <em>aff'd, </em>346 Md. 122, 695 A.2d 153 (1997). The General Assembly recognized that \u201cexisting laws [protecting consumers were] inadequate, poorly coordinated and not widely known or adequately enforced.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 13-102(a)(2).

C.L. \u00a7 13-411. In addition, a person aggrieved by a violation of the CPA may initiate a private cause of action for damages.

Luskin\u2019s, Inc., </em>120 Md. App. 1, 706 A.2d 102, <em>cert. granted, </em>350 Md. 280, 711 A.2d 871 (1998), is helpful in analyzing C.L. \u00a7 13-301. In that case, we reviewed the meaning of an \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practice\u201d under C.L. \u00a7\u00a7 13-301(1), (3), and (9). The circuit court had reversed the Division\u2019s determination that Luskin\u2019s violated the CPA when it advertised \u201cFree Airfare For Two\u201d to various vacation destinations for customers who purchased items from Luskin\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 706 A.2d 102. Before this Court, Luskin\u2019s argued that the Division should have applied the test currently used by the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) in evaluating the meaning of \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practices,\u201d because C.L. \u00a7 13-105 instructs that \u201cdue consideration and weight [must] be given to the interpretations of \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act by the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts.\u201d The FTC has traditionally evaluated allegedly deceptive trade practices using a \u201ctotal impression\u201d test, in which a representation is \u201cjudged by viewing it as a whole, without emphasizing isolated words or phrases apart from their context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 706 A.2d 102 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Prior to 1983, the FTC made this determination from the point of view of an ordinary, unsophisticated consumer. <em>Id. </em>In a policy statement delivered to Congress in 1983, the FTC unveiled its intention to evaluate the deceptiveness of trade practices from the point of view of a <em>reasonable </em>consumer. The effect of the change was to make it more difficult to prove a \u201cdeceptive\u201d trade practice, because the new standard \u201crequire[d] not only a representation or omission that is likely to mislead, but also that: (1) the practice is likely to mislead the consumer who is <em>acting reasonably </em>in the circumstances; and (2) the representation or omission is material, that is, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>consumer is likely to have chosen differently <em>but for </em>the deception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 706 A.2d 102 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">We concluded that Maryland\u2019s standard for evaluating allegedly deceptive trade practices under C.L. \u00a7 13-301 differed from the FTC approach, because a line of Maryland cases decided since 1983 was \u201caligned more closely with federal law on deception as it existed prior to 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 706 A.2d 102. The Maryland cases did not employ the \u201creasonable consumer\u201d standard and the \u201cbut for\u201d test. Rather, the cases utilized the more generous \u201cordinary consumer\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 29-30, 706 A.2d 102; <em>see Golt, </em>308 Md. at 10, 517 A.2d 328 (stating \u201cAn omission is considered material if a significant number of unsophisticated consumers would attach importance to the information in determining a choice of action.\u201d); <em>Legg v.

Thus, the <em>Luskin\u2019s </em>Court upheld the determination of the Division, which had applied a \u201ctotal impression\u201d analysis from the point of view of an ordinary consumer. <em>Id. </em>at 31-35, 706 A.2d 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We turn to evaluate whether, in the light most favorable to appellant, the dealer was entitled to summary judgment as to appellant\u2019s unfair and deceptive trade practices claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\n<em>A. The Dealer\u2019s Representation that the Taurus Was \u201cNew\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Based on the undisputed facts, and even applying the stringent standard established in <em>Luskin\u2019s, </em>we are amply satisfied that the act of checking the \u201cnew\u201d box on the May 25 buyer\u2019s order form had absolutely no \u201ccapacity, tendency, or effect of deceiving or misleading\u201d appellant. C.L. \u00a7 13-301(1). To be sure, the vehicle was not brand new. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1977, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 11-138 of the Transportation Article (\u201cTrans.\u201d) (defining a \u201cnew vehicle\u201d as one \u201cthat has never been used to destroy its newness or to convert it into or make it a used or secondhand vehicle, as these terms are commonly used or understood in trade or business.)\u201d; <em>see also Wheaton Dodge City, Inc. v. Baltes, </em>55 Md.App. 129, 132, 461 A.2d 38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>(1983)(observing that \u201c \u2018new<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, like \u2018chaste\u2019, is not a matter of degree, and once lost may only be referred to thereafter in the comparative sense, never again as an absolute\u201d). Nevertheless, the dealer\u2019s description of the Taurus as \u201cnew\u201d cannot be viewed in a vacuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">It is uncontroverted that, at the time of the transaction, appellant was expressly informed that the vehicle had been used as a \u201cdemo.\u201d Indeed, during his deposition, appellant admitted that Loyola Ford <em>told </em>him prior to signing the first buyer\u2019s order that it was a demonstrator vehicle. McGraw also knew that the car had been driven 6,161 miles, and the dealer noted the exact mileage on the same form that erroneously described the vehicle as \u201cnew.\u201d In addition, the first buyer\u2019s order form was replaced with a second form a few days later, before the transaction was consummated. On the second form, the dealer correctly described the vehicle as a demo.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Because appellee made a timely disclosure that the vehicle was a demonstrator, and informed appellant of the actual mileage on both buyer\u2019s order forms, the act of checking the \u201cnew\u201d box on the first form certainly had \u201cno capacity, tendency, or effect of deceiving or misleading\u201d appellant. The dealer\u2019s disclosures simply do not support an inference that Loyola Ford \u201cintended that [appellant] rely\u201d on the description of the vehicle as \u201cnew\u201d, as a way of convincing him that the car was new, because both parties knew that it was not. Stated otherwise, whatever falsity attended appellee\u2019s act of checking the box marked \u201cnew\u201d on the first buyer\u2019s order form, it did not vitiate the dealer\u2019s affirmative act of timely disclosing that the vehicle was a demo with over 6000 miles on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s argument that Loyola Ford violated C.L. \u00a7 13-301 by checking the \u201cnew\u201d box on the buyer\u2019s order form. Appellant\u2019s contention flies in the face of logic and the undisputed facts. Indeed, \u201c \u2018viewing [the representation] as a whole, without emphasizing isolated words or phrases apart from their context,\u2019 \u201d <em>Luskins, </em>120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Md.App. at 27, 706 A.2d 102 <em>(quoting American Home Prods. Corp. v. F.T.C., </em>695 F.2d at 681, 687 (3d Cir.1982)), the description of the vehicle as new, could not have misled appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We also consider appellant\u2019s complaint concerning the dealer\u2019s alleged misrepresentations about the favorable pricing of the demo as significant in defeating his claim here. McGraw posited factual assertions as to the pricing of the demo that are completely at odds with the claim concerning the description of the vehicle as \u201cnew.\u201d On the one hand, McGraw contends that he was misled when the dealer described the vehicle as \u201cnew,\u201d implying that he did not know the vehicle was a demo. Yet he also asserts that the dealer\u2019s representations regarding the pricing of the <em>demo </em>were actionable. At least implicitly, then, McGraw has acknowledged that he was aware the vehicle was a demo, or else the contention regarding pricing is meaningless. The factual contradiction undermines appellant\u2019s claim that he was deceived by the dealer\u2019s representation that the vehicle was \u201cnew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Moreover, appellant\u2019s deposition testimony makes it difficult to perceive how the representation that the vehicle was new could have caused appellant any \u201cinjury or loss,\u201d as required by C.L. \u00a7 13-408(a). As discussed earlier, a failure to \u201cestablish the nature of the actual injury or loss that [a consumer] has allegedly sustained as a result of the prohibited practice\u201d is fatal to a private cause of action under the Act. <em>CitaraManis, </em>328 Md. at 152, 613 A.2d 964; <em>see Hall v.

As we see it, this is the sort of speech that is \u201coffered and understood as an expression of the seller\u2019s opinion only, which is to be discounted as such by the buyer, and on which no reasonable [person] would rely.\u201d W.

There, the Court noted that claims by a home builder that the home would be built \u201caccording to a plan and specifications in structurally sound condition and free of substantial defects\u201d were insufficiently misleading to allow the buyer to rescind the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 146 A.2d 197. The Court stated that \u201crepresentations as to the soundness and value of the house are normally considered in law to be \u2018indefinite generalities of exaggeration\u2019 which could deceive no rational person and therefore do not amount to \u2018misrepresentation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247, 146 A.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">We are also guided by <em>Milkton v.

When the buyers asked the agent \u201c \u2018how the construction was, whether, it was substantial, any leaks in the basement, or anything like that and how the roof would be,\u2019 \u201d the agent said: \u201c \u2018[PJerfect, cannot be any better, my boss works fine, does the best work can be done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 150 A. 28.

After Milkton purchased the house, he sought to rescind the contract on the ground that the statements were fraudulent. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 150 A. 28. The Court of Appeals concluded that none of the alleged misrepresentations was actionable. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">[TJhe use of the term \u201cperfectly safe\u201d in connection with every detail of construction was so extravagant in scope and measure, and so indefinite and elusive in meaning, that the statement would fall within the category of a puff instead of a representation, and the plaintiff, who was an architect of experience, could not have been mislead or influenced .... The exaggeration of the statement is so plain that it can not be supposed to have deceived any rational person. Everybody knows a new house, as an old one, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>never perfect in construction, but has the anticipated defects inherent to its period----It is difficult to find these words, when reasonably considered, as capable of being understood by a [person] of average intelligence as a clear and definite representation of any particular fact....

In this case, however, there is no written opinion explaining the court\u2019s ruling, and the transcript of the hearing does not precisely elucidate the basis for the court\u2019s ruling as to the fraud count. Based on the court\u2019s comments, however, it appears that the court granted summary judgment as to fraud because appellant was not misled by Loyola Ford\u2019s representations. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>THE COURT: [L]et\u2019s assume it\u2019s a fact that there was the word new used, which of your counts is made viable by that fact and what relief does that count seek for, by reason of that fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Well, I think that\u2019s part of the misrepresentation, both counts one and counts\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">THE COURT: See, that\u2019s where we part company, <em>because I don\u2019t see it as a misrepresentation.

As we discussed earlier, appellant\u2019s own deposition testimony unequivocally established that Loyola Ford told him the Taurus was a demonstrator vehicle. Moreover, appellant acknowledged that he read the buyer\u2019s order form before he signed it. Therefore, he knew, before entering into any legal obligation to purchase the car, that the Taurus already had 6,161 miles on it. Consequently, even if Loyola Ford intentionally checked the \u201cnew\u201d box on the buyer\u2019s order, the undisputed evidence demonstrated that appellant could not have been misled by the representation. Absent reliance, appellant cannot prevail on his fraud claim. <em>See Gross v. Sussex, </em>332 Md. at 257, 630 A.2d 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>Hill v. John Banks Buick, Inc., </em>875 S.W.2d 667 (Ct.App. Tenn.1998), provides a useful contrast. In that case, a woman inquired about what seemed to be a new 1989 Buick Regal parked on the lot of a car dealership. A window sticker on the vehicle identified the car as a \u201cdemo.\u201d After test driving the automobile, the woman decided to buy it. During the course of completing the transaction, she signed three blank \u201cregistration or odometer readings,\u201d but she had not observed the actual mileage on the vehicle. During negotiations, a salesman advised her that the car was a demonstrator, and had been used to take customers on test drives. No one specifically told her that the car had actually been driven 9,385 miles, however. The salesman also described the vehicle as a \u201cnew\u201d car. <em>Id. </em>at 669. The customer asked the dealer to \u201ccome down\u201d in its price, \u201csince it was a demo and it did have some miles on it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She also signed a retail installment sales contract that identified the car as a \u201cdemo.\u201d Further, when the dealership titled the vehicle, it labeled the car as a \u201cused\u201d car. The customer sued the dealership alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>intentional misrepresentation. At the close of the plaintiffs case, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of the dealership, <em>id. </em>at 668, and the Tennessee Court of Appeals affirmed. In its view, the fact that the customer knew the car was a demonstration vehicle defeated her claim that the dealership misrepresented the car as \u201cnew.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant knew much more about the vehicle than the customer in <em>Hill </em>knew about the vehicle she purchased. McGraw was informed that the car was a demonstrator vehicle, and he knew it had been driven 6,161 miles at the time he signed the first buyer\u2019s order. In light of the specific knowledge appellant had about the extent of the vehicle\u2019s mileage, the dealer\u2019s appellation of \u201cnew\u201d was of no legal consequence in connection with the fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">III. Usury</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">We turn to consider appellant\u2019s contentions that Loyola Ford\u2019s financing contract was usurious, in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>RISA. Appellant claims Loyola Ford violated C.L. \u00a7 12-609 in two respects. First, appellant argues that, pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 12 \u2014 609(a)(1), the 16.75% interest rate on appellant\u2019s financing contract exceeded the 16.5% maximum rate allowed for a \u201cnew motor vehicle.\u201d Second, McGraw asserted in the usury count of his Second Amended Complaint that Loyola Ford violated C.L. \u00a7 12-609(g), because the dealer \u201cfailed to disclose in the retail installment contract that [Loyola Ford] was receiving a portion of the finance charge from the assignment of the retail installment contract.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the summary judgment hearing, the trial court concluded that C.L. \u00a7 12 \u2014 609(f) governed the financing aspect of the transaction, rather than C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a). Because C.L. \u00a7 12 \u2014 609(f) authorizes an interest rate as high as 24%, the dealer did not violate the RISA by charging an interest rate of 16.75%. The court also concluded that even if Loyola Ford violated C.L. \u00a7 12 \u2014 609(g) by failing to disclose the profit it made on the assignment of appellant\u2019s retail installment contract to Chrysler Credit, C.L. \u00a7 12-609(g) does not provide a private civil remedy for the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><em>A. </em>Was <em>The 16.75% Interest Rate Usurious?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Whether the interest rate for the financing of the vehicle violated the RISA depends on whether C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a) or C.L. \u00a7 12 \u2014 609(f) applies here. C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">(a) <em>Maximum, finance charge. </em>\u2014 The finance charge imposed on the sale of a motor vehicle may not exceed an amount computed using the following annual simple interest rates of finance charge:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>(1) Class 1: A new motor vehicle \u2014 16.5 percent on the outstanding balance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">(2) Class 2: A used motor vehicle designated by the manufacturer by a model year not more than two years before the year in which the sale is made \u2014 22 percent on the outstanding balance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">(3) Class 3: A used motor vehicle designated by the manufacturer by a model year more than two years before the year in which the sale is made \u2014 27 percent on the outstanding balante.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">On the other hand, C.L. \u00a7 12 \u2014 609(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">(f) <em>Maximum finance charge. </em>\u2014 Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the finance charge imposed on a motor vehicle sold under a contract may not exceed the following annual simple interest rates of finance charge:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">(1) Class 1: A new motor vehicle \u2014 24 percent on the outstanding balance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">(2) Class 2: A used motor, vehicle designated by the manufacturer by a model year not more than 2 years before the year in which the sale is made \u2014 24 percent on the outstanding balance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Apart from the financing rates prescribed, sections (a) and (f) of C.L. \u00a7 12-609 differ in two other respects. First, section (a) governs the \u201cfinance charge imposed <em>on the sale of a motor vehicle,\u201d </em>whereas section (f) addresses \u201cthe finance charge imposed <em>on a motor vehicle sold under a contract.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Second, section (a) limits the <em>\u201camount \u201d </em>of the finance charge <em>\u201ccomputed using the following annual interest rates of finance charge,\u201d </em>whereas section (f) simply limits <em>\u201cthe annual simple interest rates of finance charge.\u201d </em>Appellant seizes on these semantic differences, essentially proposing that (a) and (f) are not irreconcilable; rather, he urges that they \u201cfocus on different aspects of the law of usury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">Appellant asserts that C.L. \u00a7 12-609(f), which authorizes a 24% interest rate, applies only when a vehicle is \u201csold under contract,\u201d which appellant interprets to mean a financing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>contract. On the other hand, he suggests that C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a), which sets a maximum interest rate of 16.5%, applies \u201cin the situation where the finance charge is imposed \u2014 not by contract, but on the \u2018sale of a motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d Here, the May 25 buyer\u2019s order, which appellant claims was the \u201cdocument constituting the contract of sale,\u201d did not include any financing terms. It simply obligated appellant to pay an outstanding balance of $30,115.00. Appellant did not sign the retail installment sales contract until May 26, 1995. Moreover, the May 25 buyer\u2019s order stated explicitly that \u201cno credit has been extended to [appellant] for the purchase of [the Taurus] except as appears in writing on the face of this agreement.\u201d Therefore, as appellant interprets C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a), appellee could charge no more than 16.5% as a finance charge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">McGraw\u2019s argument, which is somewhat convoluted, is rooted in the slight difference in wording of sections C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a) and (f). Appellant interprets section (a) to apply to the \u201cmaximum \u2018amount\u2019 of \u2018finance charge\u2019 calculated by using a maximum rate of interest.\u201d He urges that C.L. \u00a7 12 \u2014 609(f) \u201cpertains only to the \u2018rate\u2019 of interest of the finance charge, not the amount....\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he legislature obviously intended the two provisions to focus on different aspects of the law of usury and employed different means to accomplish different ends, i.e. limiting both the \u2018amount\u2019 and the \u2018rate.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In his reply brief, appellant sheds some light on his contention; he suggests a public policy rationale for distinguishing the provisions in the way he suggests. He posits that C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a) was meant to protect a buyer who is put in the \u201cvulnerable position\u201d of owing the entire amount due under a contract of sale, yet has no provision for financing. In that circumstance, he claims that the maximum interest rate is statutorily limited to 16.5%, to protect such a buyer from \u201cthe ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>economic squeeze\u201d of an \u201cexorbitant interest rate.\u201d Under appellant\u2019s construction of the RISA, C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a) limits \u201cthe greed of the credit providers to 16.5% where the buyer has been placed in a vulnerable position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Appellee, on the other hand, relies on a strict and literal statutory interpretation. The dealer claims that C.L. \u00a7 12-609(f) effectively overrides section (a) by the use of the phrase \u201c[notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section.\u201d Accordingly, appellee argues that the sale of the Taurus was governed by C.L. \u00a7 12-609\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">As we see it, the only substantive difference between C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a) and C.L. \u00a7 12-609\u00ae is the schedule of maximum rates permitted on contracts for the purchase of automobiles. We can discern no appreciable difference between the \u201camount\u201d of financing charge limited in section (a) and the \u201crate\u201d of financing charge restricted in section (f), particularly when both are expressed in terms of a percentage of the outstanding balance. In our view, the use of the words \u201cunder a contract\u201d in section (f) is too thin a reed upon which to construct an alternate purpose for section (f). Section (a), which addresses the finance charge for the \u201csale\u201d of a vehicle, obviously embodies a sale pursuant to a contract, be it oral or written. Even if, <em>arguendo, </em>the Legislature meant to distinguish the contract for the sale of a motor vehicle from a separate financing contract for the same vehicle, the words \u201csold under a contract\u201d in section (f), governing financing agreements, would not add significant meaning to the provision already found in section (a), as both types of agreements are \u201ccontracts.\u201d Stated otherwise, there is nothing in the text of section (f) to indicate that \u201csold under a contract\u201d only means sold under a <em>financing </em>contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Appellant\u2019s argument that sections (a) and (f) control different kinds of contracts for the sale of automobiles is not supported either by the principles of statutory construction or the legislative history. To the contrary, applying well settled principles of statutory construction, in conjunction with our review of the legislative history, we are satisfied that C.L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u00a7 12-609(f) governs here. Because the rates in section (f) conflict with the rates in section (a), and section (f) was enacted <em>after </em>section (a), we conclude that the Legislature repealed by implication the rates provided in section (a). We explain further.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The legislative history reveals that the General Assembly intended to increase the maximum interest rate from 16.5% to 24%, by adding what is now C.L. \u00a7 12-609(f) in 1980, and later removing a sunset provision in 1985. Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s use in C.L. \u00a7 12 \u2014 609(f) of the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding subsection (a) of this section\u201d denotes a recognition by the Legislature of the conflict between sections (f) and (a), and evidences the Legislature\u2019s intention that section (f) take precedence over section (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The cardinal rule in statutory construction is to determine and effect the intent of the Legislature. <em>Roberts v. Total Health Care, Inc., </em>349 Md. 499, 523, 709 A.2d 142 (1998); <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423 (1995); <em>Mayor of Baltimore v.

The statute itself is the primary source for determining the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 570, 709 A.2d 749 (1998); <em>Allied Vending Inc. v. City of Bowie, </em>332 Md. 279, 306, 631 A.2d 77 (1993); <em>State v.

To ascertain the legislative intent, \u201cthe Court considers the language of an enactment and gives that language its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448 (1994); <em>see Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128 (1998); <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Tel. Co. v.

State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946 (1993) (internal citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>omitted), \u201cGiving the words their ordinary and common meaning \u2018in light of the full context in which they appear, and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence,\u2019 normally will result in the discovery of the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Further, when analyzing a statute, \u201cwe seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Frost v.

Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 7-8, 629 A.2d 731 (1993) (courts must reach a statutory interpretation compatible with common sense). Moreover, a statute should be read so that no word, sentence, or section is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory, unless a contrary result is manifest in the legislative intent. <em>Gordon Family Partnership v. Gar On Jer, </em>348 Md. 129, 138, 702 A.2d 753 (1997); <em>Buckman, </em>333 Md. at 523-24, 636 A.2d 448; <em>State v. 149 Slot Machines, </em>310 Md. 356, 361, 529 A.2d 817 (1987); <em>Board of Educ. of Garrett County v.

Ordinarily, \u201ca repeal by implication does not occur unless the language of the later statute plainly shows that the legislature intended to repeal the earlier statute,\u201d in most cases by use of an \u201cexpress reference\u201d to the previous enactment. <em>State v. Harris, </em>327 Md. 32, 39, 607 A.2d 552 (1992). \u201cBecause the General Assembly is presumed to have intended that all its enactments operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, statutes will be interpreted, whenever reasonably possible, to avoid repeal by implication.\u201d <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants Nat.

Any used motor vehicle designated by the manufacturer by a year model more than two years prior to the year in which the sale price is made \u2014 $15 per $100 per year on the principal balance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">In 1980, the Legislature amended C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a), replacing the dollars-per-$100 formula with a statement expressing the limit in terms of an annual simple interest rate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The amended provision provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>(a) The finance charge imposed on the sale of a motor vehicle may not exceed an amount computed using the following annual simple interest rates of finance charge:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">(1) Class 1: A new motor vehicle \u2014 16.5 percent on the outstanding balance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">(2) Class 2: \u2022 A used motor vehicle designated by the manufacturer by a model year not more than two years before the year in which the sale is made \u2014 22 percent on the outstanding balance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">(3) Class 3: A used motor vehicle designated by the manufacturer by a model year more than two years before the year in which the sale is made \u2014 27 percent on the outstanding balance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">180 Md. Laws, Chap. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Later that term, the Legislature passed HB 1414, creating what is now C.L. \u00a7 12-609(f). 1980 Md. Laws, Chap. 866. The new provision was enacted <em>\u201cfjor the purpose of </em>... <em>increasing the rate of finance charge permitted in connection with the sale of certain motor </em>vehicles.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>C.L. \u00a7 12-609(f), then located at C.L. \u00a7 12-609(e), contained a sunset provision providing for the section\u2019s demise on August 1,1982. The law stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">(e) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the finance charge imposed on a motor vehicle sold under a contract <em>executed before August 1, 1982, </em>may not exceed the following annual simple interest rates of finance charge:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">(1) Class 1: A new motor vehicle \u2014 21. 5 percent on the outstanding balance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">(2) Class 2: A used motor vehicle designated by the manufacturer by a model year not more than 2 years before-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the year in which the sale is made \u2014 23.5 percent on the outstanding balance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Our review of the bill files and committee reports associated with HB 1414 convinces us that what is now section (f) was enacted in direct response to the exorbitant interest rates for consumer loans that prevailed in 1980. The new law constituted an effort to make credit available to consumers who would otherwise have been foreclosed completely from the new car market. A letter from the Automobile Trade Association of Maryland in support of the bill summarized the problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">At the present time credit unions are not making automobile loans. Banks are only making loans on a very selective basis to customers of the bank. The only real source available to an automobile dealer to buy his retail installment agreements are the Ford Motor Credit Company, Chrysler Credit Company and General Motors Acceptance Corporation. Even these sources are becoming selective and requiring re-purchase or recourse agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">As long as the prime rate is 19% or higher there is no reason for a bank to take an assignment of a retail installment agreement for 16%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">The bill file also contains a summary of HB 1414 that is helpful in ascertaining its relationship to the rates described in C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a). The summary states that HB 1414 \u201cINCREASES FINANCE CHARGE CEILING ON SALES OF NEW AND TWO YEAR OLD MOTOR VEHICLES. NEW VEHICLE \u2014 PRESENTLY 16.5%, WITH HOUSE BILL 1414 \u2014 21.5%. USED VEHICLE LESS THAN TWO MODEL YEARS OLD PRESENTLY 22%[,] WITH HOUSE BILL 1414 \u2014 23.5 PERCENT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">A letter from then Attorney General Stephen H. Sachs to Governor Harry Hughes found \u201cno substantial objection to [the] constitutionality and legal sufficiency\u201d of the bill. In a footnote, the Attorney General indicated his interpretation of the effect of HB 1414:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>* * * H.B. 1414, like H.B. 410 permits increase in the finance charge imposed in connection with certain motor vehicle sales____H.B. 1414 adds new subsection 12-609(e), which sets forth <em>new permissible rates </em>for certain sales \u201cnotwithstanding Subsection (A) of this Section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">As we noted, a sunset provision was to take effect on August 1, 1982, with regard to C.L. \u00a7 12-609(f). In 1982, however, the Legislature extended the sunset provision to July 1, 1985, and increased the rate to 24% on both classes of vehicles covered by C.L. \u00a7 12-609(f). 1982 Md. Laws, Chap. 753. In 1985, by 1985 Md. Laws, Chap. 150, the Legislature eliminated the sunset provision altogether. That law, before the Senate as SB 201, addressed nine separate provisions of the Commercial Law and Financial Institutions articles, and was \u201c[f]or the purpose of continuing the existence of certain ceilings on certain maximum finance charges by repealing the termination provisions on those ceilings.... \u201d Again, the bill file is particularly helpful in \u00f1luminating the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">At the time the General Assembly considered SB 201, the consumer credit landscape was uncertain. Most of the ceilings affected by the proposed law were put in place in 1982, with sunset provisions of July 1, 1985. <em>See </em>1982 Md. Laws, Chap. 1853. Meanwhile, in 1983, the Legislature had enacted the \u201cCredit Deregulation Act of 1983.\u201d The Deregulation Act was optional; lenders could choose to operate under its relaxed consumer protection provisions, or they could continue to offer credit under the former rates, which were subject to sunset provisions. 1983 Md. Laws, Chap. 143. Thus, in 1985, the General Assembly faced the question of whether to allow the higher rates to expire on the sunset date, or to remove the sunset provisions, making the higher rates permanent. <em>See </em>Letter from Alan Thomas Fell, Commission of Consumer Credit, to F. Carvel Payne, Director, Department of Legislative Reference (December 7,1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>The Hearing Bill Summary for SB 201 made clear that in removing the sunset provision in C.L. \u00a7 12-609(f), the Legislature intended to enshrine at 24% the financing rate for new cars and used cars less than two years old. The Summary stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\"><em>Summary: </em>In 1982, the General Assembly created a three year period where the ceiling rates of interest for the credit provisions of the Commercial Law Article 12 would be suspended and a temporary ceiling rate of 24% allowed. <em>This bill makes the 24% interest rate ceiling permanent </em>and removes from the article the earlier lower interest rate ceilings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">(Emphasis added). With regard to C.L. \u00a7 12-609, the summary stated that the \u201cOld Ceiling\u201d for new cars and used cars less than two years old was 16.5%; the \u201cTemporary and Permanent New Ceiling\u201d was 24%.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">In a letter from John Berry, Senate Finance Committee Analyst, to Senator Dennis F. Rassmussen, Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Berry described C.L. \u00a7 12-609 in his \u201cSummary of Affected Sections:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">6. 12-609 <em>loans for motor vehicles now have a cap of 24% for all cars except a used car more than 2 years old </em>which has a 27% rate. If sunsetted, the 27% rate for 2 years + old cars remains unaffected. The rate for a new motor vehicle <em>becomes </em>16.5% and the rate for a used car less than 2 years old is limited to 22%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">The foregoing excursus into legislative archaeology sheds light on the background of the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding subsection (a) of this section.\u201d At the time the phrase was first employed, it indicated that section (f) took precedence over C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a)(l) and (2), but only on a temporary basis, and it left C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a)(3) unaffected. The ceiling on used automobiles \u201cdesignated by the manufacturer by a model year more than two years before the year in which the sale is made\u201d remained at 27%. In 1985, however, the General Assembly made permanent what had been provisional.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The legislative history contains no mention of the problem of \u201cvulnerable\u201d consumers being exposed to \u201cexorbitant\u201d interest rates because they had signed a contract but had not yet arranged financing. If that problem had been the impetus for enacting sections (a) and (f) as separate provisions, we would expect to find at least some discussion or reference to the consumer protection problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In our view, the legislative history, in concert with our interpretation of the plain meaning of the text of C.L. \u00a7 12-609(f), compels the conclusion that, as to the sale of new cars and cars less than 2 years old, C.L. \u00a7 12-609(a) was repealed by implication. Accordingly, we perceive no error in the court\u2019s conclusion that, pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 12-609(f), Loyola Ford was permitted to finance appellant\u2019s vehicle at the rate charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\n<em>B. Loyola\u2019s Financing Profit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Count II of appellant\u2019s complaint, as amended, alleges that Loyola Ford violated C.L. \u00a7 12-609(g), because the dealer failed to disclose to appellant that it had obtained financing from Chrysler Credit at 9.85%, and assigned the retail installment contract to Chrysler Credit, retaining for itself the excess financing charge. Appellant estimates, based on a document produced by Loyola Ford, that the dealer profited by $4,780.00 on the financing arrangement. McGraw also complains that Loyola Ford hid its \u201csecret profit\u201d throughout the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">C.L. \u00a7 12-609(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_x\">(g) <em>Assignment by seller of retail installment agreement. </em>\u2014 A seller may assign a retail installment agreement and receive a portion of the finance charge only if the fact is disclosed in the agreement. The specific amount to be received need not be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">Section 12-630 of the Commercial Law article defines the remedies that are available for violations of the Retail Installment Sales Act, codified at C.L. \u00a7\u00a7 12-601 through 12-631. C. L. \u00a7 12-630 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>(a) <em>Holder not to collect charges. </em>\u2014 Except as provided by subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a holder may not collect or receive any finance, delinquency, or collection charge from the buyer if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">(1) The agreement does not contain the information required by \u00a7\u00a7 12-604 through 12-606 of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">(2) The seller fails to deliver to the buyer a required copy of the agreement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">(3) The agreement contains a finance charge in excess of the applicable charge permitted by \u00a7\u00a7 12-609 or 12-610 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Appellee contends that C.L. \u00a7 12-630 precludes a civil remedy for a violation of \u00a7 12-609(g). First, appellee claims that C.L. \u00a7 12-630 provides a remedy only for violations by \u201cholders\u201d of a retail installment sales contract, and it contends that it is not a holder under C.L. \u00a7 12-60K7).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Second, appellee argues that C.L. \u00a7 12-630(a)(3) authorizes a civil remedy only for a finance charge in excess of the rates defined in C.L. \u00a7 12-609 or C.L. 12-610. Because the disclosure requirement in C.L. \u00a7 12-609(g) has nothing to do with the overall rate of the finance charge, appellee contends that C.L. \u00a7 12-630 provides no remedy. Appellant responds, however, that C.L. \u00a7 12-609(g) is impliedly within the purview of C.L. \u00a7 12-630, because the provision is found in a section titled \u201cMaximum Charge on Vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">On June 27, 1997, Loyola Ford gave the following answer to an interrogatory propounded by appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\"><em>Interrogatory No. 28: </em>If this Defendant does not contend that it received no other credits, bonuses, or any other funds from the Seller from whom it purchased the Taurus and that $25,919.10 was the final and actual amount paid by it for the Taurus, list and describe all bonuses, other funds and credits received by t3his [sic] Defendant from: 1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>sale of the Taurus to the Plaintiff and, 2) the purchase of the Taurus by the Defendant from its supplier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\"><em>Answer: </em>Defendant objects to this Interrogatory on the ground that it is ambiguous and confusing. Notwithstanding this objection and without waiving said objection, <em>Defendant responds that it did not receive any bonuses, credits or other funds as a result of the sale of the Taurus to the Plaintiffs.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">At the summary judgment hearing, the court expressed concern that appellee had been less than forthright in its answer to appellant\u2019s interrogatory. Appellee defended its answer by contending that the question asked whether Loyola Ford had profited from the sale, not whether it profited from the financing of the Taurus. Characterizing appellee\u2019s response as a \u201cdiscovery violation,\u201d the court invited appellant to file a post-judgment motion articulating a theory by which the court could impose a \u201ccreative penalty\u201d for Loyola Ford\u2019s response to appellant\u2019s interrogatory. Nevertheless, the court agreed with appellee that even if Loyola Ford violated the RISA, summary judgment was proper because, as a matter of law, no civil remedy was available to appellant for a violation of the relevant statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Our review of the record reveals an important threshold issue, which was not presented or considered below, but which may be dispositive of this particular claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The retail installment sales contract, dated May 26, 1995, was signed by appellant. It contains the following language: \u201cThis contract is accepted by the creditor (seller) and assigned to Chrysler Credit Corporation in accordance with the terms of the assignment set forth on the reverse hereof.\u201d Further, the words \u201cChrysler Credit Corporation\u201d are printed, in large type, at the top of the page. On the reverse side of the document, a lengthy paragraph entitled \u201cAssignment\u201d provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">ON VALUE RECEIVED the Creditor (Seller) named on the face of this contract (\u201cSeller\u201d) hereby sells, assigns and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>transfers to Chrysler Credit Corporation (\u201cChrysler\u201d) Seller\u2019s entire right, title and interest in and to this contract and authorizes Chrysler to do every act and thing necessary to collect and discharge obligations arising out of or incident to this contract and assignment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The question of whether the contract language was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of C.L. \u00a7 12-609(g) was not addressed or considered at the hearing. In arguing the matter before the court, appellee\u2019s counsel merely said: \u201c[I]f there was a violation, <em>and I do not agree that there was </em>\u2014 \u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We do not know why appellee did not raise the issue of statutory compliance, but we do know that the dealer did not have much time to develop its legal and factual arguments. As we observed earlier, appellant first added this RISA claim on October 7, 1997. By then, appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion was already pending. The dealer promptly moved to strike the claim as untimely filed, and the motion to strike was pending when summary judgment was considered. Moreover, on October 16,1997, a few days after the new RISA claim was filed, and shortly before the summary judgment hearing of October 27, 1997, appellee endeavored to address the new RISA claim in a \u201creply\u201d memorandum, filed in support of its motion for summary judgment. In that memorandum, appellee merely contended that the RISA did not provide a private remedy for a violation of C.L. \u00a7 12-609(g). Although appellee did not admit that it violated the statute, neither did it contend that it had complied with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In our review of the grant of summary judgment, we ordinarily will uphold the trial judge only on the grounds relied upon by the judge. <em>Boyd v. Hickman, </em>114 Md.App. at 186, 689 A.2d 106. At the time of the summary judgment hearing, given the posture of the case, the terms of the actual retail installment agreement were unexplored. Because the question of whether the agreement complied with the RISA is potentially dispositive, we shall neither affirm nor reverse the court\u2019s entry of summary judgment with respect to this por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>tion of Count II.

Appellee vigorously protested the belated filing of the Second Amended Complaint in a motion to strike filed on October 16, 1997.

The record does not explain why the total amount financed in the May 26, 1995, retail installment sales contract is $220.00 more than the total balance listed in the May 29 buyer\u2019s order. Nevertheless, the May 26 retail installment sales contract reflects the downpayment terms described in the May 29 buyer\u2019s order, not the May 25 buyer\u2019s order, i.e., a $1,500.00 Ford Rebate and the $1,000.00 net trade-in allowance. As noted, a new retail installment sales contract was not executed subsequent to the May 29 buyer\u2019s order. Furthermore, for reasons that are not entirely clear, appellant considers the May 25 buyer\u2019s order, not the one completed on May 29, as \"The contract of sale of the Taurus.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">.

This is also a violation of Consumer Protection Law.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief does not explain the basis for his assertion, nor what part of the consumer protection law appellee allegedly transgressed. Loyola Ford explains that the first payment on the retail installment contract was not due until July 10, 1995, which was fifteen days longer than the typical thirty-day installment period. According to appellee, interest on the additional fifteen day period was calculated at a rate of 16.75% per annum, and amortized over the sixty month period of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In his reply brief, appellant asserts that Loyola Ford's calculation violated C.L. \u00a7 12-611(c), \"which does not permit installments of more than one month,\u201d and C.L. \u00a7 12-609, \"which permits the charging of simple interest rate charges \u2014 not compounding.\u201d Appellant still does not explain why the rate charged was equivalent to 17.07%. Moreover, appellee has had no opportunity to respond to appellant\u2019s argument, laid out for the first time in his reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Maryland Rule 8-504(a)(5) provides that a brief shall contain an \u201d[a]rgument in support of the party\u2019s position.\u201d Failure to articulate an argument in an opening brief constitutes a waiver of that issue. <em>See Health Servs. Cost Review Comm\u2019n v.
