The judgment was the result of Muller\u2019s failure to pay appellant for services provided to his wife at appellant\u2019s nursing home facility. After Muller\u2019s death on April 12, 1997, appellant filed a claim with the Register of Wills for Montgomery County against appellee, the Estate of Robert Gustav Muller, for $18,343.26. Appellee neither paid the claim nor filed a Notice of Disallowance to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">On September 23, 1997, appellant filed a petition with the Register of Wills for allowance of the full amount of the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>and appellee filed a response on November 7, 1997. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County, wherein the judge sat as the Orphans\u2019 Court, held a hearing on December 19, 1997 concerning appellant\u2019s Petition for Allowance. Following the hearing, the court considered memoranda submitted by the parties and, on February 25,1998, issued an order and opinion denying appellant\u2019s claim. Appellant timely filed notice of appeal on March 25, 1998 and presents two questions for our review that we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\">I. Was the denial of appellant\u2019s Petition for Allowance of a claim within the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">II. Did the Orphans\u2019 Court err by not giving <em>res judicata </em>effect to the district court\u2019s affidavit judgment and denying appellant\u2019s claim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">We answer the first question in the negative, thereby reversing the court\u2019s judgment and remanding for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Consequently, we decline to discuss appellant\u2019s second question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">On or about September 22, 1994, appellant\u2019s nursing home facility, Layhill Center, admitted Robert Gustav Muller\u2019s wife, Mary A. Gill, as a resident. At the time of admission, Muller signed two documents, both of which were countersigned by a facility representative. First, as his wife\u2019s \u201csponsor,\u201d Muller agreed to long-term care by signing the \u201cMaryland Admission Agreement.\u201d Additionally, Muller initialed and signed a twelve-paragraph document that acknowledged his rights and obligations as the sponsor. Gill spent approximately one year at the nursing home before her death in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">Following Gill\u2019s death, appellant was unsuccessful in collecting the $15,744.33 of debt incurred during her period of residence. Appellant filed suit, including an affidavit and supporting documentation, against Muller in the district court for the services provided and attorney\u2019s fees, which together totaled $18,343.26. Muller, however, failed to appear or otherwise defend himself at the February 26, 1997 trial. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>of Muller\u2019s absence from the trial, appellant moved for an affidavit judgment that the district court granted on March 21, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">On April 12, 1997, Muller died and, on April 23, 1997, appellant filed a claim with the Register of Wills for Montgomery County against appellee in the amount of $18,343.26. Appellee did not file a Notice of Disallowance in response to appellant\u2019s claim. After failing to obtain payment, appellant filed a Petition for Allowance on September 23, 1997 to which appellee responded on November 7, 1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Register of Wills set a hearing on the petition for December 19, 1997 in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, the judge sitting as the Orphans\u2019 Court. After oral arguments, the lower court considered legal memoranda submitted by the parties and, on February 25, 1998, issued an order and opinion denying appellant\u2019s claim. Appellant timely noted an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Appellant asserts that the denial of its Petition for Allowance was not within the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court. Before addressing the merits of appellant\u2019s jurisdictional contention, we shall explain briefly the procedural principles concerning orphans\u2019 courts. A judge of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, pursuant to a constitutional grant of authority, may sit as an Orphans\u2019 Court. <em>See </em>Md. Const, art IV, \u00a7 20(b). When a trial judge sits as a judge on the Orphans\u2019 Court, however, the judge does not exercise circuit court authority. <em>See Barter Systems, Inc. v. Rosner, </em>64 Md.App. 255, 261-62, 494 A.2d 964 (1985). Instead, the judge \u201cpossesses no more authority in that case than that conferred by the legislature upon the Orphans\u2019 Courts of this State.\u201d <em>Barter Systems, </em>64 Md.App. at 262, 494 A.2d 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Turning to both the authority of the Orphans\u2019 Court and appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate its claim, we note the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">It must be remembered that Orphans\u2019 Courts are not courts of general jurisdiction; on the contrary, they are courts of special and limited jurisdiction only, and they cannot, under pretext of incidental or constructive authority, exercise jurisdiction not expressly conferred by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Crandall v. Crandall, </em>218 Md. 598, 600, 147 A.2d 754 (1959)). Because the lower court was limited to the authority \u201cexpressly conferred by law,\u201d it is necessary to examine an Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s statutory authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Section 2-102(a) of the Estates and Trusts Article addresses such authority. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">(a) <em>Powers. </em>\u2014 The court may conduct judicial probate, direct the conduct of a personal representative, and pass orders which may be required in the course of the administration of an estate of a decedent....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Md.Code (1991 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.), Est. &amp; Trusts (E.T.) \u00a7 2-102(a). In a prior interpretation of this enumerated power, we concluded that \u201c[t]he [0]rphans[\u2019][C]ourt has jurisdiction to consider and adjudicate claims against an estate.\u201d <em>Barter Systems, </em>64 Md.App. at 262, 494 A.2d 964 (citing <em>Schaefer v. Heaphy, </em>45 Md.App. 144, 154, 412 A.2d 107 (1980)). Moreover, the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court is binding and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>enforceable on the parties. <em>See Schaefer, </em>45 Md.App. at 153-54, 412 A.2d 107. Thus, despite the limited nature of an Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s power, Maryland law clearly allows the court to adjudicate a claim against an estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Appellant argues, however, that, because the March 21, 1997 affidavit judgment converted its claim into a final judgment, the lower court\u2019s jurisdiction was limited to a determination of whether the judgment was valid and unbarred. We agree. Appellant obtained a judgment for $18,343.26 in the district court, and the court erred as a matter of law by setting aside the judgment. In <em>Millison v. Ades of Lexington, Inc., </em>262 Md. 319, 328, 277 A.2d 579 (1971), the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">A judgment by default, while it may require extension by way of proof of damages ... is still final in respect of the question of the liability of the party against whom it is obtained. \u201cLike every other judgment, it is conclusive of every fact necessary to uphold it.\u201d This Court cannot go behind the judgment by default to examine into and determine upon the validity of the cause of action upon which suit is instituted, and any testimony offered to contradict liability is inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">(Citations omitted.) Thus, the district court\u2019s judgment was final and, after thirty days, only could be revised upon a showing of fraud, mistake, or irregularity. <em>See Tandra S. v. Tyrone </em>W., 336 Md. 303, 313, 648 A.2d 439 (1994), Md. Rule 2-535(b) (1998); Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. (C.J.) \u00a7 6-08.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>This conclusion finds further support in our earlier decision of <em>Gotham Hotels, Ltd. v. Owl Club, Inc., </em>26 Md.App. 158, 337 A.2d 117 (1975). In <em>Gotham, </em>we held that \u201cbefore an equity court may set aside a judgment in law the party attacking the judgment must allege and prove extrinsic fraud, such fraud as ... \u2018actually prevents an adversarial trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174, 337 A.2d 117 (citation omitted). In the instant case, the district court\u2019s entry of an affidavit judgment against the decedent was a judgment at law and the Orphans\u2019 Court exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the judgment absent allegations and proof of extrinsic fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">There is concern that appellant requested the court to adjudicate its claim and, after being denied, now challenges the court\u2019s jurisdiction to exercise such authority. Appellant\u2019s Petition for Allowance includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">1. Mary A. Gill, the Decedent\u2019s wife, was a resident at [appellant\u2019s] nursing home facility. While in the said nursing home, she received services, for which the Decedent agreed to pay, and for which total services were Fifteen Thousand Seven Hundred Fourty-four Dollars and thirty-three cents ($15,744.33) as per the attached bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">2. The services were proper, and the charges therefore are reasonable and customary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">3. That as a result of nonpayment by the Decedent, [appellant] obtained a judgment against the Decedent in the District Court of Maryland for Montgomery County in the sum of Fifteen Thousand Seven Hundred Fourty-four Dollars and thirty-three cents ($15,744.33) plus attorney\u2019s fees of Two Thousand Three Hundred Sixty-one Dollars and sixty-five cents ($2,361.65) and court costs in the amount of Fifty-five Dollars ($55.00) plus post judgment interest. A copy of said judgment is attached herewith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">4. That the total amount due and owing as shown on the attached worksheet is Eighteen Thousand Three Hundred Forty-three Dollars and twenty-six cents ($18,343.26)[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">5. That the Decedent\u2019s estate has not filed a Notice of Disallowance of the claim which was filed on April 23, 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>WHEREFORE, [appellant] requests this claim for the balance in the amount of Eighteen' Thousand Three Hundred Forty-three Dollars and twenty-six cents ($18,343.26) be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Although appellant\u2019s petition included language stating that \u201cthe [d]ecedent agreed to pay\u201d and \u201cthe services were proper, and the charges therefore are reasonable and customary,\u201d appellant did not request an adjudication of his claim against appellee. Instead, as reflected in the petition, appellant requested the court to allow the claim that had been enrolled as a judgment by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The court\u2019s authority was limited to determining whether there was a valid, unpaid judgment against the decedent. The Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s authority is codified in E.T. \u00a7 8-107(c), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">(c) <em>By the court. </em>\u2014 If no action is taken by the personal representative disallowing a claim in whole or in part under subsection (a), upon the petition of the personal representative or a claimant, the court shall allow or disallow in whole or in part a claim or claims presented to the personal representative or filed with the register in due time and not barred by subsection (a) of this section....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Appellee did not file any notice disallowing appellant\u2019s claim after the claim was filed on April 23, 1997. Pursuant to E.T. \u00a7 8-107, appellee\u2019s failure to file a notice of disallowance did not affect the lower court\u2019s ability to allow or disallow appellant\u2019s claim based on whether the claim was valid and unbarred. As discussed above, however, the court was without authority to hold a hearing and perform an independent adjudication of appellant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, E.T. \u00a7 8-107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>supports appellant\u2019s claim that the court erred by conducting an independent hearing and failing to enter an order directing appellee to pay the claim once it had been reduced to a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">. Meanwhile, in the district court, appellee had moved for reconsideration of the affidavit judgment because Muller never read the Notice of Entry of Affidavit Judgment that the court sent to him. The district court, however, denied appellee\u2019s motion on December 16, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-10\">. Prior to 1969, Article 93 of the Annotated Code of Maryland governed the jurisdiction of the Oiphans' Courts. In 1965, however, the Register of Wills of Maryland sponsored a resolution that requested appointment of a gubernatorial commission to study and revise Maryland testamentary law. The General Assembly enacted, Joint Resolution No. 23 of 1965, and Governor Tawes appointed a commission headed by William L. Henderson, former Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals. In The Second Report of the Henderson Commission, dated December 5, 1968, the commission proposed a comprehensive recodification and revision of Maryland testamentary law. Chapter 11 of the Acts of 1974 created the Estates and Trusts Article. The procedures and powers of the Orphans' Courts, however, underwent minimal change. <em>See </em>Shale D. Stiller and Roger D. Redden, <em>Statutory Reform in the Administration of Estates of Maryland Decedents, Minors and Incompetents, </em>29 Md. L.Rev. 85, 90 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b702-8\">. No action was taken within thirty days of the district court\u2019s March 21, 1997 affidavit judgment. Muller died on April 12, 1997 \u2014 twenty-two days after the affidavit judgment. The failure to move to vacate may well have been attributed to poor health as well as his ultimate demise. Had a proper motion to vacate been filed timely, we believe that the court could have considered Muller\u2019s death and any assertion that he was too ill to attend the hearing. We, therefore, do not pass on the merits of the district court\u2019s decision denying the motion to vacate, but rather conclude that this appeal must be decided on the narrow question of the finality of the affidavit judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b704-9\">. We note that, in <em>Schaefer v. Heaphy, </em>45 Md.App. 144, 154, 412 A.2d 107 (1980), this Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">A creditor whose claim has been disallowed by the personal representative may litigate the issue in the [0]rphans\u2019 [C]ourt; and, if he chooses to do so and is successful, the order of that tribunal is binding upon and enforceable against the personal representative. The deficiency in the authority of the [0]rphans\u2019 [C]ourt ... which effectuated its lack or loss of \"jurisdiction\u201d has now been overcome. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number><em>Schaefer, </em>although holding that the Orphans' Court had jurisdiction over litigation of a personal represent ative\u2019s claim, is distinguishable. In the instant case, appellee did not file a notice of disallowance of appellant\u2019s claim; therefore, the claim never was disallowed, preventing litigation of the claim\u2019s validity in the Orphans\u2019 Court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
