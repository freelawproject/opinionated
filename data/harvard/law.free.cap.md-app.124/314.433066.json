SMITH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A00\">(Retired, Specially Assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">Appellant, Hassan Hamdan (Hamdan or appellant), a Harford County pawnbroker, contended unsuccessfully in the Circuit Court for Harford County that sections 188-3 and 188-4 of the Harford County Code were preempted by Title 12 of the Maryland Business Regulation Article. Section 188-3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>requires \u201c[ejvery pawnbroker doing business in the county\u201d to submit to \u201cthe Sheriff of the County, a list of articles bought, traded or pledged\u201d daily. Section 188-4 spells out in detail what must be included in that list. We would affirm but for the failure of the trial court to issue a declaratory judgment. For that reason we shall vacate the judgment below and remand this case for entry of a declaratory judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Questions presented by Hamdan are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">(1) Are the Harford County Ordinances which the Harford County Government found appellant to have violated preempted by Title 12 of the Maryland Business Regulation Article?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">(2) Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Harford County Government did have jurisdiction to regulate appellant\u2019s activities as a pawnbroker, did the Harford County Government err in failing to explain the basis of its decision and failing to address appellant\u2019s argument that twenty-three of the items which appellant allegedly failed to report to the Harford County Government fell outside of the Harford County Government\u2019s jurisdiction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Not surprisingly, Klimovitz, Harford County\u2019s Director of Administration, and Harford County see the matter somewhat differently. The questions as presented by him and the County on his behalf are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">(1) Is the decision of the Harford County Director of Administration, Larry W. Klimovitz, or the decision of the Harford County Director of the Department of Inspections, Licenses and Permits, Richard D. Lynch, subject to appeal to the Circuit Court (as opposed to judicial review by means of an original action filed in the Circuit Court)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">(2) Is Hamdan entitled to a writ of mandamus preventing the two months suspension of his pawnbroker\u2019s license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">(3) Does Title 12 of the Maryland Business Regulation Article which regulates dealers and, under certain cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>cumstances, pawnbrokers preempt\" Chapter 188 of the Harford County Code which regulates pawnbrokers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">(4) Is the Harford County Director of Administration, Larry W. Klimovitz, required to make findings of fact or to explain the basis of his decision when he is not the administrative agency that suspended Hamdan\u2019s license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">We distill the issues before the Court into:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">(1) Was the case properly before the trial court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">(2) Were the findings of fact adequate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">(3) Was the Harford County public local law preempted by state law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">(4) Was the trial judge\u2019s decision otherwise correct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">This case is a procedural mess, as -will appear as we set forth the proceedings in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">Harford County, pursuant to the home rule provisions of the Maryland Constitution, has adopted a charter. Accordingly, it is permitted to enact public local laws applicable to that county. As previously indicated, Chapter 188 of its county code in section 188-3, requires every pawnbroker doing business in the county to supply daily to the sheriff of that county \u201ca list of articles bought, traded or pledged,\u201d while section 188-4 states what must be included in that list.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Appellant is a pawnbroker in the Edgewood section of Harford County, trading as Starlite Coin &amp; Pawn. During the week of March 30, 1992, representatives of the Harford County Sheriffs Office visited him and explained to him legal requirements relative to his reporting of pawn transactions. This was shortly after he began business. Thereafter, the sheriffs department by letter dated April 27, 1992, advised him that he had not complied with the regulation and if he failed to do so \u201cwithin 10 business days of the date of receipt of [the] letter,\u201d action would \u201cbe taken to suspend [his] license ----\u201d This letter was sent certified mail, return receipt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>requested. Apparently, he understood this language because he seems to have complied with the reporting requirements for a substantial period of time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In June of 1995, the Harford County Sheriffs Office, while investigating a breaking and entering, discovered that the alleged victim had rented a VCR and television from another place of business and then pawned them at Hamdan\u2019s establishment. This took place on two separate dates in May of 1995. These items were reported as stolen in the breaking and entering. Investigators discovered that there was no report from Hamdan concerning these pawn transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Under date of June 27, 1995, the sheriffs office brought to the attention of Richard Lynch, Director of Inspections, Licenses, and Permits of Harford County, these derelictions and other factors which suggested to that office \u201cthe possibility that [pawn] tickets [were] being issued for items not reported to the Sheriffs Office.\u201d The sheriffs office \u201crequested] that [Lynch] consider a suspension/revocation hearing concerning this matter.\u201d A hearing was held. Hamdan appeared and was represented by counsel. Lynch\u2019s decision was announced in a letter to Hamdan\u2019s attorney that stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">\u201cCorrespondence dated April 27, 1992, from Deputy First Class Diane Newton specifically apprised your client of Section 188-3 of the Harford County Code and warned him at that time that he must comply with that regulation. Your client\u2019s testimony at the hearing informed this Administrator that on or about January of 1995 <em>he elected independently to operate his own pawn shop outside the requirements of Harford County Code Section 188-3 and Section 188-4-. </em>When I questioned as to why he changed his business practice <em>he informed me that it was simply to save unnecessary paperwork for his business as well as the Sheriff\u2019s Department. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>operators\u2019s license effective September 15, 1995 to November 15,1995.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>CONCLUSION: I find that your client did freely and willingly operate his pawn shop in direct violation of Harford County Code Section 188-3 and hereby suspend his</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>I also find that your client did freely and willing operate his pawn shop in direct violation of Harford County Code Section 188-4(A) and hereby suspend his operators [sic] license effective September 15, 1995 to November 15, 1995.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Hamdan was advised of a right of appeal to Larry W. Klimovitz, Harford County\u2019s Director of Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">No issue was raised before Lynch concerning the preemption by state statute of the county code provisions relative to pawnbrokers here in question. No evidence was presented to show that twenty-three of the 129 items at issue met the definition of \u201cprecious metal object\u201d under the state statute and thus, pursuant to a contention presented to us, could not be policed or regulated by the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Harford County has in effect what it calls \u201cAdministrative Rules of Procedure for Regulations and Hearings.\u201d These are not laws. Rule R-2.4 provides that in a situation such as the case at bar an appeal lies to the Director of Administration, which Klimovitz is. Hamdan appealed. He appears to have raised the preemption issue for the first time before Klimovitz, who found no preemption and upheld the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Hamdan then filed in the Circuit Court for Harford County what he styled as a petition for judicial review of the decision of Klimovitz, attaching a copy of that decision. The County countered on behalf of Klimovitz with a motion to dismiss. (In an earlier generation we would have referred to it as a demurrer.) The motion asserted that the court was \u201cwithout jurisdiction to hear an appeal of the County Administrative Decision at issue .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Hamdan then filed an amended petition. He said he \u201camend[ed] his Petition for Judicial Review and, in the alternative, brings an action for declaratory relief ____\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>asserted that \u201cthe Klimovitz decision was arbitrary and capricious and ... otherwise illegal\u201d because of the alleged preemption; that if the code provisions did apply to him, \u201cthe hearing below was contaminated with illegal evidence since the allegations against Mr. Hamdan included the assertion that [he] had violated the Harford County Code by failing to report property items which clearly fell within the category of second hand precious metal objects, coins and numismatic items\u201d (exempt under the state statute from regulation); that his right to appellate review was limited because the proceeding before Klimovitz \u201cwas not stenographically recorded or transcribed but, instead, was notated by secretarial shorthand\u201d; and that the decision by Klimovitz \u201cfail[ed] to make a specific finding of fact as to why he chose to uphold the two-month suspension at issue and, therefore, violate[d] Mr. Hamdan\u2019s right to be informed as to the basis of the decision,\u201d which, he said, \u201cconstitut[ed] a deprivation of Mr. Hamdan\u2019s rights to due process.\u201d He prayed a declaration that the decision was \u201carbitrary and capricious, illegal and ... otherwise null and void .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The trial judge treated the action as one for mandamus. He regarded this proceeding as governed by the Administrative Procedure Act and thus the test was whether there was substantial evidence from the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s decision. He found no conflict between the State and County laws. Among other things, he pointed to the revisor\u2019s note to Title 12 of the Business Regulation Article, which we shall later quote. He found without merit the argument that there were insufficient findings of fact. He further found that Hamdan \u201cknowingly chose to disregard\u201d the requirements for reports to the sheriffs office. Noting that the license at issue here \u201ceasily could have [been] suspended ... for a longer and perhaps more appropriate time period,\u201d but instead was suspended for but two months, he said that he \u201cw[ould] not second guess or modify the suspension period of Appellant\u2019s license.\u201d Accordingly, the decision of the Director of Administration was affirmed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>I. Was the Case Properly Before the Trial Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Klimovitz argues that the administrative decisions here are not subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and thus are not subject to appeal to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">No one has pointed to a statutory provision for appeal to the circuit court. Such would be necessary for there to be a right of appeal. In <em>Urbana Civic Assn., Inc. v. Urbana Mobile Village, Inc., </em>260 Md. 458, 272 A.2d 628 (1971), the Court of Appeals was faced with an attempt to appeal approval of a subdivision plat for a mobile home park. Judge Digges there said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">We have determined ... that not only must the appellants\u2019 case be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in this Court, Maryland Rule 835(a)(2) and (b)(1), but the appellee\u2019s initial appeal to the circuit court must also be dismissed for a lack of jurisdiction in that court. <em>See Barnett v. Charles County, </em>206 Md. 478, 485, 112 A.2d 492 (1955).\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 460, 272 A.2d 628.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The Court further said that the actions there in question were not \u201creviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act since county agencies are not included within its provisions,\u201d and that \u201cit should not be thought that the Maryland Rules regulating appeals from administrative agencies ... can grant a right of appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462, 272 A.2d 628. The opinion concluded by stating, \u201cNeither the appellant nor the appellee are without a remedy, for they may utilize mandamus or seek appropriate equitable relief in an original action in their attempt to resolve the legal status of the proposed mobile home park.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 272 A.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Although perhaps inartfully phrased, we regard Hamdan\u2019s \u201camended petition for judicial review\u201d as essentially an original action for declaratory relief. Obviously, as we shall point out, if this were an action for declaratory relief the trial court had jurisdiction, notwithstanding the fact that the trial judge addressed the issues in terms of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Maryland Code (1973, 1998 Repl.Vol.), section 3-403(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article states, \u201cExcept for the District Court, a court of record within its jurisdiction may declare rights, status and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">It follows that the County was in error when it suggested to the trial judge in its response to the amended petition that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the cause of action and that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Citing almost a half-page listing of cases, the Court of Appeals in <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>303 Md. 461, 465, 494 A.2d 934 (1985), pointed out that \u201c[Regions of [its] cases hold that a demurrer, the type of motion to dismiss [t]here involved, rarely is appropriate in a declaratory judgment action.\u201d The <em>Broadwater </em>court quoted from <em>Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 237 A.2d 35 (1968), where Chief Judge Hammond said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">The reason is plain why a demurrer should be used in declaratory judgment actions only to challenge the legal availability or appropriateness of the remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u2018Where the plaintiffs pleading sets forth an actual or justiciable controversy, it is not subject to demurrer since it sets forth a cause of action, even though the plaintiff may not be entitled to a favorable declaration on the facts stated in his complaint; that is, in passing on the demurrer, the court is not concerned with the question whether the plaintiff is right in a controversy, but only with whether he is entitled to a declaration of rights with respect to the matters alleged.\u2019 22 Am.Jur.2d <em>Declaratory Judgments, </em>\u00a7 91 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 409, 237 A.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">This became an original action for declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Harford County. It thus became the duty of the trial judge then to declare the rights of the parties, even though such declaration might be contrary to that sought by the complaining party. The Circuit Court for Harford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>County had subject matter jurisdiction and the amended complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Because there was jurisdiction in the lower court to decide this case upon the request for a declaratory judgment we have no need to consider the issue of mandamus upon which the trial judge rested his decision. On this subject <em>see Goodwich v. Nolan, </em>343 Md. 130, 145-47, 680 A.2d 1040 (1996), and <em>Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 514, 331 A.2d 55 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">II. Were the Findings of Fact Adequate?</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Appellant contends that the decision is arbitrary and capricious because \u201cthe Harford County Government ... fail[ed] to explain the basis of its decision and failed to address appellant\u2019s argument that twenty-three of the items which appellant allegedly failed to report ... fell outside of [its] jurisdiction,\u201d being second-hand precious metal objects and therefore within the jurisdiction of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">This Court has recently reiterated the requirement that agencies must make and disclose findings of fact and conclusions of law when rendering decisions. <em>See Mission Helpers v. Beasley, </em>82 Md.App. 155, 164, 570 A.2d 382 (1990). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission was the agency there involved. Judge Wilner there said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">For those agencies subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, the requirement that the agency make and disclose specific findings of fact and conclusions of law is statutory. <em>See </em>Md. State Gov\u2019t Code Ann., \u00a7 10-214. But even agencies, such as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, that are not under that Act are subject to that requirement. In <em>Blue Bird Cab v. Dep\u2019t Emp. Sec., </em>251 Md. 458, 466, 248 A.2d 331 (1968), the Court held that \u201ca fundamental requirement of the due process of law in a quasi-judicial proceeding is the right of the parties to be apprised of the facts relied upon by the tribunal in its decision.\u201d <em>See also Baker v. Board of Trustees, </em>269 Md. 740, 747, 309 A.2d 768 (1973); <em>Turner v. Hammond, </em>270 Md. 41, 55-56, 310 A.2d 543 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>(1973); <em>Ocean Hideaway Condo, v. Boardwalk Plaza, </em>68 Md.App. 650, 656, 515 A.2d 485 (1986).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">It is not necessary for the Commission to write lengthy opinions, and indeed that is not what the claimant sought in this case. It is necessary only that, when deciding a claim or otherwise ruling upon substantive issues, the Commission state the basis for its decision or ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 164, 570 A.2d 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In the context of Code (1977, 1992 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 12-208(b) of the Transportation Art. and Code (1984,1993 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-214(b) of the State Government Art., Judge Chasanow said for the Court in <em>Forman v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>332 Md. 201, 630 A.2d 753 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">The purpose and effect of these sections is to provide the parties and, ultimately, a reviewing court, with the ability to understand the basis for the ALJ\u2019s decision. And, as Judge Adkins said with respect to \u00a7 10-214(b) in <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Mohler, </em>318 Md. 219, 230, 567 A.2d 929, 935 (1990),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">\u201c[i]f hearing examiners followed this directive scrupulously, it would be helpful to us, to the circuit courts, and to the hearing examiners themselves, for a careful statement of facts and conclusions would force the examiner to focus on the evidence presented and its sufficiency to support a particular conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq65\">Without findings of fact on all material issues, and without a clear statement of the rationale behind the ALJ\u2019s action, a reviewing court cannot properly perform its function. <em>See Harford County v. Preston, </em>322 Md. 493, 505, 588 A.2d 722 [772], 778 (1991) (\u201cThis requirement is in recognition of the fundamental right of a party to a proceeding before an administrative agency to be apprised of the facts relied upon by the agency in reaching its decision and to permit meaningful judicial review of those findings.\u201d); <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Ziegler, </em>244 Md. 224, 229, 223 A.2d 255, 257-58 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>(1966) (remanding case to zoning authority to provide factual basis and reasons for its action).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 220-21, 630 A.2d 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In this case, Klimovitz, as Director of Administration, was not the \u201cagency\u201d rendering the decision to suspend Hamdan\u2019s license. That agency was the Department of Inspections, Licenses and Permits. Klimovitz merely reviewed that decision on appeal under the existing County procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">We have heretofore set forth that which the Director of the Department of Inspections, Licenses and Permits said in his letter to Hamdan\u2019s counsel. The director sufficiently explained his decision in his letter. Appellant thus was apprised of the facts and reasons leading to the suspension of his license. Moreover, the director outlined the relevant testimony received leading to his conclusion that appellant was in violation of certain County code provisions. He specified those code sections appellant was found to have violated. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">III. Was the Harford County Ordinance Preempted by State Law?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Appellant argues that the pawnbroker\u2019s licensing provisions in Chapter .188 of the Harford County Code are not applicable to him because he holds a license to do business as a second-hand precious metal objects dealer issued by the State of Maryland pursuant to Title 12 of the Business Regulation Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland. He contends that the State licensing statute for second hand precious metal dealers completely preempts County regulations governing pawnbrokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">State law establishes the following statutory scheme. Under the Second-hand Precious Metal Object Dealers and Pawnbrokers Act, Code (1992), Section 12-102(d)(l) of the Business Regulation Article, explicitly provides, \u201cA county or municipal corporation may not enact a law to regulate dealers, coins, or numismatic items.\u201d However, the statute also provides that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided in this title, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>title does not apply to a pawnbroker located in a county that regulates pawnbrokers unless the pawnbroker does business as a dealer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12-102(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Surprisingly, neither party cited <em>Talbot County v. Skipper, </em>329 Md. 481, 620 A.2d 880 (1993), probably the leading recent case on preemption. There Judge Eldridge said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">Under our decisions, state law may preempt local law in one of three ways: 1) preemption by conflict, 2) express preemption, or 3) implied preemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 620 A.2d 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We found it significant in the recent case of <em>Dashiell Realty v. Wicomico Cty., </em>122 Md.App. 239, 249, 712 A.2d 104 (1998), where there was a contention that a county was barred from imposing conditions on a special exception by state regulation of solid waste, that the state statute there at issue required as a prerequisite to issuing a waste disposal permit a finding that a site met all zoning requirements. Here, the statute also provides, as we have said, that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this title, this title does not apply to a pawnbroker located in a county that regulates pawnbrokers unless the pawnbroker does business as a dealer.\u201d Code (1992) \u00a7 12-102(c) of the Business Regulations Article. The trial judge found significant, as we have said, the \u201cGeneral Revisor\u2019s Note to Title 12 of the Business Regulation Article.\u201d He quoted the portion which said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">After much deliberation, the Business Regulation Committee decided to revise the definition of dealer to limit the extent to which pawnbrokers are covered by this title ... Pawnbrokers are covered by this law if they are acting as dealers in particular transactions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-101(b) of this Title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Clearly, the General Assembly intended that local jurisdictions may regulate in the area of other second hand property transactions. Therefore, if a local jurisdiction enacts legislation regulating pawn transactions, the State statute applies only to the extent that the pawnbroker is operating as a dealer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>in those transactions involving second hand precious metal objects. The controlling state statute does not explicitly preempt the authority of local jurisdictions to regulate in this area. The state statute does not regulate the field so pervasively that there is no room for county action, therefore implying that the local law is preempted. The local regulation does not conflict with the State statute. Both regulations impose certain reporting requirements that are substantially similar. Thus the laws do not conflict. There is no inconsistency in requiring that a pawnbroker obtain the necessary licenses that cover all types of transactions conducted, even if one is issued by the State while another is issued by local authorities. We find no preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">IV. Was the Trial Judge\u2019s Decision Otherwise Correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The leading case in Maryland on review of actions of administrative agencies is <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Nat\u2019l Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 236 A.2d 282 (1967). In that case Chief Judge Hammond said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">Whichever of the recognized tests the court uses-substantiality of the evidence on the record as a whole, clearly erroneous, fairly debatable or against the weight or preponderance of the evidence on the entire record \u2014 its appraisal or evaluation must be of the agency\u2019s fact-finding results and not an independent original estimate of or decision on the evidence. The required process is difficult to precisely articulate but it is plain that it requires restrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to interfere with the agency\u2019s factual conclusions under any of the tests, all of which are similar. There are differences but they are slight and under any of the standards the judicial review essentially should be limited to whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. This need not and must not be either judicial factfinding or a substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment. See 4 Davis, op. cit. \u00a7\u00a7 29.01, 29.02, 29.03, 29.06, 29.07, 29.10; 2 Cooper, op. cit. Ch. XIX, \u00a7 7; 2 Am.Jur.2d Administrative Law \u00a7\u00a7 616, 620, 621, 659, 661; the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and concurring opinions in <em>N.L.R.B. v. Southland Mfg. Co., </em>201 F.2d 244; <em>Board [of County Com\u2019rs of Prince George\u2019s County] v. Oak Hill Farms, Inc. </em>[232 Md. 274, 192 A.2d 761 (1963) 7 and <em>Board [of County Com\u2019rs of Prince George\u2019s County] v. Levitt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>[235 Md. 151, 200 A.2d 670 (1964)] both supra.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 309-10, 236 A.2d 282. Although the trial judge did not cite this case, those cases to which he did refer say essentially the same thing. Clearly, there were facts before Lynch to support the conclusions he reached, as the trial judge found.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The trial judge correctly did not attempt to substitute his judgment for that of the Secretary as to the penalty to be imposed. Such is not the function of a court on review of an action of an administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Although the opinion of the trial judge was not in the form of a declaratory decree, it was appended to the order which held \u201cthat the decision of the Director of Administration be affirmed.\u201d Its intent is clear. It was intended to declare the rights of the parties. However, in <em>Reddick v. State, </em>213 Md. 18, 31, 130 A.2d 762 (1957), Judge Prescott said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">The decree of a court of equity, and not its opinion, is the instrument through which it acts in granting relief. <em>Alleghany Corp. v. Alde. Corp., </em>173 Md. 472, 478, 196 A. 418. It is not necessary that a declaratory judgment be in any particular form, as long as the Court, <em>by its decree, </em>actually passes upon or adjudges the issues raised by the pleadings. <em>Carter et ux. v. Nance, et ux. </em>(Ky.) [304 Ky. 256], 200 S.W.2d 457, 459. And, in this regard, a finding of fact by the Court, unless it be included in the decree, is not the decree of the Court. <em>Employers Ins. Co. v. Brooks </em>(Ala.), [250 Ala. 36], 33 So.2d 3, 5. <em>Alleghany Corp. v. Alde. Corp., supra, </em>P. 480 of 173 Md.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 31,130 A.2d 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">A declaratory judgment should have been issued.
