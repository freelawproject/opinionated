At the time of the offense, Levon was fourteen years old. Levon was thereafter placed on probation, and he and his mother, Ruth A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, were ordered to pay restitution of $443.73 to the owner of the vehicle. In addition, Ms. A. was ordered to pay restitution of $1,690.17 to the owner\u2019s insurance company, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">On appeal, we are asked to consider one question: \u201cDid the juvenile court err in ordering Levon and his mother to pay restitution totalling $2,133.90?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>we are convinced that it did. Accordingly, we shall vacate the order of restitution and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings. We shall also deny the State\u2019s \u201cMotion to Strike Appendix to Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief\u201d, in which the State complains about a six-page excerpt of the transcript from the exceptions hearing that was appended to the reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Levon was charged in a delinquency petition with various offenses stemming from his alleged involvement in October 1996 in the theft and unauthorized use of a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee, including theft over $300, in violation of Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 342; unauthorized use, in violation of Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 349; and malicious destruction of property, in violation of Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 111. An adjudicatory hearing was conducted by a juvenile master on February 28, 1997, at which several witnesses testified. What follows is a summary of the evidence adduced at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">H. Edward Andrews III, an attorney, was the owner of the Jeep. He testified that on the morning of October 17, 1996, he drove his automobile to the District Court located on North Avenue in Baltimore City to meet with a prosecutor about a case. At about 9:15 a.m., Andrews parked his vehicle on a street behind the courthouse, secured it with \u201cThe Club,\u201d locked the doors, and went inside. When he returned approximately forty-five minutes later, the Jeep was gone. Andrews immediately reported the missing vehicle to a policeman inside the courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Later that evening, Andrews learned that his automobile had been involved in a police chase involving two juveniles. When Andrews recovered his Jeep at a Baltimore City impoundment lot, he observed that it was damaged on the front and right side, the ignition was missing, and glass from the right rear passenger window littered the seat and floor. Moreover, audio tapes that had been in the glove compartment were damaged, and \u201cThe Club,\u201d approximately seventy dollars in cash and coins, a wool blanket, and a mug, were missing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>On November 27, 1996, Andrews filed a Notice of Claim for Restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Baltimore City Police Officer Anthony DiNunno testified that on the afternoon of October 17, 1996, he was in an unmarked car when he saw two boys who were too short \u201cto see over the dashboard,\u201d driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee southbound in the 4700 block of Harford Road. After verifying that the Jeep had been reported as stolen, the officer called for backup and followed the vehicle. In an attempt to evade police, the vehicle \u201csmashed\u201d into a wooden fence and \u201ccrashed\u201d into trees and shrubbery at the end of a private driveway. The \u201cvehicle [landed] in an upright position with the front wheels off the ground.\u201d The driver, fifteen-year-old Antonio John M. (John), ran from the Jeep but was apprehended nearby. Appellant, who was the passenger, was arrested before he was able to exit the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Levon testified that while walking home from school on October 17, 1996, he saw his friend, John, driving a Jeep, and John offered Levon a ride home. Levon thought his friend was old enough to drive, and that the Jeep belonged to one of John\u2019s relatives, because John\u2019s family owned several cars, including a Cadillac, a station wagon, and a truck. When Levon entered the vehicle, he claimed he did not know it had been stolen, nor did he notice the broken window or the missing ignition.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">According to Levon, before John drove Levon home, John stopped at his mother\u2019s house. Levon claimed that John told him the car was stolen when they were leaving John\u2019s house. Because Levon thought John was \u201cplaying with [him]\u201d, he did not ask John to stop the car and let him out. When Levon noticed a police car following them, however, he understood that John was serious. Levon explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">On the way from his house, he was going to drop me off at my house, so he seen the police. He\u2019s like, the police is behind us. And I was like, so? He was like, it\u2019s stolen. Then that\u2019s when I knew, because he had told me before, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>about his plans. Then when he started turning and stuff, that\u2019s when I knew he was going to wreck.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the master found that Levon had committed the offense of unauthorized use. As to the remaining counts, the master found \u201cfacts not sustained.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The master said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">The evidence in this matter is fairly clear. This young man was told that the car was stolen. He thought that [John] was joking. The window, the vent of the window was broken. The ignition was broken, although this young man said he didn\u2019t see it. He had an opportunity to see it from his vantage point in the front seat. The Respondent at least in this matter should have known the car was stolen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsJ\">On March 25, 1997, the master held a restitution hearing at which Levon was represented by counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Levon\u2019s mother was present, she did not have an attorney. Three witnesses testified: Andrews; Patricia Welch, a Claims Specialist for State Farm; and Ms. A. Andrews and State Farm claimed a total of $2,174.40 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Welch testified that the insurer paid Andrews $1,690.17 to repair the Jeep. The repairs included 1) a new front bumper cover; 2) a new ignition lock cylinder and switch assembly; 3) new weatherstripping; 4) a new rear passenger window; and 5) replacement of a decal on the front quarter-panel. Andrews testified that the items inside the vehicle that were missing or damaged had a value of $484.23, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">The Club $ 42.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">Wool Blanket $ 40.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">Mug $ 7.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">Cash and Coins $ 70.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">37 Tapes $324.73</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Andrews arrived at the values of \u201cThe Club,\u201d blanket, mug, and tapes based on the original cost of the items or by ascertaining the current replacement cost for the items. For example, he determined the price of \u201cThe Club\u201d by going to Wal-Mart, where he had purchased the item two years before the incident, and noted that the same model now sells for $42.00. The blanket was purchased in Scotland at a cost of $40.00. With regard to the cash that was in the vehicle when the offense occurred, Andrews testified that in August 1996, his daughter counted the money in his ashtray and found that he had $84.80. He estimated that he had used $14.80 for tolls and parking since that time, leaving a total of $70.00 in the vehicle at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">At the time of the restitution hearing, Ms. A. lived in an apartment with Levon and three of her other children, ages 10, 12, and 16.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Between the time of Levon\u2019s delinquent act and the time of the adjudicatory hearing, however, Ms. A.\u2019s children were in foster care, because there was no room for the children at Ms. A.\u2019s mother\u2019s house, where Ms. A. was living at the time. According to Ms. A., her children all have the same father, but he has no contact with them, and is \u201cthousands\u201d of dollars in arrears with regard to child support. Indeed, Ms. A. testified that she has never received assistance from him. Ms. A. also acknowledged that she is a former addict, and she had been incarcerated for a drug offense some three years prior to the restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">At the time of the restitution hearing, Ms. A. was employed as a housekeeper at Kernan Hospital, where she was earning $6.00 an hour. She indicated that she did not receive any additional social service benefits or a housing subsidy. According to Ms. A., her take-home pay was $197.00 a week. From that amount she paid the following, monthly expenses: $800.00 for rent, $200.00 for food,, approximately $50.00 for the telephone, $75.00 in utility fees, and $80.00 for work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>transportation. Ms. A. explained that what she spent for clothing and other items \u201cvarie[d] because I can\u2019t give them things or everybody something. Like this month, it has to be one this month and then next month and like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The master advised Ms. A. that the court could assess restitution against her as well as Levon. He then asked Ms. A. if there was anything she would like to add. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">MS. A.: Only that I\u2019m struggling, you know, I am clean and that\u2019s going on three years now. I\u2019m doing the best that I can trying to raise these children by myself. Their father has nothing to do with them. He sends them nothing. He don\u2019t see them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">THE MASTER: Well, let me ask. Has there been any order of child support passed in this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">MS. A.: Oh, yes. I mean, I have been on Social Services. I was there the majority of the time, and I did take him downtown for all of them, you know, but I have never received a check whatsoever, no child support\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">THE MASTER: Do you know how much he\u2019s in arrears, how much he owes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">MS. A.: All I know is thousands, the last that I know. I had got a letter from the Bureau of Child Enforcement, but that\u2019s been a few years ago.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">During her closing argument, Levon\u2019s counsel urged the court not to assess restitution against either Levon or his mother. Moreover, relying on <em>In re Jason W., </em>94 Md.App. 731, 619 A.2d 163 (1993), defense counsel said that she did not believe the damage to the Jeep was caused by Levon\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">Thereafter, the master recommended that Levon and his mother, \u201calong with any other responsible party,\u201d pay $443.73 in restitution to Andrews over a period of eighteen months. The master also recommended that Ms. A. pay restitution to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>State Farm in the amount of $1,690.17.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Although the master found as to Levon that \u201cthe restitution amount [was] in order as to the club, the blanket, the mug, the tapes and the cash,\u201d he reduced the value of the tapes from $324.73 to $291.43.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In ordering Levon to pay restitution, the master believed that Levon could soon secure employment. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">Well, you know, I expect what\u2019s going to happen is, he will be sixteen by the time this restitution ends up rolling around and being completed. I expect him at the time that he becomes fifteen to become employed, to search for employment. I don\u2019t expect him to sit on his rusty-gusty and not do anything. That gives him an adequate amount of time for him to become legally able to work. This gives him an adequate amount of time for him to make sincere attempts to pay the money, and that gives the court an adequate amount of time to make a determination as to whether he\u2019s making those sincere attempts, and to make adjustments to the restitution if it\u2019s necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Acknowledging that Ms. A.\u2019s job \u201cdoesn\u2019t pay that much,\u201d and that he \u201c[had] to decide how much food [he\u2019s] going to take out of her children\u2019s mouths,\u201d the master nonetheless recommended that the restitution order against Ms. A. be reduced to judgment immediately. The master explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">The real question is why we\u2019re here right now talking about this money. Why? Because this young man hopped into a vehicle that he knew was stolen. That\u2019s the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>we\u2019re here today. No other reason. And now somebody has got to pay some money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">There\u2019s a causal nexus in this because the court, the legislature as a matter of public policy in unauthorized use cases is [sic] that all people involved in the vehicle diminishes [sic] in some way the use of the vehicle. The court can\u2019t make a determination as to \u2014 the court can never under these circumstances make a determination as to who got into the vehicle, when they were driving it, et cetera. So, the court makes a determination in these matters that these people are as lawbreakers equally responsible for the damages done to the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">After the master announced his recommendation, appellant\u2019s counsel objected, focusing on the lack of a causal connection between the damages and Levon\u2019s participation, and the inability of Levon and Ms. A. to pay restitution. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Can I ask you what causal link you find between the respondent\u2019s actions and this damage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">THE MASTER: I have already explained that, [counsel], the best way I possibly can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: For the record, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">THE MASTER: That\u2019s fine, [counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Okay. And how \u2014 the respondent at age 14 with no employment, how is he expected to come up with $443.00\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">THE MASTER: He\u2019s expected to use his\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKh\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: \u2014in eighteen months?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\">THE MASTER: I expect he is expected to use his ingenuity in the same way that he hopped into this vehicle, just to use this person\u2019s car, to use his ingenuity, to make an attempt to pay the money. No attempt being made to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>this money will cause him to be in violation of probation if he\u2019s, in fact, placed on probation in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: In regard to the judgment against Mom, for the total insurance amount\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">THE MASTER: Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: \u2014you\u2019re saying that because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">THE MASTER: What I\u2019m saying is this. Unfortunately\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adv\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: \u2014of her past, you\u2019re holding her past against her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">THE MASTER: Unfortunately, unfortunately. She straightened herself out, but it\u2019s this court\u2019s opinion that if you have children, they have to be properly cared for; there has to be some sort of supervision for the children so these children don\u2019t end up in court. This young man has obviously had some problems and difficulties, but those difficulties are solely his own. He\u2019s in court because of the actions of his mother and father. His father is not here. I can\u2019t do anything with his father, and I think the mother should go up here and try to get this money from this man, who decided to dump her and these children like a piece of garbage. That\u2019s what I think.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">On April 1, 1997, Levon filed a Notice of Exception to the master\u2019s recommendation \u201cregarding restitution,\u201d contending that the State \u201cfailed to prove that the delinquent act was the cause of the car owner\u2019s damage or loss.\u201d Further, he asserted that the master failed to consider Levon\u2019s \u201cage and circumstances\u201d in ordering restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">At a hearing held on October 15, 1997, the circuit court considered appellant\u2019s exceptions with regard to restitution. Neither Levon nor his mother attended the hearing, but an attorney from the Office of the Public Defender appeared on behalf of Levon.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court indicated that it did not believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the exceptions encompassed a challenge by Ms. A. to the order of restitution. \u201cJust in case,\u201d however, the court proceeded to consider and address the master\u2019s recommendation as to restitution by Ms. A. The court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">[Initially I thought that the defense was challenging the award of restitution as to the mother, but that does not appear to be so. But just in case \u2014 and there was no argument on that other than the award \u2014 [Levon\u2019s counsel] raised in her argument the amount which was 1 thousand 690 dollars and 17 cents. There was extensive testimony taken by [the master] concerning the mother\u2019s place of employment, her prior job situation, the fact that she had three children living with her----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">[T]here was an extensive hearing. There was quite a bit of testimony taken and afterwards, [the master] ruled that the mother should, in fact, because she was in custody of the respondent at the time of this incident, should be ordered to pay 1 thousand 690 dollars and 17 cents. Court [sic] concurs with that recommendation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">With respect to the proposed order requiring Levon to pay $443.73 to the victim within eighteen months, the court concluded that the recommendation was \u201cappropriate.\u201d Accordingly, by order dated October 15, 1997, the juvenile court overruled the exceptions. The court\u2019s order \u201caffirmed\u201d the master\u2019s recommendation of March 25, 1997. Further, the order said: \u201cRespondent and parent to pay the restitution as stated in previous ordered [sic] made on 3/25/97.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We will include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Preliminarily, we must determine whether Levon alone is the appellant, or whether his mother, too, is an appellant herein. Levon\u2019s counsel noted an appeal from the judgment of restitution, but did not identify the particular parties lodging the appeal. The notice of appeal provided: \u201cPlease enter an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland from the judgment regarding restitution entered in the above-captioned case.\u201d In a footnote in appellants\u2019 brief, Levon and Ms. A. assert that this \u201cappeal is, in fact, on behalf of both Levon and his mother.\u201d The State challenges that assertion as to Ms. A., because she never filed exceptions to the master\u2019s recommendation. If the State is correct, our review would be limited to the propriety of the court\u2019s order requiring Levon to pay restitution to the owner of the vehicle in the amount of $443.73; we would have no basis to review the court\u2019s order requiring Ms. A. to pay $1,690.17 in restitution to State Farm, and making her jointly liable with Levon for the restitution due to the owner. For a variety of reasons, we disagree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">It is true that after the restitution hearing conducted by the master, a Notice of Exception was filed only on behalf of Levon. Ms. A.\u2019s appellate status does not turn on her failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>to note an exception, however. The only judgment from which an appeal could have been taken is the one from which the appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In our view, the State has conflated the issue of preservation of an issue for appellate review with the right to take an appeal from a final judgment. \u201cAppellate jurisdiction ... is [ordinarily] limited to review of final judgments.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Anderson, </em>349 Md. 294, 297, 708 A.2d 296 (1998); <em>see </em>Md.Code (1974, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Art. (\u201cC.J.\u201d). Clearly, the report of the juvenile master was not a final order of the circuit court, <em>In re Michael G., </em>107 Md.App. 257, 264, 667 A.2d 956 (1995), and neither Levon nor Ms. A. was entitled to take an appeal from it. Maryland Rule 11 \u2014 111(a)(2), which pertains to masters in juvenile causes, provides: \u201cThe findings, conclusions and recommendations of a [juvenile] master do not constitute orders or final action of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The State has not presented us with any authority for the proposition that, in a case involving a juvenile master, no appeal may be taken from a judge\u2019s final order adopting a master\u2019s recommendation, unless the party previously challenged the master\u2019s report by way of exceptions. Our construction of Md. Rule 11-111 does not support that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The canons and rules of construction that guide the interpretation of statutes apply equally when interpreting rules of procedure. <em>State v. Harrell, </em>348 Md. 69, 79, 702 A.2d 723 (1997); <em>Long v. State, </em>343 Md. 662, 684 A.2d 445 (1996). In ascertaining the intention of the Court of Appeals in promulgating the rule, we look first to the words used in the rule. When the language of the rule is clear and unambiguous, we construe the words in accordance with their plain meaning. <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 94, 646 A.2d 1012 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Maryland Rule ll-lll(c) expressly states that any party <em>\u201cmay </em>file exceptions to the master\u2019s proposed findings, conclusions, recommendations, or proposed orders.\u201d (Empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>sis added). But the rule does not mandate that a party who disagrees with the master <em>must </em>file exceptions in order to preserve a right to appeal from the judge\u2019s subsequent order. Indeed, Rule ll-lll(d) does not require the judge to adopt the master\u2019s determinations, even when the master\u2019s recommendations or proposed orders are unchallenged. Md. Rule ll-lll(d) states: \u201cIn the absence of timely and proper exceptions, the master\u2019s proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations <em>may </em>be adopted by the court and the proposed <em>or other appropriate </em>orders may be entered based on them.\u201d (Emphasis added). Further, even if no exceptions have been filed, Rule ll-lll(d) permits the juvenile court to remand the matter to the master for a further hearing. The court may also conduct \u201ca further hearing supplemented by such additional evidence as the court considers relevant and to which the parties raise no objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">What the State has overlooked is that it is the <em>judge\u2019s </em>final order, not the master\u2019s report, recommendations, or proposed order, that both Ms. A. and Levon have challenged here. In particular, regarding the issue of restitution, Ms. A. alleges that the judge was required to exercise his discretion -with respect to Ms. A.\u2019s financial circumstances, evidence of which was adduced at the master\u2019s hearing. Further, she claims that, in ordering her to pay restitution, the judge abused his discretion. Ms. A.\u2019s quarrel, then, is not with the master\u2019s fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Our decision in <em>Miller v. Bosley, </em>113 Md.App. 381, 688 A.2d 45 (1997), is instructive. <em>Miller </em>involved an order granting <em>pendente lite </em>custody of a child to the paternal aunt, based on the report and recommendation of a domestic master. Although the child\u2019s mother failed to note exceptions to the master\u2019s report, she lodged an appeal to this Court, challenging the trial judge\u2019s decision. On appeal, the father argued that the mother\u2019s \u201cfailure to file exceptions forecloses her objection on appeal to the master\u2019s recommendations____\u201d, which were the basis of the lower court\u2019s orders. 113 Md.App. at 390 n. 8, 688 A.2d 45. We disagreed. \"What we said in <em>Miller </em>is pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>We perceive that appellant assigns error not to the master, but to the trial judge in his exercise of his judicial responsibilities. Although exceptions are the proper vehicle for review of the master\u2019s findings, this appeal may properly consider the propriety of the judge\u2019s actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\"><em>In Re Zephrin D., </em>69 Md.App. 755, 519 A.2d 806 (1987), is also pertinent. There, we entertained a parent\u2019s appeal and reviewed an order of restitution lodged against the mother, even though it was the juvenile, and not the mother, who filed an exception to the master\u2019s report. <em>Id. </em>at 757, 519 A.2d 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>In the Matter of Tyrek S., supra, </em>351 Md. 698, 720 A.2d 306 (1998), does not persuade us that Ms. A. waived her claim by failing to file exceptions. <em>Tyrek S. </em>is factually distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In <em>Tyrek S., </em>the juvenile was found to have committed the offense of unauthorized use. At the restitution hearing, the juvenile argued to the master that he lacked the present ability to pay, but the master considered the juvenile\u2019s \u201cpotential ability.\u201d <em>Tyrek S., </em>at 707, 720 A.2d 306. The master concluded that even though Tyrek was young, unemployed, and committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice, this \u201cdoes not mean that [he] will not have the ability to become employed and earn money and pay the restitution that he owes.\u201d <em>Tyrek S., </em>at 707, 720 A.2d 306. The master thus recommended that the juvenile pay restitution to several victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Thereafter, counsel for the juvenile noted exceptions on two grounds; one pertained to the juvenile\u2019s inability to pay restitution. At the exceptions hearing, however, counsel for the juvenile affirmatively advised the court that \u201cthe only issue ... in the case for review\u201d concerned the juvenile\u2019s contention that restitution could not be awarded to a victim who was not named in the petition. Thus, the judge never considered the inability to pay issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">On appeal to this Court, Tyrek claimed that the lower court erred in finding an ability to pay restitution. Because that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>issue was not raised at the exceptions hearing, we concluded that the issue was not preserved. <em>In re Tyrek S., </em>118 Md. App. 270, 277, 702 A.2d 466 (1997). The Court agreed. <em>In the Matter of Tyrek S., </em>at 708, 720 A.2d 306. Moreover, the Court of Appeals declined to exercise its discretion to excuse the waiver. <em>Id., </em>at 709, 720 A.2d 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It is significant that, in <em>Tyrek S., </em>counsel for the juvenile essentially waived the inability to pay issue at the exceptions hearing. Moreover, because the restitution dispute concerned the juvenile\u2019s \u201cpresent versus potential ability to pay,\u201d <em>Tyrek S., </em>at 707, 720 A.2d 306, it involved disputed factual contentions concerning such matters as the juvenile\u2019s anticipated release to the community, his future employability, and his ability to earn money. Under these circumstances, counsel\u2019s statement to the court at the outset of the hearing, and the court\u2019s resulting failure to consider the issue, certainly constituted a waiver under Md. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The issue as to Ms. A.\u2019s restitution, however, did not involve any controverted facts. Rather, Ms. A. focuses on the judge\u2019s discretionary determination in regard to the uncontested factual evidence adduced at the master\u2019s hearing. She \u201cassigns error <em>to the trial judge </em>in the exercise of his independent judgment as to the propriety of his disposition of the case from those facts\u201d elicited at the master\u2019s hearing. <em>Miller, </em>113 Md.App. at 393, 688 A.2d 45. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Additionally, in contrast to <em>Tyrek S., </em>Ms. A.\u2019s failure to lodge exceptions does not offend Md. Rule 8-131(a). That rule guards against a party\u2019s assertion of an issue on appeal that was not raised or <em>considered </em>below. The \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of Rule 8-131(a) is \u201c \u2018 \u201cto ensure fairness for all parties in a case and to promote the orderly administration of law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 189, 638 A.2d 107 (1994) (citations omitted); <em>see Davis v. DiPino, </em>337 Md. 642, 647-48, 655 A.2d 401 (1995). To that end, Maryland Rule 8-131(a) provides that \u201cordinarily\u201d we will not decide any issue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>does not \u201cplainly appear[ ] by the record to have been raised in <em>or decided by </em>the trial court.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Here, although the circuit court did not believe that Ms. A. had lodged exceptions, it nonetheless proceeded to consider the issue of restitution as to the mother, \u201cjust in case.\u201d As a result of the court\u2019s commendable desire to be thorough, the question of restitution by Ms. A. was squarely considered and \u201cplainly decided\u201d by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that Ms. A.\u2019s claim is preserved under Rule 8-131(a). Therefore, we may review the judge\u2019s final order as to Ms. A., even though she did not file exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">We acknowledge that the failure to file exceptions may have serious consequences. Ordinarily, challenges to a master\u2019s report that are not raised by exceptions are waived. <em>See Tyrek S., </em>at 708, 720 A.2d 306; <em>Miller, </em>113 Md.App. at 393, 688 A.2d 45. Indeed, <em>Tyrek S. </em>suggests that even when an exception is noted in writing, waiver may result if that exception is abandoned at the exceptions hearing. <em>Tyrek S., </em>at 703, 708, 720 A.2d 306. What we said in <em>Miller </em>is pertinent here: \u201c[I]n all cases lacking timely exceptions, any claim that the master\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous is waived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 688 A.2d 45. In other words, if no exceptions are filed, the parties and the court must accept the master\u2019s first-level findings of fact. The mother\u2019s failure in <em>Miller </em>to file exceptions \u201cwould have proven fatal\u201d had she sought to challenge the master\u2019s factual findings. <em>Id. </em>In this case, as in <em>Miller, </em>the underlying factual evidence has not been challenged; the facts regarding the mother\u2019s economic circumstances are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Furthermore, in the context of this case, we do not attach significance to the failure of the notice of appeal to identify the particular parties bringing the appeal. In <em>In re Jason W., </em>94 Md.App. 731, 619 A.2d 163 (1993), the notice of appeal only mentioned the child, but we considered the mother as an appellant, because we understood \u201cfrom the brief and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>from counsel\u2019s assertion at oral argument that the appeal [was] on behalf of both [the child] and his mother.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732 n. 1, 619 A.2d 163. When we couple the text of the notice of appeal, which challenges \u201cthe judgment regarding restitution,\u201d with the court\u2019s entry of a judgment of restitution <em>against Ms. </em>A, we are readily satisfied that the appeal was lodged by both Levon and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Finally, even if the mother\u2019s claims were not preserved, we would exercise the discretion conferred on us by Md. Rule 8-131(a) and consider Ms. A.\u2019s contentions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 638 A.2d 107 (1994); <em>Taub v. State, </em>296 Md. 439, 463 A.2d 819 (1983). In <em>In Re Don Mc., </em>344 Md. 194, 686 A.2d 269 (1996), the Court concluded that the propriety of the juvenile court\u2019s order of restitution was not preserved, because it was not raised below. In its discretion, however, the Court determined to consider the matter and then found that the juvenile court had abused its discretion in ordering the minor and his mother to pay restitution. <em>Id. </em>at 200, 686 A.2d 269.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Appellants contend that the trial court\u2019s award of restitution was improper for three reasons. First, they argue that the delinquent act of unauthorized use did not cause the damage for which restitution was ordered. Second, they complain that the court erred by valuing the personal items in the Jeep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>according to their replacement value or purchase price, rather than their fair market value. Third, appellants contend that the master did not adequately consider the age and circumstances of either Levon or Ms. A. when ordering restitution. Before analyzing these assertions, we shall briefly review the principles that undergird juvenile restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In October 1996, when Levon committed the offense of unauthorized use, restitution in juvenile causes was governed by Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 808 (\u201cLiability for acts of child\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Effective October 1, 1997, the provisions of Art. 27, \u00a7 808 were repealed. At that time, the Legislature combined into a single statute what had been separate adult and juvenile restitution provisions. The restitution provisions for adults and juveniles are now combined and codified at Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 807. <em>See </em>1997 Md. Laws Chs. 311, 312 (\u201cVictims\u2019 Rights\u2019 Act of 1997\u201d); <em>In the Matter of Tyrek S., </em>at 704 n. 4, 720 A.2d 306. Therefore, when the exceptions hearing was held on October 15, 1997, and the court made its determinations as to restitution, the revised statutory provisions had just become effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The parties have not addressed in their briefs whether Art. 27, \u00a7 807 applied to this ease when the court held the exceptions hearing, even though Art. 27, \u00a7 808 was in effect when Levon committed the delinquent act of unauthorized use. Nor have the parties suggested that the outcome of this case turns on which version of the statute governs. We observe, however, that appellants and the State repeatedly cite to Art. 27, \u00a7 808. Moreover, appellants argue that at the exceptions hearing held on October 15, 1997 \u2014 two weeks after the new restitution statute went into effect \u2014 the court erred by failing to consider Levon\u2019s \u201cage and circumstances.\u201d Yet Art. 27, \u00a7 807, which is the current version of the statute, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>contain the \u201cage and circumstances\u201d language that had appeared in Art. 27, \u00a7 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We also note that, at the exceptions hearing, neither counsel for the State nor counsel for Levon noted the legislative change or raised any issue with respect to which statutory version should govern the court\u2019s decision as to restitution. Moreover, because the trial court\u2019s order of October 15, 1997, does not refer to either Art. 27, \u00a7 807 or Art. 27, \u00a7 808, we do not know which version of the statute the court applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In our analysis of the court\u2019s order of restitution, we shall refer to both Art. 27, \u00a7 808, the statute in effect when the offense was committed, and the current statute, which was in effect by the time the exceptions hearing was held. Our comparison of both versions of the statute leads us to conclude that, with respect to the particular issues before us, the outcome of this case does not hinge on the legislative changes regarding restitution. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Art. 27, \u00a7 808, the earlier version of the statute, which applied only to juvenile offenders, provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afu\">\u00a7 808. Liability for acts of child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anv\">(a) <em>In general </em>\u2014 (1) The juvenile court may enter a-judgment of restitution against the parent of a child, the child, or both in any case in which the court finds a child has committed a delinquent act and <em>during or as a result of the commission of that delinquent act has:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">(i) Stolen, damaged, destroyed, converted, unlawfully obtained, or substantially decreased the value of the property of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">(b) <em>Restitution to wronged person personally. </em>\u2014 Considering the age and circumstances of a child, the juvenile court may order the child to make restitution to the wronged person personally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">(e) <em>Judgment against parent. </em>\u2014 A judgment of restitution against a parent may not be entered unless the parent has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>been afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present appropriate evidence in the parent\u2019s behalf....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACB\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The current statutory version, Art. 27, \u00a7 807, which applies to both adult and juvenile offenders, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u00a7 807. Restitution for crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">(a) <em>Restitution upon conviction, acceptance of plea of nolo contendere, etc.; priority of payment; reasons for not ordering restitution. </em>\u2014 (1) A court may issue a judgment of restitution directing a defendant to make restitution in addition to any other penalty for the commission of a crime, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">(i) Property of the victim was stolen, damaged, destroyed, converted, unlawfully obtained, or its value substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">(3) (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the defendant is a child, the court may order the child, the child\u2019s parent, or both to pay restitution to a victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">(in) A court may not enter a judgment of restitution against a parent under this section unless the parent has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present appropriate evidence on the parent\u2019s behalf. A hearing under this section may be held as part of the sentencing or disposition hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">(4) A court need not issue a judgment of restitution under this section if the court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">(i) That the defendant or liable parent does not have the ability to pay the judgment of restitution; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">(ii) Good cause to establish extenuating circumstances as to why a judgment of restitution is inappropriate in a case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">Prior to 1987, the juvenile restitution statute provided that only property damaged \u201cduring\u201d the commission of a delin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>quent act could be the subject of a restitution order. In 1987, the Legislature broadened the causation nexus by allowing restitution for damage caused \u201cduring <em>or as a result of\u2019 </em>a delinquent act. 1987 Md. Laws Ch. 344 (emphasis added). In contrast, the statute now authorizes restitution when property is damaged \u201cas a direct result of the crime.\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The case of <em>In re Jason W., </em>94 Md.App. at 736-37, 619 A.2d 163, interpreting the \u201cduring or as a result of\u2019 language, established that \u201cthree findings (and the evidence to justify them) are required to support a restitution judgment.\u201d Specifically, the court said a juvenile court must find:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">(1) that the child committed a delinquent act; (2) that the child damaged, destroyed, or decreased the value of another\u2019s property; and (3) that such damage, destruction, or diminution in value caused by the child occurred during or as a result of the delinquent act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Even if the above criteria were satisfied, however, a court could not order restitution under Art. 27, \u00a7 808 unless it considered \u201cthe age and circumstances\u201d of the child, and provided the parent with an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence. Art. 27, \u00a7 808(b); \u00a7 808(e); <em>see In Re Don Mc, </em>344 Md. at 202, 686 A.2d 269. The current version of the statute deletes the \u201cage and circumstances\u201d language. Instead, the statute now focuses expressly on the \u201cability to pay\u201d of the juvenile and the parent. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(4)(i). Moreover, the statute now expressly provides that the court \u201cneed not issue a judgment of restitution\u201d when \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown, establishing \u201cextenuating circumstances as to why a judgment of restitution is inappropriate in a case.\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(4)(h).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, the revised statute maintains the right of a parent to be heard and to present evidence. Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(3)(iii). It also continues the \u201cabsolute limit\u201d of $10,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>000 that may be imposed upon the parent or child for restitution. Compare Art. 27, \u00a7 808(c)(2); Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">As we see it, the text of Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(4)\u00ae, which concerns \u201cability to pay,\u201d and the text of Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(4)(h), concerning \u201cgood cause,\u201d codify the case law that has developed over many years. With respect to restitution, our courts have repeatedly stressed the vital importance of the ability to pay, even when that language did not appear in the statute. Further, we have long recognized the broad discretion vested in the judge regarding an order of restitution. In <em>In Re Don Mc., </em>344 Md. at 201, 686 A.2d 269, for example, the Court said that \u201cMaryland law confers upon a juvenile court broad discretion to order restitution.\u201d Similarly, the Court recognized that the minor and the parent must have the ability to comply with an order of restitution. <em>Id. </em>at 203, 686 A.2d 269; <em>see Coles, </em>290 Md. at 306, 429 A.2d 1029. Given that \u201cthe fundamental objective of promoting rehabilitation\u201d is often \u201cfrustrated\u201d when the amount of restitution exceeds the offender\u2019s ability to pay, <em>Coles, </em>290 Md. at 306, 429 A.2d 1029, the appellate courts have also made clear that a juvenile court is vested with the discretion to deny a claim for restitution when the circumstances warrant that result. <em>In Re Don Mc, </em>344 Md. at 203, 686 A.2d 269; <em>In Re Zephrin D., </em>69 Md.App. at 762, 519 A.2d 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">To be sure, when the above cited cases were decided, the restitution statutes at issue did not contain the \u201cability to pay\u201d language or the \u201cgood cause\u201d language that appears in the present version of the restitution statute. In our view, the current statute now mirrors well-settled case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The juvenile restitution statute continues to be both \u201ccompensatory\u201d and \u201cpenal\u201d in nature, <em>In re William George T., </em>89 Md.App. 762, 771, 599 A.2d 886 (1992), and thus \u201cserves a dual objective.\u201d <em>In Re Zephrin D., </em>69 Md.App. at 761, 519 A.2d 806. On the one hand, the statute \u201cprovides for compensation to victims who have been injured or whose property has been stolen, damaged or destroyed as a result of a minor\u2019s wrongful acts.\u201d <em>In re Zephrin D., </em>69 Md.App. at 761, 519 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>A.2d 806. On the other hand, it permits punishment of parents because of \u201c \u2018a presumed neglect of parental responsibilities\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Zephrin D., </em>69 Md.App. at 761, 519 A.2d 806 (citation omitted), even though, at common law, a parent was not vicariously liable for the wrongful acts of his or her child. Parental punishment is predicated on the view that, \u201cas between the victim, or the public, and the parents of a delinquent child, the parents should bear the expense caused by their child.\u201d <em>In re William George T., </em>89 Md.App. at 775, 599 A.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In addition to the twin goals of compensation and punishment, restitution remains an integral part of the process of juvenile rehabilitation. The Court has previously observed that restitution can \u201cimpress upon [the youngster] the gravity of harm he has inflicted upon another,\u201d and \u201cprovide an opportunity for him to make amends.\u201d <em>In re Herbert B., </em>303 Md. 419, 427, 494 A.2d 680 (1985). Similarly, the Court recognized in <em>In re Don Mc., </em>344 Md. at 203, 686 A.2d 269, that the \u201c \u2018concern that the victim be fully compensated should not overshadow [the court\u2019s] primary duty to promote the rehabilitation of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Coles v. State, </em>290 Md. 296, 306, 429 A.2d 1029 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">At oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel suggested that State Farm and Andrews would not be able to recover in tort from appellant, because he was merely a passenger in the Jeep and it was the driver who negligently operated the vehicle. Therefore, counsel urged that the victims should not have greater rights to recover damages from appellants in restitution than they would have in a tort suit. We agree that the juvenile restitution statute is not \u201cintended to create a civil cause of action for the victim or to turn the juvenile court into a forum for damage suits.\u201d <em>In Re Jason W., </em>94 Md.App. at 735, 619 A.2d 163; <em>see In re Zephrin D., </em>69 Md.App. at 762, 519 A.2d 806. Thus, the statute \u201cis not a mirror of principles underlying damages in tort; it limits recovery in amount, substance and source.\u201d <em>In re Zephrin D., </em>69 Md.App. at 764, 519 A.2d 806. Moreover, as we noted, the court has the discretion to deny restitution, regardless of fault. In contrast, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>when fault and damages are established in a civil tort proceeding, \u201c[t]here is no ... discretion available to a court .... \u201d with respect to a monetary award. <em>Id. </em>at 762, 519 A.2d 806. But in other ways, recovery of restitution from a juvenile or the juvenile\u2019s parent is \u201cmore expedient ... than would be recovery in a civil suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, an order of restitution may be imposed upon a parent, even when such recovery is \u201cnot otherwise available under the common law in Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764, 519 A.2d 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Accordingly, we do not perceive a juvenile\u2019s lack of liability in the civil arena as an absolute bar to restitution in regard to a delinquency case. The changes in the restitution provisions as to juveniles have not altered the principles that we have outlined above. Accordingly, as we consider the issues presented here, we shall continue to apply the principles discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We turn to consider appellants\u2019 claims that the court erred by imposing orders of restitution upon Levon and his mother for a delinquent act that was not the cause of the damages and losses. In particular, because Levon was found not to have stolen the vehicle or to have committed malicious destruction of property, appellants urge that the juvenile court erred in requiring restitution for damages resulting from theft and malicious destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">In analyzing appellants\u2019 contention as to theft-related damages, <em>In re Jason W., </em>94 Md.App. 731, 619 A.2d 163, is instructive. There, a juvenile driving an unlicensed motorcycle tried to outrun two police vehicles that were in hot pursuit. 94 Md.App. at 732, 619 A.2d 163. One officer drove an all-terrain vehicle, while the other drove an ordinary police cruiser. <em>Id. </em>During the chase, Jason proceeded through various obstacles and traveled down a path into the woods with both police vehicles in chase. Eventually, Jason lost control of the motorcycle and was apprehended by the officer driving the all-terrain vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 733, 619 A.2d 163. Unfortunately, the officer driving the cruiser misjudged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>width of the path leading into the woods and crashed into a tree, injuring himself and extensively damaging the cruiser. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, Jason was charged with operating an unregistered vehicle, eluding an officer, and driving on a suspended license. <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, pursuant to a plea bargain, Jason pled \u201cinvolved\u201d to the charge of operating an unregistered vehicle, and the other two charges were put on the stet docket. <em>Id. </em>Jason and his mother were ordered to pay $8,656.00 in restitution for the damage to the police cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">On appeal, we considered whether Jason and his mother could be held liable for damages to the police vehicle. In our view, Jason\u2019s conduct did not cause the damage to the cruiser. Rather, the damage to the cruiser resulted from the minor\u2019s conduct in fleeing, not from driving an unregistered vehicle. The Court observed: <em>\u201cThat </em>was the delinquent act which led to the chase into the woods, but, as noted, that charge was not prosecuted and no finding as to it was made.\u201d 94 Md.App. at 737, 619 A.2d 163. Therefore, we determined that the restitution judgment was erroneous under C.J. \u00a7 3-829. We reasoned that \u201cby proceeding only on the operation of an unregistered vehicle charge and placing the \u2018eluding an officer\u2019 charge on the stet docket, the State destroyed the required nexus between the delinquent act and the <em>damage.\u201d </em>94 Md.App. at 737, 619 A.2d 163. Writing for the Court, Chief Judge Wilner explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">The statute does not allow restitution simply because property damage results from a delinquent act. It requires that the child have caused that damage. That did not happen here. Jason\u2019s conduct did not damage the sheriffs car; Deputy Guy\u2019s conduct did. In order to sustain the judgment, we would have to read the statute as though that last part of it read \u2018and during or as a result of the commission of that delinquent act the property of another was damaged or destroyed, or its value was substantially decreased.\u2019 But that is not what it says.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\"><em>In re Jason W., </em>94 Md.App. at 737, 619 A.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Appellant argues for a sweeping application of <em>Jason W. </em>He contends that it was John, not Levon, who stole the Jeep and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>was driving it when it crashed. Moreover, he claims that \u201c[t]here was no finding \u2014 and no evidence \u2014 that Levon damaged the Jeep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">As we see it, the link between Jason\u2019s delinquent act in <em>In re Jason W. </em>and the damage to the police cruiser was more attenuated than the causal connection in Levon\u2019s case; Levon was a passenger in the very vehicle that was actually damaged. 94 Md.App. at 738, 619 A.2d 163. Moreover, the only delinquent act that Jason was found to have committed was the operation of an unregistered vehicle, and that offense clearly lacked \u201cthe required nexus between the delinquent act and the damage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 737, 619 A.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Relying on <em>In re Gloria T., </em>73 Md.App. 28, 532 A.2d 1095, <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 718, 537 A.2d 272 (1988), the State counters that Levon is liable for the full amount of restitution, regardless of his degree of participation. The State urges that Levon was a principal and not an accessory to the crime of unauthorized use.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In resolving Levon\u2019s contention at the exception hearing, the juvenile judge explicitly relied on <em>In re Gloria T., </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\"><em>In re Gloria T. </em>stands for the well established principle in this state that in terms of misdemeanors all participants are deemed to be principles [sic] and I have researched that point many times in connection with adult offenders and I\u2019m convinced that that is still good law. So, in the case of unauthorized use, commonly known as a joy ride situation, therefore, occupying a stolen car without the permission and consent of the owner and the car sustains damages, all persons found on or about the car are, in fact, chargeable as principals and all are equally liable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">In <em>Gloria T., </em>the juvenile was adjudicated delinquent due to her participation in the assault and battery of another girl. Gloria\u2019s role in that crime consisted of helping her friends lure the victim into an open field \u201c[o]n the pretext of buying the victim a soda----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 532 A.2d 1095. Gloria then \u201cbrought her hands up around the victim\u2019s neck ... and threw the victim to the ground. [Gloria\u2019s] companions then beat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>victim until she bled and her nose and cheekbone were broken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rejecting the notion that a juvenile\u2019s act must be the \u201cimmediate cause\u201d of damage for which restitution is ordered, this Court held Gloria \u201cliable for the full amount of the restitution judgment regardless of the degree of her participation.\u201d <em>In re Gloria T., </em>73 Md.App. at 32, 532 A.2d 1095. Rather, it was sufficient that the juvenile actively participated in the crime that caused pecuniary damage. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">Under the facts of this case, appellant\u2019s delinquent act would be characterized as a battery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">In any event, either assault or battery is a misdemeanor and all participants are chargeable as principals. On this basis, appellant is liable for the full amount of the restitution judgment regardless of the degree of her participation. The fact that appellant\u2019s participation in the attack was not the immediate cause of the injuries to the victim which required medical attention is irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 32, 532 A.2d 1095. (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">We do not believe that <em>Gloria T. </em>is entirely controlling here. Neither <em>Gloria T. </em>nor <em>Jason W. </em>authorize an order of restitution for damages that occurred prior to the juvenile\u2019s commission of, or participation in, the delinquent act. Indeed, <em>Jason W. </em>expressly stated that, by statute, juvenile restitution may be ordered only if the court finds that the \u201cdamage, destruction, or diminution in value ... occurred <em>during or as a result of the delinquent act.\u201d </em>94 Md.App. at 736-37, 619 A.2d 163 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Here, the master found facts not sustained as to Levon\u2019s theft of the Jeep. Nevertheless, part of the restitution was predicated on damages that necessarily occurred in connection with the theft. For example, the order of restitution against Ms. A. included damages for the cost of repairing the Jeep\u2019s window and ignition, which were obviously damaged during the theft itself. Moreover, both Levon and his mother were obligated to make restitution for certain items of personal property that most likely were damaged or stolen in connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>tion with the theft, such as \u201cThe Club,\u201d which Andrews testified was \u201csecured\u201d at the time of the break in. Given the finding that Levon did not commit the theft, we agree with appellants that they cannot be ordered to pay restitution for damages directly resulting from the theft. Because neither the master nor the court distinguished between damages caused by the initial theft, for which Levon was found not involved, and damages that occurred due to the unauthorized use, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">That conclusion does not end our inquiry, however. Relying on <em>Gloria T. </em>and other cases, we reject appellants\u2019 contention that the court also erred in imposing restitution with regard to the damages that occurred during the period of the unauthorized use. Given Levon\u2019s commission of the offense of unauthorized use, it is of no moment that he was only a passenger at the time of the aceident that caused damage to the vehicle; the accident occurred during the period of unauthorized use. In view of that unassailable fact, we agree with the State that Levon\u2019s delinquent act provided a sufficient basis on which to award restitution for the losses and damages that occurred during or as a result of the unauthorized use. We explain further.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The offense of unauthorized use, codified at Art. 27, \u00a7 349, has been described as a \u201c \u2018junior varsity\u2019 version of larceny law.\u201d <em>In re Lakeysha P., </em>106 Md.App. 401, 410, 665 A.2d 264 (1995). The crime has four elements: \u201c1) an unlawful taking; 2) an unlawful carrying away; 3) of certain designated personal property; 4) of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 665 A.2d 264. The offense applies to \u201cany person or persons,\u201d as well as to \u201chis or their aiders or abettors,\u201d who \u201ctake and carry away out of the custody or use of any person or persons ... any of the above, enumerated property [here, a motor vehicle] .... \u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 349. The statute also requires the offender to \u201crestore the property so taken and carried away,\u201d or, if unable to do so, to \u201cpay to the owner or owners the full value thereof____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>In <em>Anello v. State, </em>201 Md. 164, 168, 93 A.2d 71 (1952), the Court held that \u201c[t]o be an aider or abettor [under \u00a7 349] it is not essential that there be a prearranged concert of action, although, in the absence of such action, it is essential that [a person] should in some way advocate or encourage the commission of the crime.\u201d The Court also said: \u201c[G]uilty knowledge is essential to a conviction,\u201d but \u201csuch knowledge may be inferred from facts and circumstances such as would cause a reasonable man of ordinary intelligence, observation and caution to believe that the property has been unlawfully taken.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">In Maryland, evidence that a person was a willing passenger in a car that he or she knew was stolen is sufficient evidence of criminal intent to sustain a conviction for unauthorized use. In <em>Anello, </em>the Court held that a passenger of a stolen vehicle was guilty of unauthorized use, despite his claim that he innocently accepted a ride from a man he hardly knew; circumstantial evidence supported the conclusion that the defendant knew the car was stolen when he got into the vehicle. 201 Md. at 169, 93 A.2d 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Similarly, in <em>Banks v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 373, 234 A.2d 798 (1967), we upheld a conviction for unauthorized use even though the defendant had not been involved in the actual theft of the vehicle. In that case, the defendant testified that a friend and an \u201cinebriated sailor\u201d picked him up in Cecil County, in a car that the friend said belonged to an unnamed acquaintance. After dropping off the sailor, the two men drove to Pennsylvania, where the defendant took over driving the vehicle. Both men were arrested in Pennsylvania. At the time of the arrest, the ignition switch was \u201cpunched out and the wires [were] dangling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375, 234 A.2d 798. We held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that \u201c[the defendant] had unlawfully taken and carried away \u2018out of the custody and use\u2019 of the owner ... [the owner\u2019s] car for his \u2018present use,\u2019 in violation of the code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, 234 A.2d 798. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A37\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The jury\u2019s finding clearly reveals that it did not believe the defense presented and found that the appellant was not free from guilt. <em>\u2018One is guilty [of unauthorized, use] under section 349, if he participates in the continued use of the stolen car after the original taking, since this manifests the intent to deprive the owner of his </em>possession.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 376-77, 234 A.2d 798 (quoting <em>Spence v. State, </em>224 Md. 17, 19, 165 A.2d 917 (1960)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Most recently, in the case of <em>In the Matter of Tyrek S., supra, </em>the Court upheld a restitution order imposed upon a juvenile who was found delinquent with respect to the unauthorized use of a Volvo that had been stolen and was involved in a car accident. According to the facts found by the master at the adjudicatory hearing, Tyrek was a passenger in the vehicle at the time of the collision. We note, however, that no issue was raised as to the significance of the juvenile\u2019s status as a mere passenger when the accident occurred. <em>In the Matter of Tyrek S., </em>at 699, 702, 720 A.2d 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> Because an aider and abettor is, under Art. 27, \u00a7 849, \u201cequally guilty with the principal perpetrator of the crime,\u201d <em>Anello, </em>201 Md. at 168, 93 A.2d 71, he or she is equally liable for the full range of penalties proscribed by the statute. As we noted, by statute, this includes the provision that the guilty party either \u201crestore the property so taken\u201d or pay the owner the \u201cfull value.\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 349. Relying on <em>Banks </em>and <em>Anello, </em>we conclude that an offender, such as Levon, who \u201cparticipates in the continued use of |a] stolen car after the original taking\u201d may be found to have committed the offense of unauthorized use, and thus may be ordered to \u201crestore the property so taken.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>2 Md.App. at 376-77, 234 A.2d 798; Art. 27, \u00a7 349. On this basis, the juvenile court lawfully awarded restitution for those damages caused during or as a result of the unauthorized use.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Other states have also held that a juvenile\u2019s involvement in the unauthorized use of a vehicle is sufficient to sustain restitution for damages caused during the course of that use, even when the child did not participate in the actual theft of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the vehicle. In <em>People v. Rivera, </em>135 Misc.2d 350, 515 N.Y.S.2d 397 (Dist.Ct.1987), for example, a seventeen year old passenger in a stolen car pled guilty to unauthorized use of the vehicle, but appealed a restitution award of $2,566.00 for damages incurred when the car collided with another vehicle after a high speed chase. Although the defendant admitted that he knew the car was stolen, he contended that restitution was unwarranted because he was not the driver of the car when it crashed. In fact, the evidence showed that the defendant \u201cyelled to [the driver] to stop the vehicle, which at the time was speeding at 80 mph.\u201d <em>Id. </em>515 N.Y.S.2d at 397. The New York court disagreed, holding that the defendant \u201caided [the driver] in the unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>515 N.Y.S.2d at 398. Similarly, in <em>State v. Massey, </em>106 Or.App. 242, 806 P.2d 193 (Or.Ct.App.1991), <em>rev. denied, </em>311 Or. 643, 815 P.2d 1273 (Or.1991), the Court of Appeals of Oregon sustained an award of restitution based on an underlying charge of unauthorized use. There, the defendant was arrested driving a car that he knew had been stolen some two weeks before his arrest. Because the owners of the car \u201csuffered pecuniary damages as a result of [the] defendant\u2019s criminal activities \u2014 his continued illegal possession of the car,\u201d the court held that restitution was proper. <em>Id. </em>at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In contrast to our conclusion with respect to the theft-related damages, we perceive no error in the court\u2019s restitution order as to malicious destruction. Although the court found that Levon did not commit the crime of malicious destruction of property, the evidence supported the conclusion that property was damaged or lost in the course of the unauthorized use, even if Levon did not do so with the intent that is required to sustain the offense of malicious destruction of property. <em>See In re Albert S., </em>106 Md.App. 376, 399, 664 A.2d 476 (1995) (stating that \u201cit is not sufficient [for malicious destruction of property] that the defendant merely intended to do the act which led to the damage; it is necessary that the defendant <em>actually intended </em>to damage the property in question.\u201d); <em>see also In re Taka C., </em>331 Md. 80, 83-84, 626 A.2d 366 (1993); <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 65-68, 512 A.2d 358 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>(1986)(malicious destruction of property \u201crequires both a deliberate intention to injure the property of another and malice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In sum, we conclude that the court erred to the extent that it awarded restitution for damages sustained in connection with the theft of the Jeep, for which Levon was found not culpable. Because the court did not differentiate between damages resulting from the initial theft and those that occurred during or as a result of the unauthorized use, we shall vacate the award of restitution and remand for further proceedings. On remand, the juvenile court must exclude from an order of restitution any damages that relate solely to the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Appellants complain that the court erred by valuing Mr. Andrews\u2019s personal items according to their replacement cost or original purchase price rather than their fair market value, as required by Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 808(c)(i), (ii). In our view, this issue is not preserved. Levon\u2019s notice of exception contained only two complaints: 1) the State \u201cfailed to prove that the delinquent act was the cause of the car owner\u2019s damage or loss;\u201d and 2) the master \u201cfailed to take into consideration the age and circumstances of the Respondent when ordering restitution.\u201d Nor did defense counsel raise the issue during the exception hearing. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Even if preserved, we see no merit to this complaint. \u201cFair market value\u201d is well defined in Maryland law, but is often difficult to ascertain in a particular case. \u201cFair market value\u201d is \u201c \u2018the price which a purchaser willing, but not compelled, to buy would pay, and which an owner willing, but not compelled, to sell would accept, for the property.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Christopher R., </em>348 Md. 408, 412, 704 A.2d 443 (1998) <em>( </em>quoting <em>Marchant v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>146 Md. 513, 527-28, 126 A. 884 (1924)); <em>see also In re Trevor A., </em>55 Md.App. 491, 501, 462 A.2d 1245 (1983); <em>State Roads Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>sion v.

We do not perceive clear error in deducing the fair market value from the evidence presented. <em>In re Timothy F., </em>343 Md. 371, 379-80, 681 A.2d 501 (1996) (\u201cWhen the trier of fact is the trial court, its judgment on the evidence will be set aside only if it is clearly erroneous.\u201d); <em>In re Trevor A., </em>55 Md.App. at 501, 462 A.2d 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Appellants compare Levon\u2019s case to <em>In re Christopher R., supra, </em>348 Md. 408, 704 A.2d 443. In that case, a fifteen year old boy broke into an elementary school and stole a 1994 Apple computer and various other pieces of computer equipment. The court found the boy delinquent and ordered him to pay $5,000.00 restitution, the statutory maximum at the time. The school originally paid $5,049.00 for the equipment, and estimated the replacement cost at $5,415.00. The master recommended restitution based on the replacement cost. The trial judge admitted he had \u201cabsolutely no way to know what [the] rate of depreciation should be for computers,\u201d so he based his award on what the school paid for the equipment. <em>Id. </em>at 410, 704 A.2d 443. The Court of Appeals reversed. In its estimation, because \u201cadvances [in computer technology] are constantly being made so that used equipment depreciates in value over relatively short periods of time,\u201d neither the replacement cost nor the price originally paid reflected the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the stolen goods. <em>Id. </em>at 412-13, 704 A.2d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\"><em>Christopher R. </em>is readily distinguishable from this case, however. Mugs, blankets, and cassette tapes do not ordinarily plummet in value over the course of a few months, as computers do. Moreover, it is well settled that proof of market value \u201cmay be indirect as well as direct.\u201d <em>Wallace v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 399, 410, 492 A.2d 970 <em>(quoting Vucci v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 694, 701, 284 A.2d 646 (1971)), <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 301, 498 A.2d 1186 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Furthermore, \u201con appeal, the burden of establishing error in the lower court rests squarely on the appellant.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Bradley v. Hazard Technology Co., </em>340 Md. 202, 206, 665 A.2d 1050 (1995); <em>see also Thomas v. City of Annapolis, </em>113 Md.App. 440, 450, 688 A.2d 448 (1997); <em>Myers v. Estate of Alessi, </em>80 Md.App. 124, 140, 560 A.2d 59, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 640, 566 A.2d 101 (1989). In this case, appellants have offered no reason why replacement cost is not an accurate indicator of the fair market value of the victim\u2019s personal items. <em>See In re Trevor A, supra, </em>55 Md.App. 491, 462 A.2d 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Appellants contend that the court \u201cdid not adequately consider Levon\u2019s age or circumstances, including the ability of Levon or his mother to pay, before ordering ... restitution of more than two thousand dollars.\u201d (Emphasis added). Appellants concede that the master \u201cafforded Levon and his mother the opportunity to be heard and to present evidence.... \u201d Based on the amounts of the restitutionary awards, however, they complain that both the master and the court did not \u201cadequately consider\u201d the evidence. In essence, appellants argue that because they lack the ability to pay, the court abused its discretion in ordering restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">As we observed earlier, we review the juvenile court\u2019s order for abuse of discretion. In <em>In re Don Mc., </em>344 Md. at 201, 686 A.2d 269, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">Judicial discretion is a composite of many things, among which are conclusions drawn from objective criteria; it means a sound judgment exercised with regard to what is right under the circumstances and without doing so arbitrarily or capriciously. Where the decision or order of the trial court is a matter of discretion it will not be disturbed on review except on a clear showing of abuse of discretion, that is, discretion manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">(quoting <em>State ex. rel. Carroll v. Junker, </em>79 Wash.2d 12, 482 P.2d 775, 784 (Wash.1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Again, <em>In re Don Mc., supra, </em>344 Md. 194, 686 A.2d 269, is noteworthy. In that case, a fifteen year old boy stole an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>automobile and subsequently totaled it in an accident. The owner\u2019s insurance company paid the victim $8,366.25, representing the fair market value of the car, less the victim\u2019s deductible. When awarding restitution, the master spent no time evaluating whether the juvenile or his mother could pay. He simply asked the victim\u2019s insurance agent how much the company paid, and assessed the juvenile and his mother the maximum amount allowed under statute. 344 Md. at 199-200, 686 A.2d 269. The Court of Appeals reversed. In its estimation, the juvenile court abused its discretion because it did not consider the age or circumstances of the child, or the ability of the child or parent to pay. <em>Id. </em>at 203, 686 A.2d 269. Instead, the court \u201cpredetermined that the appropriate award was the statutory maximum, and he arrived at this conclusion without any consideration of the age and circumstances of this child.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">With <em>In Re Don Mc. </em>in mind, we see no merit to appellants\u2019 complaint as to Levon\u2019s restitution. The record reflects that both the master and the court carefully considered Levon\u2019s age and circumstances. Indeed, the court imposed liability for only a relatively small portion of the total damages, and gave Levon a reasonable time to pay. At the same time, both the master and the court recognized that Levon would soon be old enough to get a job, and that he should do so. Further, at the exceptions hearing, the judge clearly applied his independent reasoning to the master\u2019s factual findings. In upholding the master\u2019s recommendation, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">I believe \u2014 and it is not I\u2019m a self made person, and if it was good enough for me, it should be good enough for them \u2014 but I\u2019m sincerely of the belief if one is involved in joy riding in a stolen car, the car sustains damages, that he respondent, as part of rehabilitation, as part of probation, ought to be required to pay restitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">I\u2019m satisfied in his decision and also based on the restitution hearing that Master Sampson did, in fact, consider the age and circumstance of the respondent. I\u2019m not satisfied that his ruling was erroneous and, therefore, as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>master\u2019s order, that the respondent pay restitution of 443.73 over a period of 18 months to the \u2014 I also want to point out that he ordered that to be paid jointly and severally with the co-respondents, that is, the decision and recommendation was an appropriate one and, therefore, the exception with respect to restitution against the respondent is also overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">As to Ms. A., however, we reach a different result. \u201c[R]ecovery [in a restitution hearing is] intended to follow the ability to pay.\u201d <em>In re Jose S., </em>304 Md. 396, 401, 499 A.2d 936 (1985)(quoting <em>In re Appeal No. 321, </em>24 Md.App. 82, 85, 329 A.2d 113 (1974)). Because an order of restitution should not exceed the ability to pay, <em>Coles, </em>290 Md. at 306, 429 A.2d 1029, the lower court must conduct a \u201c \u2018reasoned inquiry\u2019 \u201d into a person\u2019s ability to comply with an order of restitution. <em>In re Don Mc., </em>344 Md. at 203, 686 A.2d 269 (quoting <em>Coles, </em>290 Md. at 306, 429 A.2d 1029).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">To be sure, unlike <em>In re Don Mc., </em>the master here entertained detailed testimony about Ms. A.\u2019s financial situation, including evidence about her income, housing arrangements, dependents, and monthly expenses. In that sense, Ms. A. was not denied a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to present appropriate evidence on her behalf.\u201d <em>In re Don Mc., </em>344 Md. at 203-04, 686 A.2d 269. Nevertheless, the inquiry clearly demonstrated that Ms. A. had no ability to pay the kind of restitutionary award imposed here. Indeed, the master recognized Ms. A\u2019s dire economic situation, and conceded that he had \u201cto decide how much food [he\u2019s] going to take out of her children\u2019s mouths.\u201d When pressed by Levon\u2019s attorney to explain how Ms. A. could possibly pay such a substantial amount of restitution against her, the master said: \u201c[Levon] is in court because of the actions of his mother and father. His father is not here. I can\u2019t do anything with his father, and I think the mother should go up here and try to get this money from this man, who decided to dump her and these children like a piece of garbage.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Thereafter, at the exceptions hearing, when the court considered the restitution order as to the mother, it recounted the uncontradicted evidence presented to the master. Our difficulty concerns the court\u2019s failure to apply its independent judgment to the uncontested facts regarding the mother\u2019s economic plight. Instead, the court summarily adopted the master\u2019s recommendation as to restitution, without setting forth any rationale or reason for doing so; it did not reconcile the master\u2019s recommendation with the evidence adduced at the hearing as to the mother\u2019s ability to pay. The court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">There was quite a bit of testimony taken and afterwards, [the master] ruled that the mother should, in fact, because she was in custody of the respondent at the time of this incident, should be ordered to pay 1 thousand 690 dollars and 17 cents. Court [sic] concurs with that recommendation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In <em>In re: Michael G., supra, </em>107 Md.App. at 264, 667 A.2d 956, we recognized that the juvenile master\u2019s recommendations are not final orders of the circuit court. Writing for the Court, Judge Davis said: \u201cIt is the chancellor\u2019s role, and not the master\u2019s, to determine the ultimate rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This requires the chancellor to \u201cexercise his or her independent judgment in ruling on the party\u2019s exceptions.... \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Accordingly, under the circumstances attendant here, we conclude that the court abused its discretion in imposing restitution on Ms. A. for <em>all </em>of the victims\u2019 losses and damages. Clearly, Ms. A. had no ability to comply with this particular restitution order, unless she sacrificed the well being of her children. We do not believe this is what the statute envisioned. Therefore, on remand, the court should consider an order of restitution commensurate with Ms. A.\u2019s ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">APPELLEE\u2019S \u201cMOTION TO STRIKE APPENDIX TO APPELLANT\u2019S REPLY BRIEF\u201d DENIED; RESTITUTION ORDER AS TO APPELLANTS VACATED; JUDGMENT OTHERWISE AFFIRMED.

The master held a separate disposition hearing on May 13, 1997, and recommended six months of supervised probation. No exceptions were noted as to that recommendation, which the juvenile court adopted on May 21, 1997. Accordingly, the probationary disposition is not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">. Ms. A. testified that she has another child who is \"not dependent\u201d on her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\">. The master's proposed order of March 25, 1997, obligated Levon to pay restitution to the vehicle\u2019s owner <em>and </em>to the insurer, although the master had stated that he would recommend that only Ms. A. pay restitution to State Farm. Consequently, the master corrected his proposed order on September 2, 1997, to impose only on Ms. A. the obligation to pay restitution to State Farm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b142-10\">.

Although the tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>script reflects that the judge was quite familiar with the arguments advanced before the master, neither counsel for the State nor counsel for Levon made any arguments with respect to the issues at the exceptions hearing. Indeed, Levon's attorney merely identified herself for the record, and the prosecutor just summarized the master's rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b145-10\">. In its brief, the State notes that on September 2, 1997, the master \"corrected\u201d his proposed order of March 25, 1997. <em>See </em>footnote 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>supra. </em>The State also indicates that, on October 15, 1996, the court adopted the master\u2019s proposed order of March 25, 1997, \"as amended,\u201d although the order of October 15, 1997, does not so indicate. Moreover, in our review of the record, we note that, on September 10, 1997, the juvenile court actually signed the master's corrected proposed order of September 2, 1997. Yet that order is not reflected on the docket sheet. The text of the order of September 10, 1997, effectively implements the master\u2019s proposed order of March 25, 1997, as revised. The order of September 10, 1997, indicates that it is a \"corrected order\u201d, it \"incorporate[s]\u201d facts of the March 25, 1997 order, and it \"supercedes\u201d [sic] the order of March 25, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The parties have not raised the matter of the September 10, 1997 order here. Moreover, at the exceptions hearing, neither counsel nor the court referred to the order of September 10, 1997. In any event, we are satisfied that the order at issue here is the one that was executed after the exceptions hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\">. In reaching our conclusion with respect to preservation, we are not persuaded by the argument raised by appellants for the first time in their reply brief. There, they argue that Ms. A.\u2019s claim is preserved under <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 488 A.2d 949 (1985). In <em>Walczak, </em>the Court said that \"when the trial court has allegedly imposed a sentence not permitted by law, the issue should ordinarily be reviewed on direct appeal even if no objection was made in the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 488 A.2d 949. But in <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 646 A.2d 1012 (1994), the Court of Appeals made clear that despite the \u201cpenal overtones\u201d implicit in the adjudication of juvenile causes, \"juvenile proceedings are not criminal matters....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 646 A.2d 1012. Thus, despite the arguably punitive character of the court's restitution order, we cannot say that Ms. A. was a \"defendant\u201d before the juvenile court, or that she received a \"sentence\u201d, as contemplated in <em>Walczak.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">. Previously, authorization for restitution orders in juvenile causes was found in C.J. \u00a7 3-829. Effective October 1, 1996, C.J. \u00a7 3-829 was transferred to Md.Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 808, without substantive change. 1996 Md.

Restitution could not have been assessed against Levon's father unless he had been \u201cafforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>to present evidence in [his own] behalf.\u201d <em>See </em>former Art. 27, \u00a7 808(e); <em>see also </em>current Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(3)(iii). Ironically, the mother, an impoverished, single parent who came to court as directed, was effectively punished for trying to act responsibly, while the proverbial \"deadbeat\u201d parent continued to escape any obligation. Had the father been present, the master or the court might have divided the financial responsibility. If the master felt that both of Levon's parents should both bear financial responsibility for their son's conduct, he might have considered an order of court directing service of process on the father to compel his attendance at the restitution hearing. Regardless, the admonition to Ms. A. to recover the money from Levon\u2019s disinterested father, who apparently has never supported Levon, was unfair to Ms. A., her children, and ultimately to the victims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
