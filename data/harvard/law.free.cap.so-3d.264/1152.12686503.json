We grant the amended motion for rehearing but deny the amended motion for rehearing en banc.

No further motions for rehearing will be entertained.\n  </p>\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   LUCAS, Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Marlyn Tracey appeals a final judgment foreclosing Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s mortgage on her home. Ms. Tracey raises two issues on appeal. Finding merit in her first argument, we need not consider the second. The circuit court reversibly erred when it permitted Wells Fargo to amend its complaint during trial to conform to the evidence it presented of two unpled modification agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The underlying litigation began on June 9, 2011, when Wells Fargo filed a complaint seeking to foreclose upon a mortgage on Ms. Tracey's property. The original complaint included as exhibits Ms. Tracey's promissory note, mortgage, and two loan modification agreements, dated May 8, 2009, and July 17, 2009, respectively. As originally filed, Wells Fargo's complaint specifically alleged that Ms. Tracey's breach of the modification agreements predicated its claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following an involuntary dismissal of that pleading, Wells Fargo changed tack with respect to its theory of recovery. On September 5, 2012, it filed an amended complaint, what would become the operative pleading for the remainder of this case, in which no mention was made of the previously asserted and attached modification agreements. For her part, Ms. Tracey's answer and affirmative defenses to the amended complaint did not raise either of these modification agreements as an avoidance to any part of Wells Fargo's claim. So, seemingly, whatever importance these modification agreements may have had-either as a basis for Wells Fargo's recovery or as an avoidance to it-was abandoned as an issue for adjudication. The case then progressed in a not unordinary course for a residential mortgage foreclosure proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the case went to trial four years later, Wells Fargo changed course yet one more time, reverting back to the modification agreements as a basis for its cause of action. Over objection, Wells Fargo admitted both modification agreements into evidence and called two witnesses who explained the succession of the note, Ms. Tracey's payment history, and that the balance was due and owing based upon the note and modification agreements. Wells Fargo's counsel argued that the omission of the modification agreements from the amended complaint was a \"mistake or inadvertence\" but that, in all events, their inclusion as part of its claim for relief visited no prejudice on Ms. Tracey because she signed the agreements and they were attached to a pleading-albeit the original, abandoned complaint. Ms. Tracey maintained that she was prejudiced by the change in Wells Fargo's theory of the case because she was unable to prepare her defense for an issue she had thought was abandoned four years earlier. Indeed, she testified that she was under the impression that the loan modification agreements Wells Fargo introduced had never progressed beyond proposals: she received only blank envelopes from Wells Fargo regarding the agreements, and when she attempted to inquire about their status by telephone was directed to a call center in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, the circuit court granted Wells Fargo's motion and, following the conclusion of the trial, entered the final judgment of foreclosure-premised on the mortgage, promissory note, and both loan modification agreements-that we now have before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A circuit court's decision to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence under Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.190(b) is one we review for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Turna v.

Our review here requires us to examine a particular aspect of rule 1.190(b) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Amendments to Conform with the Evidence.\n   </strong>\n   When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party\n   at any time, even after judgment, but failure so to amend shall not affect the result of the trial of these issues. If the evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended to conform with the evidence and shall do so freely when the merits of the cause are more effectually presented thereby and\n   <em>\n    the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence will prejudice the objecting party\n   </em>\n   in maintaining an action or defense upon the merits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Without question, Ms. Tracey objected to Wells Fargo's reassertion of the loan modification agreements as a basis for its recovery at trial. She did not try Wells Fargo's claim on two modification agreements by express or implied consent. The question before us, then, is whether the circuit court's finding that she was not prejudiced by the late amendment amounted to an abuse of discretion. Under these facts, we hold that it was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Few courts have attempted to lay hold of the precise measure of \"prejudice\" that rule 1.190(b) contemplates when a party objects to a motion to amend a pleading to conform to the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Yet, remand is a vitally important component of any appellate decision, particularly for the litigants who, depending on a decision's remand instruction, may either find themselves completely vindicated in their civil dispute or forced to retry its merits all over again. Beyond the individual parties, conflicting remand instructions could present inconsistent, even misleading, signals to litigants in other civil cases about what remedy they may anticipate from an appellate court's review. Our colleague, Judge Salario, recently wrote about the potential jurisprudential repercussions of disparate remand directions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   My point, however, is that we are making decisions about when a foreclosure plaintiff gets an involuntary dismissal or a new trial based on considerations that do not bear an obvious relationship to the rule governing the consequences of a party's failure to meet its burden of proof that we apply in cases other than foreclosures and that we may not be able to limit to the foreclosure context on a principled basis. Someday, for instance, a lawyer is going to ask that we apply the some-evidence-no-evidence rule in a garden variety contract or tort case, a result we may well consider unadvisable. At least on the basis of what our opinions say, \"that is a foreclosure rule\" may be the only answer we are able to give for not extending it.

Today we are simply recognizing what appellate courts have always done when issuing directions on remand. We are confident that the basic principles of natural fairness and equity, handed down for centuries in our common law and subject to the strong preference for finality in trials, can continue to withstand the analytical rigors of fashioning an appropriate scope of remand for civil appeals in our district. And we are hopeful that litigants will be able to more cogently frame their arguments in civil appeals for a particular remand by knowing what drives the decisions we make on this important issue. We will now apply those principles to the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Under the facts of this case, we believe Ms. Tracey is entitled to the relief she requests in her motion for rehearing. The last minute insertion of the modification agreement as an issue at trial-when it had been dropped as an issue in the operative complaint-is a puzzle that has remained unsolved throughout this appeal. Wells Fargo has never explained why its original complaint attached a modification agreement as an exhibit, while its amended, operative complaint made no mention of it. Nor has it bothered to offer an excuse for why it waited until trial to resurrect this agreement as an issue in the controversy. In its response to Ms. Tracey's motion for rehearing, Wells Fargo only tells us it made an \"inadvertent\" pleading error when it filed its amended complaint but gives no justification for why it should now enjoy a chance at a second trial to correct that error of its own making. Indeed, Wells Fargo's response does not even claim it would be prejudiced by an involuntary dismissal; it instead tries to turn the table around, suggesting it would be \"entirely appropriate to remand for continued proceedings so Wells Fargo may, if the court deems it appropriate, amend to cure any prejudice\" to Ms. Tracey. The prejudice to Ms. Tracey is having to relitigate her defense in piecemeal, seriatim trials while her adversary vacillates around what the alleged basis of its claims will ultimately be. Given the facts and equities here, we must agree with Ms. Tracey that remanding her case with directions to involuntarily dismiss the\n   amended complaint is appropriate under these circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buday\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11539089\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/754/771/#p772\">\n    754 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   773 ;\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7601164\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/485/438/#p439\">\n    485 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   440 ;\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12025678\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/692/947/#p950\">\n    692 So.2d at 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We conclude by addressing some of the thoughtful concerns our dissenting colleague has expressed. Our colleague agrees \"with the general proposition that courts should endeavor to do equity between the parties on remand,\" but not to the extent that this proposition would \"ignore established precedent,\" a term which is used to refer to two lines of cases: (1) a selection of opinions in which the appellate courts have remanded for further proceedings following an erroneous pleading amendment at trial and (2) a selection from the recent spate of Florida residential foreclosure appellate opinions which, in reversing in favor of the defendants, have indicated a distinction between cases in which some evidence was presented at the prior trial versus those in which no evidence was presented (the former are typically remanded for a new trial to allow the plaintiff to again present its claims; the latter are not).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

These decisions, and the seeming unfairness to Wells Fargo, lead our colleague to conclude that Wells Fargo ought to be given another chance in another trial to prove the case it should have pled and proven the first time around.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As to the first line of authorities, we would simply reiterate what we stated earlier.

It cannot be. First, to so hold would be to elevate a common law didacticism above a legislative pronouncement of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 59.35 (\"An appellate court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   , in reversing a judgment of a lower court brought before it for review by appeal, by the order of reversal, if the error for which reversal is sought is such as to require a new trial, direct that a new trial be had on all the issues shown by the record or upon a part of such issues only.\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    Metro.

Second, it would conflict with decades of Florida law that ties the scope of remand in civil appeals concerning evidentiary disputes to the equitable circumstances of a particular case. Finally, we must observe that none of the recent foreclosure opinions our colleague recites for this proposition included a ratio decidendi for the \"some-evidence-no-evidence\" rule from which those courts fashioned their respective remand instructions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such omissions were surely not unintentional.

Thus, as we implied in\n   <em>\n    Wolkoff\n   </em>\n   , we must read these recent foreclosure opinions as cases in which the panels viewed the fairness and equity of the specific evidentiary records before them as necessitating either further proceedings (as in the case of\n   <em>\n    Sas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7010028\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/112/778/\">\n    112 So.3d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) or an involuntary dismissal (as in the case of\n   <em>\n    Wolkoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892734\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/280/\">\n    153 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   283 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   To be sure, whether that record was utterly devoid of, or otherwise rife with, competent evidence might play an important equitable consideration for purposes of remand in this class of appeals-but it remains just that: an equitable consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Today we reconcile our recent jurisprudence in residential mortgage foreclosure appeals with long-standing, settled law on the scope of remand in civil appeals. We hold that when fashioning remand for a civil appeal where the party with the burden of proof fails to sufficiently plead the claim it presents at trial or to establish a basis in admissible evidence for a claim at trial, an appellate panel may exercise some level of equitable discretion to consider the circumstances of the particular case. This discretion is bounded both by the substantive relief sought within the appeal and the strong preference for finality of trial proceedings. The prohibition against proverbial multiple \"bites at the apple\" for trials remains firmly rooted as the leading, guiding principle to govern the scope of remand and should serve as the default direction when these kinds of decisions are being made. We agree with how the\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    's\n   </em>\n   court put it: only \"exceptional legal or factual\" circumstances will justify a deviation from this general prohibition.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7035034\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/48/76/#p79\">\n    48 So.3d at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Having so held, we recognize the important points our dissenting colleague has raised, as well as the cases he discusses in which certain courts have begun fashioning varying remand directions without reference\n   to the analysis we have discerned. It may be that a \"clear line of case law\" now mandates a particular remand, without discretion, on the part of appellate panels whenever a certain kind of error has been identified that warrants reversal in a civil appeal. Certainly, the issue is one that has become a central feature in many residential mortgage foreclosure appeals. Accordingly, pursuant to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.030(a)(2)(A)(v), we certify the following question of great public importance to the Florida Supreme Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   WHEN A PARTY WITH THE BURDEN OF PROOF IN A CIVIL CASE FAILS TO PLEAD THE CLAIM PRESENTED AT TRIAL OR TO ESTABLISH A BASIS IN ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE FOR A CLAIM AT TRIAL, DOES A DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL HAVE EQUITABLE DISCRETION TO FASHION THE SCOPE OF REMAND AFTER A REVERSAL ON APPEAL, AND, IF SO, WHAT GOVERNS OR CONSTRAINS THE EXERCISE OF THAT DISCRETION?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We would answer the question in the affirmative, consistent with the principles we have identified above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the judgment below and remand with directions for the circuit court to enter an involuntary dismissal in favor of Ms. Tracey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Reversed and remanded with instructions; question certified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   KHOUZAM, J., Concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   SLEET, J., Concurs in part and dissents in part with opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    At the same time, several courts have observed that the issue of prejudice is \"the crucial consideration\" on a motion to amend to conform to the evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Horacio O.

Where the answer is 'yes,' then a remand for new trial is the correct result.\" There is no legal basis for such a didactic approach to remand; and as we have already explained such a rule would be an anomaly within jurisprudence that has always been grounded on principles of equity and fairness. Pragmatically speaking, the test she proposes would likely prove to be illusory in application. If the \"foreclosing lender would have prevailed at trial\" in spite of an erroneous evidentiary ruling, then the error would almost certainly have been harmless-and an appellate court would not reverse such a ruling.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Special v.

Therefore, the error, if any, was harmless.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The dissent also posits that the recent \"distinction\" in remand directions among the district courts is ultimately based on Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.420(a)'s evidentiary standard for motions for involuntary dismissal in nonjury trials. That is a novel notion (one wonders how to apply it to the analogous motion for directed verdict in jury trials, rule 1.480, a rule that contains no evidentiary standard whatsoever in its text). It is also a notion that reflects a fundamental obfuscation between what an appellate court does when it considers the merits of an appeal and the scope of remand the court issues following a successful appeal. The two inquiries may be related, but they are not fungible. When an adjudication is made under a particular procedural rule, that rule can, and often will, shape and illuminate how the appellate court will review the substantive issues on the merits of the appeal. Similarly, the invocation of a procedural rule may be necessary to preserve certain appellate arguments and relief. That is all the cases cited by the dissent on this point actually hold. But the rules of civil procedure do not speak to the scope of appellate remand at all (unlike section 59.35 and the authorities discussing the scope of remand in section II.B.,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , which do). The scope of remand after the merits of an appeal have been decided is necessarily a separate inquiry, and in those cases where it has been addressed, is always treated as such. In any event, if it were true, as the dissent now espouses, that an appellate court's remand in these cases turned completely on the standard trial courts are supposed to apply under rule 1.420(b), then surely one of the cases cited in the dissenting opinion would have stated that sweeping proposition. None of them did. That is because the analysis here turns on principles of equity and well-established case law (case law the dissent ignores), not the text of a procedural rule that does not address the scope of remand.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Winchel v.

One would intuit that, to the extent the presentation of \"some\" admissible evidence were a pertinent demarcation for all remands in appeals over the sufficiency or admissibility of evidence, the more appropriate remand in most cases would be to direct the trial court to simply enter an amended judgment based upon the record evidence that was otherwise properly admitted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-67\">\n   SLEET, Judge, Concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   I concur fully in part I of the majority opinion. However, because the scope of remand in this panel's original opinion was appropriate, I dissent from the majority's decision in parts II and III to grant rehearing and to remand for an involuntary dismissal. The analysis in this case should have been limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Wells Fargo to amend the complaint during trial and whether this amendment prejudiced Tracey in the preparation of her defense. Instead, the majority has ventured beyond the specific facts of this case and created a new, sweeping standard for the scope of remand which it mandates will now apply to all civil appeals in the Second District. As I will explain below, this new standard conflicts with the rules of procedure and well-established precedent from this and every other Florida District Court of Appeal.

The prejudice to Tracey was that she was unable to adequately prepare a defense to these loan modifications, having no notice that they would be admitted at trial or that Wells Fargo would proceed on a theory that she had breached the modification agreements when she stopped making payments on her mortgage in November 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Remanding for amendment of the pleadings and retrial will cure this prejudice, giving Tracey sufficient notice and opportunity to prepare and present a defense to the loan modification agreements if she can do so in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   However, remanding for an involuntary dismissal in this case unfairly penalizes Wells Fargo for relying on the trial court's ruling and grants a windfall to Ms. Tracey.

Superficially, the cases cited by the majority may appear to reach divergent results; however, an analysis of their holdings shows that they are consistent. In\n   <em>\n    Dean Co. v. U.S. Home Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7601164\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/485/438/#p439\">\n    485 So.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 440 (Fla. 2d DCA 1986), this court remanded for the entry of judgment in favor of the defendant when the plaintiff agreed to an \"all or nothing\" theory of indemnification but was permitted at the close of the case to amend its complaint to plead a theory of contribution. In that case, the defendant pleaded and succeeded in proving that both parties were at fault only to find itself \"trap[ped] ... in a judgment requiring contribution.\" And in\n   <em>\n    Freshwater v. Vetter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7571827\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/511/1114/#p1115\">\n    511 So.2d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1115 (Fla. 2d DCA 1987), the trial court erred in permitting the plaintiff to amend its complaint at the close of the evidence to include an entirely new cause of action against one of the defendants. In that case, this court merely vacated the judgment against that defendant, leaving the judgment against the remaining defendants intact. The majority has not identified any such inequities in the present case. The only prejudice to Ms. Tracey was that she was unable to prepare a defense based on the loan modification agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, although I agree with the general proposition that courts should endeavor to do equity between the parties on remand, I disagree with the majority's mischaracterization of the holdings in\n   <em>\n    Sas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wolkoff\n   </em>\n   as limited to the \"specific evidentiary records before [the panels in those cases]\" or based solely on the application of equitable principles. The plain language of this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Wolkoff\n   </em>\n   sets forth a rule generally applicable when a party fails to prove an essential element of its case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892734\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/280/\">\n    153 So.3d at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When a party seeking monetary damages fails to establish an evidentiary basis for the damages ultimately awarded at trial, reversal for entry of an order of dismissal is warranted.\"). Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Sas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wolkoff\n   </em>\n   , an involuntary dismissal is not and should not be the default disposition of all civil appeals; rather, it is only warranted where the plaintiff failed \"to offer any evidence at\n   all-whether admissible or not.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12367345,12367337\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/223/1059/\">\n    223 So.3d at 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Beauchamp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904301\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/827/\">\n    150 So. 3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   829 n.2 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6830403\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/183/1038/#p1040\">\n    183 So.3d at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"While ... the general rule [is] that 'when the record on appeal is devoid of competent substantial evidence to support the attorney's fee award, the appellate court will reverse the award without remand for additional evidentiary findings,' where the record includes some evidence supporting the fee and cost award, this court may remand for further proceedings.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Diwakar v.

Contrary to the majority's assertions, this court's adherence to procedural requirements and precedent in providing instructions on remand does not preclude it from considering the \"equitable circumstances\" of the parties. Indeed, as this court observed in\n   <em>\n    Wolkoff\n   </em>\n   and as the majority repeats above, equity supported remanding the case for a new trial in both\n   <em>\n    Sas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kelsey v.
