An automobile operated by Calvin Jones ran a stop sign and collided with Spano's automobile; Thomas was injured. Thomas's damages exceeded the limits of Jones's automobile-liability policy, so Thomas sued Spano's insurer, Safeway Insurance Company of Alabama, Inc. (\"Safeway\"), in the Jefferson Circuit Court (\"the trial court\") seeking underinsured-motorist (\"UIM\") benefits. Safeway filed a motion for a summary judgment, in which it argued that Thomas was not entitled to benefits under Spano's policy based on an exclusion in the policy precluding coverage when the automobile covered under the policy was being operated by an unlicensed driver (\"the unlicensed-driver exclusion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Thomas opposed Safeway's motion and also sought a judgment in his favor. After discovery was completed, the parties stipulated to the following facts: Evans was not and had not ever been a licensed driver, and Thomas was unaware that Evans did not possess a driver's license; no other facts regarding the accident were disputed. Based on arguments made by Thomas, the trial court entered a judgment declaring the unlicensed-driver exclusion unenforceable against Thomas because, the trial court said, based on Thomas's lack of knowledge of Evans's status as an unlicensed driver, the exclusion violated Alabama's UIM statute, Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 32-7-23(a), and Alabama's public policy. The trial court further ordered Safeway to pay to Thomas the policy limits of $50,000 and costs of $173.10. Safeway timely appealed the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, Safeway argues that the trial court erred in declaring that the unlicensed-driver exclusion in Safeway's policy violates \u00a7 32-7-23(a) or public policy. Safeway contends that the unlicensed-driver exclusion, like many other insurance-policy exclusions examined by Alabama courts, is enforceable and that, in essence, by basing its decision, in part, on Thomas's knowledge of Evans's status, the trial court impermissibly engrafted a knowledge requirement onto the exclusion and rewrote the policy. Based on our review of the relevant statutes and caselaw, we agree with Safeway that the unlicensed-driver exclusion is valid and enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    General Principles Governing the Construction of Insurance Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We begin our analysis by setting out the general rules governing our construction of insurance contracts.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"General rules of contract law govern an insurance contract.\n   <em>\n    Twin City Fire Ins.

Because UIM coverage (as opposed to the offering of such coverage) is not mandatory, we explained, White's failure to list Lightfoot in her policy application effectively served as a rejection of UIM coverage as to him, and the exclusion in White's policy was enforceable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11757562\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/723/93/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We noted that Hambrick had paid nothing for the coverage he sought, underscoring the idea in\n   <em>\n    McCullough\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Higgins\n   </em>\n   that UIM coverage is for the protection of those who purchase liability insurance and not necessarily everyone who might be injured by an uninsured or underinsured motorist.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11757562\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/723/93/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11757562\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/723/93/\">\n    at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We realize that Thomas has attempted to distinguish cases like\n   <em>\n    Hambrick\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McCullough\n   </em>\n   on the ground that those cases involve a rejection of coverage for \"specific\" individuals. Of course, in\n   <em>\n    Hambrick\n   </em>\n   , it was the failure to list a specific person, Lightfoot, on the insurance application that resulted in the determination that the insured, White, had rejected any coverage for him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11757562\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/723/93/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11757562\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/723/93/\">\n    at 96-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The provision upon which that rejection was based in\n   <em>\n    Hambrick\n   </em>\n   , however, was what Thomas refers to as a \"blanket\" exclusion, excluding coverage for a class of individuals: those under age 25, residing in the household of the insured, who had not been listed on the policy application.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11757562\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/723/93/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The exclusion in the present case is also a \"blanket\" exclusion, excluding coverage for individuals operating a vehicle who do not have a driver's license. Because Spano agreed that her policy would not cover her automobile if its was driven by an unlicensed driver, she, like White, \"partially rejected\" UIM coverage in such situations, which she was entitled to do under \u00a7 32-7-23(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11757562\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/723/93/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11757562\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/723/93/\">\n    at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We also reject Thomas's argument that the unlicensed-driver exclusion is void as against public policy because of a statement contained in\n   <em>\n    Grimes v. Alfa Mutual Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12369760\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/227/475/#p488\">\n    227 So.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488 (Ala. 2017). In a discussion of mandatory liability coverage, our supreme court stated that \"[a] person who does not own the automobile that he or she operates must purchase an operator's policy or a non-owner policy in order to qualify for a driver's license.\"\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12369760\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/227/475/#p488\">\n    227 So.3d at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Thomas, this \"fact\" means that an unlicensed driver cannot get a driver's license or insurance, leaving that person with no ability to comply with the law regarding licensing or compulsory liability insurance. The\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   court cited no statute or caselaw, and we can find none, to support the above-quoted statement, which does not appear to be necessary to the holding in the opinion. Thus, we conclude that the\n   statement is dicta and that Thomas's argument that Evans would be unable to secure a driver's license or insurance is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on the principles espoused by both our court and our supreme court, we conclude that the trial court erred in declaring that the exclusion in Safeway's policy violated \u00a7 32-7-23(a) and public policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The exclusion is valid under the rationale announced in\n   <em>\n    McCullough\n   </em>\n   and applied in\n   <em>\n    Hambrick\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court's judgment in favor of Thomas is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for the entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Thompson, P.J., and Pittman and Donaldson, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Moore, J., concurs in the result, without writing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The parties appear to agree that the automobile in which Thomas was a passenger was a \"covered auto\" under the terms of Spano's policy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    In his appellate brief, Thomas asserts for the first time an argument that Safeway should be estopped from relying on the unlicensed-driver exclusion because it consented to his settlement with Jones for Jones's policy limits. \"We decline to consider the question of estoppel, raised for the first time on appeal.\"\n    <em>\n     Warrior Drilling and Eng'g Co. v.
