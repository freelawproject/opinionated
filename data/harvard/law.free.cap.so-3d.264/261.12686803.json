Sutton appeals his judgments and sentences for attempted second-degree murder and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon following his nolo contendere plea to the charges. Mr. Sutton argues, and the State correctly concedes, that the trial court erred by failing to conduct a competency hearing and by failing to enter a competency order. Therefore, this case must be remanded for the trial court to determine, if it is able, whether Mr. Sutton was competent at the time he entered the plea and to enter a competency order reflecting its finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Prior to Mr. Sutton's plea, his attorney successfully moved for an order appointing mental health experts to examine Mr. Sutton to determine if he was mentally competent to proceed to trial. Two experts examined Mr. Sutton and one expert found that he was not competent to proceed, while the other expert found that he was competent to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the change of plea hearing, the trial court asked Mr. Sutton if he was \"suffering today or in the past from any mental health disorder that effects your thinking?\" Mr. Sutton replied in the affirmative and his attorney stated \"In the past.\" The trial court then inquired:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   THE COURT: Alright, you feel like you know what you're doing here today?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THE COURT: Your responses appear to [be] appropriate to the questions posed. Are you taking any medication now?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: No, Sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE COURT: And do you feel like your mind's clear?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: Alright. Has he previously been declared incompetent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No Sir, he was evaluated was um--rehabilitated or uh--re-reintroduced into the system as competent. We actually had a independent evaluation done afterwards. It came back competent as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   There is no indication in the record that the trial court was given the opportunity to review the experts' reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.212(b) requires a trial court to enter a written order if the court finds the defendant competent to proceed. Further, a trial court may not accept a stipulation from the parties regarding a defendant's competency to stand trial because doing so \"improperly absolves the trial court from making an independent determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Dougherty v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6912097\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/149/672/#p678\">\n    149 So.3d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678 (Fla. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the trial court, when the parties agree, may decide the issue of competency on the basis of written reports alone, it cannot dispense with its duty to make an independent determination about a defendant's competency, and must enter a written order if the defendant is found competent to proceed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6912097\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/149/672/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6912097\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/149/672/#p678\">\n    at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There are three recent cases from this court addressing this issue:\n   <em>\n    Sallee v.

In each case, the trial court appointed experts to evaluate the defendant's competency to proceed, and at a competency hearing, the defense attorney recounted the findings of the experts and conceded that the defendant had been found competent. The trial court in each case never entered a written order in which it made an independent finding that the defendant was competent.\n   <em>\n    Sallee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12669774\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/244/1143/\">\n    244 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1145 ;\n   <em>\n    Carrion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12380361\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/235/1051/\">\n    235 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1053 ;\n   <em>\n    Moulton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12378278\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/230/934/\">\n    230 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   936 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golloman v.
