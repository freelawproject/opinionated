In the parties' 2009 divorce judgment, the Jefferson Circuit Court, Bessemer Division, incorporated an agreement of the parties and awarded the \"care, custody, and control\" of the child to the mother. It awarded the father visitation and ordered him to pay certain expenses \"in lieu of paying child support.\" The agreement provided that the parties could not have overnight guests of the opposite sex during custodial periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The record contains an October 4, 2016, modification judgment that includes a determination that the father had accrued a $1,000 \"child-support arrearage,\" which apparently resulted from the father's failure to pay certain expenses he had been ordered to pay in lieu of child support, and ordered the father to begin paying the mother $361 per month in child support. The modification judgment did not modify the child's custody and left \"all other provisions of the divorce judgment in full force and effect,\" with the exception of one provision that is not relevant to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 17, 2016, the father initiated another modification action. The father complained that the mother had notified him that, in violation of the terms of the divorce judgment, she and the child were moving in with a man. The father requested an award of \"primary\" physical custody of the child. The mother filed an answer in which she asserted, among other things, that she was not violating the terms of the divorce judgment because, she argued, she was in a common-law marriage relationship with the man. The father filed an amended complaint seeking an emergency hearing, in which he asserted\n   that the mother and the child had moved into the man's house, that the mother had enrolled the child in a new school, and that the child did not have his own bedroom. The circuit court entered orders setting a hearing and ordering the mother to bring the child to the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The circuit court entered a modification judgment on May 12, 2017, finding the mother in contempt based upon its determination that she and the man were living together \"under the pretense of a common-law marriage.\" Regardless, the circuit court concluded that the mother and the father would \"continue to share joint custody\" of the child\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and included a detailed custody and visitation schedule, which provides that the child will live with the mother during the school year, subject to the father's right to visitation on odd weekends each month, and that the child will live with the father 8 of 10 weeks during the summer. The circuit court also provided a relatively equal holiday-visitation schedule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court did not require either party to pay child support and set out in writing that it had intentionally deviated from the Rule 32, Ala. R. Jud. Admin., child-support guidelines because the mother and the father were to \"jointly share custody and expenses.\" The judgment allows each parent to claim the child as a dependent on his or her income-tax return every other year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The mother filed a timely postjudgment motion, which the circuit court denied. The mother filed a timely notice of appeal, seeking our review of whether the circuit court had erred by not ordering the father to pay child support, by allowing the father to claim the child as a dependent for income-tax purposes every other year, and by limiting the mother to a two-week custodial period in the summers. Notably, the mother\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   waives any issue on appeal regarding the award of joint custody of the child. The mother's appellate brief reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The Order contains a factual error as it incorrectly implies that the parties shared joint custody of [the child] prior to the entry of the Order when, in fact, the Mother had sole custody of [the child].\n   <em>\n    Be that as it may, the Mother does not appeal the award of joint custody.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A court reporter was not present at the modification hearing, and, thus, there is no transcript of that hearing. Rule 10(d), Ala. R. App. P., states, in pertinent part: \"If no report of the evidence or proceedings at a hearing or trial was made, or if a transcript is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means, including the appellant's recollection.\" The mother prepared a statement of the evidence. Although the father did not file an objection or any proposed amendments to the mother's statement of the evidence, as permitted by Rule 10(d), the circuit court issued its own statement of the evidence, which is included in the record on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 10(d) (\"The statement, either as approved by the court or as issued by the court ..., shall be filed with the clerk of the trial court, who shall include it in the record on appeal.\"). The mother filed in this court a motion to strike the circuit court's statement of the evidence, which we denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The circuit court's statement of the\n   evidence consists of five brief paragraphs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first paragraph provides that the mother failed to demonstrate the existence of a common-law marriage, which is not an issue on appeal. The second paragraph reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"This Court agrees that neither Party timely submitted [child-support] forms; however, the [father] filed a CS-41 form on April 24, 2017, after trial, which the Court did not consider. This Court agrees [that the father] resides in his parents' home. Evidence was not presented to the Court with respect to payment of [the father's] bills.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The third paragraph provides that a certain witness's testimony was not relevant to the issue of child support. The fourth paragraph indicates that the child testified in camera. The final paragraph provides a short summary of evidence presented regarding a gun collection, which is not a subject of this appeal. Our review of the issues presented is limited by the brevity of the statement of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   First, the mother argues that the circuit court abused its discretion by not ordering the father to pay child support. Matters related to child support, including modifications of a child-support order, rest soundly within the trial court's discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal, absent a showing that the ruling is unsupported by the evidence and thus is plainly and palpably wrong.\n   <em>\n    Berryhill v.

Pursuant to Rule 32(A)(1)(a), a trial court has the discretion, in a case in which joint physical custody is awarded, to not award child support based on the particular circumstances of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bonner v.

Although a deviation from the child-support guidelines would be permissible in this case, by going so far as to not award child support in light of the particular joint-physical-custody schedule in this case, we agree with the mother that the circuit court abused its discretion. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's judgment insofar as it fails to require the father to pay child support.

The award of the income-tax exemption is an issue that is related to child support; therefore, that award is also reversed, and the circuit court should, on remand, redetermine who is entitled to claim that exemption, as a part of its child-support determination made in compliance with Rule 32.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arnold v.

The father has visitation on odd weekends during those 10 months, amounting to approximately 44 days, assuming 2 months occur that have 5 weekends. The father also has visitation with the child for 56 days during the summer. The parties alternate holidays each year, so the division of that time is equal. Disregarding the equal award of holiday visitation to each party, the father has visitation with the child a little more than one-quarter of the time. Thus, although the trial court has ordered a purported \"joint custody\" award, the mother has the child in her home significantly more often than the father, which necessitates her spending more money than the father to support the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Motley v.

App. 1992), I cannot agree that the custody award set forth in the judgment is sufficient to warrant a deviation from the child-support guidelines under Rule 32. As already stated, I conclude that that custody arrangement is actually one awarding the mother sole physical custody. Rule 32 contemplates a deviation when, among other things, there is \"[s]hared physical custody or visitation rights providing for periods of physical custody or care of children by the obligor parent substantially in excess of those customarily approved or ordered by the court.\" Rule 32(A)(1)(a). In this case, the father was awarded a fairly standard schedule of alternating weekend and holiday visitation, and he was awarded summer visitation of only two to four weeks in excess of that generally awarded by trial courts in a standard visitation award. The judgment at issue does not provide the father visitation that is \"substantially in excess\" of visitation periods contemplated by the child-support guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comment to Rule 32 (as amended to conform to amendments to Rule 32 effective October 4, 1993) (\"The Schedule of Basic Child Support Obligations is premised on the assumption that the noncustodial parent will exercise customary visitation rights, including summer visitation. Any abatement of child support because of extraordinary visitation should be based on visitation in excess of customary visitation.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Comment to Amendments to Rule 32 Effective January 1, 2009 (same). Accordingly,\n   I conclude that the trial court erred in failing to determine a child-support obligation for the father, and, for that reason, I concur in the result insofar as the main opinion reverses the trial court's judgment as to the issue of child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Similarly, because the issue of the income-tax exemption is a part of the overall child-support determination, I also concur in the result insofar as the main opinion reverses that part of the judgment. I concur in that part of the main opinion that affirms the award of summer custodial periods.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Nothing in the record supports a conclusion that the mother and the father had shared joint custody of the child in the past.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    \"Joint physical custody does not necessarily mean physical custody of equal durations of time.\" \u00a7 30-3-151(3), Ala.
