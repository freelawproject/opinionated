In December 2008, Alcorn State University's head football coach, Ernest Jones, sued the university. He alleged that Alcorn had breached his contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in a number of ways, including by firing seven of his assistant coaches and by failing to provide necessary equipment for his team. Jones's complaint also sought an injunction to prevent Alcorn from firing him. The following month, Alcorn fired Jones. For the next seven years, litigation continued in three different cases until Jones's original lawsuit finally proceeded to a jury trial. The jury found that Alcorn breached its implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and awarded Jones damages\n   of $500,000. However, the circuit court granted Alcorn's post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). Jones then appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. On appeal, Jones argues that the circuit court erred by granting Alcorn's motion for JNOV. Jones also argues that the circuit court erred by denying his pretrial motion to amend his complaint, which prevented him from pursuing a claim that Alcorn breached his contract by firing him without cause. Finally, Jones argues that the circuit court erred by dismissing his claim against Alcorn's former athletic director for tortious interference with contract on the ground that the claim was barred by the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (MTCA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. We reverse and remand. First, we hold that Jones has a viable claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. However, that claim is subject to the MTCA. Because Jones did not satisfy the MTCA's pre-suit notice requirement, the claim must be dismissed without prejudice. Jones may refile the claim, but it must be decided by the circuit judge \"without a jury,\" as required by the MTCA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-13\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-46-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (Rev. 2012). Second, we hold that Jones should have been allowed to pursue a claim that Alcorn breached his contract by firing him without cause. Third, we reverse the dismissal of Jones's claim against Hamilton based on our Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Springer v. Ausbern Construction Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12378502,12378487\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/231/980/\">\n    231 So.3d 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 988-89 (\u00b6\u00b6 32-35) (Miss. 2017), which held that the MTCA does not apply to such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Jones played wide receiver for Alcorn in the mid-1990s and graduated from the university in 1995. After graduation, he briefly played arena and semi-pro football before going into coaching. Jones eventually became an assistant coach at Central Michigan University under head coach Brian Kelly. When Kelly became the head coach at the University of Cincinnati, Jones joined his staff at Cincinnati as the running backs coach. Jones's salary at Cincinnati was $190,000. In 2007, the NCAA recognized Jones as one of ten up-and-coming minority assistant coaches with the potential to become Division I head coaches. Other coaches who received this recognition later became head coaches at the University of Texas, Texas A &amp; M, Penn State, Vanderbilt, and Stanford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. In 2007, Jones was hired as Alcorn's head coach with an annual salary of $140,000. Jones was willing to take a significant pay cut because of the opportunity to return to his alma mater as a head coach. The contract that Jones eventually signed was short on details. It consisted of a single page with five additional, standard form clauses attached. The contract was for a term of four years with an annual salary of $140,000. The contract provided that Jones could be fired only for (a) \"[f]inancial exigencies as declared by the Board [of Trustees of the State Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL) ]\"; (b) \"[t]ermination or reduction of programs ... as approved by the Board\"; (c) \"[m]alfeasance, inefficiency or contumacious conduct\"; or (d) \"[f]or cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Darren Hamilton became Alcorn's athletic director in April 2008. Hamilton clashed with Jones almost immediately. Alcorn's then-president, George Ross, testified that the \"two men didn't like each other,\" although Ross said he did not know why. On May 12, 2008, only six weeks after Hamilton arrived at Alcorn, Hamilton wrote a strongly worded \"Letter of Reprimand\" to Jones, with copies to Jones's personnel file and Alcorn's director of human resources. Hamilton alleged that\n   Jones had violated the university's code of conduct by \"inexcusable neglect of duty or insubordination.\" Specifically, Hamilton alleged that Jones and an assistant coach, Keith Majors, failed to attend a scheduled meeting with him. Jones denied the allegation in a written response. According to Jones, he and Majors went to see Hamilton at the appointed time, but Hamilton looked at them and turned and walked away without saying a word. Jones testified that Hamilton called the meeting because Hamilton wanted Jones to fire Majors, but Jones refused because Majors was a valued member of his staff. However, Hamilton testified that he did not tell Jones to fire Majors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. When Alcorn began fall practice in late July 2008, the team had no helmets, pads, shoes, or uniforms. The few items of used equipment that the team did have had not been certified as safe for use as required by NCAA rules. Players had to supply their own helmets, pads, and shoes for practice. For much of the preseason, the team practiced in plain white t-shirts with handwritten numbers. Pads, helmets, shoes, and uniforms finally arrived only a week before the team's first game. Jones and the team's equipment manager, Dante Tyson-Bey, testified that they repeatedly asked Hamilton to approve orders for desperately needed uniforms and equipment, but Hamilton delayed. Tyson-Bey, who had years of experience with college and pro sports teams, described the 2008 preseason as \"the most embarrassing thing [he had] ever been a part of.\" Jones and others also testified that the athletic department failed to provide meals for the team during fall practice and failed to pay medical insurance premiums. As a result, Jones and his staff provided peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and box lunches, and injured players had to wait to see doctors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Jones also testified that, before Hamilton arrived, Ross promised Jones that he could raise money for the football program and supplement his base salary by soliciting sponsors for TV and radio shows. According to Jones, this practice is customary in college football, and the previous coach at Alcorn, Johnny Thomas, had done the same. Jones testified that Ross directed him to talk to Thomas about the shows. Based on conversations with Ross and Thomas, Jones opened a bank account that he named the \"Run and Gun\" account and solicited donations and sponsorships for the shows. However, after Hamilton was hired, he ordered Jones to close the account and transfer the money to the ASU Foundation, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the university. Jones testified that he did as Hamilton instructed. Jones testified that he did pay vendors for fundraising-related expenses that were incurred before he was ordered to close the account. But Jones transferred all remaining funds, which was most of what he had raised, to the Foundation. Nonetheless, Hamilton accused Jones of opening an unauthorized bank account and refusing to turn over funds to the Foundation. A May 22, 2008 memorandum shows that, based on Hamilton's allegation, Alcorn's human resources director contacted a special assistant attorney general for advice about possible \"disciplinary actions and/or termination of [Jones's] employment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Jones also testified that Hamilton gave him permission to book hotel rooms for all games in advance of the season. Jones delegated this responsibility to an assistant coach, who then booked hotels for all games, including the Capital City Classic-the season finale in Jackson against Jackson State University. Unbeknownst to Jones and his assistant coach, another Alcorn employee booked hotel rooms for the Capital City Classic at a different hotel. Hamilton later claimed that\n   Jones had mishandled football finances by double-booking rooms for the team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Jones testified that he met with Hamilton in June 2008 to discuss a potential shoe contract with New Balance. After discussing the issue with Hamilton, Jones agreed to a deal with New Balance, and Hamilton approved the agreement subject to certain modifications to the terms of the contract. However, in October the Southwestern Athletic Conference signed an agreement to make Nike the exclusive shoe provider for the entire conference. Hamilton directed Jones to get out of the contract with New Balance. In addition, Hamilton alleged that the agreement with New Balance was unauthorized. Jones testified that this harmed his reputation with New Balance and other companies in the industry. Jones also testified that Hamilton ordered him to cancel the New Balance contract in retaliation for Jones's continued refusal to fire Majors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Hamilton also alleged that Jones made an $11,000 order from a Russell Athletics vendor without proper authorization. However, Jones testified that the vendor eventually acknowledged that Jones did not place the order and that the shipment and invoice were in error. Jones offered a note from the vendor's salesman to corroborate his testimony. However, even after the vendor acknowledged its error, Hamilton accused Jones of \"inefficiency in resolving\" the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. Alcorn struggled through a 2-10 season in 2008. On November 26, 2008, seven of Jones's assistant coaches received identical notices that their contracts would \"not be renewed\" and that their \"employment at Alcorn ... [would] end on December 31, 2008.\" Although Ross signed the notices, each stated that the decision not to renew the coach's contract was based on Hamilton's recommendation. Ross testified that he simply followed Hamilton's recommendations, and he could not recall or lacked personal knowledge of the reasons for the non-renewals. Jones was not given any advance warning or any reason for the non-renewal notices. He first learned about the notices from his assistant coaches. Jones then filed the instant lawsuit against Alcorn on December 5, 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jones testified that Alcorn's abrupt termination of his assistant coaches made it impossible for him to do his job and harmed his reputation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. At trial, Ross claimed that the assistant coaches were never really fired. He testified that the assistant coaches were on one-year contracts, and the fact that their existing contracts were not being\n   <em>\n    renewed\n   </em>\n   did not mean that they would not be offered\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   contracts for the following year. None of this was explained to the assistant coaches, who understandably were confused and upset by the non-renewal notices. However, after Jones filed suit against Alcorn, all of his assistant coaches were asked to remain with the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14. Five days after Jones filed suit, Alcorn gave him notice of his possible termination for cause. In the notice, Hamilton stated that he was recommending Jones's termination \"due to inefficiency and malfeasance\" on four grounds: (1) \"[o]pening a bank account in [his own] name and depositing fundraising monies without proper\n   authority ... and without following the proper procedures\"; (2) buying shoes from a \"non-approved\" vendor \"when [Alcorn] ha[d] an exclusive footwear contract with Nike\"; (3) \"[i]nefficiency in resolving\" the alleged unauthorized order of Russell Athletics apparel; and (4) booking hotel rooms for the Capital City Classic \"without authority and without following proper procedures.\" The notice informed Jones that he had the right to request a due process hearing before a hearing committee, which would make a recommendation to Ross.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15. Jones exercised his right to a hearing, and the hearing was held on January 16, 2009. The hearing committee was comprised of three Alcorn employees appointed by Ross. Jones was allowed to attend the hearing and to call and question witnesses. Jones's attorneys were allowed to attend as advisors but were not allowed to examine witnesses or present evidence. After the hearing, the committee recommended that Ross terminate Jones for malfeasance and contumacious conduct. Ross concurred in the committee's recommendation and terminated Jones effective January 28, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16. Jones appealed the hearing committee's decision and his termination to the Claiborne County Circuit Court by petition for a writ of certiorari.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-51-93\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-51-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2012). In April 2011, the circuit court dismissed Jones's petition and upheld the committee's decision. Jones appealed, and in August 2013, this Court affirmed the circuit court's order dismissing Jones's petition. This Court held that Jones's hearing comported with due process and that Jones could not show that the hearing committee's decision was \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Alcorn State Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004022\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/120/448/\">\n    120 So.3d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17. On January 28, 2009, the same day that Ross officially terminated Jones, Alcorn asked Jones's associate head coach and defensive coordinator, Earnest Collins, to serve as Alcorn's interim head coach for the 2009 season. Collins initially declined. He and Jones were close friends,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and he testified that he \"didn't want to be in that environment\" or work for a school that would treat an alumnus like Jones had been treated. However, after Jones encouraged Collins to take the job, Collins agreed to stay on one condition: he would not report to or deal with Hamilton. Alcorn agreed that Collins could report to Ross's chief of staff and would not have to deal with Hamilton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hamilton left Alcorn during 2009. Collins remained at Alcorn as the interim head coach for the 2009 and 2010 seasons before he was hired as the head coach at his alma matter, the University of Northern Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18. In May 2010, Alcorn filed a motion to dismiss this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Alcorn argued that Jones's complaint in this case was \"premature\" because Jones's petition for writ of certiorari, which challenged his termination, remained pending in the circuit court. Alcorn argued that both cases arose \"out of the same operative facts, events, and/or occurrences.\" Alcorn further argued that Jones was required to \"exhaust\n   his administrative remedies\"-i.e., pursue his certiorari petition to a final decision-before he could pursue his complaint for damages in this case. Indeed, Alcorn argued that there could not even be a \"justiciable controversy\" on Jones's complaint for damages until there was \"a final determination of [his] appeal seeking reinstatement of his employment.\" The circuit court never ruled on Alcorn's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 19. Also in May 2010, while Jones's petition for certiorari and separate complaint for damages both remained pending in circuit court, Jones filed suit in federal court against Alcorn, IHL, Hamilton, and Ross. Jones's federal complaint alleged violations of his constitutional rights and sought damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and injunctive relief under\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    209 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    28 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    52 L.Ed. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1908). Jones also asserted state law claims, including breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and tortious interference with contract. Jones's reasons for filing the federal complaint are unclear. In any event, in 2012, the district court ruled that the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution provided Alcorn and IHL with immunity from suit in federal court. Therefore, the court dismissed all claims against Alcorn and IHL \"without prejudice pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment.\" Jones's claims against Hamilton and Ross were also dismissed \"without prejudice\" for failure to serve process within 120 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 20. As noted above, this Court affirmed the dismissal of Jones's petition for a writ of certiorari in August 2013. In 2014, this case stirred to life in the circuit court, and eventually trial was set for January 12, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 21. On August 10, 2015, Jones filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. Jones stated that the proposed amended complaint would \"simplify\" the case by eliminating some claims, which he conceded were not viable. Alcorn opposed Jones's motion, arguing that the proposed amended complaint asserted a \"brand new\" claim for breach of contract based on Jones's termination. Alcorn contended that Jones's motion should be denied because of Jones's \"lack of diligence\" and because the amendment would unduly delay the litigation and prejudice Alcorn. In rebuttal, Jones argued that his original complaint \"gave ... notice that [he] was claiming breach of contract.\" Jones also pointed out that in Alcorn's previously filed motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Alcorn itself had argued that this case was premature until Jones has exhausted his administrative remedies by appealing his termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 22. In November 2015, the circuit court denied Jones's motion for leave to amend his complaint to assert a breach of contract/wrongful termination claim. The court found that the motion should have been filed \"at a much earlier stage\" and that the amendment would unduly delay the litigation and prejudice Alcorn. In addition, in December 2015, the circuit court granted Hamilton's motion to dismiss all of Jones's claims against him. The court concluded that Jones's claim against Hamilton for tortious interference with contract was barred by the MTCA. Thus, Jones's only remaining claims were against Alcorn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 23. The case proceeded to a four-day jury trial in January 2016. The case was submitted to the jury on a theory that Alcorn breached its contract with Jones by breaching the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court instructed the jury that \"all contracts contain an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\" which \"need not be written into the contract.\" The court further instructed the jury that Jones alleged that Alcorn had\n   breached the covenant in three ways: \"(A) By firing his assistant coaches; (B) By intentionally making false charges of financial misconduct; and (C) By failing to provide uniforms and shoes for the players in a timely fashion.\" The court also instructed the jury that \"the trial [did] not have anything to do with\" Alcorn's termination of Jones, that Jones \"was still employed\" as Alcorn's coach when he filed the lawsuit, and that they could not award damages based on Jones's termination or the remaining years of salary under his contract. The jury was instructed that they could award damages for emotional distress or mental anguish if Jones proved that Alcorn breached his contract, that such damages were a foreseeable consequence of the breach, and that Jones actually suffered such damages. After deliberating, the jury returned a verdict for Jones and found that Jones suffered damages of $500,000, and the court entered final judgment on the verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 24. IHL filed a post-trial motion for JNOV or a new trial. The circuit court granted the motion, set aside the verdict, and entered judgment in favor of Alcorn. The court ruled that Jones's good faith and fair dealing claim failed \"as a matter of law\" because Jones failed to \"prove a breach of his written employment contract.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 25. Jones filed a timely notice of appeal. On appeal, he argues that the circuit court erred by granting Alcorn's motion for JNOV. As noted above, he also argues that the circuit court erred prior to trial by denying his motion for leave to amend his complaint and by dismissing his tortious interference claim against Hamilton. Following oral argument, we entered an order directing the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing several issues, primarily related to Jones's good faith and fair dealing claim and the MTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Jones has a viable claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, but the claim is subject to the MTCA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 26. We first determine whether Jones has a viable claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and, if so, whether and how the MTCA applies to that claim. All of the issues related to this claim are issues of law or statutory interpretation, which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Kelley LLC v. Corinth Pub. Utils.

In granting Alcorn's motion for JNOV, the circuit court ruled that Jones's \"good faith and fair dealing claims must be rejected as a matter of law\" because Jones \"did not prove a breach of his written employment contract.\" The circuit court cited this Court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Daniels v.

We held Daniels's claim failed for four reasons: (1) the contract between Daniels and Parker ended long before the\n   release was requested, so there was no existing contract between the parties; (2) the contract was not \"exclusive,\" so no release was needed; (3) the release was a requirement of the prospective employer that \"had no relation to any agreements between Parker and Daniels\"; and (4) Parker was justified in refusing to sign the release because Daniels owed Parker money.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021418\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/99/797/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021418\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/99/797/\">\n    at 801-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 14-18). In short, we held that Daniels's claim failed as a matter of law because the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing terminated with the contract and because Parker acted in good faith. We did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   hold that technical compliance with the express terms of a contract necessarily or always precludes a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 30. Neither the Mississippi Supreme Court nor this Court has ever held that a good faith and fair dealing claim requires a breach of an express term of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Cenac v. Murry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , which the Supreme Court aptly described as an \"unusual and interesting case\" about a contract to sell \"a little country store in McLaurin,\" is the leading Mississippi case on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    Cenac\n   </em>\n   , 609 So.2d at 1259. In\n   <em>\n    Cenac\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs, who bought the store, \"clearly proved\" that the defendants, who sold the store to them, \"breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in every contract in our law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Notably, the Supreme Court's extended discussion of the relevant facts and law did not identify any express term of the parties' contract that the defendants had breached. Rather, the Court held that the defendants breached their duty of good faith and fair dealing by engaging in a course of \"abusive, aberrant, intimidating, harassing behavior\" that made the plaintiffs' \"life a living hell\" and undermined their efforts to operate the store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1272. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Cenac\n   </em>\n   's reasoning and result clearly indicate that a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not require a breach of any express provision of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 31. In addition, in an unpublished decision, the Fifth Circuit has rejected the argument that \"Mississippi law holds that a party cannot breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing if it honors the [express] terms of the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Crosby Mem'l Hosp. v.

Moreover, courts in other states have held that a plaintiff need not prove a breach of an express provision of the contract. For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stated that \"[i]t is, of course, possible to breach the implied duty of good faith even while fulfilling all of the terms of the written contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Metavante Corp. v.

The California Supreme Court likewise held that \"breach of a specific provision of the contract is not a necessary prerequisite\" to a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    Carma Developers (Cal.) Inc. v. Marathon Dev. Cal.

And the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit specifically emphasized that \"a breach of the\n   <em>\n    implied\n   </em>\n   duty of good faith and fair dealing does not require a violation of an\n   <em>\n    express\n   </em>\n   provision in the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Metcalf Constr.

Logically, if the covenant of good faith and fair dealing required\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   technical compliance with the contract's express terms, then \"the implied covenant would be a mere redundancy.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   , 177 F.Supp.3d at 612. \"[T]he covenant would have no practical meaning, for any breach thereof would necessarily involve breach of some other term of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Carma Developers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20467\">\n    6 Cal.Rptr.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=826%20P.2d%20710\">\n    826 P.2d at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the Supreme Court reasoned in\n   <em>\n    Cenac\n   </em>\n   , the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing protects the parties' \"justified expectations\" that the contract will be performed in a manner consistent with its \"agreed purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Cenac\n   </em>\n   , 609 So.2d at 1272. Because it is rarely possible or practical for contracting parties to anticipate and address every conceivable issue that may arise in the future performance of the contract, the doctrine substitutes a general duty of good faith and fair dealing for details of the performance that the contract does not address expressly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metcalf Constr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074830,4070959\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/984/\">\n    742 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   991 ; Burton, 94 Harv. L. Rev. at 371, 393. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Cenac\n   </em>\n   , the parties' contract did not expressly prohibit \"abusive, aberrant, intimidating, harassing behavior\" that would make the plaintiffs' lives \"a living hell.\"\n   <em>\n    Cenac\n   </em>\n   , 609 So.2d at 1272. Nonetheless, such conduct violated the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, based on the plaintiffs' justified expectations that the defendants would not undermine their operation of the store.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 35. Similarly, Jones argues that he justifiably expected that Alcorn would, among other things, provide basic equipment for his team and would not fire seven of his assistant coaches without\n   warning. He argues, in essence, that proper equipment and assistant coaches were necessary to the agreed purpose of his contract, which was to coach a Division I college football team. Alcorn, in contrast, argues that it had\n   <em>\n    no duty\n   </em>\n   to provide\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   helmets, pads, or assistant coaches because the express provisions of Jones's contract do not address those issues. Alcorn contends that as long as it paid Jones his salary, Jones had no possible claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. We disagree. Alcorn's argument would render the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing redundant and superfluous. Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Cenac\n   </em>\n   's reasoning and result, we hold that it is possible to breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing even if there is no breach of an express provision of the parties' contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Alcorn also argues that employment contracts do not contain an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Alcorn relies on this Court's statement that \"this implied duty has been said not to apply to employment contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    Lippincott v. Miss. Bureau of Narcotics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9093280\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/856/465/#p467\">\n    856 So.2d 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467 (\u00b6 7) (Miss.

However, this statement was also dicta, and it was an overstatement. The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is limited or inapplicable in the context of\n   <em>\n    at-will\n   </em>\n   employment.

Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Lippincott\n   </em>\n   did not add anything to\n   <em>\n    Hartle\n   </em>\n   's holding.\n   <em>\n    Lippincott\n   </em>\n   involved a lawsuit by a confidential informant (CI) against the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics (MBN) for injuries that the CI suffered when he was shot during a drug buy.\n   <em>\n    Lippincott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9093280\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/856/465/#p467\">\n    856 So.2d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 1).

In summary, the Supreme Court has held only that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not limit an employer's right to terminate a purely at-will employee. However, the Supreme Court has never held that an employment contract for a specified term that is terminable only for cause does not contain an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Rather, the Supreme Court has stated repeatedly that such a covenant is implied and inherent in \"all contracts.\" Alcorn provides no persuasive reason why this doctrine would not apply to a contract like its contract with Jones. Accordingly, we hold that an employment contract for a specified term that is terminable only for cause contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

We reach a similar conclusion in this case.

Persuasive authority supports our conclusion. For example, the California Supreme Court held that it is not \"necessary that the party's conduct be dishonest.

Applying Washington law, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the fact that \"a party can breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing by acting dishonestly or unlawfully does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   mean that dishonesty or an unlawful purpose is a necessary predicate to proving bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Scribner v.

For reasons that are unclear, he also served a second notice on the IHL Board on April 7, 2009. Alcorn argues that Jones's failure to serve pre-suit notice as required by the MTCA requires dismissal of the lawsuit. Jones makes only one argument in response: that the issue is \"pure[ly] academic\" because his good faith and fair dealing claim is not subject to the MTCA. However, for the reasons discussed above, we have held that Jones's claim\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   subject to the MTCA.

Here, Jones filed his complaint well within the MTCA's one-year statute of limitations, albeit without pre-suit notice, and properly served the complaint.

Although we recognize that \"pre-suit notice\" may be a pointless exercise at this stage of the litigation, our holding that Jones's good faith and fair dealing claim is subject to the MTCA is not a technicality. For one thing, as discussed above, the MTCA makes clear that Jones cannot sue the State for slander or libel simply because he has re-labeled the claim as a good faith and fair dealing claim. The State retains full sovereign immunity against any claim for slander or libel, and such a claim was improperly submitted to the jury as part of Jones's good faith and fair dealing claim. Accordingly, the MTCA would require us to set aside the verdict for that reason alone. In addition, the trial judge must \"hear and determine\" any claim brought under the MTCA \"without a jury.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-13\">\n    Miss.

Jones's original complaint, filed on December 5, 2008, sought damages for various alleged breaches of contract, breaches of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and tortious interference with his contract. Jones's complaint also sought injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order to prevent Alcorn from terminating his contract for employment, which he apparently anticipated. Five days after he filed suit, Jones received a notice of possible termination. After an administrative hearing, Alcorn terminated Jones's employment, and the circuit court and this Court later upheld his termination on appeal. While Jones appealed his termination, there was little activity in this case, and Jones did not move to amend his complaint to allege specifically that his termination was a breach of his contract until August 10, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 59. Alcorn opposed Jones's motion for leave to amend, arguing, among other things, that Jones was guilty of \"undue delay\" and a \"lack of diligence.\" Alcorn also argued that the amendment \"would cause undue delay in the litigation\" and \"seriously prejudice\" Alcorn by injecting a \"brand new ... theory of liability\" into the case. Alcorn emphasized that Jones filed the motion only five months prior to trial, after the case had been pending for over six years. In addition, Alcorn claimed that Jones had \"admitted\" in his deposition \"that he was not suing [Alcorn] for wrongfully terminating his employment.\" The circuit court agreed with Alcorn that the amendment would \"cause undue delay in the litigation\" and \"undue prejudice\" to Alcorn. Therefore, the court denied Jones's motion for leave to amend.

For two primary reasons, we conclude that the circuit court abused its discretion by denying Jones's motion for leave to amend his complaint. First, the propriety of Jones's termination under his contract has been part of this case from the beginning. As noted above, Jones's original complaint alleged that Alcorn had already breached his contract in several respects and specifically sought a temporary restraining order to prohibit Alcorn from \"terminating [his] contract of employment.\" Moreover, Alcorn moved to dismiss Jones's complaint on the ground that Jones was \"appealing [Alcorn's] decision to terminate [his] employment and seeking reinstatement of his employment.\" Alcorn argued that Jones's appeal of his termination arose \"out of the same operative facts, events and/or circumstances as [this] lawsuit.\" Alcorn further argued that\n   <em>\n    this case\n   </em>\n   was \"premature\"-and the circuit court \"lack[ed] subject matter jurisdiction\"-until Jones had \"exhaust[ed] his administrative remedies\" by litigating his administrative appeal to \"a final resolution.\" Indeed, Alcorn claimed: \"Absent a final determination of [Jones's] appeal seeking reinstatement of his employment,\n   <em>\n    no justiciable controversy even exists upon which to bring [Jones's] lawsuit in this [c]ourt\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 62. Alcorn's positions in this case have been inconsistent. The issue in the prior administrative hearing and appeal was whether Alcorn properly terminated Jones for cause under his contract.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004022\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/120/448/\">\n    120 So.3d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And Alcorn initially argued that the two cases were so intertwined that this case was \"premature\"-and there not even a \"justiciable controversy\"-until there had been a final ruling on Jones's challenge to his termination. Yet, in subsequently opposing Jones's motion for leave to amend his complaint, Alcorn argued that a claim for breach of contract for wrongful termination would inject a \"brand new\" theory into the case. Alcorn's opposition to Jones's motion for leave to amend is inconsistent with its prior motion to dismiss. Based on the relief sought in Jones's original complaint, and Alcorn's response that the complaint as \"premature,\" we conclude that the original complaint put Alcorn on notice that Jones was alleging that his termination was a breach of his employment contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MS Comp Choice, SIF v. Clark, Scott &amp; Streetman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8402789\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/981/955/#p962\">\n    981 So.2d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 962 (\u00b6 23) (Miss. 2008) (\"Under\n   Rule 8 of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure, it is only necessary that the pleadings provide sufficient notice to the defendant of the claims and grounds upon which relief which is sought.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 63. The second reason that we conclude that leave to amend should have been granted is that Alcorn failed to show that it would be prejudiced by the amendment. Alcorn's alleged reasons for terminating Jones's employment were thoroughly explored during Jones's \"due process hearing.\" Eight witnesses testified at the hearing, including Jones, Hamilton, and Collins, and the hearing transcript runs 395 pages. Jones then appealed his termination to the circuit court and this Court. The same lawyers have represented Alcorn throughout both cases, and Jones moved to amend his complaint five months prior to trial in this case. Alcorn fails to explain why it could not have been prepared to defend Jones's termination in this case given that it had already done so at Jones's due process hearing and in the prior appeal. Our Supreme Court has held that \"[i]n practice an amendment should be denied only if the amendment would cause actual prejudice to the opposite party.\"\n   <em>\n    TXG Intrastate Pipeline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11710195\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/716/991/#p1011\">\n    716 So.2d at 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 64. Alcorn asserts that Jones's proposed amendment \"clearly\" would have been \"extremely prejudicial\" because it would have \"completely transformed\" the case. As discussed above, we cannot agree. Alcorn itself stated in its prior motion to dismiss that Jones's wrongful termination claim involved the same nucleus of facts and circumstances as his other claims, and Alcorn had already defended the termination in an administrative hearing and appeal. Generalized or conclusory assertions of prejudice are insufficient to establish that actual prejudice will result from the amendment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Middle Atl.

At the hearing in the circuit court, Jones argued that his failure to formally amend the complaint sooner to allege that his termination was a breach of his contract was, at worst, an \"oversight\" by counsel. As our Supreme Court has stated, \"since attorneys sometimes fail to write perfect pleadings, it is necessary that courts permit liberal amendments of the pleadings in order to reach the actual merits of a controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468243\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/631/798/#p800\">\n    631 So.2d at 800-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    William Iselin &amp; Co. v.

This is such a case. Alcorn was on notice that Jones was alleging wrongful termination and breach of contract, all issues related to that claim were thoroughly explored in the prior case, and Alcorn fails to articulate how the amendment would cause any specific prejudice or delay. Accordingly, we hold that the denial of\n   Jones's motion for leave to amend was an abuse of discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Our subsequent order requiring supplemental briefs asked the parties to address whether this Court's prior decision bars Jones's wrongful termination/breach of contract claim. In his supplemental brief, Jones again relied on\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   and argued that this Court's prior decision does not bar his claim. Alcorn argued that Jones's claim is barred because the doctrine of collateral estoppel generally applies to administrative proceedings and bars re-litigation of administrative decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

As Brewer points out in his brief, the circuit court has original jurisdiction over all breach of\n   contract cases.\n   <em>\n    Our notions of due process would be impugned by requiring Brewer to pursue a breach of contract claim against the Board in an administrative tribunal ultimately answerable to the Board itself and subject to the limited review of the circuit court allowed [on appeal by writ of certiorari under section 11-51-93 ].\n   </em>\n   As a result, we find that Brewer followed the proper procedure for initiating a breach of contract claim against [IHL] in this case by filing a complaint in the circuit court.

In our view, the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   is controlling. Although the\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   Court was addressing a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the Court clearly indicated that the decision of a university \"administrative tribunal,\" subject only \"to the limited review of the circuit court allowed\" on appeal by writ of certiorari, could not bar Brewer's breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621210\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/732/934/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621210\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/732/934/\">\n    at 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 7). Indeed, the Supreme Court considered the issue a matter of basic \"due process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621210\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/732/934/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 70. We conclude that there is no material distinction between\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   and this case. It is true that Jones appealed his termination to the circuit court and this Court, whereas Brewer did not appeal the adverse decision of the university's hearing board. However, in\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court specifically discussed the \"limited review\" available in circuit court and indicated that, as a matter of due process, such review was not an adequate substitute for Brewer's right to sue for breach of contract. Moreover, the preclusive effect of an administrative proceeding, if any, stems from the administrative decision itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476158\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/797/956/#p962\">\n    797 So.2d at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 22). Judicial review of the administrative decision does not add to its preclusive effect. Such review only assesses whether the administrative decision was \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004022\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/120/448/\">\n    120 So.3d at 453-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 12-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 71. We also find persuasive the Supreme Court's subsequent discussion of\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476158\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/797/956/#p962\">\n    797 So.2d at 960-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 15-19). In\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that an appeal by writ of certiorari was the exclusive remedy for a university employee who did not have a written employment contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476158\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/797/956/#p962\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476158\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/797/956/#p962\">\n    at 961, 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 18, 29). The Supreme Court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   by explaining,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court's rationale in\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   was based on the fact that Brewer had a written, separately negotiated contract with the University, the terms of which were in dispute. This Court places high importance on such contractual relationships. Smith, however, had no such written contract.... Smith was afforded statutory protections and procedures for the purpose of appealing employment decisions,\n   <em>\n    while an employee with a separate, written contract may pursue other avenues in search of relief\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476158\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/797/956/#p962\">\n    797 So.2d at 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 18) (emphasis added). The Court also reiterated that\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   \"was based in part on fairness concerns\" and \"due process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476158\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/797/956/#p962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 72. Likewise in this case, Jones \"had a written, separately negotiated contract with [Alcorn],\" and he alleges that Alcorn breached that contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476158\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/797/956/#p962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 18).

As we read the Supreme Court's opinion,\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   holds that a decision of an administrative tribunal within a university, subject to only \"limited\" judicial review, does not bar a subsequent action for breach of a written employment contract.\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621210\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/732/934/\">\n    732 So.2d at 936-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 6-7). That holding squarely applies to the facts of this case. Accordingly, we hold that this Court's prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004022\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/120/448/\">\n    120 So.3d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not bar Jones's claim for breach of contract based on his allegedly wrongful termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The MTCA does not bar Jones's tortious interference claim against Hamilton.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 74. In his final issue on appeal, Jones argues that the circuit court erred by dismissing his tortious interference claim against Hamilton in Hamilton's individual capacity. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Whiting v. University of Southern Mississippi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7040341\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/62/907/#p915\">\n    62 So.3d 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 915-16 (\u00b6\u00b6 15-16) (Miss. 2011), the circuit ruled that such claims were subject to dismissal pursuant to the MTCA. However, while this case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court overruled\n   <em>\n    Whiting\n   </em>\n   in relevant part and held that a claim for tortious interference with contract is not subject to the MTCA.\n   <em>\n    Springer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12378502,12378487\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/231/980/\">\n    231 So.3d at 988-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 32-35). Such a claim may be brought against a governmental employee in his individual capacity, and the MTCA does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12378502,12378487\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/231/980/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 75. Because the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Springer\n   </em>\n   handed down after Alcorn filed its principal brief on appeal, we permitted the parties to address this issue again in their supplemental briefs. In its supplemental brief, Alcorn asserts that the dismissal of the claim against Hamilton should be affirmed because Jones \"failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing suit.\" We do not follow this argument.\n   <em>\n    Springer\n   </em>\n   clearly holds that the MTCA does not apply to a claim for tortious interference with contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12378502,12378487\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/231/980/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Jones properly filed this claim against Hamilton\n   <em>\n    in Hamilton's individual capacity\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12378502,12378487\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/231/980/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The MTCA and its various requirements, defenses, and exemptions do not apply to a claim properly filed against an individual employee in his individual capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Miss.

Based on the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Springer\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court erred by dismissing Jones's tortious interference claim against Hamilton. That claim simply is not subject to the MTCA. Jones adequately alleged a claim for tortious interference with contract, and he presented evidence at trial that would have supported such a claim. Accordingly, on remand, Jones may pursue an individual-capacity claim against Hamilton for tortious interference with contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 77.
