He raises issues with the parenting plan, child support award, and equitable distribution scheme. We affirm the portions of the final judgment related to the equitable distribution and parenting plan, except that with regard to the parenting plan, we remand for the limited purpose of having the trial court include in the final judgment a provision that either parent alone may provide consent for a child to receive mental health treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 61.13(2)(b)(3)(a), Fla. Stat. (2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The ongoing and retroactive child support provisions in the final judgment prove more troublesome. Although we review a trial court's award of child support for an abuse of discretion,\n   <em>\n    Augoshe v.

K.A.N. v. A.N.J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872797\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/165/846/#p848\">\n    165 So.3d 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 848 (Fla. 2d DCA 2015) (\"[T]he child support determination must be supported by evidence in the record.\"). There are three problems with the final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, there are no findings that explain how the trial court arrived at the figures it included in the \"allowable deductions\" section of the child support guidelines worksheets incorporated in the final judgment. The worksheets included an amount for the former wife's deductions that is greater than what would be supported by her financial affidavits or, for that matter, any other evidence of those deductions that we can find. And on the flip-side, the amount\n   of the former husband's deductions was substantially lower than indicated by his affidavits. While these discrepancies might legitimately be related to the trial court's decisions to impute income to the former wife and allocate the federal income tax exemptions for the children, without findings that explain why the trial court did what it did, we are unable to determine whether it abused its discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8915506\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/912/702/#p705\">\n    912 So.2d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 705 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005) (reversing child support award where \"neither the final judgment nor the record ... discloses with any meaningful specificity the manner in which the trial court calculated the husband's child support obligation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Second, it appears that the trial court used the wrong number of overnights in the guidelines worksheets. In a point the former wife conceded in the trial court, the former husband is entitled to 128 overnight visits with the children. The worksheets, however, say that the former husband gets 126 overnights. This discrepancy seems to stem from confusion over whether the children were enrolled in public or private school (the parenting plan is based on the Pinellas County school calendar despite the children apparently being enrolled in private school). Because each party's support obligation is based on the percentage of overnights that a child has with the other parent, the use of an incorrect overnight figure can affect the ultimate support obligation. Thus, it is important to use the correct figure. In preparing new guidelines worksheets on remand, the trial court shall use the correct number of overnights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liguori v. Liguori\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12350997\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/210/117/#p119\">\n    210 So.3d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119 (Fla. 2d DCA 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Third, while we take no issue with the trial court's decision to base the retroactive support award on the earlier guidelines worksheet that was prepared in conjunction with the former wife's motion for temporary relief,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 61.30(17)(a), we cannot ascertain whether the amount of that award is supported by the evidence because that guidelines worksheet does not appear in the record and there are no other portions of the record from which we can review the trial court's calculation in this regard,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Voronin v. Voronina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8399694\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/975/1228/#p1229\">\n    975 So.2d 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1229 (Fla. 2d DCA 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8915506\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/912/702/#p705\">\n    912 So.2d at 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For these reasons, we reverse the portions of the amended final judgment\n   awarding ongoing and retroactive child support and remand for a new hearing on these issues. In recalculating the ongoing support obligation, the parties should prepare and file guidelines worksheets based on their current financial information,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fla. Fam. L. R. P. 12.285(k), and the trial court shall determine their respective financial situations and recalculate their support obligations in keeping with the record and related findings and the child support guidelines,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Long v. Long\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9012072,9012037\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/916/823/\">\n    916 So.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 824 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005). The former husband is entitled to credit for any previous overpayments. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sierra v. Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7425994\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/677/406/#p408\">\n    677 So.2d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408 (Fla. 3d DCA 1996). If the court again chooses to award retroactive support, the amount of any such award must be supported by evidence in the record, and the former husband shall be entitled to credit against that obligation to the extent that he can offer competent substantial evidence of actual payments qualifying under section 61.30(17)(b). Additionally, the court is free on remand to revisit any other part of the amended final judgment to the extent that doing so is necessary for it to make \"sufficient findings to permit meaningful review\" of the recalculated child support obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sumlar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11423915\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/827/1079/#p1083\">\n    827 So.2d at 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While such a finding may not be required by Florida law, it would prove helpful in this case. The right to claim an exemption for one or both of the children will have a direct effect on each party's actual federal income tax burden, which will in turn affect their allowable deductions for the purposes of the guidelines worksheets and, ultimately, their monthly responsibility. It is unclear who the trial court envisioned would have the right to claim the exemption for each child when it prepared the guidelines worksheets in the amended final judgment. In this case, the former husband is correct that under the default rule, the former wife has the right to claim the exemption for both children because she is the primary custodial parent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n     26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(4)(B)(i) (2012).
