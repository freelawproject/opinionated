Noting that plaintiff had visited the site on prior occasions and nothing prevented her from seeing the curb or appreciating its height, the district court held that the height of the sidewalk was an open and obvious condition and, as such, the defendants did not owe a duty to the plaintiff. Accordingly, I would grant this writ application and reinstate the district court's dismissal of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins.
