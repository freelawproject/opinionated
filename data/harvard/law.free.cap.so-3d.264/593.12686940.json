For the reasons that follow, we affirm defendant's convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 4, 2013, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant, Kevin Johnson, with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1 (count one)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and aggravated criminal damage to property in violation of La. R.S. 14:55 (count two). On June 17, 2013, defendant pled not guilty at his arraignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 16, 2014, defendant withdrew his not guilty pleas and pled guilty as charged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant was sentenced to thirteen\n   years, four months imprisonment at hard labor to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence and a $1,000 fine on count one and ten years imprisonment at hard labor on count two. The court further ordered defendant's sentences to run concurrently with each other and concurrently with the sentences imposed in case numbers, 13-4664, 13-5020, 14-507, and 14-1131. The trial court also recommended defendant for any self-help programs available to him through the Department of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 15, 2014, defendant, through his newly retained counsel, filed a motion to withdraw and set aside guilty plea, alleging that his former trial attorneys failed to interview and investigate potential witnesses or defenses available to him that would have proven his innocence to the charges. In support of his motion, defendant attached an affidavit from Selena Collins, an alleged eyewitness to the crimes, in which she recanted her statement identifying defendant as the perpetrator, claiming that she was \"in shock\" and \"pressured\" to name defendant. On September 10, 2014, the trial court denied defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea on September 10, 2014. On October 9, 2014, defendant filed a motion for reconsideration and request for a contradictory hearing. Defendant's motion was set for hearing and continued without date at the request of his counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 13, 2016, defendant filed an application for post-conviction relief (APCR), claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant filed a supplemental memorandum to his APCR on October 21, 2016, asserting the alleged ineffectiveness of his trial counsels' performance, which he claimed caused him prejudice by \"failing to investigate the facts, interview essential witnesses, available defenses that could have placed the State's theory through an adversarial-test which ultimately would have disproven the State's theory\" and by the lack of inspection of evidence. Defendant was subsequently granted this out-of-time appeal under\n   <em>\n    State v. Counterman\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because defendant pled guilty, the underlying facts were not fully developed at a trial. A factual basis was not provided at the guilty plea proceeding, therefore, the facts have been gleaned from the bill of information which provided that: on or about May 3, 2013, defendant violated La. R.S. 14:95.1, having possessed a firearm in Jefferson Parish after being previously convicted of the crime of aggravated second degree battery, in violation of La. R.S. 14:34.7, under case number 08-4682, Division \"M,\" of the Jefferson Parish 24th Judicial District Court and that on May 3, 2013, defendant violated La. R.S. 14:55, having committed aggravated criminal damage to a 2003 Chevy Tahoe belonging to Curtis Grimes and driven by Montero Ursin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, defendant asserted three assignments of error: (1) the trial court erred in denying the motion to withdraw guilty pleas; (2) the guilty pleas were not knowingly and voluntary entered into by defendant; and (3) the guilty pleas are legally infirm. In these three related assignments of error, defendant argues his trial counsels' performance was deficient in that they failed to properly investigate this matter. Defendant contends that if they properly investigated, he would have rejected the State's plea offer and proceeded to trial. Defendant claims that his guilty pleas should be invalidated because they were entered without full and correct information, and thus involuntary due to his trial counsels' alleged ineffectiveness. Defendant\n   argues that he has maintained his innocence and that his motion to withdraw guilty plea should have been granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    State v. Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   , 41,601 (La.

The trial court has the discretion to permit a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea at any time prior to sentencing. La. C.Cr.P. art. 559 A; See\n   <em>\n    State v. Kron\n   </em>\n   , 07-1024 (La.

However, this discretion cannot be exercised arbitrarily, and an abuse of discretion can be corrected on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   , 97-767 (La. App. 5 Cir. 1/14/98),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11852037\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/707/82/#p84\">\n    707 So.2d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84. Once a defendant is sentenced, only those pleas that are constitutionally infirm may be withdrawn by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v. Joseph\n   </em>\n   , 14-762 (La.

A guilty plea is constitutionally infirm if it is not entered freely and voluntarily; if the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   colloquy is inadequate; or when a defendant is induced to enter the plea by a plea bargain, or what he justifiably believes was a plea bargain, and that bargain is not kept.\n   <em>\n    State v. McCoil\n   </em>\n   , 05-658 (La.

Dissatisfaction with a sentence or a mere change of heart or mind by the defendant as to whether he made a good bargain will not ordinarily support allowing the withdrawal of a bargained guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    State v. Green\n   </em>\n   , 03-410 (La. App. 5 Cir. 10/28/03),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9299534\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/860/237/#p242\">\n    860 So.2d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 03-3228 (La. 3/26/04),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9278888,9278948,9278829\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/871/346/\">\n    871 So.2d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, where a defendant's misunderstanding of the plea bargain is not induced by or attributed to representations made by the district attorney or the trial court, there are no grounds for withdrawal of the plea. In the absence of fraud, intimidation, or incompetency of counsel, a guilty plea is not made less voluntary or informed by the considered advice of counsel.\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867596\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/169/661/#p664\">\n    169 So.3d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not error in denying defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. The record supports the trial court's determination that defendant voluntarily entered the guilty pleas with a full understanding of the consequences associated with those pleas. On the waiver of rights form and during the colloquy, defendant was advised of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   rights, stated that he understood his rights, and that he was waiving those rights. Defendant was also advised of the sentencing ranges for the offenses and the sentences that would be imposed should the court accept his guilty pleas. Defendant further indicated that he was satisfied with the way his trial attorneys had handled his case and had not been forced, threatened, or coerced into entering his pleas of guilty. The court accepted defendant's pleas of guilty as knowingly, intelligently, freely, and voluntarily entered into by defendant. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with the\n   plea agreement. Accordingly, the plea colloquy, along with the signed waiver of rights form, constitute a sufficient affirmative showing on the record that defendant was advised of his rights, understood those rights, and that he made an intelligent and knowing waiver of his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Moreover, defendant entered an unconditional guilty plea which, by its nature, admits factual guilt and waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings prior to the entering of the plea.\n   <em>\n    State v.
