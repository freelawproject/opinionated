Before the Court is Thomas Edwin Loden Jr.'s fourth\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   petition for post-conviction relief. Loden challenges the Mississippi Department of Corrections' use of midazolam in its lethal-injection protocol. He claims that midazolam is not an \"appropriate anesthetic or sedative\" that, \"if properly administered in a sufficient quantity, is likely to render the condemned inmate unconscious, so that the execution process should not entail a substantial risk of severe pain\" under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-51 (Supp. 2018). Loden requests this Court to enter an order forbidding the State from using any drug, including midazolam, as the first drug in its lethal-injection series that is not \"likely to render the condemned inmate unconscious,\" or, in the alternative, to grant him an evidentiary hearing to prove that midazolam is not \"an appropriate anesthetic or sedative\" under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. First, our review of Loden's filings and affidavits on the critical issue-that is, whether a 500-milligram dose of midazolam meets Mississippi's statutory definition of an \"appropriate anesthetic or sedative,\" reveals that Loden has offered no more than the\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   arguments of his expert, Craig W. Stevens, Ph.D. Loden has failed to carry his burden of proof in presenting a substantial showing of the denial of a state or federal right as required by Mississippi Code Section 99-39-27 (Rev. 2015), for the portions of his affidavits related to the efficacy of a 500-milligram dose of midazolam are a \"sham\" and are not supported by established medical literature.\n   <em>\n    Gable v.

Moreover, the State responds that, in\n   <em>\n    Glossip v. Gross\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court considered the same arguments presented in Loden's petition and rejected them, affirming the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit's and a United States District Court's finding that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam-the same dosage that MDOC requires in its lethal-injection protocol-is capable of placing a person at a sufficient level of unconsciousness so that the recipient is unable to feel pain.\n   <em>\n    Glossip v.

Stevens, Ph.D., who meanders through a series of contradictory, speculative assertions about midazolam, from criticizing the State's definition of \"appropriate anesthetic or sedative\" (while simultaneously conceding that midazolam satisfies that definition), to criticizing the ability of a 500-milligram dose of midazolam to induce unconsciousness without citing a single scientific publication or study involving such a dose to support his argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Loden has not carried his burden of proof that he is entitled to post-conviction relief, irrespective of the contradictory affidavit presented by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 13. Stevens\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   opines that midazolam does not satisfy the State's definition of an \"appropriate anesthetic or sedative\" under Section 99-19-51. Stevens criticizes midazolam as the first drug in MDOC's lethal-injection protocol on two theories. First, Stevens asserts that midazolam does not comply with the statute's definition of \"appropriate anesthetic or sedative,\" arguing that midazolam does not produce \"general anesthesia.\" Second, Stevens opines that the \"ceiling effect\" of midazolam prevents the drug from changing from a sedative into a general anesthetic. Additionally, Stevens challenges MDOC's preparation and administration of the IV, the actual dose of midazolam to be administered, the lack of a saline flush, and the method of checking consciousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 14. Stevens does not dispute that midazolam is a sedative as prescribed in the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Stevens admits that midazolam is part of the sedative-hypnotic class of drugs, and that sedative-hypnotic drugs have largely replaced barbiturates,\n   which he admits \"reliably produce anesthesia,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   in clinical therapeutics. Despite these concessions, Stevens surmises that the legislative intent of the word \"or\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the phrase \"anesthetic or sedative\" requires an equivalency between anesthetic drugs and sedative drugs; he concludes that the two are not equivalent. Stevens offers that midazolam is not an anesthetic drug because it cannot produce the state of general anesthesia. Stevens continues, opining that midazolam is a sedative, which \"by its very nature and definition, cannot meet the criteria of an appropriate drug that is likely to render the inmate unconscious\" and \"impervious to pain.\" Stevens offers that the second and third drugs, if not given with a state of general anesthesia produced by the first drug, would be severely painful and cause suffering. Stevens, despite not sharing the education, practical experience, or training of an anesthesiologist, then offers that \"even under the best circumstances, ... anesthesiologists inducing general anesthesia appear to get it wrong a significant percentage of the time and their patients are not unconscious (or anesthesized) as often as they think.\" In a final\n   <em>\n    coup de gr\u00e2ce\n   </em>\n   , Stevens offers that the lethal-injection statute should be modified, stating that, \"[t]o be correct and to be in alignment with common pharmacological knowledge,\" Mississippi Code Section 99-19-51(1)\"should be modified to read '(a) an appropriate general anesthetic drug' \" as opposed to an \"appropriate anesthetic or sedative.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 15. Stevens also opines that midazolam has a \"ceiling effect,\" in which a greater dose will not produce a greater pharmacological effect; yet, he freely concedes that no scientific studies or tests of midazolam's ceiling effect on humans exist. Instead, Stevens opines about midazolam's ceiling effect by extrapolating from studies conducted on cells in laboratory dishes (\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   ) and studies examining the blood concentration of midazolam in humans who were administered clinical doses of midazolam at five to fifteen milligrams and then offers his\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   opinion about what the concentration of midazolam would be in the human brain after a 500-milligram dose. Stevens concludes that a 200-milligram dose of midazolam is sufficient to reach its ceiling effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 16. Stevens's contradictory opinions overwhelmingly belie his assertion that midazolam is not an \"appropriate anesthetic or sedative.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gable\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11501353\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/748/703/#p706\">\n    748 So.2d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing when petitioner's affidavit is belied by written statements of the affiant to the contrary). Stevens opines that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam cannot render an inmate unconscious, yet in the very same report, Stevens concedes that much smaller doses of midazolam are routinely used for sedation and anesthesia. Stevens himself provided five different uses of midazolam as an anesthetic or sedative: (1) preoperative sedation, (2) outpatient sedation, (3) anesthesia induction, (4) sedation for intubated patients, and (5) co-anesthesia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17. Stevens also admits that \"the highest-clinically used\" dosage of midazolam\n   does \"not approach the ceiling effect dosage,\" admitting that \"the usual clinical midazolam IV doses produce brain concentrations that are far below ceiling or plateau effect.\" In other words, Stevens admits that the highest clinically used dosage of midazolam, which is routinely used for sedation and anesthesia, does not reach the drug's ceiling effect. Furthermore, Stevens admits that no scientific tests, studies, or literature concerning midazolam's ceiling effect on humans following a 500-milligram dosage exist. Additionally, Stevens does not provide any evidence that his own calculation of midazolam's purported ceiling effect was the product of reliable principles and methods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 18. As to midazolam's effectiveness in inducing unconsciousness, Stevens's affidavits and supplemental reports focus entirely on midazolam's inability to produce \"general anesthesia,\" which is not required under either Mississippi Code Section 99-19-51 or\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, the statute only requires an appropriate anesthetic or sedative, and Stevens concedes that midazolam is routinely used as both an anesthetic and a sedative. Even if Mississippi's lethal-injection protocol required only anesthetics, Stevens admits that midazolam, among other drugs, has largely replaced barbiturates, which \"reliably produce anesthesia\" in clinical therapeutics. Stevens defines anesthesia as \"the loss of all feeling and is generally meant to be in a state of unconsciousness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 19. Furthermore, Stevens concedes that midazolam is used for regional anesthesia and actually cites clinical studies in which midazolam was infused until patients became unresponsive to mild prodding or shaking. Stevens further admits that midazolam has been documented to produce a \"BIS value\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   of 65 in surgery patients, which represents \"deep sedation.\" And just like the weakness contained in Stevens's \"ceiling effect\" argument, Stevens opined that unconsciousness cannot be measured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 20. As previously stated, \"where an affidavit is overwhelmingly belied by unimpeachable documentary evidence in the record such as, for example, a transcript or written statements of the affiant to the contrary to the extent that the court can conclude that the affidavit is a sham[,] no hearing is required.\"\n   <em>\n    Gable\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11501353\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/748/703/#p706\">\n    748 So.2d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The district court held an evidentiary hearing and denied the four prisoners' application for preliminary injunction, finding that they had failed to prove that midazolam is ineffective. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. After granting certiorari, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgments of the trial and appellate courts and addressed the lack of contrary scientific evidence to support the petitioners' claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Petitioners attack the District Court's findings of fact on two main grounds. First, they argue that even if midazolam is powerful enough to induce unconsciousness, it is too weak to maintain unconsciousness and insensitivity to pain once the second and third drugs are administered. Second, while conceding that the 500-milligram dose of midazolam is much higher than the normal therapeutic dose, they contend that this fact is irrelevant because midazolam has a \"ceiling effect\"-that is, at a certain point, an increase in the dose administered will not have any greater effect on the inmate. Neither argument succeeds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The District Court found that midazolam is capable of placing a person \"at a sufficient level of unconsciousness to resist the noxious stimuli which could occur from the application of the second and third drugs.\" ... This conclusion was not clearly erroneous. Respondents' expert, Dr. Evans, testified that the proper administration of a 500-milligram dose of midazolam would make it a \"virtual certainty\" that any individual would be \"at a sufficient level of unconsciousness to resist the noxious stimuli which could occur from application of the 2nd and 3rd drugs\" used in the Oklahoma protocol.... And petitioners' experts acknowledged that they had no contrary scientific proof.... (Dr. Sasich stating that the ability of midazolam to render a person insensate to the second and third drugs \"has not been subjected to scientific testing\"); ... (Dr. Lubarsky stating that \"there is no scientific literature addressing the use of midazolam as a manner to administer lethal injections in humans\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Testimony from both sides supports the District Court's conclusion that midazolam can render a person insensate to pain. Dr. Evans testified that although midazolam is not an analgesic, it can nonetheless \"render the person unconscious and 'insensate' during the remainder of the procedure.\" ... In his discussion about the ceiling effect, Dr. Sasich agreed that as the dose of midazolam increases, it is \"expected to produce sedation, amnesia, and finally lack of response to stimuli such as pain (unconsciousness).\" ... Petitioners argue that midazolam is not powerful enough to keep a person insensate to pain after the administration of the second and third drugs, but Dr. Evans presented creditable testimony to the contrary.... (testifying that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam will induce a coma). Indeed, low doses of midazolam are sufficient to induce unconsciousness and are even sometimes used as the sole relevant drug in certain medical procedures. Dr. Sasich conceded, for example, that midazolam might be used for medical procedures like colonoscopies and gastroscopies....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Petitioners emphasize that midazolam is not recommended or approved for use as the sole anesthetic during painful surgery, but there are two reasons why this is not dispositive. First, as the District Court found, the 500-milligram dose at issue here \"is many times higher than a normal therapeutic does of midazolam.\" ... The effect of a small dose of midazolam has minimal probative value about the effect of a 500-milligram dose. Second, the fact that a low dose of midazolam is not the best drug for maintaining unconsciousness during surgery says little about whether a 500-milligram dose of midazolam is constitutionally adequate for purposes of conducting an execution. We recognized this point in\n   <em>\n    Baze\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

Petitioners argue that midazolam has a \"ceiling\" above which any increase in dosage produces no effect. As a result, they maintain, it is wrong to assume that a 500-milligram\n   dose has a much greater effect than a therapeutic dose of about 5 milligrams. But the mere fact that midazolam has such a ceiling cannot be dispositive. Dr. Sasich testified that \"all drugs essentially have a ceiling effect.\" ... The relevant question here is whether midazolam's ceiling effect occurs below the level of a 500-milligram dose and at a point at which the drug does not have the effect of rendering a person insensate to pain caused by the second and third drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Petitioners provided little probative evidence on this point, and the speculative evidence that they did present to the District Court does not come close to establishing that its factual findings were clearly erroneous. Dr. Sasich stated in his expert report that the literature \"indicates\" that midazolam has a ceiling effect, but he conceded that he \"was unable to determine the midazolam dose for a ceiling effect on unconsciousness because there is no literature in which such testing has been done.\" ... Dr. Lubarsky's report was similar, ... and the testimony of petitioners' experts at the hearing was no more compelling. Dr. Sasich frankly admitted that he did a \"search to try and determine at what dose of midazolam you would get a ceiling effect,\" but concluded: \"I could not find one.\" ... The closest petitioners came was Dr. Lubarsky's suggestion that the ceiling effect occurs \"[p]robably after about ... 40 to 50 milligrams,\" but he added that he had not actually done the relevant calculations, and he admitted: \"I can't tell you right now\" at what dose the ceiling effect occurs....We cannot conclude that the District Court committed clear error in declining to find, based on such speculative evidence, that the ceiling effect negates midazolam's ability to render an inmate insensate to pain caused by the second and third drugs in the protocol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2740-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and emphasis omitted). The United States Supreme Court also noted that numerous courts have examined similar challenges to midazolam but have ultimately concluded \"that the use of midazolam as the first drug in a three-drug protocol is likely to render an inmate insensate to pain that might result from administration of the paralytic agent and potassium chloride.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 24. Based on the above holdings in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , Loden's petition fails. Like the petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , Loden's filings lack contrary scientific evidence to support his challenge to midazolam. Furthermore, Loden's expert, Stevens, has failed to present any new argument that was not already considered and rejected by the United States Supreme Court. Indeed, like the petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , Stevens attacks MDOC's use of midazolam on two main grounds: (1) that midazolam is incapable of rendering an inmate unconscious, and (2) that midazolam's \"ceiling effect\" renders the drug's effect no greater than normal therapeutic doses. Stevens provides nearly identical expert opinions and conclusions to those offered in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   . The United States Supreme Court expressly rejected those arguments, opinions, and conclusions as speculative, because the petitioners had not offered contrary scientific proof to support\n   their challenge to midazolam.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting expert's testimony that, to a virtual certainty, any individual would be at a sufficient level of unconsciousness to resist the noxious stimuli which could occur from application of the second and third drugs after administering a 500-milligram dose of midazolam ). Here, too, Stevens's opinions concerning the ceiling effect of midazolam and its ability to induce unconsciousness lack scientific proof supporting Loden's challenge to midazolam and contain the same speculative assertions that the Supreme Court rejected in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   . Stevens conceded that no scientific studies or tests of midazolam's ceiling effect on humans exist and freely conceded that \"unconsciousness\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   cannot be measured.\" Loden offered no other scientific proof to support his hypothesis that midazolam is not an \"appropriate anesthetic or sedative\" under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-51(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 25. Loden attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , arguing that the Supreme Court merely held that the district court \"did not abuse its discretion in denying a preliminary injunction.\" Loden argues that, if MDOC's argument is correct-that is, if the Supreme Court held that midazolam is clearly sufficient to induce unconsciousness and render an inmate insensate to pain, then \"the case would be over.\" Loden asserts that, because\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   is still proceeding in Oklahoma, the Supreme Court's holding is not dispositive. This argument is without merit. The Supreme Court's analysis began with holding that \"this case turns on whether petitioners are able to establish a likelihood of success on the merits\" of their challenge to midazolam.\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The Supreme Court then examined the petitioners' substantive arguments against the use of midazolam-the same arguments made by Stevens for Loden-and specifically rejected them, affirming the district court's and the Tenth Circuit's holding that midazolam is capable of placing a person \"at a sufficient level of unconsciousness to resist the noxious stimuli which could occur from the application of the second and third drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n    at 2740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Loden has not offered any contrary scientific proof to support his challenge to midazolam, we hold likewise. Pursuant to the United States Supreme Court's holdings in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , a 500-milligram dose of midazolam satisfies Mississippi's statutory standard for lethal injection under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-51(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 26. Although Loden frames his petition for PCR as a state-law challenge instead of an Eighth Amendment challenge as in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , the underlying claims to support his statutory challenge are the very same claims that were made in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   . Loden cannot circumvent the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   -that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam is capable of placing a person \"at a sufficient level of unconsciousness\" to \"render a person insensate to pain[,]\" for the Supreme Court's holdings mirror Mississippi's statutory requirement for lethal injection.\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2739-41 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-19-51\">\n    Miss.

Antognini, M.D., M.B.A., a board-certified medical doctor in the medical specialty of anesthesiology licensed to practice medicine in the State of California. Dr. Antognini received his medical degree from the University of Southern California and currently serves as a clinical professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine at the University of California, Davis-School of Medicine, and as the director of peri-operative services at the University of California, Davis Health System. Dr. Antognini has provided expert testimony in one case over the last four years.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Dr. Antognini relates that, in practice, the typical therapeutic dose of midazolam is two to three milligrams, and that a dose above five milligrams must be used with extreme caution because of the well-known risks of unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and apnea. He further relates that midazolam has been used for the induction of anesthesia and cites two scientific studies in support. He specifically points out that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam, which is about 100 to 200 times the normal therapeutic dosage, would render a person \"completely unconscious and insensate to pain and noxious stimuli.\" Dr. Antognini cites the \"Black Box Warning\" of midazolam, which signifies that midazolam can cause respiratory depression, unconsciousness, and death. Further, Dr. Antognini states that \"there is only an exceedingly small risk that a person administered a 500[-milligram] dose of midazolam would experience any pain\" from the administration of vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. Dr. Antognini also relates that 500 milligrams of midazolam would produce a state of anesthesia that is considered adequate \"for many thousands of surgical procedures performed on a daily basis.\" Further, Dr. Antognini states that Stevens's hypothesis on the \"ceiling effect\" of midazolam is erroneous. Applying the Supreme Court's holding in\n    <em>\n     Glossip\n    </em>\n    coupled with his training, knowledge, and experience in performing real-life anesthesia, Dr. Antognini states that the ceiling effect is only germane as to the dosage at which the ceiling effect kicks in. Dr. Antognini states that \"the primary medical and scientific issue raised in this case is whether the ceiling effect, if it exists for midazolam, occurs before a person becomes unconscious and insensate to pain and noxious stimuli.\" Dr. Antognini ultimately concludes that \"a purported ceiling effect does not affect midazolam's ability to induce unconsciousness and render a person insensate to pain and noxious stimuli.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     In re Ohio Execution Protocol\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276333\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/881/#p887\">\n     860 F.3d 881\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (6th Cir. 2017) ;\n    <em>\n     Gray v.

Here, the majority argues that\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   is instructive to the state-law claim at issue. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , however, was not presented with a state-law based claim; instead, it considered whether midazolam violates the Eighth Amendment. The petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   were on death row in Oklahoma.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n    at 2735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast to Section 99-19-51's requirement that the State of Mississippi use \"an appropriate anesthetic or sedative[,]\" Oklahoma's statute does not contain a specific directive. Oklahoma's statute provides, \"The punishment of death shall be carried out by the administration of a lethal quantity of a drug or drugs until death is pronounced by a licensed physician according to accepted standards of medical practice.\" Okla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1014. Additionally,\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   was not dispositive regarding midazolam; the district court found that the plaintiffs were not entitled to a preliminary injunction because their claims did not have a substantial likelihood of success; the Supreme Court affirmed this decision, but did not rule that the plaintiffs also should lose the substantive case.\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2736, 2746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, importantly, the Supreme Court was reviewing a more developed record including testimony and documents, not simply affidavits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n    at 2735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It did not itself weight the expert opinions, as the majority inappropriately does; rather, it found that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in its conclusion regarding midazolam after the trial court held a three-day evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n    at 2739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   is not dispositive regarding whether an evidentiary hearing is warranted on a state-law claim. Indeed, a thorough evidentiary hearing did occur in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , providing the Supreme Court with an adequate record and allowing the district court to decide evidentiary matters and matters of credibility. The majority goes so far as to chastise Dr. Stevens for failing to cite enough \"proof\" for his conclusion that he was unable to determine the ceiling effect for midazolam, even criticizing him for failing to \"provide any evidence\" regarding a ceiling effect. Maj. Op. \u00b6 17. However, the majority denies the very evidentiary hearing in which Loden and Dr. Stevens would have the opportunity to present proof and evidence under the Mississippi Rules of Evidence. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court specifically held that the lack of research on non-therapeutic doses of midazolam applies equally to both parties' cases, noting that \"because a 500-milligram dose is never administered for a therapeutic purpose, extrapolation was reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2739\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 34. In addition to sharply criticizing Dr. Stevens for extrapolations that the Supreme Court found acceptable, the majority attempts to paint Dr. Stevens's affidavits as a sham and \"contradictory\" because \"Stevens opines that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam cannot render an inmate unconscious, yet in the very same\n   report, Stevens concedes that much smaller doses of midazolam are routinely used for sedation and anesthesia.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 16. To hold that these two statements are \"contradictory\" misrepresents or misunderstands medical terminology, a misunderstanding that might be corrected at an evidentiary hearing. \"Unconscious\" is defined as \"not conscious\" and \"unconsciousness\" is defined as \"an imprecise term for severely impaired awareness of self and the surrounding environment; most often used as a synonym for coma or unresponsiveness.\"\n   <em>\n    Unconscious\n   </em>\n   , PDR Medical Dictionary (3d ed. 2006);\n   <em>\n    Unconsciousness\n   </em>\n   , PDR Medical Dictionary (3d ed. 2006). \"Sedation\" is defined as \"the act of calming, especially by the administration of a sedative\" and \"sedative\" is defined as \"calming; quieting\" and \"a drug that quiets nervous excitement.\"\n   <em>\n    Sedation\n   </em>\n   , PDR Medical Dictionary (3d ed. 2006);\n   <em>\n    Sedative\n   </em>\n   , PDR Medical Dictionary (3d ed. 2006). \"Anesthesia\" is defined as a \"loss of sensation resulting from pharmacological depression of nerve function.\"\n   <em>\n    Anesthesia\n   </em>\n   , PDR Medical Dictionary (3d ed. 2006). Clearly, a person can lose some of his sensation (anesthesia ) without becoming unconscious. A person can also become calm (sedative) without becoming unconscious. Dr. Stevens's admission that midazolam is used for sedation and anesthesia in no way contradicts his assertion that it cannot render an inmate unconscious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 35. In fact, Dr. Stevens was the expert witness for prisoners in the Ohio litigation regarding midazolam, and the trial court found that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [a]lthough there was no time to conduct a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   hearing, Plaintiffs presented an adequate foundation in this hearing which, when coupled with what was presented in January, established a sufficient basis to find Dr. Stevens was qualified to offer opinions on the subjects on which he was presented so as to comply with Fed.

Furthermore, the majority parses two phrases out of approximately thirty-five pages of scientific reports and gaslights its readers into thinking that these two phrases, taken out of context, magically render the affidavit so contradictory as to be a sham. The majority's conclusion, which is essentially that any scientist who disagrees with the majority's unscientific opinion on midazolam is a sham, is simply not supported by the expert reports, nor is\n   it supported by caselaw that by and large allows and examines contradictory expert opinions on midazolam. The information upon which Dr. Stevens bases his conclusions does not appear to be a sham, and reasonable minds in the scientific community often disagree regarding issues that cannot be proven to certainty, which is exactly what occurred here. To declare the affidavit a sham and speculatively inadmissible under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and the Rules of Evidence without a hearing and without a full record of scientific testimony goes far beyond the appropriate role of an appellate court.

But this is not the case at all, for we do not engage in trial by affidavits here any more than any other proceeding. The State would be better advised to direct its responses to the idea that an evidentiary hearing is not required, that is, to the proposition that either the petitioner's showing is not in proper form or that the facts he alleges are supported by affidavits suggesting no reasonable possibility that at an evidentiary hearing [the petitioner] may be able to establish a claim for relief from his sentence or conviction. The counter affidavit process is at the very earliest one in which the State should engage in connection with a motion for summary judgment.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-19\">\n     Miss.

The majority appears to find that whenever two experts disagree, the expert who \"loses\" automatically becomes a scientific sham. Such a ruling is dangerously contrary to science and the law. Further, the majority's misrepresentations of caselaw and the affidavit actually bolster the notion that an evidentiary hearing is needed, because the majority factfinds and makes misrepresentations and leaps from facts to determine that the affidavit is a sham.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    In fact, in\n    <em>\n     Glossip\n    </em>\n    , the petitioners challenged the state's expert, who was a doctor of pharmacy, claiming that inconsistencies in his testimony existed.
