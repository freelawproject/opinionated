We nonetheless withdraw our previously issued opinion and substitute the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellants Mark and Barbara Sacks appeal a final summary judgment of foreclosure in favor of Appellee, The Bank of New York Mellon (\"the Bank\"). Appellants raise several issues on appeal. We affirm without comment with respect to all issues with one exception. The trial court erred in admitting the payment history submitted by the Bank to establish the amount owed under the note. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for an evidentiary hearing on that issue. We otherwise affirm on the remaining issues raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellants defaulted on their mortgage, and the Bank filed a foreclosure complaint and subsequently moved for summary judgment. In support of its motion, the Bank filed a tabulation of Appellants' payment history under the terms of the note and mortgage and an accompanying affidavit seeking to establish the business records predicate for admission. The affiant was a document coordinator of the Bank's servicer, Bayview Loan Servicing (\"BLS\"). The payment history attached to the affidavit was generated by BLS and it incorporated tabulations by Bank of America (\"BoA\"), a prior servicer of the loan. The entirety of the affidavit's discussion of BLS's business records was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The information in this affidavit is taken from BLS's business records. I have personal knowledge of BLS's procedures for creating these records. They are: (a) made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters recorded by persons with personal knowledge of the information in the business record, or\n   from information transmitted by persons with personal knowledge; (b) kept in the course of BLS's regularly conducted business activities; and (c) it is the regular practice of BLS to make such records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the summary judgment hearing, with respect to the BLS affidavit, Appellants argued the absence of any mention of \"[BoA's] records, how BLS got a hold of them, and how they ... brought those records in with a sufficient boarding process.\" The trial court nonetheless granted the Bank's motion for summary judgment and entered a final judgment of foreclosure against Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The standard of review for evidentiary rulings is abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Holt v.
