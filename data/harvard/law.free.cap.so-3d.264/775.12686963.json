Claire Clements Flowers (Claire) and Brenda Jane Flowers Paixao (Jane) appealed the judgment of the Leflore County Chancery Court denying their request for an accounting of the estate and testamentary trust of their mother, Brenda Bargas Flowers. The chancery court concluded that the daughters did not have a current interest in their mother's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62. On appeal, the daughters argued that they were specifically named in the will to be remainder beneficiaries and thus have standing to request an accounting. The Court of Appeals found that Claire and Jane have standing to request an accounting, finding that they have limited rights as holders of a shifting executory\n   interest to prevent future waste.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re Flowers v.

We granted certiorari not to determine whether the sisters have standing, because we agree that they do, but to determine whether the chancellor abused his discretion in denying the sisters' accounting request.

We hold today that the chancellor, in his discretion, correctly held that under Brenda's will, Claire and Jane have so remote an interest with such a mere expectancy of a future inheritance that they are not entitled to an accounting until that interest vests. The Court of Appeals relied on\n   <em>\n    Hemphill v. Mississippi State Highway Commission\n   </em>\n   , but we find that it does not apply here because that case was restricted to a consideration of constitutional rights. We granted certiorari to determine whether the chancellor abused his discretion in denying Claire and Jane's accounting request. We find the denial of that request was not an abuse of discretion, and we affirm that portion of the chancellor's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616. Chancellors have long been vested with discretionary authority to decide matters of equity. Article 6, section 159, of the Mississippi Constitution confers on chancery courts jurisdiction of \"All matters in equity ...,\" as well as other enumerated matters. \"A court of equity is a court of conscience. The function of the chancellor is, upon equitable considerations, to winnow the wheat from the straw, and his decree will not be set aside on appeal unless, as is not the case here, it is made to appear that it is not equitable but inequitable to let it stand.\"\n   <em>\n    Durkin v. Lovknit Mfg. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"561593\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/208/665/#p667\">\n    208 F.2d 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 667 (5th Cir. 1953).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617. The chancellor, in reviewing the will, found that the will's terms reflected that in creating the testamentary trust, Brenda had named D.A. the income beneficiary, with the principal to be placed in trust until D.A.'s thirtieth birthday or his death, whichever occurred earlier. Upon either D.A.'s thirtieth birthday or his death, Brenda's will directed that the trust's principal be evenly divided between D.A. and Knox \"per stirpes to include adopted children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618. The terms of the will also discussed disbursement of trust assets to beneficiaries who were under the age of twenty-one at the time of the trust's termination or who died before the trust's termination. Finally, establishing that D.A. and Knox were to inherit subject to a condition subsequent of survivorship, the will stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   If there are no surviving beneficiaries, descendants of deceased former beneficiaries, former beneficiaries who are living, or descendants of deceased former beneficiaries, then his or her interest shall be distributed share and share alike to the [c]onservatorships for my two daughters[, Claire and Jane;] should either one or both of them not have a [c]onservatorship at the termination of this trust[,] then distribute their portion outright to them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619. Thus, Brenda's will established that if D.A. and Knox died\n   <em>\n    without any descendants\n   </em>\n   , then the remainder would be distributed to Claire and Jane; at that point, their interest would vest. If Knox and D.A. died today without any descendants, then Claire and Jane would be entitled to receive an accounting because their interest would vest. But affording Claire and Jane an accounting now, when the interest has not yet vested, would result in an inequitable, unjust burden on the court and furthermore on the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620. This matter has been ongoing for the last ten years. The beginning traces back to D.A.'s birth in 2004 and his subsequent adoption in 2005 by his maternal grandparents, Richard and Brenda Flowers. After both of their deaths, custody disputes over D.A. ensued. After custody\n   was resolved, estate disputes began. All along, both parties conceded that the will creating the trust was primarily for the benefit of D.A., and Claire and Jane fully recognized that their interest is a future interest. But they continued to disrupt, prolong, and dwindle the estate and its assets. After numerous petitions and a 616-page pleading alleging a plethora of wrongdoing by everyone involved in the case, the estate was finally nearing its closing when Claire and Jane requested yet another accounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621. Claire and Jane argue that an accounting is necessary because proof of mismanagement exists; Knox did not file annual accountings under Mississippi Code Section 91-7-277 (Rev. 2018). This Court has held, \"Generally, executors and administrators are required to submit an annual accounting to the court.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Baumgardner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021339\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/82/592/#p604\">\n    82 So.3d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 604-05 (Miss. 2012) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2091-7-277\">\n    Miss.

The Court of Appeals held that Claire and Jane have standing to request an accounting of their mother's estate and testamentary trust. I agree with the Court of Appeals and, accordingly, would affirm. The majority agrees that Claire and Jane do, in fact, have standing. Maj. Op. at \u00b6 3. However, I must, with respect, dissent, because the majority considers the merits of the sisters' request for an accounting and thereby affirms the chancery court and reverses the Court of Appeals on an issue not reached by it. While the chancellor's final judgment does rely in part on a 2008 order denying Claire's initial request for an accounting in denying the newer request by both Claire and Jane years later, Jane was not a party in 2008. Moreover, the chancellor's May 6, 2016, final Decree discussed at length the effect of the nature of the sisters' interest in the trust on their ability to bring the request for accounting. The chancellor wrote, \"Claire Clements Flowers and Brenda Jane Flowers have no standing to file any pleadings or other matter in this cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b632. A majority of the Court of Appeals held that Claire and Jane \"have\n   <em>\n    standing to request an accounting\n   </em>\n   of their mother's estate and testamentary trust pursuant to their limited rights.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Flowers v.

Judge Tindell disagreed, writing that he would \"affirm the chancellor's judgment that the [daughters]\n   <em>\n    lack standing to request an accounting\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20718626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20718626\">\n    2018 WL 718626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (\u00b6 34) (Tindell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis added). Although the Court of Appeals was divided, it agreed that the issue before it the chancellor's determination as to standing. Accordingly, the majority miscasts the case when it writes that \"[w]e granted certiorari to determine whether the chancellor abused his discretion in denying the Claire and Jane's accounting request.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 15. The majority holds that the \"chancellor was well within his discretionary authority to deny the Claire and Jane's accounting request.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 29. However, the record is clear that the chancellor based his denial\n   on the perceived lack of standing rather than on the merits of the request for an accounting; he dismissed the request for lack of jurisdiction. \"Standing is an aspect of subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Hobson v.

As noted above, the majority agrees that the trial court erred in finding the sisters lacked standing. The majority writes, \"We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to determine not whether the sisters possess standing,\n   <em>\n    because we agree that they do\n   </em>\n   , but to determine whether the chancellor abused his discretion in denying the sisters accounting request.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 3 (emphasis added). Despite the majority's apparent reversal of the chancellor on the issue of standing, the majority affirms the chancellor by deciding an issue no lower court has fully addressed-the merits of the Claire and Jane's request for an accounting. For reasons more fully set forth below, I agree with the majority that the chancellor erred in finding the sisters lacked standing. However, because the chancellor's dismissal of the request for an accounting prevented the consideration of the merits of the request in the trial court-especially as to Jane-and quite possibly prevented the full development of a record to inform our consideration of the merits, I would remand the case rather than reach the merits for the first time on appeal. \"One of the most fundamental and long established rules of law in Mississippi is that the Mississippi Supreme Court will not review matters on appeal that were not raised at the trial court level.\"\n   <em>\n    Miss.

To have standing to sue, a party must assert a colorable interest in the subject matter of the litigation or experience an adverse effect from the conduct of the defendant, or as otherwise authorized by law. An interest is deemed colorable if it appears to be true, valid, or right. An individual's legal interest or entitlement to assert a claim against a defendant must be grounded in some legal right recognized by law, whether by statute or by common law.

In its writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   , the estate contends that the Court of Appeals' decision is erroneous, because it failed to apply the two part test announced in\n   <em>\n    Hemphill\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hemphill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8829814\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/245/33/\">\n    145 So.2d at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing that \"[t]he owner of a future interest must fulfill two requirements in order to receive compensation.\"). I agree with Judge Tindell's dissent to the extent that the two part test is inapplicable to the facts of the present case, which do not involve a taking. Although the two part test is inapplicable, the\n   <em>\n    Hemphill\n   </em>\n   Court's discussion of owners of executory interests is applicable, apart from the analysis specific to the constitutional issue of a taking. The\n   <em>\n    Hemphill\n   </em>\n   Court wrote that \"[t]he owner of an executory interest has certain limited rights to enjoin the possessory owner from waste of the inheritance, and to recover damages for injuries which diminish substantially its value.\"\n   <em>\n    Hemphill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8829814\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/245/33/\">\n    145 So.2d at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court further explained\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Moreover, the owner of a future interest must have his \"day in court\", or its equivalent, before a claim affecting it can effectively secure judicial sanction. This rests upon the constitutional provision for due process.

The wide acceptance of that fact makes it clear that the interest is \"property\" in the usual sense of the word. Whether a given future interest is of a sufficiently substantial character to be given the protection of a particular constitutional guaranty would seem properly to depend upon factors other than the classification as vested or contingent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 462.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b644.

Ultimately, under the guide of\n   <em>\n    Hemphill\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Baumgardner\n   </em>\n   , and in light of the Court's liberal standing requirements, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Jane and Claire, as contingent remainder interest holders, have standing to request an accounting, because they have a colorable interest in the subject matter of whether the estate and the trust were administered faithfully.
