(\"CASE\"). He appeals a final judgment of the trial court which fixed the fair value of his shares at contradictory amounts of $ 871,817.00 and $ 587,187.00. The judgment was then amended\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   by the trial court to a decisive figure of $ 871,817.00. This Amended Judgment now forms the subject of Mr. Kolwe's consolidated appeals, whereby he challenges its validity pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 1951. Mr. Kolwe additionally contends the trial court erred in its conclusion of his effective date of withdrawal from CASE and also in its failure to award interest on the amount of his shares as valued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CASE answers the appeal challenging the trial court's determination of the fair value of Mr. Kolwe's shares in the corporation. Specifically, it asserts that the trial court erred in declining to tax-effect Mr. Kolwe's shares, in including proceeds of a settled claim awarded to CASE in its valuation determination, and in allegedly refusing to consider evidence of undue burden pursuant to La.R.S. 12:1-1436(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we amend the original judgment to conform to the statutory framework contemplated by the LBCA and, as amended, affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We must decide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) whether the Amended Judgment on Rules issued by the trial court on January 4, 2018, is an absolute nullity pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 1951 and, if so, whether the Original Judgment on Rules signed on December 22, 2017, may be revised to correct any errors of substance or, alternatively, any errors in calculation or phraseology;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) whether the trial court erred in determining the effective date of Mr.\n   Kolwe's Notice of Withdrawal to be November 29, 2015;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (3) whether the trial court erred in its determination of the \"fair value\" of Mr. Kolwe's interest by failing to tax-effect the value of his shares and/or including the BP settlement payment in its valuation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (4) whether the trial court erred in failing to award Mr. Kolwe judicial interest and costs from the date of judicial demand; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (5) whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to hear evidence pertaining to La.R.S. 12:1-1436(E) at the conclusion of the valuation trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   CASE is a professional engineering firm operating as a closely-held business corporation. Its three shareholders, Michael Smith, Matthew Granberry, and Joseph Kolwe, Jr., each owned an equal one-third share until December 2017. Prior to Mr. Kolwe's disassociation from the corporation, each shareholder served as an employee and officer of CASE, and the three together comprised the board of directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After employment-related disputes arose concerning Mr. Kolwe's performance, discussions regarding his departure from CASE commenced in December of 2014. In early 2015, CASE began negotiating a buy-out of Mr. Kolwe's ownership interest and retained a business valuation expert, Jason MacMorran, to facilitate the transaction; Mr. Kolwe likewise retained his own expert, Charles Theriot, to protect his interests. By mid-2015, however, the shareholders were unable to amicably resolve the terms of Mr. Kolwe's withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In November of 2015, Mr. Kolwe received notice of a special meeting of the board of directors to be held for the purpose of considering a profitability incentive plan for employees and directors of CASE. After receiving notice of the meeting, Mr. Kolwe's attorney drafted and mailed a notice of withdrawal to the corporation pursuant to La.R.S. 12:1-1435,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   At the board meeting, the profitability incentive plan was adopted despite Mr. Kolwe's objection. At the end of November, Mr. Kolwe's employment with CASE was terminated, and, over the course of the next month, he was removed as both an officer and director of the corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 2, 2015, Mr. Kolwe filed suit against CASE, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Granberry alleging claims of shareholder oppression. However, this suit was ultimately dismissed after the trial court sustained the defendants' Exceptions of No Cause of Action and Prematurity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 6, 2016, Mr. Kolwe reasserted his claims of oppression against CASE, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Granberry. After disagreements continued regarding the value of Mr. Kolwe's ownership interest, the parties agreed to bypass a trial on the merits of the oppression claims and simply litigate the valuation issue by summary proceeding in accordance with La.R.S. 12:1-1436. Upon joint request of the parties, the trial court signed a Consent Judgment and Order of Trial Date which ordered that a trial be held for the limited purposes of valuing Mr. Kolwe's shares and determining the effective date of his notice of withdrawal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to the valuation trial, CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment regarding the effective date of Mr. Kolwe's withdrawal. On November 20, 2017, the trial court granted the motion and held Mr. Kolwe's notice of withdrawal to corporation was effective as of November 29, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A valuation trial was held on December 20-21, 2017, and a final judgment was rendered in the matter on December 22, 2017, purporting to declare the value of Mr. Kolwe's shares and affirming its earlier ruling as to the effective date of Mr. Kolwe's notice of withdrawal. In reaching its valuation determination, the trial court declined to \"tax-effect\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the value of the corporation's unaccrued net assets as argued for by CASE, and included the proceeds of a settled BP claim in the valuation as argued against by CASE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   However, the final judgment contained an internal inconsistency regarding the dollar figure amount of Mr. Kolwe's interest, and the trial court thereafter issued an amended judgment on January 4, 2018, to correct the inconsistency. On appeal, however, Mr. Kolwe asserts that the amended judgment is absolutely null and, thus, seeks to reinstate the original judgment because of the trial court's failure to afford the proper hearing with notice to the parties prior to correcting its error of substance in the original judgment. Next, Mr. Kolwe argues that the effective date of his notice of withdrawal was November 24, 2015, despite the trial court's ruling that his notice of withdrawal was effective five days later, as of November 29, 2015. Whereas the effective date of Mr. Kolwe's withdrawal from the corporation dictates the fair value of his ownership interest in CASE, the parties raise several arguments on appeal with respect to both procedural and substantive aspects of the trial court's valuation determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[A]ppellate jurisdiction of a court of appeal extends to law and facts.\" La.Const. art. 4, \u00a7 10 (B).

However, the judgment contained an internal inconsistency with respect to the dollar figure amount of Mr. Kolwe's ownership interest in the corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an earlier portion of the judgment located under the subheading JUDGMENT, the trial court stated: \"This court adjudges declares and decrees [sic] the plaintiff's shares as of November 29, 2015 to be $ 587,178.00.\" In its conclusion, however, the trial court went on to state: \"Accordingly, this court finds that the plaintiff's ownership interests in CASE shares as of November 29, 2015 to be valued to be $ 871,817.00.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On January 4, 2018, the trial court issued an Amended Judgment on Rules (\"Amended Judgment\")\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . Without providing a hearing with notice to the parties, the trial court deleted its language decreeing Mr. Kolwe's interest to be worth $ 587,178.00. Consistent with the Original Judgment, the Amended Judgment valued Mr. Kolwe's shares to be $ 871,817.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Mr. Kolwe now argues before this court that the Amended Judgment rendered on January 4, 2018, ought to be declared an absolute nullity pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 1951. Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 1951 provides the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   On motion of the court or any party, a final judgment may be amended at any time to alter the phraseology of the judgment, but not its substance, or to correct errors of calculation. The judgment may be amended only after a hearing with notice to all parties, except that a hearing is not required if all parties consent or if the court or the party submitting the amended judgment certifies that it was provided to all parties at least five days before the amendment and that no opposition has been received.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   He asserts that while the trial court clearly intended to value his interest to be worth $ 871,817.00, as demonstrated by the Amended Judgment's deletion of the decretal reference to the $ 587,187.00 figure contained in the Original Judgment, the deletion constitutes an amendment to\n   the substance of the final Original Judgment rendered by the trial court, in violation of La.Code Civ.P. art. 1951. Finding that this alteration of the final judgment regarding the fair value amount not only affects the substance of the judgment, but also directly injects uncertainty into the very objective to be attained by the valuation trial, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   While the usual remedy of this court in such a case is to vacate the amended judgment and reinstate the original judgment, this case will not be resolved by such a remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tunstall v. Stierwald\n   </em>\n   , 01-1765 (La. 2/26/02),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9518467\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/809/916/\">\n    809 So.2d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To reinstate the Original Judgment here would allow a judgment to stand which contains an internal inconsistency regarding the value of Mr. Kolwe's shares, which would, thus, defeat the sole objective of the valuation trial. Pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 2164, an appellate court may \"render any judgment which is just, legal and proper upon the record on appeal.\" Accordingly, based on the complete record before us, we deem it just, legal and proper not only to vacate the Amended Judgment and reinstate the Original Judgment, but also to revise the Original Judgment to reflect the clear intent of the trial court to value Mr. Kolwe's ownership interest in the amount of $ 871,817.00 as of November 29, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Accordingly, Mr. Kolwe's ownership of any interest and any corresponding rights and obligations as a shareholder in CASE will be deemed to have terminated as of the date of the issuance of the Original Judgment, on December 22, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Additionally, CASE raises a separate error of the trial court in rendering its final judgment. It asserts that the trial court erred in its failure to render a portion of the judgment in favor of CASE and against Mr. Kolwe, as required by La.R.S. 12:1-1436(D). We agree, and likewise revise the Original Judgment, as amended above, to conform with the statutory requirements of the LBCA pursuant to the authority conferred upon this court in La.Code Civ.P. art. 2164.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Louisiana Revised Statutes 12:1-1436(D) (emphasis added) provides, in pertinent part, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [A]t the conclusion of the trial the court\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   render final judgment as described in Paragraphs (1)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) of this Subsection:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) In favor of the shareholder and against the corporation for the fair value of the shareholder's shares.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    In favor of the corporation and against the shareholder that does both of the following\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (a) Terminates the shareholder's ownership of shares in the corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (b) Orders the shareholder to deliver to the corporation within thirty days of the date of the judgment any certificate issued by the corporation for the shares or an affidavit by the shareholder that the certificate has been lost, stolen, destroyed, or previously delivered to the corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In both judgments, the trial court concluded its written reasons by stating the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   In accordance with the provisions of La.R.S. 12:1-1436(D), this is a final judgment is [sic] rendered in favor of plaintiff Joseph Kolwe, Jr. and against defendant Civil and Structural Engineers, Inc. This judgment terminates the plaintiff's ownership shares [sic] in Civil and Structural Engineers, Inc. The plaintiff is ordered to deliver to CASE, Inc., any certificate issued by CASE for the shares or an affidavit that the certificate has been lost, stolen destroyed [sic] or previously delivered to the corporation, within thirty days of the date of this judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As stated above, La.Code Civ.P. art. 1951 provides that a court may, on its own motion, amend a final judgment at any time to correct the phraseology of a judgment. Thus, La.Code Civ.P. art. 1951 allows that a \"judgment may be amended by the court where the amendment takes nothing from or adds nothing to the original judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Villaume v.

While we recognize that the trial court's holding comports with the statute's requirement in effect through featuring language that terminates Mr. Kolwe's ownership of shares and orders him to deliver any certificate or affidavit to the corporation, we further amend the phraseology of Original Judgment to explicitly reflect the statutory directive for the judicial determination of fair value as contemplated by La.R.S. 12:1-1436(D), specifically Subsection (D)(2), where to do so would neither add nor take something away from the substance of the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Effective Date of Notice of Withdrawal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Kolwe asks this court to determine whether the trial court erred in declaring that the effective date of his notice of withdrawal to the corporation was November 29, 2015, rather than November 24, 2015, as he maintains. For the following reasons, we decline the arguments advanced by Mr. Kolwe and affirm the trial court's determination that Mr. Kolwe's notice of withdrawal to the corporation became effective as of November 29, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On November 21, 2015, a notice of special meeting of the board of directors of CASE was timely mailed to Mr. Kolwe per the corporate by-laws, informing him of a special meeting to be held on the morning of November 25, 2015. The board meeting notice was delivered to Mr. Kolwe's mailbox on November 23, 2015, at 1:23 p.m., as indicated by the return receipt. On the\n   afternoon of November 24, 2015, following his receipt of the board meeting notice, Mr. Kolwe's attorney, Travis Broussard, prepared a letter asserting that Mr. Kolwe was withdrawing as a shareholder of CASE pursuant to La.R.S. 12:1-1435,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The letter was addressed to Michael Smith as president of CASE, and sent by U.S. mail to be delivered to the address of the corporation's principal office as indicated in the corporate records. However, the letter was never actually received by the corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At or around the same time, Mr. Broussard's secretary drafted and sent an email to Kyle M. Bacon, an attorney representing Mr. Smith and Mr. Granberry as majority shareholders and directors of CASE. The email stated: \"Attached please find a letter from Mr. Broussard directed to Civil and Structural Engineers, Inc., regarding the above-referenced matter, which was sent via U.S. Mail today.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   At all pertinent times, Mr. Kolwe has argued that the email sent to Mr. Bacon constituted notice by electronic transmission pursuant La.R.S. 12:1-141, and further that notice to Mr. Bacon constituted sufficient, legal notice to the corporation. Mr. Kolwe alternatively argued that because the notice of withdrawal was mailed to a shareholder of CASE pursuant to La.R.S.12:1-141(I)(2), the notice was effective upon deposit in the U.S. Mail. On November 20, 2017, the trial court granted CASE's Partial Motion for Summary Judgment and found that \"there is no genuine issue of material fact that notice of withdrawal was mailed on November 24, 2015, to the address of the business. Notice is effective five (5) days thereafter, which was November 29, 2015.\" On appeal, we find Mr. Kolwe's arguments to be neither compelling nor applicable to the instant situation as reasserted before this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Louisiana Revised Statutes 12:1-1435 governs the procedure affording an oppressed shareholder the right to withdraw from a corporation. At the outset, the statute dictates that \"the value of a withdrawing shareholder's shares is to be determined as of the effective date of the notice of withdrawal.\" La.R.S. 12:1-1435(C)(1). The statute further indicates that \"[a] shareholder may assert a right to withdraw under this Section by giving written notice\n   <em>\n    to the corporation\n   </em>\n   that the shareholder is withdrawing from the corporation on grounds of oppression.\" La.R.S. 12:1-1435(D) (emphasis added). Therefore, in addition to the requirements that notice be written and specify that the shareholder withdraws on grounds of oppression, the statute explicitly mandates that a shareholder direct his or her notice of withdrawal to the corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   While La.R.S. 12:1-1435 does not contain any formal requirements for effectuating notice particular to oppressed shareholders, the \"effective date of notice\" is defined in La.R.S. 12:1-141. La.R.S. 12:1-140(7). That statute provides that \"[n]otice or other communication to a domestic...corporation...may be delivered to its registered agent or to the secretary of the corporation at its principal office.\" La.R.S. 12:1-141(C). Alternatively, the statute also permits that such notice \"may be delivered by electronic transmission if consented to by\n   the recipient or if authorized by Subsection J of this Section.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsection (J) goes on to provide the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   J. A notice or other communication may be in the form of an electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper form by the recipient through an automated process used in conventional commercial practice only if all of the following requirements are met:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (1) The electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in perceivable form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (2) The sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of such form of electronic transmission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   La.R.S. 12:1-141(J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   While Mr. Kolwe maintains that the email sent by Mr. Broussard's secretary to Mr. Bacon constitutes notice by electronic transmission, we disagree for several reasons. First, any notice, regardless of form, given to Mr. Bacon cannot be deemed effective as notice to the corporation. While La.R.S. 12:1-141(C) provides that notice to the corporation may be effected upon either its registered agent or its secretary, Mr. Bacon served in neither capacity for CASE. Moreover, even if Mr. Bacon were authorized to receive notice on behalf of the corporation, there is no evidence that Mr. Bacon gave his consent to Mr. Kolwe, written or otherwise, to receive any electronic communication from him under Subsection (J). To this point, Mr. Kolwe relies on a letter dated September 1, 2015, in which Mr. Bacon stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   I am sending this letter in my capacity as counsel for the majority shareholders and majority directors of Civil and Structural Engineers, Inc. (\"CASE\"), Mike Smith and Matt Granberry. If you are represented by an attorney, please notify me immediately, and I will direct all future communications to your attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In our review, nothing contained in the above language suggests that Mr. Bacon gave, or otherwise indicated, his consent to receive notice on behalf of the corporation electronically. Therefore, we find this argument to be without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Though more persuasive, Mr. Kolwe's alternative argument that notice was effective upon deposit in the U.S. mail likewise fails. He asserts that because the notice was addressed to Michael Smith, the corporate president and a shareholder, the notice consequently ought to be effective on the date of its alleged deposit on November 24, 2015. In examining the plain language of the statute, however, we must disagree with Mr. Kolwe's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In more pertinent part, the relevant statutory provision relied upon by Mr. Kolwe provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   I. Notice or other communication, if in a comprehensible form or manner, is effective at the earliest of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (2) If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly addressed\n   to a shareholder, upon deposit in the United States mail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (3) If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a\n   <em>\n    recipient other than a shareholder\n   </em>\n   , the earliest of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (a) The date when actually received.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (b) If sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, the date shown on the return receipt signed by or on behalf of the addressee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (c) Five days after it is deposited in the United States mail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   La.R.S. 12:1-141(I) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   While Mr. Smith was indeed a shareholder of the corporation, Mr. Kolwe's argument attempts to unduly circumvent the procedural scheme set forth by the withdrawal provisions in La.R.S. 12:1-1435,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   by relying on the general notice statute which governs all communications by a variety of actors across numerous types of business entities in this state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As mentioned previously, La.R.S. 12:1-1435(D) allows Mr. Kolwe to \"assert a right to withdraw\n   <em>\n    under this Section\n   </em>\n   by giving written notice\n   <em>\n    to the corporation\n   </em>\n   ...\" (emphasis added). A plain reading of the withdrawal statute\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   with the general notice statute suggests that while a shareholder may assert his right to withdraw by giving written notice to a registered agent or secretary of the corporation, giving such notice to a shareholder solely on the basis of being a shareholder is not contemplated by the withdrawal provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In reviewing the facts, Mr. Kolwe's withdrawal notice was addressed to \"Michael Smith, president\" and listed the mailing address of the corporation's principle office, rather than the separate mailing address listed for Michael Smith in his capacity as registered agent in the corporate records. Moreover, in discussing the issue of notice in his brief, Mr. Kolwe correctly identified that \"[t]he proper purchaser of Kolwe's interest was the corporation, not the remaining shareholders.\" Though we find these facts not completely dispositive, it appears that Mr. Kolwe properly directed his right to withdraw to the corporation in accordance with the very statute defining his remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Furthermore, the mailed notice of withdrawal was never received by the corporation in this case and the record does not indicate that Mr. Kolwe's notice was sent by registered or certified mail. Thus, the effective date of Mr. Kolwe's notice necessarily falls under La.R.S. 12:1-141(I)(3)(c), which is five days after it was deposited in the U.S. mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As such, we find no manifest error in the trial court's determination that Mr. Kolwe's notice of withdrawal became effective on November 29, 2015. Consequently, Mr. Kolwe's shares ought to be valued as of that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Trial Court's Determination of \"Fair Value\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   At the valuation trial, each party presented competing expert testimony as to the estimated value of Mr. Kolwe's ownership interest in CASE. While both experts agreed that the net asset approach was the proper approach in rendering their respective opinions, they disagreed as to whether certain adjustments should be made to the corporation's book value. Specifically, two main points of disagreement arose: first, whether the corporation's accounts receivables should be adjusted, or \"tax-effected,\" to reflect the tax liability that would accrue upon their collection, and second, whether certain proceeds of a settled BP claim awarded to the corporation were \"known or knowable\" as of the date of Mr. Kolwe's withdrawal such that they ought be included in the valuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As a result, the experts' calculations differed significantly. CASE's valuation expert, Jason MacMorran, argued that while tax-effecting should be allowed in this case, the settlement proceeds should not be included in the valuation. Thus, after discounting the value of CASE's estimated future tax liability, he opined that Mr. Kolwe's shares were worth $ 587,178.00. Conversely, Mr. Kolwe's expert, Charles Theriot, argued that tax-effecting was inappropriate in this context and that because the proceeds to be received from the settlement were \"known or knowable\" as of the date of Mr. Kolwe's withdrawal, his shares were worth $ 871,817.00. It is undisputed that the difference between the figures reached was equivalent to the estimated tax liability (a $ 252,580.00 value), and what would be Mr. Kolwe's share of the proceeds from the BP claim (a $ 31,666.00 value).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   After hearing the expert testimony of both parties, the trial court accepted Mr. Kolwe's valuation estimate and declared that the fair value of his ownership interest was worth $ 871,817.00 as of November 29, 2015, the effective date of his notice of withdrawal. In rendering its valuation, the trial court explicitly rejected CASE's argument supporting a discount of the corporation's assets to account for future tax liability. It stated, \"the logic of CASE's argument suggest [sic] any reduction of the valuation for tax-effecting would result in a discount for the two remaining shareholders and double taxation for the plaintiff; therefore, this court finds that tax-effecting the unaccrued net assets is inappropriate in this case.\" As to the proceeds of the BP claim, the trial court expressly determined that because \"that asset was in fact known and a value of that asset was knowable\" as of the date of Mr. Kolwe's withdrawal, and, thus, the date his shares are to be valued, that those proceeds be included in the valuation of his interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On appeal, CASE challenges the trial court's determination of the \"fair value\" of Mr. Kolwe's ownership interest. Specifically, it alleges that the trial court's failure to tax-effect CASE's accounts receivables and its inclusion of the BP settlement proceeds in its valuation erroneously inflated the value of Mr. Kolwe's shares by approximately $ 284,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Before ruling on this issue, however, our review reveals that CASE's reasoning as to the applicability of certain adjustments, particularly with respect to tax-effecting, necessarily follows its flawed interpretation of \"fair value\" as contained in the newly revised and reenacted La.R.S. 12:1-1435(C)(2) and 12:1-1301(4). While the trial court's ultimate determination of fair value is a question of fact, the determination of whether a given fact is relevant to fair value under La.R.S. 12:1-1435(C)(2) and 12:1-1301(1) is a question of law which we review de novo. Here, CASE argues that the future tax liability to be accrued by the\n   corporation (but eventually passed-through to the shareholders personally) once its accounts receivable are collected upon reduces the value of those receivables to a hypothetical buyer, and is, thus, a relevant fact which ought to discount the value of Mr. Kolwe's ownership interest. However, because the reduction of the value of the corporation to account for Mr. Kolwe's share of future tax liability follows directly from the concept of \"fair market value,\" rather than the legislature's explicit and distinct statutory standard of \"fair value\" which expressly rejects the applicability of discounts, we disagree with CASE's interpretation in light of the clear statutory language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    The Meaning of \"Fair Value\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The primary question in interpreting applicable statutory law is one of legislative intent and the ascertainment of the reasons that prompted the legislature to enact the law.\n   <em>\n    Caldwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6926532\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/144/898/\">\n    144 So.3d 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It states that the definition of fair value \"is designed to adopt the more modern view that appraisal should generally award a shareholder his or her proportional interest in the corporation\n   <em>\n    after valuing the corporation as a whole, rather than the value of the shareholder's shares when valued alone\n   </em>\n   .\" Mod.

Instead, in order to be \"consistent with customary and current valuation concepts and techniques,\" CASE urges that La.R.S. 12:1-1435(C)(2) requires a valuation to be made in the context of \"a hypothetical transaction with a third-party buyer.\" We find that CASE's interpretation of fair value presents two separate, but related, issues. We, therefore, disagree with its reading of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   First, CASE's interpretation of the language, \"a sale of the entire corporation ...\" unnecessarily convolutes the context of La.R.S. 12:1-1435(C)(2) into a hypertechnical construction that detracts from the fair value standard set forth by the legislature. It is our view that the context envisioned by the legislature in drafting \"a sale of the entire corporation\" is that of a dissolution in effect. However, given the legislature's express striking of shareholder oppression as a grounds for corporate dissolution, it appears reasonable that the legislature would choose not to include the term \"dissolution\" in the shareholder oppression statute so as not to create an apparent inconsistency in the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   To begin, La.R.S. 12:1-1435(C)(2) is codified under Part 14 of Title 12, Chapter 1, which is entitled \"Dissolution.\" The Official Comments to that statute state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (a) Model Act Section 14.34 provides a mechanism under which the corporation or its shareholders may elect to buy out the interests of a shareholder\n   <em>\n    who is seeking to have the corporation dissolved\n   </em>\n   under Model Act Paragraph 14.30(a)(2). This Section retains the Model Act approach with respect to dissolution on grounds of deadlock under R.S. 12:1-1430(A)(2)(a) and (c). But, with respect to other grounds for dissolution under R.S. 12:1-1430(A)(2), this Section replaces the Model Act scheme with four entirely new Sections, R.S. 12:1-1435 through 1-1438. As explained in Comment (c), below, the four new Sections provide remedies for a claim under R.S. 12:1-1430(A)(2) only on grounds of oppression. But the main effect of the four new Sections is to reverse the order of the remedies provided by the Model Act for oppression, from dissolution unless the corporation or its shareholders choose quickly to buy out the plaintiff shareholder, to a buyout of the plaintiff shareholder unless the corporation chooses to dissolve before final judgment in the suit is rendered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   (b) This change in the order of remedies is designed to do two things: allow the corporation to contest the plaintiff shareholder's allegations of oppression without risking an involuntary dissolution of the entire company, and align the statutory remedies for oppression more closely with those that have been provided in most of the reported American cases on the subject.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   La.R.S. 12:1-1435, Official Revision Comments (a) and (b) (emphasis added). While we recognize that the Official Comments are not part of the statute, and, thus, are not binding on this court, they provide meaningful guidance in this instance by setting forth the legislature's clear preference for the buyout remedy over that of corporate dissolution.\n   <em>\n    Terrebonne Parish School Bd. v. Castex Energy, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 04-968 (La. 1/19/05),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182757\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/893/789/\">\n    893 So.2d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the legislature has followed the Model Act's approach in most aspects of its revision of the LBCA, it specifically chose to reverse the order of the Model Act's remedy from \"dissolution unless buyout\" to \"buyout unless dissolution.\" That is to say, where the Model Act provides that the oppressed\n   shareholder's primary remedy is to seek dissolution of the corporation unless the corporation elects to buyout the shareholder, the LBCA expressly prohibits dissolution on grounds of oppression in favor of its exclusive remedy being the fair value buyout.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, it would seem practical for the legislature not to choose to use the term \"dissolution\" in La.R.S. 12:1-1435(C)(2). In choosing the phrase \"a sale of the entire corporation in an arm's length transaction by a person who owns all of the shares in the corporation[,]\" which, in effect amounts to a dissolution, the language clearly reflects the legislature's disfavored (and now defunct) remedy of dissolving the corporation in matters of shareholder oppression disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Despite departing from the Model Act in the context of dissolution, the LBCA has nevertheless aligned its objective more closely with the Model Act's stated purpose of \"valuing the corporation\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   \" as opposed to valuing the shareholder's shares in and of themselves. In valuing a shareholder's interest \"in the context of a sale of the\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   corporation,\" the legislature kept consistent with the Model Act's approach of first examining the value of the corporation as whole, as a beginning step in determining the fair value of shares. Hypertechnicalities aside, the danger in CASE's initial misconstruction lies not in its literal impacts, but rather in the implications that follow. To accept CASE's reasoning would erroneously convert the meaning of \"fair value\" into \"fair market value,\" a separate and distinct standard that directly impacts the valuation of shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Following the argument advanced by CASE, we next examine its continued references to a hypothetical transaction-specifically, what a hypothetical buyer of these shares would pay for Mr. Kolwe's shares. On review, we find this logic to be directly antithetical with the legal conception of \"fair value.\" While scholars and commentators in other jurisdictions have wrestled with the meaning of \"fair value\" over the last few decades, such strife has largely been predicated on the applicability of discounts where the relevant statutory provisions are silent on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like such jurisdictions which have struggled to correctly define \"fair value,\" CASE's argument illustrates the common, yet erroneous, injection of fair market value principles into the legal definition of fair value where the valuation difference between these two approaches is equivalent to the amount, and, thus, the applicability, of discounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   To begin, \"[a] fair market value analysis determines the value of closely held corporation shares by asking what someone would hypothetically pay for those shares.\" Douglas K.

Because the shares of a minority shareholder\n   in a closely held corporation, such as that of Mr. Kolwe, are marked by a lack of value-enhancing attributes such as control and liquidity, \"fair market value\" captures the absence of those features by reducing, or \"discounting\" the purchase price of those shares.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Loy.%20L.%20Rev.%20461\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, if we accept that fair value is equivalent to fair market value, discounting the buyout price of those shares is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Loy.%20L.%20Rev.%20461\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Unlike the other aforementioned jurisdictions, however, the Louisiana legislature has explicitly resolved this issue by rejecting the applicability of discounts in the context of purchasing a withdrawing shareholder's interest. Not only does the language of the statute expressly disallow discounting, but the legislature's decision to select the term \"fair value\" rather than \"fair market value\" carries the implicit rejection of discounting. As one scholar has explained, fair value may be equated with \"enterprise value,\" which at the outset, views the shareholder in an oppression-induced buyout transaction \"as an investor forced to relinquish his ownership position, rather than as an investor looking to sell his shares.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Loy.%20L.%20Rev.%20461\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Loy.%20L.%20Rev.%20461\">\n    at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this view, the fair value of shares \"is determined not by reference to what the particular shares would fetch in a hypothetical market sale, but instead by valuing the company\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   and by ascribing to each share its pro rata portion of that overall enterprise value.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Loy.%20L.%20Rev.%20461\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the shares of a minority shareholder are not valued in and of themselves, but rather as a part of the overall value of the corporation with no discounting for the shares' lack of valuable attributes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Loy.%20L.%20Rev.%20461\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In its decision to choose \"fair value\" as its standard, which in and of itself both explicitly and implicitly rejects discounting, the Louisiana legislature has explicitly resolved this issue in favor of expressly rejecting the applicability of discounts in calculating the fair value of a withdrawing shareholder's interest in the corporation. Thus, shares of a withdrawing shareholder in the context of La.R.S. 12:1-1435,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   must be valued in accordance with the general rule that rejects discounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Accordingly, we hold that the term \"fair value\" in the context of Louisiana's shareholder oppression statute means the withdrawing shareholder's proportionate interest in the corporation valued as a going concern. Thus, in order to ascertain \"fair value,\" the trial court must first determine the value of the corporation in its entirety and then allocate the withdrawing shareholder his proportionate ownership interest of that value, without applying any discounts at the shareholder level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    Tax-Effecting\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In its determination of the value of Mr. Kolwe's interest, the trial court concluded that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   CASE argues that the failure to apply tax-effecting will result in the remaining two CASE shareholders incurring an obligation to pay income taxes on income that the plaintiff received. However, CASE failed to present any evidence to support that conclusion. There was no evidence presented that this judgement [sic] will cause any tax effect on the parties. In fact, the logic of CASE's argument suggest [sic] any reduction of the valuation for tax-effecting would result in a discount for the two remaining shareholders and double taxation for the plaintiff; therefore, this court finds that tax-effecting the unaccrued net assets is inappropriate in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Under this interpretation, which is also espoused by Mr. Kolwe, to tax-effect the net assets of the corporation in determining the fair value of a withdrawing shareholder's interest results in a discount. As\n   we previously explained, this is expressly prohibited in valuing a minority shareholder's interest under La.R.S. 12:1-1435.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Tax-effecting is a method whereby an appraiser fictitiously reduces the earnings stream, and, thus, the value, of a pass-through entity to account for a hypothetical entity-level income tax where such entities are not subject to taxation. CASE is incorporated as an S-corporation, and is, thus, not subject to corporate-level tax. Instead, taxes are passed through to the individual shareholders on the personal level to be reported as income tax. Every year, each shareholder receives a K-1 form reporting all income received by him or her individually for that year, and taxes are to be paid on the amount reported as income. CASE operates on a cash basis, meaning that its accounts receivable, which comprise its unaccrued net assets, are taxed when collected, not when earned. Therefore, until the receivables are realized as income, these earnings are not yet subject to taxation. However, the decision of whether to tax-effect S-corporations is an ongoing debate among the business valuation profession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   As the jurisprudence of this state has illustrated, expert testimony in cases involving the valuation of interests in a business entity is critical.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   Generally, the trier of fact is not bound by expert testimony, but is to hear and weigh expert testimony in the same manner as any other evidence.

Moreover, in analogizing to the community property context in which courts of this state must routinely value the assets and liabilities of the community upon termination, we likewise find that where the \"asset to be valued is an interest in a partnership or corporation, the court must be careful to value the interest, not just the assets of the business entity\" upon a shareholder's withdrawal on grounds of oppression.\n   <em>\n    Ellington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9334931\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/1160/\">\n    842 So.2d at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The fair value of a withdrawing shareholder's interest may be determined by employing several approaches.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the\n   experts agreed that the proper approach to be employed in this case was the \"net asset approach,\" which relies on valuing separately the individual assets and liabilities of the company and assumes the highest value is achieved through breaking up the company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the experts ultimately disagreed on the applicability of tax-effecting in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   At the valuation trial, the trial court was able to weigh the conflicting testimony presented by Mr. Theriot and Mr. MacMorran as to the applicability and impact of tax-effecting the value of CASE's accounts receivables. Mr. Theriot, the valuation expert for Mr. Kolwe, opined that tax-effecting was inappropriate here. In his valuation, Mr. Theriot first appraised CASE in its entirety to testify that one-hundred percent interest in CASE was worth approximately $ 2.6 million, and divided that figure by the total number of shareholders to determine that Mr. Kolwe's one-third interest in CASE was worth approximately $ 871,000.00. He declined to tax-effect the $ 871,000.00 figure to account for the accrual of tax liability because Mr. Kolwe remained a shareholder throughout 2017 and will nevertheless remain liable for taxes on the income received throughout that tax year. Mr. Theriot premised his argument on the fact that as the buyer of Mr. Kolwe's shares, CASE is not subject to any corporate-level taxation where its tax liability is passed-through to the shareholders who report that income on their personal tax returns according to its S-corporation status. Therefore, because CASE itself will not assume any future tax liability in purchasing Mr. Kolwe's shares where taxes are owed on the shareholder level, Mr. Kolwe will remain liable for his share of the corporation's tax liability for as long as he remains a shareholder and receives a K-1 reporting item.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Conversely, Mr. MacMorran, the valuation expert for CASE, argued that notwithstanding CASE's status as an S-corporation, the taxes will have to be paid by someone. In premising his argument on what a \"hypothetical buyer\" would pay for Mr. Kolwe's shares, as examined in the previous section, he testified that \"[t]hey would not pay after-tax dollars to acquire pretax assets that they have to turn around and pay tax on again the next day. That would be a double-dip in valuing the shares.\" Thus, Mr. MacMorran ultimately argued that the issue was not only whether the corporation itself will pay taxes, but also whether a hypothetical buyer would pay taxes once the receivables were collected, thereby reducing the value of those receivables to the buyer. In concluding, a hypothetical buyer of shares in a pass-through entity will owe taxes upon collection of the receivables, and, thus, Mr. Kolwe's shares should be discounted to reflect that reduction in value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Ultimately, business valuation methods are not an exact science, and serve as guides to the trial court in determining fair value for the parties involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vedros v. Vedros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16-735%20%28La.App.%205%20Cir.%2010/25/17%29\">\n    16-735 (La.App. 5 Cir. 10/25/17)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381291\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/229/677/\">\n    229 So.3d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the valuation determination was made for the purpose of evaluating the fair value of Mr. Kolwe's shares\n   in CASE as a shareholder exercising his right to withdraw. However, in light of our interpretation of \"fair value,\" we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in its determination to not tax-effect the value of the corporation's receivables, nor that it committed manifest error in considering the expert testimony of both Mr. MacMorran and Mr. Theriot in reaching its conclusions. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's valuation determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    BP Settlement Payment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In November of 2013, CASE submitted a claim to the BP Settlement Fund in the amount of approximately $ 126,000.00. In either January or February of 2017, CASE received $ 105,000.00 from that claim, and subsequently collected a net amount of approximately $ 95,000.00 after deducting preparation expenses. Both experts agreed that the amount received for the claim could be included in the valuation if it comported with certain accounting standards, or was \"known or knowable as of the valuation date\" which has been established as November 29, 2015. In fact, it was adduced at the trial that Mr. MacMorran's accounting firm handled the administration of the BP claim. However, the experts disagreed as to what aspects of the claim were known or knowable as of the valuation date in determining whether the claim proceeds should be included in the valuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In providing expert testimony on behalf of Mr. Kolwe, Mr. Theriot included the BP claim in his valuation because he considered it an asset of the company as of November 29, 2015, the effective date of Mr. Kolwe's withdrawal and, thus, the date his shares were to be valued. In applying the relevant accounting standards, Mr. Theriot testified that so long as the receipt of proceeds subsequent to the valuation date are \"corroborative\" of a fact that was \"known or knowable\" as of the withdrawal date, then he is permitted to consider those proceeds in his valuation. However, Mr. Theriot acknowledged that corroborating a fact may not serve to establish a fact, the fact here being \"the incident had occurred, the settlement had been reached, the claim had been filed, there was just a question of approval of that claim.\" While CASE did not know of the claim's approval until early 2017, the settlement itself set forth all of the criteria that needed to be met, the parties supplied all the relevant documentation, and there were no additional requests made of CASE as of November 29, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   On the other hand, Mr. MacMorran testified that as of November 29, 2015, there was no known dollar amount and no known date of payment. Because the amount that was to be eventually received from the settlement had not been approved as of the valuation date, Mr. MacMorran testified that the BP claim was not known or knowable and, thus, should not have been included in the valuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   At the conclusion of the valuation trial, the trial court determined that the value of the proceeds of the settled BP claim was to be included in the valuation of Mr. Kolwe's shares. It held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   In 2017, CASE received settlement proceeds of a BP claim that had been accepted as of the date of plaintiff's withdrawal. The parties dispute whether this subsequent event should be included in the valuation of plaintiff's shares in the corporation. Subsequent events should not be considered in the valuation decision if those subsequent events are indicative of conditions that were not known or knowable at the valuation date, including conditions that arose after the valuation date. The parties testified that the BP claim was made prior to the withdrawal date. Thus, this court finds that asset was in fact known and a\n   value of that asset was knowable. There was no evidence presented that the settlement value that was ultimately obtained was not knowable ... The plaintiff's explanation of the [sic] how that value was knowable was clear and convincing[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Again, the trial court's weighing of the expert testimony and its ultimate decision to include the BP claim proceeds in the valuation of Mr. Kolwe's shares in CASE are subject to a review for abuse of discretion, and in the absence thereof, we shall afford great deference to the trial court's determination. While an exact dollar figure of the BP claim was not approved as of the valuation date, the completed settlement proceedings as of that date indicate that a forthcoming payment of the claim to the corporation was at least knowable, and, thus, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in accepting Mr. Theriot's opinion over that of Mr. MacMorran's in its valuation determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Judicial Interest and Costs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    Judicial Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Kolwe asserts that the trial court legally erred in failing to award legal interest from the date of judicial demand. Though both the Original and Amended Judgments assessed costs of the valuation proceedings to CASE, it remained silent regarding judicial interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In response to Mr. Kolwe's assertion, CASE now files a Peremptory Exception of\n   <em>\n    Res Judicata\n   </em>\n   and also moves this court for a partial dismissal of Mr. Kolwe's appeal to the extent it seeks interest and costs. Specifically, the corporation argues that because the Consent Judgment and Order of Trial Date signed by the trial court on July 12, 2017, dismissed with prejudice all claims and demands except those not reserved by the parties, CASE argues that the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   bars this court from re-litigating the issue given Mr. Kolwe's failure to reserve interest and costs in the Consent Judgment itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   While Mr. Kolwe concedes that La.R.S. 12:1-1435,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   does not explicitly address awards of judicial interest, he maintains that because his original Petition filed April 6, 2016 included a prayer for judicial interest, he is, thus, entitled to recovering such notwithstanding his failure to reserve any such entitlement in the Consent Judgment. Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 1921 provides that \"[t]he court shall award interest in the judgment as prayed for or as provided by law.\" Our review of the record reveals that Mr. Kolwe did in fact pray for judicial interest in his original Petition filed on April 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As CASE correctly points out, La.R.S. 12:1-1435 does not expressly provide Mr. Kolwe with a positive statutory right to recover interest as a withdrawing shareholder. However, we find the preceding statute, La.R.S. 12:1-1434, which governs the corporation's election to purchase a petitioning shareholder's interest in lieu of a dissolution proceeding, to be sufficiently analogous to the instant case in allowing interest to a shareholder who is nevertheless departing from the corporation, albeit on different grounds. While not controlling, the statute provides some additional support for our position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate.... Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise\n   not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   La.R.S. 12:1-1435(E). This case, which has in fact resulted in a judicial determination of the fair value of Mr. Kolwe's shares, is similar enough to the preceding statutory provision that we find it appropriate to reason by analogy that an award of interest is allowable here. We, thereby, allow Mr. Kolwe to recover judicial interest as a withdrawing shareholder in the absence of any showing of bad faith on his part in the valuation proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In determining the date from which interest is due, however, we do not agree with Mr. Kolwe's assertion that he is owed interest from the date of judicial demand. Louisiana Civil Code Article 2000 provides, in pertinent part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   When the object of the performance is a sum of money, damages for delay in performance are measured by the interest on that sum from the time it is due, at the rate agreed by the parties or, in the absence of agreement, at the rate of legal interest as fixed by R.S. 9:3500. The obligee may recover these damages without having to prove any loss, and whatever loss he may have suffered he can recover no more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Instead, we find it instructive to view the Consent Judgment as the conventional obligation ordering that the valuation trial be held, at which the parties understood that the trial court would determine the fair value of Mr. Kolwe's shares which would be owed by the corporation.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   A consent judgment is a bilateral contract in which parties adjust their differences by mutual consent and thereby put an end to a lawsuit with each party balancing hope of gain against fear of loss.

Despite the fact that CASE brought the statute to the trial court's attention in opening argument and twice more before closing arguments, as well as proffered testimony of its financial condition after the trial, it maintains that the trial court erroneously excluded the evidence it sought to present pertaining to the statute.

Moreover, the statute clearly conditions this discretionary adjustment of the judgment amount upon its satisfaction that the corporation has adequately proven that its payment of the judgment will either violate rules pertaining to a corporation's acquisition of its own shares or cause some undue harm. Thus, if and only if the corporation has sufficiently demonstrated either of these aspects before the trial court, the court may adjust the judgment as necessary to avoid that result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   We find that nothing in the statute \"necessitates\" a \"reduction\" in the amount,\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , as CASE argues. If so convinced at the conclusion of the valuation trial, the trial court in its discretion may provide relief \"as close in value and effect as feasible\n   to that contemplated by Subsection D ... but adjusted as necessary to avoid the relevant violation or undue harm.\" La.R.S. 12:1-1436(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Despite acknowledging that the statute clearly and explicitly \"calls for its application 'at the conclusion of trial,' \" CASE argues that the normal order of trial should have been varied to allow for an evidentiary hearing and/or a reopening of the record. In light of the clear language of the statute, and finding that CASE did in fact have several opportunities to present evidence pertaining to the application of the statute by the conclusion of the valuation trial, we do not find CASE's argument to this point compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   We also find CASE's assertion that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence pertaining to La.R.S. 12:1-1436(E) meritless. In its opening statement, counsel for CASE mentioned the statute before the trial court in an explicit effort to bring the statute to the court's attention. Before the close of Mr. Kolwe's rebuttal, counsel for CASE again read the statute before the court and stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   My point is that it looks like the statute is calling for us to know what the judgment rendered is going to be so we can put on evidence of whether the corporation can pay the judgment or not. And I just want to know procedurally how we do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Following a recess at which the trial court reviewed the statute, it stated on the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   I have now had an opportunity to read Revised Statute 12:1-1436, and it appears that the particular paragraph that is of note is paragraph E. And my interpretation of that paragraph is that if during the course of this trial I determine that the value of the plaintiff's share is $ 300, that is what the evidence convinces me, and also there has been evidence presented during the course of the trial that convinces me that if I order the corporation to pay any amount more than $ 200, if that will cause undue harm to the corporation or to a creditor to the corporation, then I'm not allowed to render the $ 300 judgment, I'm required to reduce the $ 300 judgment to something not more than $ 200. That is what the statute says.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   The evidence that's already been presented, there is no evidence that causes me to be able to conclude that undue harm of a judgment of any amount would result - there's no evidence that would cause me to conclude that any judgment I render today will produce undue harm to this corporation or to any of its creditors. There has not been that evidence presented. So I don't think that that paragraph has any bearing on anything we're doing today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   CASE's assertion that a reduction in the judgment is required is simply untenable where the ultimate condition giving rise to the trial court's exercise of discretionary relief was not fulfilled, that is, the corporation's ability to present proof or otherwise convince the trial court that it will suffer a violation or undue harm in its payment of the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   After resting its case but before closing arguments, CASE moved to reopen the record for purposes of introducing evidence pertaining to La.R.S. 12:1-1436(E). Citing several appellate cases as well as codal authority, CASE argued that the trial court had discretion to reopen the record and that it ought to do so in this case in order to allow for \"ascertainment of the truth\" pursuant to La.Code Evid. art. 611.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   In ruling on the motion, the trial court examined all of the jurisprudence presented and determined that CASE \"made a calculated decision to not present evidence that was available.\" It further stated that CASE had \"not given [the trial court] sufficient reason to exercise the discretion that [it has] to allow you to reopen this case to present evidence.\" In light of what we find to be sound reasons enunciated throughout the valuation trial by the trial court, we are reminded that this is ultimately an evidentiary determination of the trial court that is accorded considerable discretion by this court. While the procedure set forth in La.R.S. 12:1-1436(E) is considerably new, our supreme court has noted,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   [S]everal of the most important reasons for deferring to the trial judge's exercise of discretion are: his observation of the witness, his superior opportunity to get \"the feel of the case,\" ... and the impracticability of framing a rule of decision where many disparate factors must be weighed .... On occasion, when a problem arises in a context so new and unsettled that the rule-makers do not yet know what factors should shape the result, the case may be a good one to leave to lower court discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <em>\n    Kem Search, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641264\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/434/1067/\">\n    434 So.2d at 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1983) (internal citations omitted). As such, we find the trial court has not abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen the record, nor in ultimately determining that CASE did not sufficiently prove that its payment of the judgment would cause a violation or undue harm under La.R.S. 12:1-1436(E). Therefore, its decisions with respect to the statute will not be disturbed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the final judgment of the trial court rendered on December 22, 2017, valuing Mr. Kolwe's shares to be worth $ 871,817.00 is affirmed as amended.
