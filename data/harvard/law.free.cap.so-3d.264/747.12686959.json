Dr. Roger Weiner brought a malicious-prosecution claim against Health Management Associates Inc. and Teena Rowe. Dr. Roger Weiner based his malicious-prosecution claim on the federal district court's dismissal of his criminal prosecution. The court had dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. Health Management Associates Inc. and Teena Rowe filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the malicious-prosecution claim, arguing that a jurisdictional dismissal is not a favorable termination for the purposes of a malicious-prosecution claim. The trial court agreed. Later, with a new trial judge on the bench, Dr. Weiner sought reconsideration. The trial court reconsidered and reversed the former judge's order. Health Management Associates Inc. and Teena Rowe appealed. The Court reverses and remands the judgment of the trial court, holding that it erred in denying the partial summary-judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62. Dr. Roger Weiner was prosecuted in federal district court for violating the Mann Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202422\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2012). Dr. Weiner sought dismissal of the charges, alleging that the interstate-commerce element was not met. The district court dismissed the charges for lack of federal jurisdiction, stating that \"the federal nexus to interstate commerce necessary to create federal jurisdiction simply is not present in the case at bar.\" The order stated that dismissal was jurisdictional and that \"[i]n this case the court is not ruling on whether prostitution was never discussed and would never have been engaged in. If state or local prosecutorial authorities want to pursue a state law prosecution of solicitation of prostitution, that is their prerogative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63. Subsequently, Dr. Weiner brought a civil suit against Health Management Associates Inc. (HMA) and Teena Rowe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The suit alleged a number of claims, including a claim for malicious prosecution. HMA and Rowe filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the malicious-prosecution claim. HMA and Rowe argued that the malicious-prosecution claim should be dismissed because a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of the underlying criminal prosecution did not amount to a \"favorable termination\" under the elements of a malicious-prosecution claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64. The trial judge granted HMA and Rowe's motion for partial summary judgment. The trial judge then denied Dr. Weiner's motion for reconsideration and\n   certified the order granting partial summary judgment as a final order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65. Dr. Weiner filed a petition for interlocutory appeal and a direct appeal on the grant of the partial summary-judgment motion. The Court denied the petition for interlocutory appeal, holding that a Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) certification had been entered. Subsequently, HMA and Rowe filed a motion to dismiss the direct appeal, arguing that the order had been improperly certified as a final order under Rule 54(b). The Court granted the motion and dismissed the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66. Thereafter, the trial judge assigned to the case retired, and a new trial judge was assigned to the case. Dr. Weiner filed a \"Motion to Reconsider the Former Trial Court[']s Granting of HMA Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Rule 54(b) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure, the new trial judge granted the motion to reconsider and denied HMA and Rowe's partial summary-judgment motion on the issue of malicious prosecution. She stated that the prior federal case was decided in Dr. Weiner's favor because the order of dismissal \"went to the substantive elements of the crime of the Mann Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67. HMA and Rowe filed an interlocutory appeal. A panel of the court granted permission for the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68. The parties argue two general issues regarding whether the underlying termination supports a claim for malicious prosecution and whether the grant of the motion to reconsider was proper. The Court considers only one issue, as it is dispositive. The Court restyles the issue as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Whether the underlying termination of the federal criminal action constitutes a favorable termination for the purposes of a malicious-prosecution claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Whether the underlying termination of the federal criminal action constitutes a favorable termination for the purposes of a malicious\n   </strong>\n   -\n   <strong>\n    prosecution claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69. The trial court granted Dr. Weiner's motion to reconsider. The trial court then denied HMA's motion for partial summary judgment on the claim of malicious prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610.

Whether the underlying dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of the federal criminal action constitutes a favorable termination for the purposes of the malicious-prosecution claim.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611. Dr. Weiner maintains that the underlying dismissal for lack of jurisdiction\n   of the federal criminal action constitutes a favorable termination for the purposes of the malicious-prosecution claim. HMA and Rowe consider the termination procedural and, therefore, conclude that it does not constitute a favorable termination for the purposes of the malicious-prosecution claim. For the reasons discussed below, the Court agrees with HMA and Rowe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612. In\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   , in considering an issue of first impression for Mississippi, the Court held that a dismissal of the underlying criminal action for a lack of jurisdiction is not a favorable determination for malicious-prosecution purposes.\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7048974\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/29/761/#p764\">\n    29 So.3d at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Before reaching its holding, the\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   Court reviewed the competing interests in malicious-prosecution cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613. First, it considered \"[t]he public policy interest in crime prevention [which] insists that private citizens, when aiding law enforcement personnel, ought to be protected against the prejudice that is likely to arise from the termination of the prosecution in favor of the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7048974\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/29/761/#p764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7048974\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/29/761/#p764\">\n    at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Benjamin v.

Second, it considered the interest \"which protects individuals from being wrongly accused of criminal behavior which results in unjustified and oppressive litigation of criminal charges.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7530292\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/568/1182/#p1187\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614. The\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   Court also specifically stated that the dismissal must \"reflect on the merits of a criminal action or the innocence of the accused,\" noting that \"[t]he record is totally void of any indication of why the justice court concluded that it had no jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7048974\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/29/761/#p764\">\n    29 So.3d at 764, 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, it held that \"the dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction does not reflect on the merits of the criminal case against Bearden.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7048974\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/29/761/#p764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7048974\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/29/761/#p764\">\n    at 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615. Dr. Weiner maintains that, although the criminal dismissal here was jurisdictional,\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. Stating that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, Dr. Weiner concludes that, unlike in state court, if a federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, no federal crime exists. On the other hand, he claims that in state court, if a court lacks jurisdiction, the criminal charge may be brought elsewhere. HMA and Rowe argue that the jurisdictional requirement to federal crimes is merely a jurisdictional hook.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616. Dr. Weiner is correct to note the fundamental precept that \"federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute ....\"\n   <em>\n    Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    511 U.S. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1675,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). Thus, federal criminal laws differ from state criminal laws in that \"state crimes do not contain interstate commerce elements because a State does not need such a jurisdictional hook.\"\n   <em>\n    Torres v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596710\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1619/#p1625\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1625,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596710\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1619/#p1625\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Here, the Mann Act required interstate commerce as a jurisdictional requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202422\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The district court dismissed the criminal action against Dr. Weiner, citing a lack of jurisdiction due to the missing element of interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617. Although\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   addressed dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, it did so for a state crime, not a federal crime. Here, the question for the Court is also one of first impression: whether the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    for a federal crime\n   </em>\n   in federal court is a termination in Dr. Weiner's favor for the purposes of malicious prosecution. The instant issue presents an issue of law, which the Court reviews de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12368502\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/233/223/#p227\">\n    233 So.3d at 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618. The parties cite\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   , arguing that it supports their arguments. The issue in\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   is notably different than the issue here. The Supreme Court was faced with determining whether a state crime can count as an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act when the only difference in the state-law offense and the federal offense is the interstate-commerce element.\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596710\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1619/#p1625\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the issue was whether the jurisdictional element precluded the state crime from being considered an aggravated felony. The Supreme Court determined that the jurisdictional element was immaterial and that a state offense, which otherwise mirrors the federal offense, constituted an aggravated felony under the Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596710\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1619/#p1625\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Despite the factual differences in\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   , the Court agrees with the parties that\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   provides guidance regarding the effect of a jurisdictional element of a federal crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619. Dr. Weiner points out that\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   refers to federal jurisdiction as an element of the crime. Dr. Weiner states that the\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   Court noted that both kinds of elements must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596710\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1619/#p1625\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Weiner then interpreted\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   to conclude, \"If neither is proven beyond a reasonable [doubt], the accused is not guilty!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620. The\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   Court did state that both elements must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, but it went on to provide that the two types of elements are not the same. It said,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Both kinds of elements must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; and because that is so, both may play a real role in a criminal case. But still, they are not created equal for every purpose. To the contrary, courts have often recognized-including when comparing federal and state offenses-that Congress uses substantive and jurisdictional elements for different reasons and does not expect them to receive identical treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596710\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1619/#p1625\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The holdings of\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hattaway\n   </em>\n   illustrate that the jurisdictional element of a federal crime does not reflect upon culpability.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Lochridge\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the instant case and does not provide support for Dr. Weiner's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b637. Dr. Weiner also cites\n   <em>\n    Hyer v. Caruso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7018581\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/102/1232/\">\n    102 So.3d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. Ct. App. 2012). In\n   <em>\n    Hyer\n   </em>\n   , the charges against Caruso \"were remanded to the file.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7018581\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/102/1232/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7018581\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/102/1232/\">\n    at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once again, Dr. Weiner presents no such factually similar situation to garner guidance or support from\n   <em>\n    Hyer\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b638. In sum, when a dismissal does not address the merits, a failure of the government to appeal does not amount to an abandonment. Therefore, the instant issue does not bar summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b639. Under a de novo review, the trial court erred in denying the partial summary-judgment motion. The Court reverses the judgment and remands the case with instructions for the trial court to enter an order granting partial summary judgment in favor of HMA and Rowe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b640.\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   RANDOLPH, C.J., KITCHENS AND KING, P.JJ., BEAM, ISHEE AND GRIFFIS, JJ., CONCUR.
