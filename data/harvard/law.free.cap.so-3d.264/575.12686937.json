For the following reasons, we find that the trial judge erred in denying Defendants' motion to dismiss on the ground of abandonment based upon the record before her and improperly considered evidence not in the record. We therefore reverse the trial court's denial of Defendants' motion to dismiss, grant Defendants' motion to dismiss, and dismiss Plaintiff's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 14, 2013, Plaintiff filed a \"Petition to Enforce Security Interest\" against Defendants in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, seeking to enforce a loan agreement and mortgage in the amount of $52,631.38. On March 5, 2013, Defendants answered the petition and filed a reconventional demand, asserting breach of contract claims related to Plaintiff's alleged failure to apply payments in a specific manner as provided for in the loan agreement and failure to release to Defendants certain insurance claim funds following Hurricane Gustav. Additionally, Defendants contended that Plaintiff violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act and improperly charged Defendants late fees for payments made but not applied properly to the loan balance. Plaintiff filed an \"Answer and Affirmative Defenses\" to Defendants' reconventional demand on August 8, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 14, 2016, Defendants filed an \"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss Due to Abandonment,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   contending that Plaintiff took no formal step in the prosecution of the litigation in more than three years and, thus, pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 561, Plaintiff's suit was abandoned as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 4, 2016, the Honorable Tess Stromberg signed an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   judgment, denying the motion to dismiss. On the judgment, the trial judge included the hand-written language \"Denied. [A]ction taken[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, on November 14, 2016, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel discovery allegedly propounded upon Defendants on June 2, 2016, in connection with Defendants' reconventional demand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a hearing, the trial judge issued a judgment compelling Defendants, who appeared\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   throughout the proceedings, to respond to discovery within thirty days of the January 23, 2017 hearing date. Notice of the written judgment, dated February 9, 2017, was issued on February 15, 2017-seven days prior to the discovery due date. The written February 9, 2017 judgment compelling discovery responses did not articulate the penalty for Defendants' failure to comply with the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 23, 2017, Plaintiff filed a \"Motion to Dismiss for Failure to Comply with Discovery Order,\" which the trial court set for hearing. Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiff's motion to dismiss, challenging Plaintiff's standing to bring suit against Defendants, and a motion for sanctions against Plaintiff's counsel, contending that counsel engaged in\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication with the trial judge concerning Defendants' \"Motion to Dismiss Due to Abandonment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 24, 2017, Defendants filed a motion for extension of time to respond to discovery, which the trial court also set to be heard on the same date as Plaintiff's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants subsequently filed a motion to recuse Judge Stromberg, which she denied on March 23, 2017. However, on the same date, Judge Stromberg issued a separate judgment recusing herself from the litigation to \"eliminate the appearance of partiality.\" The matter was reallotted to the Honorable Jesse LeBlanc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 8, 2017, following a hearing, the trial judge granted Plaintiff's \"Motion to Dismiss for Failure to Comply with Discovery Order,\" dismissing Defendants' reconventional demand, with prejudice, for failure to comply with the court's February 9, 2017 order. In the same judgment, the trial judge denied Defendants'\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for extension of time to respond to\n   the discovery requests and motion for sanctions against Plaintiff's counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 18, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment on its principal demand, attaching various exhibits including a copy of the loan agreement, mortgage, assignment of mortgage, as well as various affidavits attesting that the original note had been lost or destroyed and that Plaintiff had complied with the publication or notice requirements set forth in La. R.S. 13:341.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants have appealed, assigning errors related to the trial court's granting of summary judgment on Plaintiff's principal demand as well as the November 4, 2017 denial of their \"Motion to Dismiss Due to Abandonment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jurisdictional Issue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff argues on appeal that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the trial court's denial of Defendants' \"Motion to Dismiss Due to Abandonment.\" Plaintiff contends that the denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground of abandonment is a final, appealable judgment under La. C.C.P. art. 561(A), which provides that an action is abandoned when the parties fail to take any step in the prosecution or defense in the trial court for a period of three years. The Article further provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    (3)\n   </strong>\n   This provision shall be operative without formal order, but, on ex parte motion of any party or other interested person by affidavit which provides that no step has been timely taken in the prosecution or defense of the action, the trial court shall enter a formal order of dismissal as of the date of its abandonment. The sheriff shall serve the order in the manner provided in Article 1314, and shall execute a return pursuant to Article 1292.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    (4)\n   </strong>\n   A motion to set aside a dismissal may be made only within thirty days of the date of the sheriff's service of the order of dismissal. If the trial court denies a timely motion to set aside the dismissal, the clerk of court shall give notice of the order of denial pursuant to Article 1913(A) and shall file a certificate pursuant to Article 1913(D).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    (5)\n   </strong>\n   An appeal of an order of dismissal may be taken only within sixty days of the date of the sheriff's service of the\n   order of dismissal.\n   <strong>\n    An appeal of an order of denial may be taken only within sixty days of the date of the clerk's mailing of the order of denial.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff urges this Court to find that La. C.C.P. art. 561(A)(5) instructs that the denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground of abandonment is a final, appealable judgment and that Defendants in order to obtain review of the judgment, must have appealed the judgment at the time it was rendered. However, as discussed below, we find that the denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground of abandonment is an interlocutory judgment and, thus, this Court retains jurisdiction to review the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To support its argument that the denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground of abandonment is a final, appealable judgment, Plaintiff points to the isolated language in La. C.C.P. art. 561 (A)(5), which states, \"[a]n appeal of an order of denial may be taken only within sixty days....\" However, the comments to La. C.C.P. art. 561 clearly indicate that the \"order of denial\" referenced in that section is the denial of a motion to set aside a judgment of dismissal, not the denial of a motion to dismiss. The comments to the article specifically provide that, \"[a]n appeal may be taken either following a formal order of dismissal, or following an order\n   <em>\n    denying a timely motion to set aside the dismissal\n   </em>\n   .\"(emphasis added.) The comments to the article clearly reflect the intent of the legislature that the denial of a motion to set aside a judgment of dismissal-which results in the continued termination of the litigation-is a final, appealable judgment. However, the denial of a motion to dismiss, which maintains the suit, is an interlocutory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Louisiana appellate courts have found that the denial of a motion to dismiss on grounds of abandonment is an interlocutory judgment and that, generally, an interlocutory judgment is reviewable in connection with an unrestricted appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bezou v.

The controlling statutory provision in this case is La. C.C.P. art. 561.

On March 5, 2013, Defendants answered the petition and filed a reconventional demand. Plaintiff filed an \"Answer and Affirmative Defenses\" to Defendants' reconventional demand on August 8, 2013. On October 14, 2016, more than three years from Plaintiff's August 8, 2013 Answer, Defendants filed an \"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss Due to Abandonment.\" The trial judge, however, did not grant the motion but, rather, issued an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   judgment denying the motion with the handwritten language, \"action taken\" on the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Our review of the contents of this record as of October 14, 2016, when Defendants filed their motion to dismiss, and further as of November 4, 2016, when Judge Stromberg denied the motion to dismiss, reveals no evidence of action taken at any time between August 8, 2013, and November 4, 2016. Therefore, based upon the record before us, it appears that the trial judge considered evidence not properly before her and not then in the trial court record in rendering her judgment denying the motion to dismiss. Under La. C.C.P. art. 561, the trial judge was required to grant Defendants'\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion to dismiss based upon the record before her and erred in denying the motion. Plaintiff could have subsequently filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, pursuant to the statutory procedure set forth in La. C.C.P. art. 561(4), and requested a contradictory hearing to prove that documents outside of the record demonstrated that the parties took a \"step\" in the prosecution or defense of the litigation sufficient to interrupt the abandonment period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Therefore, for the reasons stated above, we find the trial judge erred in denying Defendants' motion to dismiss on the ground of abandonment. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's November 4, 2017 judgment, grant Defendants' motion to dismiss, and dismiss Plaintiff's petition. Consequently, all judgments rendered subsequent to the November 4, 2017 denial of Defendants' motion to dismiss are hereby vacated and without effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JUDGMENT REVERSED; JUDGMENT RENDERED; PETITION DISMISSED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   CONCURS IN PART AND DISSENTS IN PART WITH REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   CONCURS IN PART AND DISSENTS IN PART FOR THE REASONS ASSIGNED BY JUDGE LILJEBERG\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   LILJEBERG, J., CONCURS IN PART AND DISSENTS IN PART\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   I concur with the majority's finding that the November 4, 2016 denial of defendants' ex parte motion to dismiss on the ground of abandonment was an interlocutory ruling. Defendants' request for review of this ruling as part of their appeal of the November 29, 2017 final judgment is timely and properly before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   I, however, dissent from the majority's decision to reverse the trial court's denial of defendant's ex parte motion to dismiss for abandonment and grant the motion to dismiss the Petition to Enforce Security Interest originally filed by plaintiff, Household Finance Corp. II (\"Household\"). On\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the majority finds that pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 561, the trial judge was required to grant the ex parte motion to dismiss and erred in denying the motion. La. C.C.P. art. 561(A)(3) explains that a trial court shall enter an order of dismissal for abandonment when a party or interested person files an ex parte motion with an affidavit affirming that no timely step has been taken in the prosecution or defense of the action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   This provision shall be operative without formal order, but, on ex parte motion of any party or other interested person\n   <em>\n    by affidavit which provides that no step has been timely taken in the prosecution or defense of the action\n   </em>\n   , the trial court shall enter a formal order of dismissal as of the date of abandonment.

However, this case is distinguishable because defendants subsequently submitted the required affidavits and this Court further noted that the trial court held a contradictory hearing during which the plaintiff had the opportunity to present evidence to establish the matter was not abandoned, which negated the need for reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the present matter, defendants did not submit a corrected affidavit and the trial court did not conduct a contradictory hearing on defendants' ex parte motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court had a deficient\n   affidavit, which did not comply with La. C.C.P. art. 561(3) because it did not affirm for the trial court that no step had \"been timely taken in the prosecution or defense of the action.\" I believe this situation is similar to the\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   cases where defendants failed to submit the required affidavit. Consequently, I believe the trial court did not err by denying defendants' ex parte motion to dismiss for abandonment because the affidavit provided by defendants did not comply with La. C.C.P. art. 561(3) and was not sufficient to support a judgment granting an order of dismissal for abandonment. The trial court was not required to grant the ex parte motion to dismiss and I believe it is not proper for this Court to enter an order of dismissal for abandonment based on defendants' deficient affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   I further disagree with the majority's decision to limit its\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record to filings between August 8, 2013 and November 4, 2016, when the trial court denied defendants' motion to dismiss. A\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the entire subsequently developed record before this Court reveals that it contains a judicial admission by defendants that Household sent discovery requests to them on June 2, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears defendants intentionally crafted the statements contained in their affidavit supporting their ex parte motion to dismiss for abandonment to avoid disclosing the June 2, 2016 discovery requests to the trial court. In fact, the record indicates that at the time defendants filed their ex parte motion, they were engaged in discussions with plaintiff's counsel regarding their failure to respond to the discovery requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In their appellate brief, defendants attempt to imply that the June 2, 2016 discovery requests did not qualify as a step in the prosecution of the matter because they did not pertain to the principal demand and only addressed the reconventional demand filed by defendants on March 5, 2013. As noted above in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court confirmed that a step taken with respect to any principal or incidental demand constitutes a step as to the entire action. Therefore, defendants' implication is unsupported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Furthermore, though they do not raise the issue on appeal, in the underlying proceedings, defendants suggested the discovery requests sent to them by Household should not count as a step because Household assigned their promissory note to U.S. Bank in December 2013, and therefore, Household did not have standing to act a party in the proceedings after that date. I would find this argument to be without merit based on La. C.C.P. art. 807, which permits a party who transfers its interests in the subject matter of the litigation to retain its status as a party until the court provides for the substitution of the party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seale v. Abadie\n   </em>\n   , 99-771 (La. App. 5 Cir 1/12/00),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11485013\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/752/971/\">\n    752 So.2d 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Certainly, if La. C.C.P. art. 807 permitted Household to remain as a party in the proceedings after it transferred its interests in defendants' promissory notes, any actions it took in furtherance of the prosecution\n   or defense of the matter would constitute a step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Therefore, in addition to finding the trial court was not required to grant the ex parte motion to dismiss, I believe that based on defendants' judicial admission, this Court can conclude this matter was never abandoned. Even if defendants submitted a sufficient affidavit to support their ex parte motion to dismiss, I do not believe it is in the interests of justice or judicial economy to limit our review of the record before us, ignore defendants' subsequent judicial admission, and require the parties to relitigate the abandonment issues in this matter, particularly since defendants failed to provide full disclosures to the trial court regarding all steps taken in the proceedings. Based on the foregoing, I believe this Court should proceed with a review of defendants' remaining assignments of error related to the granting of plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   WINDHORST J., CONCURS IN PART AND DISSENTS IN PART FOR THE REASONS ASSIGNED BY JUDGE LILJEBERG\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The record reflects that Household Finance Corp.
