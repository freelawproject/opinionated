Actual notice of the judgment is irrelevant. It is well-settled that actual notice of a judgment does not waive the requirement of service.\n   <em>\n    Nassau Realty Co., Inc. v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9646485\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/332/206/\">\n    332 So.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1976). Furthermore, any such waiver must be an express waiver and not an implied waiver, considering the undisputed fact that under our law, maintaining an appeal is favored.\n   <em>\n    Shell Pipeline Corp. v. Kennedy\n   </em>\n   , 00-3207, p. 4 (La. 10/16/01),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9472524\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/799/475/#p478\">\n    799 So.2d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 478. I would grant this writ and reverse the court of appeal's dismissal of Mr. Loyola's appeal.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
