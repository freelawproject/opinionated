BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-22\">Marilyn Nowicki is a veterinarian who, through her professional corporation known as Marilyn F. Nowicki, DVM, P.A., operated several incorporated animal clinics in Broward County, Florida. Douglas Verhougstraete was her long-time companion and was involved in her business, where he handled certain administrative and financial matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-23\">Their personal relationship eventually ended, apparently not amicably. Verhoug-straete informed the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) that Nowicki\u2019s professional corporation had paid some of her personal living expenses, which it deducted as business expenses but which she did not report as income. During the course of the IRS investigation Nowicki produced cancelled corporate checks and bank statements, among other records. At the IRS\u2019 request, Verhougstraete reviewed the checks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>to assist in differentiating between business and personal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">Based upon its investigation, the IRS determined that Nowicki realized additional taxable income for the 1992 through 1994 taxable years in the form of constructive dividends from her professional corporation and that she was liable for accuracy-related additions to tax. Nowicki petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiencies, and on November 1, 2000, filed a motion in that court to suppress all evidence obtained in violation of Internal Revenue Code (\u201cI.R.C.\u201d) \u00a7 6103, arguing that by asking Verhougstraete to review the checks from her professional corporation, the IRS had improperly disclosed her tax return information and thereby \u201ccontaminated the evidence supporting the notice of deficiency ... and rendered it inadmissable as evidence against her.\u201d She also filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing on her motion to suppress; the tax court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">Instead of proceeding to trial, Nowicki settled her case after the IRS conceded a portion of the asserted deficiencies. However, the stipulated decision filed in the tax court preserved her right to appeal the denial of her motion to suppress and her motion for an evidentiary hearing. She now appeals, arguing that the disclosure of her return information violated \u00a7 6103 and that any evidence obtained as a result of that violation must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">Section 6103<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires that tax returns and return information be kept confidential and not be disclosed by a federal officer or employee, with certain exceptions. The government argues that any disclosure to Verhougstraete was permitted pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6103(k)(6) because the disclosure was \u201cnecessary in obtaining information, which [was] not otherwise reasonably available, with respect to the correct determination of tax [or] liability for tax.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(k)(6); <em>see also </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6103(k)(6)-l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-13\">Nowicki contends that the exception provided for in \u00a7 6103(k)(6) is not applicable. Although the government claims that information regarding the nature of the expenses paid by Nowicki\u2019s professional corporation was \u201cnot otherwise reasonably available\u201d because she disclaimed any knowledge of the nature of the expenses, she adamantly denies that suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-14\">Even assuming for the sake of argument that the \u00a7 6103(k)(6) exception is not applicable, imposition of the exclusionary rule is not warranted for a disclosure of return information which violates \u00a7 6103. Congress has specifically provided civil (I.R.C. \u00a7 7431) as well as criminal penalties (I.R.C. \u00a7 7213) for violations of \u00a7 6103. There is no statutory provision requiring exclusion of evidence obtained in violation of \u00a7 6103 and we will not invent one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-15\">In <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>936 F.2d 1249, 1250 (11th Cir.1991), we considered a criminal defendant\u2019s contention that evidence should have been suppressed in his trial on various drug charges because of a violation of the statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121 <em>et </em>seq.) allowing for use of a \u201cpen register.\u201d We looked for guidance to several cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>addressing other statutes which held that statutory violations by themselves were not sufficient to warrant imposition of the exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Thompson, </em>936 F.2d at 1251. Assuming without deciding that \u00a7 3121 had been violated, we reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab2\">Clearly Congress intended to place limits on the Government\u2019s ability to monitor the private activities of individuals when it passed this statute. Congress did not, however, suggest that any information obtained in violation of the statute\u2019s provisions should be excluded. Instead the statute provides only for fines and possible imprisonment for knowing violations. When Congress specifically designates a remedy for one of its acts, courts generally presume that it engaged in the necessary balancing of interests in determining what the appropriate penalty should be. Absent a specific reference to an exclusionary rule, it is not appropriate for the courts to read such a provision into the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1251-52 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">We find that reasoning persuasive and equally applicable here. Congress saw fit to provide only certain remedies for violations of \u00a7 6103, and the exclusionary rule was not one of them. Even assuming that the disclosure to Verhougstraete violated \u00a7 6103, suppression of any evidence resulting from that violation is not an appropriate remedy. <em>See United States v. Michaelian, </em>803 F.2d 1042, 1049-50 (9th Cir.1986) (because Congress specifically provided for criminal penalties for \u00a7 6103 violations, suppression of evidence was not an appropriate remedy); <em>Marvin v. United States, </em>732 F.2d 669, 673 (8th Cir.1984) (same, but also noting that Congress provided civil penalties for \u00a7 6103 violations).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">.
