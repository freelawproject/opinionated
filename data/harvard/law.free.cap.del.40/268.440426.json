The secondary meaning by Webster is \u201cclear or manifest to the understanding\u201d; \u201cplain\u201d; \u201cevident\u201d; \u201cobvious\u201d; \"known\u201d; \u201cpalpable\u201d; \u201cindubitable.\u201d The word \u201cindubitable,\u201d as defined by Webster, means \u201ccertain,\u201d \u201cunquestionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">(c) Black defines the word \u201capparent\u201d to be that which is \u201cobvious,\u201d or \u201cmanifest\u201d; \u201cwhat appears or has been made manifest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">Under Winston, Webster, and Black, the word \u201cap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>parent\u201d has the same primary meaning. Webster, however, defines \u201capparent\u201d as having a secondary meaning of \u201cindubitable,\u201d and \u201cindubitable\u201d Webster defines as meaning \u201ccertain\u201d or \u201cunquestionable,\u201d which I accept as being synonymous to the word \u201csure.\u201d If the word \u201cindubitable\u201d were eliminated from Webster\u2019s definition of the word \u201capparent,\u201d I would have no difficulty in definitely holding that the word \u201capparent\u201d did not have a dual meaning. However, I can understand the difficulty that Courts of other jurisdictions have had in dealing with the proper application of the word \u201capparent\u201d when the fact has been argued before them that the word has a dual meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">It is fundamentally sound to conclude that when the Legislature, by an act of amendment, adds to or detracts from a statute, that such addition or detraction is for the purpose of either clarifying, altering or changing the meaning thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In determining Legislative intent, we start with <em>Chapter </em>10, <em>Volume </em>36, <em>Laws </em>of <em>Delaware, </em>wherein the Legislature enacted an act entitled \u201cAn Act concerning Motor Vehicles and making Uniform the Law relating Thereto.\u201d Under <em>Paragraph (b) </em>of <em>Section </em>107 of that act, the following appears:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u201cThe driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in damage to property shall immediately stop such vehicle at the scene of such accident and any person violating this provision shall upon conviction be punished as provided in <em>Section </em>144 of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In the above act it is logical to conclude that the word \u201cdamage\u201d as used in its unqualified sense could only mean \u201ccertain,\u201d \u201csure,\u201d \u201creal,\u201d or \u201cactual\u201d damage. It was not material as to whether or not the damage should be obvious, visible to the eye, evident, plain, open to view, or capable of being seen. Therefore, I, of necessity, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>conclude that the word \u201cdamage,\u201d as used in the above act, means \u201ccertain,\u201d \u201csure,\u201d \u201creal,\u201d or \u201cactual\u201d damage.</p>\n<p id=\"ASv\">The Legislature, however, under <em>Chapter </em>38, <em>Volume </em>40, <em>Laws </em>of <em>Delaware, </em>obviously concluded that the duty of the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in damage to property should be qualified, and consequently they amended <em>Chapter </em>10, <em>Volume </em>36, <em>Laws </em>of <em>Delaware </em>by the enactment of <em>Chapter </em>38, <em>Volume </em>40, <em>Laws </em>of <em>Delaware </em>as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u201cThe driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in apparent damage to property shall immediately stop such vehicle at the scene of such accident and any such person violating this provision shall upon conviction be punished as provided in <em>Section </em>144 of this <em>Act.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Did the Legislature, by amending <em>Paragraph (b) </em>of <em>Section </em>107, aforesaid, by inserting after the word \u201cin\u201d and before the word \u201cdamage,\u201d the word \u201capparent,\u201d attempt to clarify, add to, or detract from the duty of the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident resulting in damage to property?</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">I cannot conceive that anyone could say with any degree of sound logic that the word \u201capparent\u201d was inserted by way of an amendment to <em>Paragraph (b) </em>of <em>Section </em>107, for the purpose of clarifying the word \u201cdamage\u201d as used in said paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Likewise I cannot with any degree of reason conclude that the word \u201capparent\u201d would add to the duty imposed upon the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in damage to property.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">It would be illogical to reason that the word \u201capparent\u201d as used in the amended act means \u201csure,\u201d \u201ccertain,\u201d \u201creal,\u201d or \u201cactual\u201d as the addition of the word \u201capparent\u201d in this sense would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Under <em>Section </em>1 of <em>Chapter </em>1 of the <em>Revised Code </em>of 1935, dealing with the rules and constructions of statutes, the following appears:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">(a) \u201cAll words and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of our language; but technical words and phrases, and such others as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law, shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">It is my opinion that the common and approved usage of the word \u201capparent\u201d is as defined primarily by Winston, Webster,' and Black and meaning \u201copen to view\u201d; \u201ccapable of being easily understood\u201d; \u201cevident\u201d; \u201cseeming,\u201d rather than true or real; \u201ccapable of being seen\u201d; \u201ceasily seen\u201d; \u201cvisible to the eye\u201d; \u201cwithin sight or view\u201d; \u201cobvious\u201d; \u201cmanifest\u201d; \u201cwhat appears or has been made manifest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Therefore, my conclusion necessarily follows that the Legislature intended by its amendment, in inserting the word \u201capparent\u201d after the word \u201cin\u201d and before the word \u201cdamage,\u201d to qualify the duty of the driver aforesaid, wherein and whereby he would only be liable in the event the damage was apparent in the sense of being \u201copen to view\u201d; \u201ccapable of being easily understood\u201d; \u201cevident\u201d; \u201cseeming,\u201d rather than true or real; \u201ccapable of being seen\u201d; \u201ceasily seen\u201d; \u201cvisible to the eye\u201d; \u201cwithin sight or view\u201d; \u201cmanifest\u201d; \u201cobvious\u201d; \u201cwhat appears or has been made manifest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\"><em>Paragraph </em>(&amp;) of <em>Section </em>107, <em>Chapter </em>38, <em>Volume </em>40, <em>Laws </em>of <em>Delaware, </em>in my opinion is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">The judgment below is hereby sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\"><em>Procedendo </em>is hereby ordered issued.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
