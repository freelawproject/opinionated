J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOfY\">This is an appeal by the People from an order dismissing the action. The defendant was prosecuted under section 973 of the Labor Code, the complaint charging that he \u201cdid wilfully and unlawfully while a strike, lockout, or other trade dispute was in active progress at his establishment located at 350 South Thomas Street, in the City of Pomona, County of Los Angeles, State of California, insert an advertisement in the Los Angeles Examiner, a newspaper published in the said County of Los Angeles, soliciting persons to work for him, the said Lee Smith, and failed to state plainly and explicitly in the said advertisement that a strike, lockout, or other trade dispute was in active progress at his said establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The docket of the trial court shows the following matters affecting the dismissal. The trial proceeded before the court without a jury, and evidence was introduced in behalf of the People. Then we find this entry in the docket: \u201cMotion of defendant\u2019s counsel Stanford Shaw for dismissal on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the statutes of which the defendant is charged as being indefinite and uncertain. Ruling reserved on motion.\u201d Then another witness was sworn for the People, following which is the further docket entry: \u201cAction dismissed by order of the Court in the furtherance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 779\">*Supp. 779</page-number>justice, it appearing to the Court that Section 973 of the Labor Code, under which the defendant is charged, is indefinite, and uncertain.\u201d Following this is a discussion of the rule requiring certainty in a penal statute, winding up with this statement: \u20181 The statute is so indefinite as to leave within the mind of the trial court the question as to what shall constitute the prohibited acts. The person to be charged has the right to know exactly what particular acts are prohibited. For the reasons stated it is ordered that the action be dismissed in furtherance of justice. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Although this entry reads like an opinion of the trial judge, we may consider it, for section 1385 of the Penal Code, which authorizes a dismissal \u201cin furtherance of justice\u201d requires that the reason therefor be set forth in an order \u201centered upon the minutes,\u201d and the docket of the trial court here is to be regarded as its minutes. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1428, as amended in 1953.) All such minute entries are required to be sent up as a part of the record on appeal by rule 3 of \u201cRules on Appeal from Municipal Courts and Inferior Courts in Criminal Cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The efficacy of the People\u2019s appeal from the order is not impaired by the fact that before it was made the trial had proceeded to the extent that evidence had been introduced against defendant. Section 1466, Penal Code, as amended in 1951, authorizes the People to appeal from a judgment of dismissal made before the defendant has been placed in jeopardy, \u201cor where the defendant has waived jeopardy.\u201d Assuming that the defendant was placed in jeopardy by the proceedings occurring before his motion to dismiss, he waived that jeopardy by making such motion. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Finch </em>(1953), 119 Cal.App.2d 892, 899 [258 P.2d 1124], a case substantially the same on its facts as that now here, was presented to this court, and we held that by making the motion to dismiss, the defendant waived jeopardy and the People\u2019s appeal was effective. We see no reason to depart from that decision, and refer to it for a full discussion of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Considering now the grounds on which the dismissal was made, we find that they amount to no more and no less than this: \u201cthat the facts stated do not constitute a public offense\u201d; a conclusion which must follow if the statute purporting to create an offense from those facts is invalid. This is one of the grounds of demurrer specified in section 1004, Penal Code, which is made applicable to municipal courts by section 690, Penal Code. Section 1385, Penal Code, as amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 780\">*Supp. 780</page-number>ed in 1951, which is the only authorization for the court to dismiss an action \u201cin furtherance of justice,\u2019\u2019 specifically provides that \u201cNo dismissal shall be made for any cause which would be ground of demurrer to the accusatory pleading.\u201d The court, therefore, exceeded its authority in making the dismissal for the reason stated, and the order must be reversed, even if no other cause for reversal appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">We conclude, further, that the trial court was in error in holding section 973 of the Labor Code invalid, and for that reason also, a reversal is necessary. Section 973, so far as material here, provides: \u201cIf any person advertises for, or seeks employees by means of newspapers, posters, letters, or otherwise, or solicits or communicates by letter or otherwise, with persons to work for him or the person for whom he is acting, or to work at any shop, plant', or establishment while a strike, lockout, or other trade dispute is still in active progress at such shop, plant, or establishment, he shall plainly and explicitly mention in such advertisement or oral or written solicitations or communications that a strike, lockout, or other labor disturbance exists.\u201d Section 974 makes a violation of section 973 a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">In support of the judgment, it is urged here that the terms \u201ctrade dispute\u201d and \u201clabor disturbance\u201d are not defined in the Labor Code, and that they are too indefinite and uncertain for use in a penal statute, and it is therefore void, so far as they are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The memorandum of the trial court seems to suggest that the terms \u201cstrike\u201d and \u201clockout\u201d are also in need of definition, but we see no ground for such a claim. These words are of such common use and their meaning, when applied to the subject of labor relations, with which this statute deals, is so plain, that their use in the statute cannot be held to introduce any uncertainty into it. For definition of the words, see 54 Corpus Juris Secundum 665 (lockout) and 83 Corpus Juris Secundum 525-526 (strike). However, since the complaint here uses the terms \u201cstrike, lockout or other trade dispute\u201d in the alternative so that proof of any one of them might support the charge, we must consider the validity of the statute separately as to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The rule regarding uncertainty of a statute is thus stated in <em>Lockheed Aircraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1946), 28 Cal.2d 481, 484 [171 P.2d 21, 166 A.L.R. 701], where it was held that the words \u201cpolitics\u201d and' \u201cpolitical\u201d are not too uncertain for use in a statute: \u201cThe first contention made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 781\">*Supp. 781</page-number>defendant is that section 1101 is so uncertain and ambiguous that it is unconstitutional. All presumptions and intendments favor the validity of a statute and mere doubt does not afford sufficient reason for a judicial declaration of invalidity. Statutes must be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively and unmistakably appears. <em>(Collins </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>24 Cal.2d 912, 915 [152 P.2d 169] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>10 Cal.2d 288, 298 [73 P.2d 1221]. See also <em>Jersey Maid Milk Products Co. </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>13 Cal.2d 620, 636 [91 P.2d 577], and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">\u201cA statute should be sufficiently certain so that a person may know what is prohibited thereby and what may be done without violating its provisions, but it cannot be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical construction can be given to its language. As stated in <em>Pacific Coast Dairy </em>v. <em>Police Court, </em>214 Cal. 668, at page 676 [8 P.2d 140, 80 A.L.R. 1217], \u2018Mere difficulty in ascertaining its meaning, or the fact that it is susceptible of different interpretations will not render it nugatory. Doubts as to its construction will not justify us in disregarding it.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Peterson </em>(1955), 131 Cal.App.2d 241, 246 [280 P.2d 522], the court expressed like views, and added: \u201cThe requirement of reasonable certainty does not preclude the use of ordinary terms to express ideas which find adequate interpretation in common usage and understanding.\u201d In <em>Smulson </em>v. <em>Board of Dental Examiners </em>(1941), 47 Cal.App.2d 584, 587 [118 P.2d 483], the court said: \u201cIt is not required that even a penal statute, to be valid, have that degree of exactness which inheres in a mathematical theorem.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1939), 36 Cal.App.2d Supp. 748, 752 [92 P.2d 1039], this court said: \u201cTo make a statute sufficiently certain to comply with constitutional requirements it is not necessary that it furnish detailed plans and specifications of the acts or conduct prohibited.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ring </em>(1937), 26 Cal.App.2d Supp. 768, 772 [70 P.2d 281], this court said: \u201cWords used in creating a statutory crime do not fail of such certainty merely because the offense, when viewed through them, may not have all the precision in outline of a geometrical figure; if the main and central part of the field of view is clear, some slight lack of definition around its outer edges is not fatal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Section 973 provides in substance that one who advertises for employees \u201cwhile a strike, lockout or other trade dispute is in active progress\u201d at his shop shall mention in his advertisement the fact that \u201ca strike, lockout or other labor dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 782\">*Supp. 782</page-number>turbance exists. \u201d  It is no doubt true that the terms \u201ctrade dispute\u201d and \u201clabor disturbance\u201d if considered by themselves, without context, might have different significations. But here they appear in the same sentence, and in such context that it seems the same sort of situation must be intended by both of them. The Legislature was trying to protect workers against the form of misrepresentation of which there had been much complaint in the past, in which employers who had labor troubles sought employees without notifying those approached that such labor troubles existed. With such object in view, it seems unreasonable to suppose that the labor troubles whose existence requires an employer to make a public statement in his advertisement would be in anywise different from those which he was required to state. We think they are not. Bach of these terms, when so used, throws some light on the meaning of the other. Moreover, each of these phrases is of general import and they are accompanied by more specific words.  Hence the rule of <em>ejusdem, generis </em>is applicable here, and this being a criminal statute, it is to be applied with stringency. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1945), 25 Cal.2d 880, 899 [156 P.2d 7].)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">With these matters in mind, we see at once that the two phrases in question apply only to matters affecting the relations between employers and those who work or might work for them. This eliminates the possibility, discussed in argument, that the phrase \u201ctrade dispute\u201d might refer to disputes between tradesmen as to customers and other matters. See <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>California Emp. Stab. Com. </em>(1949), 34 Cal.2d 239, 242 [209 P.2d 602], where the court used the term \u201clabor dispute\u201d as if it were synonymous with \u201ctrade dispute\u201d in the statue next to be cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The term \u201ctrade dispute\u201d is not new in our law. In 1935 our Legislature passed the Unemployment Insurance Act (Stats. 1935, p. 1226) which contained a section 56 providing that an employee is not eligible for unemployment benefits \u201cif he left his employment because of a trade dispute . . . in the establishment in which he was employed.\u201d (Stats. 1935, p. 1238.) This provision is now in section 1262 of the Unemployment Insurance Code, in substantially the same form. The scope and meaning of the term \u201ctrade dispute\u201d in this statute have been frequently before the courts, and while no decision has formulated a definition of it, the courts have apparently had no difficulty in ascertaining whether a particular situation was or was not within its meaning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 783\">*Supp. 783</page-number>nor have any of the decisions suggested that there was any uncertainty about it. See the following eases in which this matter was discussed: <em>Bodinson Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>California Emp. Com. </em>(1941), 17 Cal.2d 321, 324 [109 P.2d 935] ; <em>Matson Terminals, Inc. </em>v. <em>California Emp. Com. </em>(1944), 24 Cal.2d 695, 702 [151 P.2d 202]; <em>American-Hawaiian Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>California Emp. Com. </em>(1944), 24 Cal.2d 716, 719 [151 P.2d 213] ; W. <em>R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>California Emp. Com. </em>(1944), 24 Cal.2d 720, 727 [151 P.2d 215] ; <em>Bunny\u2019s Waffle Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>California Emp. Com. </em>(1944), 24 Cal.2d 735, 740-741 [151 P.2d 224] ; <em>Mark Hopkins, Inc. </em>v. <em>California Emp. Com. </em>(1944), 24 Cal.2d 744, 748 [151 P.2d 229, 154 A.L.R. <em>1081]; McKinley </em>v. <em>California Emp. Stab. Com., supra </em>(1949), 34 Cal.2d 239, 242; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>California Emp. Stab. Com. </em>(1952), 39 Cal.2d 501, 505 [247 P.2d 561].) In all of these cases the term \u201ctrade dispute\" has been regarded as relating to the relations between employers and those who did or might work for them. It extends to contentions between employers and unions, even though no members of the union are then working for such employers. Prom the decisions in these eases, a sufficiently accurate meaning for the term may be found to justify its use in a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">We note that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Libbey </em>(1914), 216 Mass. 356 [103 N.E. 923, Ann.Cas. 1915B 695, 49 L.R.A.N.S. 879], a statute requiring that an employer advertising for employees during a strike or labor disturbance shall advertise the fact that \u201ca strike, lockout, or other labor disturbance exists\" was held valid against several attacks made on it. It does not appear that the particular objection of uncertainty was made, so the case is not direct authority here; but at least the decision contains no suggestion of a doubt on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">We are not considering the question whether the use in the complaint of the words \u201ctrade dispute\" where the statute uses the words \u201clabor disturbance\" would impair the efficacy of the complaint to charge an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed, and the trial court is directed to retry the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Patrosso, J., and Swain, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
