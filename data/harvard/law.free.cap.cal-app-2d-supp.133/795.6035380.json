(We are inclined to the view that the plaintiff had a right to look ahead and take action by way of preparation.)  Findings were not requested, however, and assuming, as we should <em>(Estate of Rule </em>(1944), 25 Cal.2d 1, 10 [152 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 796\">*Supp. 796</page-number>P.2d 1003, 155 A.L.R. 1319]), that the trial court reached every conclusion, essential to the judgment, that is supported by the evidence, we find a basis for the judgment other than plaintiff\u2019s preparations to be defendant\u2019s rival.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The plaintiff sought judgment for a month\u2019s wages (etc.) that he had been prevented from earning, although he alleged himself to be ready, willing and able to do so. \u201cThe case was tried on the theory,\u201d we read in the settled statement on appeal, \u201cthat the pleadings establish a prima facie case entitling plaintiff ... to recover.\u201d The issues to be tried, on this theory, must have been the defenses. We find it alleged in the answer that the contract of employment \u201cprovided, among other things, that plaintiff would devote his entire time and energy to the furtherance of the business of defendant ...\u201d Strangely enough, this was not followed by an allegation that the plaintiff had not devoted his entire time and energy to defendant\u2019s business, but evidence .was received, apparently without objection, that for a period of three months prior to his discharge the plaintiff had been absent from his duties on many occasions, the defendant not knowing his whereabouts nor how to get in touch with him. The plaintiff offered (and should have been permitted) to prove that he was never absent because of his preparations to go into his own business, but he neither disproved nor attempted to deny that he had frequently been absent from his duties, nor did he offer any explanation of his absences (and the error noted was not prejudicial). We have here a ground for discharging plaintiff that is both tenable and comes within the reason given him, \u201cthat he was engaging in activities which interfered with [his] ability to work and perform his services for [the defendant].\u201d True, this ground is not clearly set forth in defendant\u2019s answer as a reason for his discharge, yet the foundation was laid for it, as we have noted, and it is not a material variance, as defined in section 469, Code of Civil Procedure. (See <em>Genger </em>v. <em>Albers </em>(1949), 90 Cal.App.2d 52, 55 [202 P.2d 569].)  Moreover, not having been raised at the trial, any possible claim of variance has been waived. <em>(Colbert </em>v. <em>Colbert </em>(1946), 28 Cal.2d 276, 281 [169 P.2d 633].)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Shaw, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b820-9\">SWAIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQCc\">I dissent. The majority opinion affirms the judgment on the ground that plaintiff was absent from work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 797\">*Supp. 797</page-number>at unspecified times in September, October and November, 1953, without explanation, and that this supports an implied finding that he was discharged for that reason. The record does show (Settled Statement, pp. 1, 2, 20 et seq.) that during September, October and November, 1953, appellant was absent from his duties on many occasions without explaining his absence. However, it does not show that this was a cause of his discharge. The answer alleges only two grounds for the discharge, (1) \u201cthat plaintiff was negotiating for the purchase and, in fact, completed the purchase of a plumbing business, which business was in competition with defendant\u2019s business\u201d (Par. II of Second Defense), and (2) that plaintiff \u201csecured information of a confidential nature belonging to defendant for the purpose of using said information when plaintiff was engaged in the operation of his own business\u201d (Par. V of Second Defense). Nowhere does the answer allege that plaintiff was discharged because of unexplained absences in September, October and November. Furthermore, the evidence does show the true cause of discharge, viz. (Settled Statement, pp. 1, 3, 16 et seq.), that defendant learned on November 27, 1953, of plaintiff\u2019s contemplated purchase of the competing business and \u201c. . . on the 28th day of November, 1953, respondent notified appellant that his services were no longer needed or desired because of the fact that he was engaging in activities which interfered with appellant\u2019s ability to work and perform his services for respondent.\u201d Those activities were, obviously, the ones just discovered; absence is not an activity. There is no evidence to support the alleged second ground of defense that plaintiff was discharged because he had secured confidential information. There is evidence (Settled Statement, pp. 1, 2, 27 et seq.) that -\u201cappellant moved from respondents\u2019 place of business a large brief case, the contents of which were not disclosed to respondents\u201d but there is no evidence that the suitcase contained confidential information. The court\u2019s error, in holding that mere negotiations for purchasing the competing business was ground for discharge, was prejudicial. I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
