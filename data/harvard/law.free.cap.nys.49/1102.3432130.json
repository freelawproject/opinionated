It will be remembered that this request was read in hearing of the jury, after the court had made its charge on the subject in question, as last above quoted. So it is reasonable to suppose that when the court said, \u201cSo charged, except the word \u2018solely,\u2019 \u201d the attention of the jury was brought particularly to this part of the request to charge, and that the preceding instruction of the court on this subject may have become somewhat modified in the minds of the jury. However, immediately afterwards, the court, on defendant\u2019s request, charged that \u201cif the jury believe that the injury to the plaintiff was caused by his own carelessness, or that it was the result of a pure accident, then, in either event, the jury must render a verdict for the defendant.\u201d This question, therefore, presents itself, viz.: Does not this instruction, taken with the previous instruction in the body of the charge on the subject in question, cure whatever prejudice may be said to have been caused by the court\u2019s striking out the word \u201csolely\u201d from the request? There was no question of the negligence of any third party presented either by the pleadings or by the evidence, and the court particularly stated, after the refusal aforesaid, that if plaintiff\u2019s carelessness or negligence contributed to the accident, or if the injury was the\u2019 result of a pure accident, the verdict must be for the defendant. What, therefore, could the jury have understood, except that, to entitle plaintiff to recover, the defendant\u2019s negligence must have been the proximate and only cause of the injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">We are of the opinion that, although it would have been more correct had the trial judge charged in the exact language requested, it must be said that the alleged error under consideration does not warrant a reversal of the judgment. In the instructions given to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>jury upon the question of negligence, both before and after the taking of the exception under consideration, the learned trial judge laid down the law clearly, fully, and \u00e1ccurately. It is a well-settled principle that where the court has charged fully and completely, in its own way, every element of the request, it is not bound to repeat, parrot-like, the words of counsel, or reiterate in other forms the clear and pointed instructions already given. Laidlaw v. Sage, 2 App. Div. 378, 37 N. Y. Supp. 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">The other alleged error, assigned as ground for reversal, is the refusal of the court to charge that there was no evidence \"from which the jury may find damages for loss of occupation or business. To this refusal the defendant duly excepted. If, therefore, we find no evidence of a pecuniary loss to the plaintiff, caused by his inability to perform his usual work, the exception was well taken. The plaintiff testified that it was three weeks before he wa,s able to go upon his wagon, and that he could not do the other work belonging to his calling, by reason of his injuries; that he could not carry trunks, which it was his business to do, and which he was able to do, without the assistance of another man, before his injuries; that he made efforts t\u00f3 do business, but could not'do it, because he was not able to; that he had not been able, and at the time of the trial could not, raise his arm to his head without the assistance of the other hand; that at the time of the accident he was earning $35 a week. It must be said that, although this testimony does not indicate any exact sum the plaintiff sustained by way of special damage arising from the loss of occupation, there is some evidence from which the jury might infer substantial damage of that character. In Orsor v. Railway Co., 78 Hun, 169, 28 N. Y. Supp. 966, cited by appellant in support of his contention, it was held error to permit the jury to consider damage arising from loss of earnings, for the reason that it was evident from the testimony that plaintiff did not know what his earnings were. In the case at bar we have the plaintiff\u2019s earnings before the injury, and evidence of the extent of his disability thereafter. We think there was sufficient evidence to sustain a substantial award for pecuniary loss. We therefore see it was not error for the court to refuse to charge that there was no evidence from which the jury might find damages for loss of occupation or business. In charging the jury on the question of damage the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcGm\">\u201cShould you find for the plaintiff, under the rules of law I have laid down, you have a right to allow him a fair compensation for the inj uries occasioned to him through the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants, for the pain and suffering he underwent, and the loss he sustained, and no more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">This instruction was correct. It fully protected the defendant\u2019s rights, and was all on the subject that the defendant was entitled to have. There are no other exceptions in the case of sufficient importance to call for discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-7\">For the reasons above given the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
