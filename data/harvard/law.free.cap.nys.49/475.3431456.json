The jury found a verdict for the full amount claimed against the defendant corporation, and in favor of the defendant Palmer; and from an order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial as to the defendant Palmer, and the portion of the judgment in favor of said defendant, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">Plaintiff leased to the National Wrought-Steel Manufacturing Company and William W. Palmer, president, the parlor floor of No. 10 East Forty-Second street, New York City, for 1 year and 10 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-16\">' The lease was in writing, and was signed and sealed by the defendants. The defendant corporation admitted all the allegations of the complaint concerning the lease, and judgment was recovered' against it. The defendant Palmer, however, set up the defense that the lease was executed by him on behalf of the defendant corporation, and hence he was not individually liable. It will be noticed that the lease in question is a solemn instrument under seal. There are three signatures and three seals, and Charles M. Heymann subscribes as a witness for William W. Palmer. The body of the instrument recites that it is \u201cbetween Jeanne E. Soule, as landlord, party of the first part, and the National Wrought-Steel Manufacturing Company and William W. Palmer, president, as tenant, parties of the second part,\u201d and \u201cthat the said party of the first part hath letten, and by these presents doth grant, demise, and to farm let, unto the said parties of the second part, the parlor floor,\u201d etc., and \u201cthe said parties of the second part hereby covenant to pay to the said party of the first part the yearly rent as herein specified,\u201d etc., together with many other covenants whereby the parties of the second part bound themselves. The execution of the instrument was proven, and the defendant Palmer admits that he \u201clooked at the body of it, stating the terms and the rent,\u201d and signed it. His contention upon the trial was that, under the lease so made, only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>company was bound; and the learned trial justice left the intention of the parties to the jury, over, the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">It is well settled that parol evidence will not be admitted or permitted to vary the contents of a sealed instrument. Here, indeed, no such evidence was directly introduced, but evidence was introduced tending to show the original intention of the parties. Where a, person signs and seals an instrument, no inquiry into (the question of his intent will be permitted upon an action to enforce the covenants contained in the instrument. The court must construe the instrument as it finds it. Dwight v. Insurance Co., 103 N. Y. 352, 8 N. E. 654. The defendants come into court, and admit that the lease is valid and binding against the defendant corporation, .but seek, by a mere question of preliminary intention, to eliminate from the whole instrument all \u00abmention of the defendant Palmer, and of the \u201cparties\u201d of the second part, and in fact to change its whole tenor. Taking the instrument as it stands on the record, we find that it is made to two parties of the second part,\u2014the defendant corporation, and \u201cWilliam W. Palmer, president.\u201d All the plaintiff\u2019s contentions in regard to the defendant corporation having been sustained, the instrument is now to be viewed as though the sole issue was between the plaintiff and \u201cWilliam W. Palmer, president.\u201d The defendant Palmer contends, however, that the word \u201cpresident\u201d relieves him of personal liability. But it is dear that this addition to his name is only descriptive, and has no effect in limiting or discharging his liability upon the covenants in the lease. Such words are mere words of description, and the makers of the instruments are liable personally. Taft v. Brewster, 9 Johns. 334; Orchard v. Binninger, 51 N. Y. 652; Hills v. Bannister, 8 Cow. 31; White v. Skinner, 13 Johns. 310; Stone v. Wood, 7 Cow. 454; Moss v. Livingston, 4 N. Y. 210; De Witt v. Walton, 9 N. Y. 571; Bank v. Clark, 139 N. Y. 310, 34 N. E. 908; Institution v. Bitter, 87 N. Y. 250-255. The form of lease made him the lessee, and he is liable upon the covenants therein contained. It was not necessary even that he should sign and seal it. It appears from his own testimony that he occupied the leased premises from July, 1896, to the time this action was begun, and this lease was the only terms upon which the defendants ever entered the premises. \u201cBy accepting the deed and taking possession of the land conveyed, the grantee became bound to perform the obligations specified in the deed, and which became attached to the grant.\u201d Post v. Railroad Co., 50 Hun, 303, 3 N. Y. Supp. 172; Belmont v. Coman, 22 N. Y. 438; Dock Co. v. Leavitt, 54 N. Y. 41. Nor can it be said that the words \u201cWilliam W. Palmer, President,\u201d are a part of the signature of the National Wrought-Steel Manufacturing Company. The signature \u201cWilliam W. Palmer, President,\u201d moreover, exactly agrees with the wording in the body of the lease. Nothing more than the company\u2019s bare name was requisite to constitute its signature. \u201cSo the statute of frauds, requiring certain agreements in writing, and to be signed by the party to be charged therewith, is satisfied by the signature or subscription of the name of such party thereto by another person authorized to make it.\u201d Barnard v. Heydrick, 49 Barb. 66. The statement of the defendant that he did not read the contract, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>inform himself of the contract, cannot be considered. He had full opportunity to do so, and must take the consequences if he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The order and the portion of the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">VAN WYCK, C. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
