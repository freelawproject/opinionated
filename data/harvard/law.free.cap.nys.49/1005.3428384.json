The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>plaintiff was a designer and a manufacturer of children\u2019s reefers, and the defendants were manufacturers and dealers therein. An agreement was entered into in writing between the parties for the service of the plaintiff at a fixed compensation, which he alleges was after-wards terminated by a further agreement to pay him compensation \u2022at the rate of $40 per week for 14 weeks, and a further sum of $287.77, alleged to be due him under the agreement first named, as a settlement upon the termination thereof. The first agreement is admitted by the defendants, but the subsequent arrangement for its termination, as well as the balance claimed to be due, was denied. The whole case went to the jury upon disputed questions of fact, and there was no exception to the charge of the trial judge, nor do we find a single exception in the record taken by the defendant during the progress of the trial, except to the refusal of the court to dismiss the complaint on the defendants\u2019 motion at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and the record as made does not appear to present to this court any single exception for review on appeal. The whole case was fairly presented to the jury upon all the evidence, and there was a determination in the plaintiff\u2019s favor for the full amount claimed. We think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
