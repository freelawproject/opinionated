The defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground that there is a defect of parties defendant, and that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The defect of parties defendant, if defect there be, as stated in the demurrer, does not appear on the face of the complaint, and therefore cannot be taken advantage of by demurrer. The allegation in the complaint to which the demurrer is directed is that marked \u201cSeventh,\u201d which reads as follows: \u201cThat the defendants, during all the times when the debts herein alleged were contracted, were directors of said Ladies\u2019 Deborah Nursery and Child\u2019s Protectory.\u201d The defendants demur, stating this ground for their demurrer: \u201cThat it appears upon the face of the complaint that there is a defect of parties defendant in the omission of all'the other persons besides the defendants who were directors of the Ladies\u2019 Deborah Nursery and Child\u2019s Protectory during the times mentioned in said complaint.\u201d It is clear, from mere inspection of the \u25a0complaint, that no such defect appears upon the face thereof. The complaint simply states- that the defendants \u201cwere directors,\u201d and \u25a0does not state whether they were or were not all directors during said time. A demurrer upon such ground is bad, unless it appears affirmatively in the complaint that some person or persons who should have been made defendants were omitted. The court will take judicial notice of the statute (Laws 1895, c. 559, \u00a7 11), and under it the directors are jointly and severally liable, and the plaintiff may sue one, any, or. ail. ' Strong v. Sproul, 4 Daly, 326; Halstead v. Dodge, 51 N. Y. Super. Ct. 169, 170; Manufacturing Co. v. Schwind, 25 N. Y. Supp. 808, 5 Misc. Rep. 205; Bank v. Andrews (City Ct. N. Y.) 18 N. Y. Supp. 167; Quigley v. Walter, 2 Sweeney, 175. The complaint sets out all the facts necessary to constitute a cause' of action under the statute. It follows that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
