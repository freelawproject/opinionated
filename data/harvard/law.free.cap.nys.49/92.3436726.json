The motion was made under Rule 6 of the General Rules -of Practice in the First Department, which rule took effect January 1, 1897. The ground of the motion was that the cause would not occupy more than two hours in its trial. The point is made by the respondents that the order is not appealable. The ordinary rule concerning motions of this character is that their disposition is within the judicial discretion of the court to which the motion is originally addressed; but there are cases in which it becomes the \u2022duty of this court to review the discretion exercised below. From the papers presented in this record, it seems to us to be clearly \u25a0established that this cause could not, in its trial, occupy two hours, and should not occupy half that time. Without expressing any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>opinion upon the merits of the controversy,, it is perfectly obvious that the plaintiffs\u2019 proofs can be put in, in a few minutes; and, even if the defendants are allowed to go into the matters which are set up in the amended answer, these matters are so clearly stated, and are so readily susceptible of proof (if they exist), that they cam he put before the court and jury in a very short time.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the motion to put the canse on the short-cause calendar granted, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">WILLIAMS, O\u2019BRIEN, and INGRAHAM, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">VAN BRUNT, P. J.</p>\n<p id=\"AHQ\">I dissent. There is no reason why apneals of this character should be encouraged by this court. I think it extremely doubtful whether this cause can be tried in two hou s. There will be a sharp controversy about the facts, and, under these circumstances, there is no evidence of an abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
