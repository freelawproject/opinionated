The plaintiff, in presenting his side of the case, proved that on December 19, 1895, at about 6:30 o\u2019clock p. m., he drove his horse and truck loaded with marble northwardly along a road called Boston or Bear Swamp road, on the right side of which defendant operated a line of trollev cars. Plaintiff found the road very soft and loamy, so that the horse could not pull through. He therefore drove onto the hard trolley roadbed. He got stuck on that in a hole, and, seeing a trolley car coming towards him southwardly, he was endeavoring to turn and get off the track, but, being stuck, he could not succeed. He then yelled to the motorman in charge of the car repeatedly, a dozen times, \u201cStop the car.\u201d The car was about 300 feet away when the plaintiff first saw it. It was run at the rate of 12 to 20 miles an hour. It was a clear night, not foggy, and an electric street light was within 50 feet of the accident. The motorman made no attempts to stop the car until it struck plaintiff\u2019s horse and truck, injuring the horse so much that it had to be killed, overthrowing the truck, and throwing plaintiff off the wagon, so that he became unconscious, and had to keep to bed for four weeks to heal his bruises and injuries occasioned thereby. This evidence is sufficient to charge the defendant\u2019s motorman with want of exercise of care and caution of an ordinary prudent man in running the car against plaintiff\u2019s horse and wagon, under the circumstances in this case. The evidence fully absolves plaintiff of contributory negligence. To be sure, all the evidence presented on plaintiff\u2019s behalf is contradicted by the defendant\u2019s side of the case; but that conflict is settled by the jury rendering a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $500. The plaintiff proved the value of the horse at $250, the truck at $100, the harness at $50, the medical services and medicines at $119, and the loss of his services at $25 a week, being for the four weeks during which he was laid up, $100, making a total of $619; being in excess of the $500 verdict rendered. For that reason the evidence admitted by the trial judge, complained of in the appellant\u2019s fourth point, to the effect \u201cthat for about nine months after the accident occurred plaintiff was unable to work,\u201d etc., did not act injuriously upon the minds of the jury in fixing the amount of their verdict to defendant\u2019s prejudice. The loss of time and services occasioned to plaintiff by the injury was properly pleaded. Hone of the various exceptions present reversible error, and therefore the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
