It alleged that defendant agreed to let to plaintiff the cattle space in seven steamships, to carry cattle to Liverpool, from December 1, 1897, to November 30, 1898; that this freight space would have accommodated 52,000 head of cattle; that, relying on the agreement, plaintiff had made arrangements to purchase cattle for such shipment; that defendant refused to carry out the contract, and plaintiff was unable to procure space in other steamships; and that plaintiff would have realized large profits on said 52,000 head of cattle if the contract had been carried out. The plaintiff resided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>in England, and the undisputed allegations of the papers used in opposing the motion showed that it would take 20 days to comnmnicate with him.

No sufficient time was given to the plaintiff in which to furnish such bill of particulars, and he should not have been required to furnish a verified bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">The order should therefore be modified by directing the service of an unverified bill of particulars within 20 days after notice of the entry of the order upon this appeal, and by striking from the order entered at special term the third paragraph thereof. As so modified, the order should be affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
