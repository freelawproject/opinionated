In an action to foreclose a mortgage made by defendant, plaintiff\u2019s brother, to their father, and payable to plaintiff, which defendant claimed had been satisfied, plaintiff, applying for an order for the examination of defendant, presented affidavits showing that such examination was necessary to enable her to prepare an amended complaint, so as to state her cause of action as fully as the facts would warrant; she not knowing the terms and details of the transaction between her father and brother. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff was entitled to an order for defendant\u2019s examination, but that the latter could not be required to produce papers, necessary to his examination, respecting any agreements between himself and his father.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b617-13\">Appeal from special term, Monroe county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-14\">Action by Sarah E.

Perkins, their brother, is a son of Asa Perkins; and the complaint alleges that he, on the 18th of August, 1883, executed his bond and mortgage to the father for the purpose of allowing to the plaintiff and her assignors the sum of $3,350, payable two years after the death of said Asa Perkins and his wife, Martha Perkins, which bond and mortgage were executed and delivered to Asa Perkins, and the usual allegations in a complaint for a foreclosure of a mortgage are inserted. The respondent, Asa F. Perkins, interposed an answer containing certain denials, and alleging payment, and that the said mortgage was satisfied and discharged by Asa Perkins, the father, on the 11th of June, 1886. The examination of the respondent was sought by the plaintiff for the purpose of ascertaining facts and circumstances upon which an amended complaint might be prepared, and it was stated in the affidavits used by the appellant \u201cthat an amended complaint is necessary in order that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action may be stated on as broad ground as the facts will warrant.\u201d The affidavits seem to indicate the fact that the respondent is unwilling to disclose the information sought by the plaintiff, with a view of amending the complaint. The application for the examination of the respondent, Asa F. Perkins, seems to have been made in good faith, and for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff to amend her complaint so as to present more fully the claims of herself and her assignors against the respondent. It was not necessary that a notice should be given to the defendant before obtaining the order for his examination. Dixon v. Dixon, 8 N. Y. St. Rep. 816; Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 870-872; Heishon v. Insurance Co., 77 N. Y. 278. The plaintiff alleges, in an affidavit which was used, that she knows that \u201can agreement was entered into by Asa F. Perkins with Asa Perkins, whereby he agreed to pay to his brothers and sisters, as alleged in the complaint in this action, the sum of $3,350, and that the source of her information is statements made to her by her father and by the defendant, Asa F. Perkins, to that effect, but that deponent does not know the form and details or terms of that agreement.\u201d It seems that facts and circumstances sufficient were shown to authorize the county judge to make an order for the examination of the defendant before trial. However, we think that portion of the order which required the defendant to \u201cproduce and bring with him papers as shall be necessary to his examination as to any and all agreements made between him and his father and mother, touching his father\u2019s property or a divisiou thereof,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>was improperly inserted in the order, as no case was made by the affidavits for an inspection of papers. Wahed El Tazi v. Stein, 20 Civ. Proc. R. 125, 13 N. Y. Supp. 96; Hauseman v. Sterling, 61 Barb. 347. We think the order of the special term, setting aside the order made by the county judge, should be reversed, and the order made by the county judge should be modified by striking therefrom the provision requiring the production of papers, and the motion to set aside and vacate that portion of the order remaining after such modification should be denied, and the appellant, upon giving five days\u2019 notice to the respondent for the examination before the referee, should be allowed to execute the order as thus modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the order of the county judge modified, as stated in the opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
