Instead of moving to vacate this order upon the papers on which it was granted, he made a motion upon affidavits alleging that he is a resident. The defendants met these affidavits by further proofs in support of their allegation of nonresidence, and thus the question of residence or nonresidence is to be determined from all the affidavits contained in the record. The plaintiff deposes that he \u201cresides in the -city and county of New York, where he has continually resided for seventeen years last past.\u201d This is but the statement of a conclusion, unless taken to mean that the plaintiff has actually lived within the city for that period, which, as he was repeatedly absent, was obviously not intended. In a later part of the affidavit is a declaration that the plaintiff has business interests which \u201cpreclude him from having a domicile \"in any other place than in this city.\u201d The words \u201cdomicile\u201d and \u201cresidence\u201d are here confused in the mind of the affiant. He evidently treats \u201cresidence\u201d as synonymous with \u201cdomicile,\u201d and this \u25a0error is doubtless the keynote to his position throughout. It throws a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>clear light upon his assertion of residence, and, in view of the real facts as to his business life and doings, it plainly indicates that \u201cdomicile,\u201d in its legal sense, and not \u201cresidence,\u201d is what he speaks of. The defendant\u2019s affidavits show quite conclusively that at some time in the year 1896 Mr. Flaherty moved from this city to Philadelphia, in order to be near the Philadelphia office of the Remington &amp; Sherman Company, which had just employed him, and that, when this employment there ceased, he still continued to reside in that city. The removal to Philadelphia, coupled with the intention to remain there permanently (that is, while his business required it), made plaintiff, for the time being, a resident of that city, although his domicile at the same time may have been here. Frost v. Brisbin, 19 Wend. 11; Austen v. Crilly, 13 App. Div. 247, 42 N. Y. Supp. 1097; Bennett v. Watson, 21 App. Div. 409, 47 N. Y. Supp. 569. The statements in plaintiff\u2019s affidavit as to his employment by the firm of Remington, Sherman &amp; Co., his absences from the city on the business of that firm, that he lived at Yo. 309 West Fourteenth street, \u201cwhenever his business engagements permitted him to make a protracted stay in the city,\u201d and his storage of trunks and property in this house during his absences, call for no special consideration. These statements cannot outweigh the prominent facts upon which residence, in a legal sense, depends. They are, besides, trifling in themselves, and are more than balanced by the facts shown in the plaintiff\u2019s opposing affidavits. In view of the clear evidence of legal nonresidence furnished by the defendants, the circumstance, for example, that during his absences from the city the plaintiff left certain trunks and property in the care of the person with whom he lived when he was here, is of no importance. So, also, as to the plaintiff\u2019s statement that \u201che has always registered as a qualified voter in said [this] city whenever circumstances permitted him so to do, and has never voted or performed any other act of citizenship in any state other than Yew York.\u201d This statement is quite vague. It leaves us entirely in the dark as to when circumstances permitted him to register here, and, indeed, he does not say that he ever voted here. The real significance - of the statement is in what it fails to tell us. Without commenting further upon the affidavits, or attempting a minute analysis of their contents, we need only say that, upon their careful examination, we think it clear that the plaintiff is a nonresident, within the meaning of the statute, and that the order requiring him to give security was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The order appealed from should be reversed, and the order requiring the plaintiff to give security reinstated, with costs and disbursements of the appeal, and costs upon the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
