J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQab\">Plaintiff, on the evening of May 15, 1895, left her residence, which is situated on the west side of Main street, in the village of Savannah, and started northerly, along Main street, in company with Mrs. Sedore, intending to reach the Methodist church, and attend a prayer meeting. As they passed up Main street, towards the tracks of the defendant, they came to a gate house or flagman\u2019s shanty which was situated about 17 feet south of track No. 1, being the passenger track used by trains passing eastwardly. The gate house entirely shuts off the west view of track No. 1, \u201cand this continues until you pass by the building, and the building is 5 feet 10 inches wide. Immediately after leaving the gate house going north you begin to see the tracks. The gate is 3 feet 5 inches north of the gate house. At a point on the sidewalk just half way between the gate house and the gate itself * * you can see the clear southerly track or passenger track <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>* * * up for a distance of 466 feet without any obstruction whatever. You can see a point 20 feet west of the north mail-catch post.\u201d As the plaintiff was nearing the crossing a freight train was approaching the crossing from the east, and she waited for it to pass, and as soon as it uncovered the track she started northward, and was struck by an east-bound passenger train, coming at the rate of from 40 to 45 miles an hour. She testifies, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201cWhen we stopped we were a few steps north of the flag house. Mrs. Sedore was with me. When the .train struck me I was between the sidewalk and the track, or gate house and track. The gate there,\u2014we call it the gate\u2014 The gates were up. I had not stepped over on the track yet. The train came along, and hit me there,\u2014something about the engine or tender. Of course; I can\u2019t tell what hit, and next I was on the ground, of course, going with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Her hand was bruised and she was otherwise injured. At the time of the accident the plaintiff was familiar with the crossing. She had lived just south of the crossing some 30 years, and all her communications with the village, including attendance upon church, were had by passing over this crossing. The accident occurred about 7:45 p. m., and the witnesses say the evening was \u201ccloudy, misty, dusky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In the plaintiff\u2019s direct examination she stated that she looked and listened while passing from the shanty towards the track. In the course of her cross-examination the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u201cQ. I ask you if you say you looked on that occasion because you always looked. A. I slon\u2019t know but that was it. Q. What I am after is -whether you have any present distinct recollection of what you did on that occasion, or whether you simply say you looked then because you always look when you are near a crossing. A. We always look for a train when we are near a crossing, to go over it. Q. That is the reason you say you looked on that occasion, is it? A. I say I think it is. Q. And that is the only reason, is it? A. No; looking for a train, of course. Q. Is that the only reason? A. There isn\u2019t any reason, only we looked to see if there was a train coming, if the road was clear. Q. Is there any reason that you say that, other than because you always looked? A. I don\u2019t know; I always looked, of course. Q. Is that the reason you say you looked on that occasion? A. Most assuredly; it must have been. Q. You must have looked because you always look? A. Because we wouldn\u2019t want to go and get run over, would we? Q. There is nothing more to it than that? A. Not that I know of. Q. You always look when you are near a railroad crossing? A. Yes, sir. Q. So you think you must have looked on that occasion because you always looked? A. I must; I know I looked. Certainly, I know I looked. Q. Because you always looked? A. I don\u2019t know what answer else I can give you. I have no recollection of what I did on this night, more than on any other particular night. I stood there south of the crossing while the train was going by. I always look for a train, and that leads me to say I looked for a coming train on this occasion. There is nothing else that makes me say so. Q. Then, after you had left that place south of the flagman\u2019s house, and gone to the north of it, what did you do? A. We looked again. Q. Did you stop? A. We were going slow. We didn\u2019t stop,\u2014stand still. We were just taking steps along. We' didn\u2019t stop,\u2014stand still. We did not stop from the time we were standing south of the flagman\u2019s shanty until we were struck. We were going leisurely along; just an ordinary walk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">In describing the manner of the collision the witness said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">\u201cI knew when it struck me, and I was going with the train; I didn\u2019t know what it was that struck me. Q. Do you know, as a matter of fact, you walked right into the side of the tender of the locomotive? A. I think the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>matter of fact is the tender walked into us. I was not struck by the front of the locomotive. I was not on the track. Something along the side of the tender or cars hit my left arm, and tore my clothes all oft of me. Mrs. Sedore, who is here, says she pulled me out from under the wheels. I did not see that train or hear it at all. I did not know there was any .such train coming. The first thing I knew was I was rolling across the street, with the train across the road. I just saw the locomotive when it passed, and it was something beyond that that hit me; must be on the tender, between the tender and the locomotive. X don\u2019t know what struck me; something that stuck out. I saw the front of the engine go by just like a flash. It must have been something between it that hit me,\u2014got my clothes all grease; so it must, have been something about the engine or tender. It wasn\u2019t but a few steps that I took after I looked west before I was struck. It couldn\u2019t have taken me more than five or ten seconds to get where we were. I can\u2019t tell how many steps I took. I did not look west more than once after I left that shanty. I looked up to the west, and then I turned immediately, and looked towards the east. I looked to the west, and then to the east.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Mrs. Sedore, who was with the plaintiff, testified, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201cAfter we started up we went between the gate house and the track, and I kind of halted, and looked up west, and listened to see if we could see or hear anything coming\u2014any other train\u2014before we started for the track. Q. Did you do anything more? A. Not until after we started on. Q. Before looking east? A. We looked up east. I looked west first, and heard nothing, and cast my eye east before we started on. Q. Then did you start up again? A. Start up again, and, just as we got between the flag house, the gate house, and the track, kind of halted and kind of listened, and I looked west again to see, because I always do,\u2014looked west, and then east,\u2014before we started on. * * * As we started on, just after we started up, this train came from the west,\u2014this passenger train. I did not see it, or hear it, until it just went right by us. At that time I could not say just exactly how many steps we had taken from the time we stopped and looked. We had not taken but a few. <em>* </em>* * The train or something hit us, and knocked us both down, and as I laid there I saw the wheels go along, and it seemed as though it came up so still, and I kind of gathered myself. I know I fell, and hit me,\u2014something did, I could not say what it was,\u2014and knocked me down, and as I gathered myself up I looked to see where she was, and she was going this fashion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">This witness further says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">\u201cWe looked west. We were between the flagman\u2019s shanty,\u2014we call it the \u2018gate house,\u2019\u2014just coming between there and the track, when we looked west. I cannot tell any nearer than that. We were closer to the track than we were back to the flagman\u2019s house. When we looked or halted for breath, we were between the shanty and the track. I think we were nearest the flagman\u2019s house; I can\u2019t tell exactly, but between the track and the flagman\u2019s. That is as near as I can get to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">This witness states that there was no noise there,\u2014nothing to distract their attention. She was then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-12\">\u201cQ. The first thing you knew you walked right into the side of this locomotive? A. That came right into us. Q. If you had not been there, it would not have struck you? A. Certainly not. We would not have walked right into it, I don\u2019t think. Mrs. Comby was on my right. She had taken one step, one foot, further ahead than I. That is why it caught hold of her, and knocked us both down. She did not have hold of me; she did not have my arm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-16\">This witness also testified, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-17\">\u201cI always look and listen before I come over the tracks. I never fail to. There was no more reason why I should do it on that night than any other night, that I know of. I am speaking from my general recollection. Q. When you say that you always look and listen, and therefore you must have looked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>and must have listened that night\u2014 A. Certainly I did. Q. That is the process o\u00ed reasoning you go through. You don\u2019t single out this night any more than any other particular night to testify to it? A. I don\u2019t know as I do. I look every time we go hy; always like to know whether there was a train coming or going. Q. You have got no different or other recollection about this night than any other night when you crossed those .tracks? A. None particularly, as I know of. I never saw this train at all, nor heard it, until it whizzed right hy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Considering that the view between the shanty and the track, a distance of some 17 feet, was unobstructed westwardly for 466 feet, in connection with the testimony given by the plaintiff and by her companion, we are of the opinion that the trial judge was warranted in holding, as matter of law, that the evidence did not establish that the plaintiff was free from contributory, negligence at the time she received the injuries complained of. The plaintiff failed to exercise the care which a prudent person should have exercised under the circumstances surrounding her at the time she approached the highway crossing of the defendant. Smith v. Railroad Co. (Sup.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 400, affirmed Id., 137 N. Y. 562, 33 N. E. 338; Landrigan v. Railroad Co., 23 App. Div. 43, 48 N. Y. Supp. 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The facts disclosed by the evidence in this case differ from the facts disclosed in Seeley v. Railroad Co., 8 App. Div. 403, 40 N. Y. Supp. 866. That case was said to be upon the border line \u201cwhich separates questions of fact from questions of law\u201d; and it was rested largely upon the ground that the party injured and her companion \u201clooked in each direction before going upon the track upon which the accident happened.\u201d Appellant calls our attention to Greany v. Railroad Co., 101 N. Y. 419, 5 3ST. E. 425. While it was said in that case that the plaintiff is not bound to see, it was also said that he \u201cis bound to make all reasonable efforts to see that a careful, prudent man would make in like circumstances.\u201d The evidence before us does not indicate that the plaintiff used that care and caution which, under the circumstances, she ought to have, used to avoid being injured by the approaching train from the west. Our attention is invited to the case of Miller v. Railroad Co., 82 Hun, 164, 31 N. Y. Supp. 317, affirmed Id., 146 N. Y. 367, 41 N. E. 90. In that case it was said: \u201cHere there is a conflict as to some of the material facts relating to the question of the deceased\u2019s freedom from negligence;\u201d and, upon looking into the facts in that case, they are found to differ very essentially from the facts disclosed by the case now in hand. We recognize the rule that, where there is a nonsuit, the plaintiff is entitled to the most favorable construction of the evidence, and to the most favorable inferences that may be drawn therefrom, and we have applied that rule in considering the evidence in this case; and we are of the opinion, after due consideration of the rule applied to the evidence before us, that the plaintiff has failed to establish her freedom from contributory negligence. The train which was approaching the crossing was the usual train passing that station at 7:43, and on this occasion was a few minutes late, and was coming at apparently its usual speed of 40 to 45 miles an hour; and with the sound created by such a train, if the plaintiff had been alert and using that care and caution which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>persons approaching a known place of danger ought to have exercised, she would not have been injured. We think the trial judge committed no error in granting a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Order affirmed, with costs, and judgment ordered for the defendant, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
