The issues framed by the complaint and amended answer admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s claim. The answer further attempted to allege an equitable set-off sufficient in amount to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Such set-off was properly disallowed by the referee, to whom the issues herein were sent for determination. Now, defendants seek to amend their amended answer by alleging a counterclaim for nearly $12,000, and, in addition, deny the material allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. It must be, therefore, apparent that the proposed supplemental and amended answer actually proposed to make entirely new issues, and ones entirely different to the issues framed by the complaint and the amended answer. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is denied in the last proposed answer. In the amended answer such claim was admitted, and, besides, in addition, a very large counterclaim is alleged,\u2014something not attempted in the amended answer. These very radical amendments defendants sought to have allowed to them just \u00bfbout the closing of the trial before the referee. The referee properly denied their application; likewise the special term justice, when the matter was presented to him. If he had granted the motion, the trial would have rendered all the proceedings taken before the referee of no effect. The trial would have to be commenced all over again. Plaintiff would have had cast upon his shoulders the burden of proving his case, and the defendants allowed to prove their counterclaim, and disprove the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Under these circumstances, we think that the order appealed from was properly made. The defendants should not at this late hour be permitted to introduce their said counterclaims, but should sue upon the same in the usual way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-3\">The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">CONLAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
