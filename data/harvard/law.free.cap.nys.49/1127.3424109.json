'Before taking passage, he,purchased a ticket at defendant\u2019s station from its agent for the trip, and was 6charged and paid 40 cents for it. If section 37 of the railroad law fixed the rate of fare, it should not have exceeded 33 cents, being \u201cthree cents for every such mile or fraction thereof.\u201d The defense was: (1) A right to charge four cents per mile, under section 5, c. 594, Laws 1872, which provides: \u201cThe Utica, Ithaca &amp; Elmira Railroad are hereby authorized to charge a fare not exceeding four cents a mile on said road: * * * provided they shall furnish commutation tickets in amounts not less than ten dollars, not transferable, at the rate of two cents per mile.\u201d The Utica, Ithaca &amp; Elmira Railroad Company and its successors, including the defendant, did furnish the commutation tickets pursuant to this statute, and the defendant still does so. (2) That, if it did not have such legal right, it supposed it had, and thus the excessive charge was made through inadvertence or mistake, not amounting to gross negligence. The defendant, in charging four cents per mile, acted upon the advice of its counsel that it had the right to do so. The trial court found for the defendant upon the latter ground. The defendant is the successor in interest of the Utica, Ithaca &amp; Elmira Railroad Company, the owner and operator of the railroad when chapter 594, Laws 1872, was enacted. In 1878, upon foreclosure sale under a mortgage given by this com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>party, the railroad and the franchises of the company were sold to Goodlow &amp; Lindley, acting for the bond and stockholders of the company, who, associating others with them, organized the Utica, Ithaca &amp; Elmira Kailway Company, to which company they thereupon conveyed the railroad and franchises. This company then gave a mortgage upon the railroad and franchises of the new company, and in 1884 the same were sold under judgment of foreclosure to Corbin &amp; Maxwell, who, associating others with them, thereupon organized the defendant, to which they conveyed the railroad and franchises.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1148-4\">Argued before PARKER, P.

In Beardsley v. Railroad Co., 15 App. Div. 251, 44 N. Y. Supp. 175, we reached the conclusion \u201cthat it was the intent of the legislature to include within the classification of section 37 every railroad corporation except the New York Central, and prescribe the only rule or rules which should govern the entire subject.\u201d In addition to what was there said, it may be remarked that the act of 1890 is professedly one of a series of general laws. It is the railroad law. It was enacted after 60 years of experiment, evolution, and development in railroad construction and operation. The railroad system had passed beyond the day of special laws for special needs, and the legislature supposed'it could deal with it in a manner fitted to its maturity and uniformity. Thus the greater reason for holding that the legislature did intend that its general act should supersede all former special acts, and that chapter 594, Laws 1872, is repealed by implication. But, assuming this to be so, it does not follow that the defendant has incurred the penalty. The act imposing it excepts an overcharge made through \u201cmistake not amounting to gross negligence.\u201d Whether the general act repealed the special one by implication is a matter not patent upon the face of the general act, but is an inference of law. What the inference of law is may remain unknown until the courts declare it. Meantime parties who are called upon to Interpret the two statutes, and act upon them, may make a mistake as to the ultimate ruling of the court. It is often hard in such cases for the mistaken party to pay the actual damages which his mistake has caused. In this respect, ignorance of the law is no excuse. But when it comes to imposing a penalty in addition, then, if the statute opens a way of escape for the mistaken offender, the statute should be liberally construed in his favor, and rigidly against the party seeking to recover the penalty. What we should hold if the statute did not contain this exception, we need not say. We think section 37 is so framed as to exempt the defendant from this penalty. The plaintiff would, no doubt, be entitled to recover the overcharge,\u2014seven cents,\u2014but such a nominal recovery would not protect him from costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">The plaintiff contends that section 5 of the act of 1872, which gave the right to the Utica, Ithaca &amp; Elmira Railroad Company to charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>four cents per mile, was unconstitutional, because the act was a local or private one, embracing more than one subject, and not expressing this one in its title. The act was entitled \u201cAn. act to authorize the \"Utica, Ithaca &amp; Elmira Bailroad Company to extend their road, and to confirm their purchase of a portion of the roadbed of the Lake Ontario, Auburn &amp; New York Bailroad, and for other purposes.\u201d He also contends that the defendant, as the successor company through various transfers, some of them to individuals, did not acquire the franchise to charge four cents per mile, even if the act were valid. If either of these contentions is valid,\u2014a question we need not decide,\u2014the defendant, for the reasons already stated, would not be liable for the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
