Mr, Skinner, one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, described the occurrence as one caused by gross negligence on the part of the defendant; that it looked to him as though there would be a collision, and he shouted to the plaintiff to look out.</p>\n<p id=\"Avj\">As usual in negligence cases, the defendant and his witnesses gave a different version of the occurrence from that given by the plaintiff, throwing the fault upon the plaintiff; but the circumstances were such as to warrant the justice in believing the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and finding that the collision was caused wholly by the negligence of the defendant. One thing is certain. The defendant was driving at such a high rate of speed, with his mind on the horse he was speeding, that it is doubtful whether he had his horse under such control as to avoid doing damage to others'lawfully using the highway; and it is highly probable that the accident \u25a0occurred from this cause. The question of fact involved was decided on conflicting evidence. That given by the plaintiff, on the one hand, and by the defendant, on the other, are irreconcilable. The justice had the witnesses before him, observed their appearance and manner of testifying, and had ample opportunity of forming an accurate judgment as to the value of the evidence given. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>There is nothing in the case that warrants us in holding that he erred in giving credence to the plaintiff\u2019s version of the facts, and, as no point is made as to the amount of the recovery, the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">DALY, P. j., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
