Proc. \u00a7 999, to warrant the hearing and decision of the motion for a new trial on the minutes, the original order should be resettled so as to read that the motion therein referred to was made on plaintiff\u2019s exception to the dismissal of the complaint.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b941-10\">Van Brunt, P.

The learned counsel for the plaintiff, in his application for a resettlement, asked more than he was entitled to, and specified grounds which were not taken. That, however, does not deprive him of a resettlement as to the ground which actually was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">The order denying the motion for a resettlement should therefore be reversed, and an order made resettling the original order so as to read that the motion therein referred to was made upon the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the dismissal of the complaint, without costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">RUMSEY, PATTERSON, and O\u2019BRIEN, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b941-19\">VAN BBUNT, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6Lq\">I dissent. A formal motion having been made for a new trial at the termination of the trial, a few days subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>quently the same was argued; the plaintiff stating various ground\u00bb upon which he based his motion. This motion was denied, and an order was entered, without notice o\u00ed settlement, which contained no reference to the grounds stated upon the argument. A motion was made to resettle this order, which motion was denied, and from such denial the present appeal is taken. It will be observed, upon a reference to section 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that a motion for new trial, where the complaint has been dismissed, can only be made upon exceptions; and this would be the only ground which could be required to be stated in the order, if such motion had been made upon that ground. ' It nowhere appears, however, that any exceptions whatever were taken upon the trial which could form a basis of a motion for a new trial. Consequently there was no ground authorized by section 999 which could be stated in the order denying the motion. It is true that the section provides that a motion for a new trial may be made where a verdict is contrary to evidence or contrary to law, but such provision does not apply to a direction dismissing the complaint. In such a case the motion for a new trial, as has been above stated, must be founded upon exceptions; and, there being no exceptions, there was no ground for the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
