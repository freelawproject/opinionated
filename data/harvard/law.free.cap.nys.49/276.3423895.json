The collision actually happened on Avenue A, at a point on the westerly side of that avenue, between Seventy-Sixth and Seventy-Seventh streets, the plaintiff\u2019s direction having been originally northwardly along the avenue, on its easterly or right-hand side, but, in order to escape injury, so far as might be, from impact with the defendant\u2019s wagon, which was being driven westwardly along Seventy-Sixth street and first seen when the plaintiff reached the corner of that street, his course was changed towards his left-hand side and the continued progress of the vehicles resulted in their coming together when north of the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">From the evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the approach of both these wagons towards the intersection of Seventy-Sixth street with the avenue, at which point the question of the due exercise of care arose, we think the justice could properly find that the accident was brought about through the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servant, without a failure of reasonable prudence upon the part of the plaintiff, or of the servant who was driving his carriage. The manner in which these vehicles approached the intersection of the street with the avenue caused it to become necessary for one to give place for the other\u2019s passage, since their respective courses, at right angles, if maintained, must have resulted in their coming together, and, conceiving that he had the better right of way, the plaintiff\u2019s driver signaled to the defendant\u2019s driver that he would pass in front, continuing his course; but the latter did not lessen his speed in obedience to this signal, nor change his direction in any way, and the plaintiff\u2019s driver then turned his course to the left, in order to avoid the collision which, despite his efforts, resulted as detailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">It was claimed for the defendant that his wagon could not have been brought to a stop, or its speed sufficiently lessened, after the plaintiff\u2019s intention became apparent, because it contained a heavy load, consisting of tubs of meat, weighing 1,500 pounds; but, so far as was apparent to the plaintiff, this vehicle was an ordinary covered grocery wagon, drawn by one horse, and readily to be controlled within the space available, and the fault was wholly that of the defendant\u2019s driver, if, by reason of this concealed load, he was unable to properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>control the wagon when approaching the crossing of a much-traveled thoroughfare. That the plaintiff\u2019s driver did not fail to act as a reasonably prudent person when electing to pass in front of the defendant\u2019s wagon, under the circumstances, was, we think, a legitimate finding of fact from the evidence, since, while there is no question that the collision would not have occurred had the defendant\u2019s driver been given the right of way, the plaintiff\u2019s servant could well be justified in his assumption that his signal that he himself intended to maintain Ms course would be observed and acted upon, and, so far as was apparent to him, the situation was not one calling for any greater caution upon Ms part, such as might have been expected were it apparent that the approaching wagon was under less perfect control than was his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">No rule of law required that both the wagons should be brought to a stop. One or the other was entitled to the right of passage, and, the plaintiff\u2019s driver having signified his intention to pass, without having had any reason to believe that the defendant\u2019s driver would dispute the right of way thus indicated, he was not chargeable with negligence, as contributing to the injury which was then brought about, solely because the defendant\u2019s servant failed to exercise the amount of care which was reasonably to be expected from him. The defendant\u2019s driver testified that no signal was given, and that, from the fact that the plaintiff turned Ms course to the left, he assumed that the latter intended to drive into Seventy-Sixth. street, and away from Mm; but the justice was quite authorized to credit the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s servant that he did signal, and that Ms change of course took place only after that signal was obviously disregarded, and when the certainty of a collision thus became apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The fact that the plaintiff, who was sitting beside his driver at the time, thought that the action of the driver in swerving to the left was for the purpose of avoiding contact with a child upon the street, does not affect the force of this driver\u2019s own testimony that he was then trying to avert a collision with the defendant\u2019s wagon, although it is true, as the appellant contends, that the servant\u2019s testimony does not contain an allusion to any child\u2019s presence. It is not to be assumed that the plaintiff knew what was passing in his servant\u2019s mind, and it is entirely probable that, while such servant\u2019s attention was directed only to the approaching wagon, the plaintiff himself may have had in view a child whose position upon the street was rendered the safer by the actual change of course which took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The question is raised with regard to the measure or evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s damage, and, as to the matter of responsibility for the accident itself, the conclusion reached by the justice is to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
