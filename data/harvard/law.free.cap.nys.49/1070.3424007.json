See American Exch. Nat. Bank v. New York Belting &amp; Packing Co., 148 N. Y. 698, 43 N. E. 168. In this connection, attention is called to the fact that there was evidence given by defendants tending to show that the plaintiff himself was present at the time that the defendants arranged with Lunitz for the terms upon which the note was to be delivered to Samuelson. The plaintiff, when subsequently put on the stand, was not asked whether he was so present at that time, nor was any evidence given by him tending to contradict the testimony that had been given by the defendants. This, we think, should have been given. We also think that the justice should have allowed the question put to plaintiff on cross-examination, \u201cWhere did you get these fifty dollars?\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">Judgment appealed from reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
