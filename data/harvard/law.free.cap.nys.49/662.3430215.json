The article in question related to alleged delays attending the execution of a contract for legislative printing; to the manner in which resolutions for \u201cextra\u201d work had been procured from the legislature, etc. The defendant set up a defense of justification. In addition to the matters mentioned in the opinion, plaintiff also asked for a specification, among other things, of the year in which the state comptroller, as alleged, called attention, in a report, to the cost of work done under plaintiff\u2019s contract, and of the names of the friends of plaintiff who, as alleged, secured orders for extra printing.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b683-7\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

We think that the motion for a bill of particulars should have been granted to the extent of requiring the defendant to furnish (1) a list of the bills presented to the comptroller referred to in the answer, containing false and fraudulent charges; (2) the title of the reports in which paper was used in violation of the contract; (3) the title of the reports required to be printed which were not printed by plaintiff, but printed elsewhere; and (4) the matters from which, by reason of the delay and failure of the plaintiff to execute its contract, the state got no service.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">The order should be reversed, and the motion granted to the extent indicated in this opinion, with $10 costs and disbursements of appeal, and $10 costs of motion to abide the final event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
