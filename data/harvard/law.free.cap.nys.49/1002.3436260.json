The grounds of the arrest stated in the order are \u201cfraud, false and fraudulent representations.\u201d Fraud is a deception practiced in order to induce another to part with property, or to surrender some legal right; and the affidavits found in this record do not make out a cause of action for fraud. It does not appear that defendant or any one else through his acts has obtained either money, goods, or credit; and we \u00e1re not satisfied from the proofs that ithe money paid by the plaintiffs for the orange peel will not be recovered when the merchandise is sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-21\">The other ground stated in the order of arrest, \u201cfalse and fraudulent representations,\u201d is not a cause of action in tort known to the law. Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit C shows that the defendant did receive a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>verbal order from the Cheney Medicine Company, through Opitz,, the manager, for gentian and gentian root, which was filled without comment. It also appears that the defendant was in Toledo, and did have a consultation with Opitz concerning orange peel, and the case resolves itself into a contest of veracity between defendant and Opitz. That defendant wrote \u201cthat he was in a hole\u201d because of Opitz denying the order is true, but that language is not proof of fraud. Any one of the thousands engaged in selling goods can be placed in the same position at any moment by the buyer denying the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Furthermore, the agreement entered into between the plaintiffs and defendant conferred on defendant authority and discretion to order the orange peel, whether he had an order therefor or not-The defendant is not a partner in the firm of Leber &amp; Mayer, bul his interest in the drug department under the agreement is such that they and he are co-partners in that enterprise. All the essential conditions for the creation of a co-partnership are found therein. The agreement is between Edward F. Leber, Louis Mayer, and the defendant as individuals. It is executed by them individually, under separate seals. Plaintiffs agree \u201cto furnish the capital.\u201d The said department is to be charged interest. Defendant is \u201cto manage the purchases and sales.\u201d Defendant receives no salary. Plaintiffs agree \u201cto perform the financial duties of said department,\u201d and to \u201cassist the defendant to the best of their ability.\u201d All three agree \u201cto work the department between themselves in conformity with the ideas of each of them.\u201d The department is charged wi1;h expenses, office rent, wages, etc. Annual accountings are to be had, and the profits and losses ascertained. 2Tet profits are to be divided, one-half to the plaintiffs, and one-half to the defendant. Losses are'to be borne in the same proportion, one-half by each. Defendant\u2019s accumulated profits are to remain in the business at interest. \u201cIn case the share of profits which may be credited to said defendant be not sufficient to cover the advances to be made to him, he shall be and remain responsible to the said Leber &amp; Mayer for any such difference. For aught that appears, the plaintiffs may have in their hands earned profits belonging to defendant more than sufficient to cover any loss that may arise from the purchase of the orange peel. Plaintiffs have brought an action to recover damages, which damages are the possible losses which may be made upon one transaction in the business of the' drug department. The defendant having authority to make the purchase, and partnership existing, the action cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the motion to vacate the order of arrest granted, with $10\u00bb costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
