J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJS\">The action was to foreclose a mortgage made by the defendant, Margaret Hickey, and after judgment a motion was made at special term to set aside the judgment, on the ground that there had been no personal service of the summons on said defendant. The court appointed a referee \u201cto take testimony, and ascertain whether the summons and complaint in the above-entitled action was served upon the defendant, Margaret Hickey, in the above-entitled action, on April 24, 1897, and report to this court with all convenient speed.\u201d There were several hearings before the referee, where Mrs. Dehong, the person employed to serve the process, and whose affidavit of service is annexed to the judgment roll, was examined and carefully cross-examined. Other witnesses were examined by the defendant, to contradict and impeach her. The defendant\u2019s counsel was requested to call Mrs. Hickey as a witness, and declined to do so. The referee reported that the summons and complaint were served on Mrs. Hickey on the day named. The court made an order confirming the referee\u2019s report and denying the motion to vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">After carefully examining the evidence taken before the referee, we cannot do otherwise than affirm the order confirming the report of the referee and denying the motion to vacate the judgment. The failure of Mrs. Hickey to appear for examination before the referee, of itself, would afford strong presumption against her contention that she was never personally served with the summons; but when this fact is coupled with a refusal of her counsel to produce her, the presumption ripens into an almost conclusive deduction that her contention is unfounded. Ror is this cured by the statement, contained in Mrs. Hickey\u2019s affidavit used to oppose the motion for confirmation, in which she states that she went to Connecticut before the first hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ing before the referee, on account of ill health, and that her attorney did not know where she was until she informed him by a letter dated July 12th and.received by him on July 13th. The referee\u2019s report was dated and filed July 24th, and there was an interval of nearly two weeks during which an application could have been made to the referee to open the hearing and take the defendant\u2019s testimony; but no such application was made. Under these conditions, the court and referee were justified in the finding that she was served with the process; and we agree with their conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The order should be affirmed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
