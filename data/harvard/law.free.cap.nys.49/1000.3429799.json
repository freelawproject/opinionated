It directs the trial justice to resettle the case on appeal in a particular manner. In so doing the special term justice exceeded his powers. If it appeared to Mm that the case on appeal was not properly settled, it was within his power to order that it be sent back to the trial justice to resettle the same, if the trial justice deemed it proper to do so. The order appealed from goes further than that, and directs a resettlement in certain particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-15\">It must be modified so as to conform to our view, and, as so modified, is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
