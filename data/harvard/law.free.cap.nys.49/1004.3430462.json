We are of the opinion that the facts set forth in the affidavits entitled the plaintiffs to the order for substituted service. The order granted herein complies with the requirements of section 436 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that section applies to the city court \u00abof the city of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.
