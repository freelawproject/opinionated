No answer has been interposed. The defendants, however, moved in due time that one Aaron Wainess should be substituted as a defendant, for the reason that, as they say, Wainess claims to be entitled to one-half of the commissions, pursuant to an agreement made by him with one of the defendants and one of the plaintiffs. This contract, however, is denied by the plaintiffs. The moving papers do not admit, in terms, a liability existing on the part of the defendants towards the plaintiffs for these commissions, or for anything else. On the contrary, there is an affidavit of merits, in which it is stated that the defendants have a good and substantial defense on the merits to the cause of action set forth in the complaint. In the face of this allegation, the defendants have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>no right to an interpleader, which can only be ordered when the defendant admits a liability to some one for the full amount claimed, and the only question is to whom he owes it. Railroad Co. v. Arthur, 90 N. Y. 234. There is no admission of that kind in these papers, but the contrary. It may be that the defendants are indebted, not only to the plaintiffs, but to Wainess, but that fact is of no importance here. It is sufficient that the defendants do not concede that they are indebted to the plaintiffs in the amount of this claim, or in any amount, and for that reason this order should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion of inteipleader is denied, with $10 costs. All concur: O\u2019BRIEN, J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b953-6\">O\u2019BRIEN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOYG\">I concur in the result. Too much weight is given to the affidavit. It seems to me that, though one may have a good defense, he need not insist upon it, but may waive it, and in so doing is not prejudiced in making any other application or seeking any other relief to which he is entitled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
