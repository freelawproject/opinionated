The pleadings are in writing. The defendants answered separately, but the answers are similar in all respects, each admitting that no part of the sum sued for has been paid, while denying each and every allegation of the complaint. At the trial there was a sharp conflict of evidence upon the issues thus raised, which the justice resolved in plaintiff\u2019s favor, by rendering judgment against the defendant May McKenzie Enright, for $164.37, damages and costs, but dismissing the complaint as to the defendant Henry Enright.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-16\">The justice, having had the witnesses before him, and observed their conduct and demeanor while testifying, was undoubtedly better able to judge of their credibility, and determine the weight to be attached to their testimony, than is this appellate court; and we should not disturb his conclusion unless the evidence is of such a convincing character as to clearly indicate that there was a mistake on the part of the justice, or that he had been influenced by bias, passion, prejudice, or corruption, or that he had manifestly neglected to deliberate upon the whole testimony. Dempsey v. Paige, 4 E. D. Smith, 218, 219; Lynes v. Hickey, 4 Misc. Rep. 522, 24 N. Y. Supp. 731. A close scrutiny of the record does not lead to such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-17\">Although decided in his favor, Mr. Enright has joined his wife in an appeal from the judgment rendered, which, evidently, is due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>an oversight. His co-defendant essays to reverse the judgment solely upon the facts; but, as we cannot discover any ground for disturbing \u2022the justice\u2019s determination thereof, the judgment should be affirmed,with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
