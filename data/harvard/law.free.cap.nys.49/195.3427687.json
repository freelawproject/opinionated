The money was deposited in the bank in the name of \u201cCatherine Murray, in trust for Julia Murray.\u201d It may be true that the equitable title to the money was in the cestui que true. Cunningham v. Davenport, 147 N. Y. 43, 41 N. E. 412. It is equally true that a court would be authorized to find, upon the evidence, in a proper action, that the money was in fact the property of Catherine Murray. But, however this may be, she was invested with the legal title to the money when the order was served, and when the same was drawn out Her act in transferring the fund was, therefore, a violation of the order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>within the authority of People v. Kingsland, *42 N. Y. 325, and authorized the order which was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
