GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">A Mississippi state jury convicted Phillip Stokes of murder during the commission of a robbery; the court then sentenced him to life imprisonment. Stokes appealed, and the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed his conviction. <em>Stokes v. State, </em>548 So.2d 118 (Miss. 1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1029, 110 S.Ct. 742, 107 L.Ed.2d 759 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">After collateral appeals in state and federal court, Stokes filed a second petition for federal habeas relief, raising seventeen claims. A magistrate judge determined that nine of Stokes\u2019 claims were procedurally barred,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> some did not sound in federal habe-as, and the rest failed on the merits. The district court then adopted the findings of the magistrate judge (with some changes) and dismissed Stokes\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">After the district court denied Stokes a eei\u2019tificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), Stokes moved this court for a COA, arguing that the district court erred by dismissing any of his claims as procedurally barred. This court granted Stokes a partial COA on the issue of \u201cwhether the Mississippi courts have consistently and regularly applied [the appellate bars of] Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-27(5) (1994) and Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-21(1) (1994).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of federal habeas review based on a state procedural ground. <em>Amos v. Scott, </em>61 F.3d 333, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 116 S.Ct. 557, 133 L.Ed.2d 458 (1995). Where a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, this court may not review the prisoner\u2019s habeas petition unless he can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). A state procedural rule that bars consideration of an issue is not adequate unless it is \u201cstrictly or regularly followed.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Mississippi </em>486 U.S. 578, 587, 108 S.Ct. 1981, 1987, 100 L.Ed.2d 575 (1988); <em>see also Hathorn v. Lovorn, </em>457 U.S. 255, 262-63, 102 S.Ct. 2421, 2426, 72 L.Ed.2d 824 (1982) (\u201cState courts may not avoid deciding federal issues by invoking procedural rules that they do not apply evenhandedly to all similar claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-16\">The Mississippi Supreme Court held that Stokes\u2019 claims were procedurally barred under \u00a7\u00a7 99-29-21(1) and 99-39-27(5). Section 99-39-21(1) states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0c\">[f]ailure by a prisoner to raise objections, defenses, claims, questions, issues or errors either in fact or law which were capable of determination at trial and/or on direct appeal, regardless of whether such are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>based on the laws and the Constitution of the state of Mississippi or of the United States, shall constitute a waiver thereof and shall be procedurally barred, but the court may upon a showing of cause and actual prejudice grant relief from the waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-21(1). In turn, \u00a7 99-39-27(5) provides-that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVqM\">[u]nless it appears from the face of the application, motion, exhibits, exhibits and the prior record that the claims presented by such are not procedurally barred under Section 99-39-21 and that they further present a substantial showing of the denial of a state or federal right, the court shall by appropriate order deny the application. The court may, in its discretion, require the attorney general upon sufficient notice to respond to the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-27(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">As a threshold matter, we first determine that we need not consider whether Mississippi applies \u00a7 99-39-27(5) strictly or regularly. This section cannot operate as a <em>procedural </em>bar to review because it requires some evaluation, however cursory, of the merits of a petitioner\u2019s claim. Similarly, \u00a7 99-39-27(5) cannot be an <em>independent </em>state ground because it is not separate from the merits of Stokes\u2019 claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) that he is being held in custody in violation of the Constitution or federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">In contrast, \u00a7 99-39-21(1) does contain an independent state procedural bar. The question, then, is whether this bar is \u201cadequate,\u201d and this hinges on whether Mississippi has strictly or regularly applied it. <em>Lott v. Hargett, </em>80 F.3d 161, 165 (5th Cir.1996). As a general rule, a procedural bar must be \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed by the time as of which it is to be applied.\u201d <em>Ford v. Georgia, </em>498 U.S. 411, 424, 111 S.Ct. 850, 857-58, 112 L.Ed.2d 935 (1991). However, a state fails to strictly or regularly apply a procedural bar only when the state \u201cclearly and unequivocally excuse[s] the procedural default.\u201d Amos, 61 F.3d at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">The petitioner bears the burden of showing that the state did not strictly or regularly follow a procedural bar around the time of his direct appeal. <em>Sones v. Hargett, </em>61 F.3d 410, 416 (5th Cir.1995). Moreover, the petitioner must demonstrate that the state has failed to apply the procedural bar rule to claims identical or similar to those raised by the petitioner himself. <em>Martin, </em>98 F.3d at 848; <em>Amos, </em>61 F.3d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">In attempting to show that Mississippi has not strictly or regularly applied the \u00a7 99-39-21(1) procedural bar, Stokes cites twenty-two Mississippi Supreme Court cases. However, none of these cases is particularly relevant, and most miss the mark by a wide margin. Twelve cases, for instance, do not involve any discussion of \u00a7 99-39-21(1), and another four cases are orders of the Mississippi Supreme Court granting Stokes leave to proceed in the trial court. Two cases pertain to \u00a7 99-39-27(9) of the Mississippi Code. This provision generally bars second or successive state habeas petitions except in a number of specific situations, including \u201cthose cases in which the prisoner can demonstrate ... that there has been an intervening decision of the supreme court of either the state of Mississippi or the United States which would have actually adversely affected the outcome of his conviction or sentence....\u201d One case deals with time and <em>res judicata </em>bars, not the \u00a7 99-39-21(1) procedural bar. In a couple of other cases, the Mississippi Supreme Court recognized plain error despite the fact that the time bar of \u00a7 99-39-5(2) or the bar on second or successive writs applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">Only one of twenty-two cases\u2019 Stokes cites involves the \u00a7 99-39-21(1) procedural bar. In this case, <em>Smith v. State, </em>477 So.2d 191 (Miss.1985), the court reversed and remanded to correct a sentencing mistake, even though the \u00a7 99-39-21(1) procedural bar applied. The court explicitly waived the bar because it found that the sentencing mistake rose to a level of plain error and affected Smith\u2019s fundamental rights. However, Stokes does not allege that the state court made a error in sentencing him. Thus, he may not rely on <em>Smith </em>to show that the Mississippi Supreme Court does not strictly or regularly apply the \u00a7 99-39-21(1) procedural bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>In short, Stokes has not pointed to a single ease where the Mississippi Supreme Court case has failed to apply the \u00a7 99-39-21(1) procedural bar to a claim identical or similar to one of his own proeedurally barred claims. Accordingly, Stokes has failed to carry his burden of showing inconsistent and irregular application of the \u00a7 99-39-21(1) bar; he has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b903-20\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. We also DENY Stokes\u2019 motion to file a reply brief in excess of the page limit set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 28.1.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-12\">. The nine claims the magistrate judge suggested were procedurally barred included those pertaining to the admission of enlarged fingerprint evidence, the failure to grant a motion for acquittal, the failure to sequester the jury, the denial of a motion for a mistrial, allowing the prosecutor to lead witnesses, permitting the admission of hearsay testimony by a police officer, the denial of an impartial jury, the denial of the right to testify by being forced to appear in court while bleeding and suffering head injuries, and the refusal to use proffered jury instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-17\">. The only issue on appeal is the adequacy of the appellate bars of \u00a7\u00a7 99-39-27(5) and 99-39-21(1). Thus, we will not examine whether Stokes can show cause and prejudice or whether the court's failure to consider his claims would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>See generally Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2506, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
