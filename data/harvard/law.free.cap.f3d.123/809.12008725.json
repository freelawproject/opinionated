Sandle asserts that the district court erred by using a prior Texas state conviction for cocaine possession to enhance his federal sentence and that the amount of cocaine base attributed to him in his presentence invest\u00ed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>gation report improperly reflected amounts attributable to his co-conspirators prior to his involvement in the conspiracy. The district court overruled his objections and sentenced him to the statutory minimum of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">As a result of an investigation conducted by the Brazos County, Texas, Narcotics Task Force and other local, state, and federal agencies concerning the crack cocaine market and distribution system in the Bryan/College Station, Texas, area, a federal grand jury returned a seventy-one count indictment charging Sandle and thirteen others with various drug-related offenses. Prior to re-arraignment, the government gave notice as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 that it' would seek to use Sandle\u2019s 1992 Texas state conviction for felony cocaine possession for sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Pursuant to a plea agreement, Sandle pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute in excess of fifty grams of cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); 846 (count 2 of the indictment). The district court sentenced Sandle to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, 10 years\u2019 supervised release, and a $50 special assessment. Also pursuant to Sandle\u2019s plea agreement, the government filed a motion to dismiss the remaining counts against San-dle, which the district court granted. San-dle appeals his sentence enhancement and the district court\u2019s adoption of the presen-tence investigation report. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\"> Sandle complains that the district court erred by applying section 841(b)(l)(A)\u2019s enhancement provision to his conviction premised on a prior Texas state felony conviction for possession of cocaine and by attributing to him an amount of crack cocaine unsupported by his involvement with the drug conspiracy. \u201c We will uphold a sentence unless it (1) was imposed in violation of law, (2) resulted from an incorrect application qf the guidelines, (3) was outside the guideline range and is unreasonable, or (4) was imposed for an offense for which there is no applicable sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mathena, </em>23 F.3d 87, 89 (5th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Headrick, </em>963 F.2d 777, 779 (5th Cir.1992)). In this regard, the district court\u2019s interpretation of a federal statute is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">I. \u201cFelony Drug Offense\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">Sandle first contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to set aside his sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). According to Sandle, because the applicable statute contains no express definition of \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d we should look to section 4B1.2(2) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which defines \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under section 4B1.2(2) requires an intent to manufacture, import, export, or distribute, <em>United States v. Gaitan, </em>954 F.2d 1005, 1008 (5th Cir.1992), Sandle argues that enhancement under section 841(b)(1)(A) likewise should not be permitted when a prior \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d is for \u201cmere\u201d possession. As Sandle\u2019s argument is founded on an erroneous reading of the enhancement statute, we reject his argument and affirm the district court\u2019s application of section 841(a)(1)(A)\u2019s enhancement provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">Section 841(b)(1)(A), as currently written, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-16\">\u201c(b) Except as otherwise provided in section 859, 860, or 861 of this title, any person who violates subsection (a) of this section shall be sentenced as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-17\">(1)(A) In the case of a violation of subsection (a) of this section involving\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-18\"><em>* </em>* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>(iii) 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance described in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-4\">such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years or more than life.... <em>If any person commits such a violation after a prior conviction </em>for <em>a felony drug offense has become final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years and not more than life </em>imprisonment_\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West Supp.1997) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Far from omitting a statutory definition of \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d section 802(44) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-8\">\u201c(44) The term \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44) (West Supp. 1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">This statutory definition has remained essentially consistent since its inception, in slightly different form, in 1984.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Sandle does not dispute that his prior Texas state conviction for possession of cocaine was final, <em>United States v. Morales, </em>854 F.2d 65 at 68-69 (5th Cir.1988), or that it was, in fact, an otherwise qualifying felony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor does Sandle dispute that Texas\u2019 system of deferred adjudication does not constitute a conviction for the purposes of section 841(b)(1)(A)\u2019s sentence enhancement provision. <em>See United States v. Cisneros, </em>112 F.3d 1272, 1282 (5th Cir.1997). Rather, in the face of the statutory definition, which does not require the additional elements that he would have us read into \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d Sandle simply argues that application of section 841(b)(l)(A)\u2019s enhancement provision is improperly triggered by a felony conviction for \u201cmere\u201d possession. Although this Court has affirmed sentences that were enhanced under section 841(b)(1)(a) for prior state convictions for simple possession of a controlled substance, <em>see United States v. Kubosh, </em>63 F.3d 404, 405-06 (5th Cir.1995) (rejecting arguments that, under section 841(b)(1)(A), prior possession convictions were improperly used to enhance sentence because they were constitutionally invalid, not separately countable, and misdemeanors in other jurisdictions), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 116 S.Ct. 1012, 134 L.Ed.2d 93 (1996); <em>United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022, 1028 (5th Cir.) (rejecting challenge to enhancement based on improper notice under section 851), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 116 S.Ct. 577, 133 L.Ed.2d 500 (1995); <em>United States v. Morales, </em>854 F.2d 65, 68 (5th Cir.1988) (rejecting argument that probated sentence for possession of marihuana was not \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>841(b)(1)(A) enhancement), we have yet to expressly address this precise issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The Eleventh Circuit, in <em>United States v. Hansley, </em>54 F.3d 709, 715-16 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 116 S.Ct. 540, 133 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995), rejected an argument similar to that advanced by Sandle. In <em>Hansley, </em>the appellant challenging his enhancement under section 841(b)(1)(A) argued that Congress did not intend to subject \u201cmere possession offenses\u201d to the enhancement provision'. <em>Id. </em>at 717. Quoting the definition of \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d the Eleventh Circuit held that \u201cunder the plain language of the statute, it appears that a \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 includes <em>any </em>criminal conduct relating to narcotics, including simple possession, which a state has proscribed as a felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718 (emphasis in original). The Eleventh Circuit also observed that the use of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), which is limited to \u201c \u2018offense[s] under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii)), and thereby expressly excludes state convictions for simple possession, supports an inference that Congress intended no such limitation to apply in section 841(b)(1)(A). <em>See also United States v. Mabry, </em>3 F.3d 244, 251 (8th Cir.1993) (noting that \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d in section 841(a)(1)(B) is defined \u201cto include any felony drug offense under state law\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>511 U.S. 1020, 114 S.Ct. 1403, 128 L.Ed.2d 75 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">We find <em>Hansley </em>persuasive. Nothing in the statutory definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d suggests that the term is limited to those possession offenses involving an additional intent element. Neither section 841(b)(1)(A) nor section 802(44) is ambiguous in this regard. Although Sandle would have us look to the more restrictive definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under section 4B1.2(2) of the Sentencing Guidelines, we have no need to utilize the guidelines where the statute plainly mandates a more severe sentence. \u201c[T]he guidelines provide that \u2018[wjhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Levay, </em>76 F.3d 671, 674 (5th Cir.1996) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b) (1993)). <em>See also United States v. McGlory, </em>968 F.2d 309, 349 (3d Cir.1992) (rejecting appellant\u2019s position that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 definition of \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d should control for purposes of section 841(b)(1)(A) because the statutory definition was clear and not so limited), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 962, 113 S.Ct. 1388, 122 L.Ed.2d 763 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">We hold that the statutory definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d set forth in section 802(44) controls this appeal and that a felony state conviction for simple possession that otherwise qualifies under section 841(a)(1)(B) triggers that section\u2019s enhancement provision. The definition Sandle proffers from the guidelines is inapposite. It is undisputed that under Texas law Sandle\u2019s cocaine possession for which he was previously convicted by the Texas court constituted under Texas law a violation of that law\u2019s prohibition or restriction of conduct relating to narcotic drugs which was punishable under that law by imprisonment for more than one year. Sandle\u2019s prior Texas state conviction for cocaine possession was properly considered a prior felony drug offense under section 841(b)(1)(A)\u2019s enhancement provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">II. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">Sandle next argues that the district court erred by denying his objection to the presentence investigation report\u2019s attribution to him of the 683 grams of cocaine for which his co-conspirator Melvin Smith, the leader and organizer of the drug conspiracy, was held accountable. According to Sandle, as he was not involved in the drug conspiracy until February 1994, he should not have drugs from deals completed prior to his entry into the conspiracy attributed to him. Sandle argues that a lower figure \u2014 63.64 grams\u2014 should have been attributed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">Assuming Sandle\u2019s assertion to be true, his sentence is nevertheless supported under section 841(b)(1)(A), which calls for a minimum sentence of 240 months for prior felony drug offenders, like Sandle, who are convict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>ed of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute \u201c50 grams or more of a mixture or substance ... which contains cocaine base.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii); 846 (West Supp.1997). In his written objections to the presentence investigation report, Sandle expressly acknowledged that 63.64 grams of cocaine base were properly attributable to him. Had the district court not attributed the additional cocaine base to Sandle, it nevertheless could not have been any more lenient to him than it was. Even using solely Sandle\u2019s admitted amount, he would have received the mandatory statutory minimum \u2014 twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. His sentence could not have been any lower in light of his prior Texas state felony drug-conviction. Accordingly, any error (if there was any) in this regard was harmless. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>11 F.3d 1218, 1224-25 (5th Cir.) (rejecting sentencing challenge where either the amount attributed to appellant (13,600 kilograms) or the amount limited to the cocaine actually received by appellant (3,600 kilograms) would have resulted in the same offense level), <em>cert. denied, </em>511 U.S. 1129, 114 S.Ct. 2138, 128 L.Ed.2d 867 (1994). As the district court would necessarily have reached the same sentencing result regardless of Sandle\u2019s asserted error,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a remand is unnecessary. <em>Williams v. United States, 503 U.S. </em>193, 201-05, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1120-21, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">As the district court properly found that Sandle\u2019s 1992 Texas state felony drug conviction for cocaine possession triggered the enhanced sentencing provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), and because the asserted misattribution of an additional amount of cocaine base to Sandle over 63.64 grams, if indeed it was a misattribution, did not in any way affect, and could not have affected, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Sandle came within the terms of the statutory mandatory minimum sentence which the district court imposed in light of the 63.64 grams Sandle acknowledged were properly attributed to him, we AFFIRM Sandle\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-8\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, which defines the terms used in the career offender guideline (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-11\">\"(2) The term 'controlled substance offense\u2019 means an offense under a federal or state law prohibiting the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(2).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b853-11\">. Prior to 1984, the enhancement provision applied only to prior <em>federal </em>drug-related felonies. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (1981) (\"felony under any other provision, of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter or other <em>law of the United States </em>relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances\u201d) (emphasis added).
