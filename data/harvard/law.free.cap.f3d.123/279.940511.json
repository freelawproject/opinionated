McDermott,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the government mischaracterizes, misconstrues, or at a minimum misapprehends, our panel opinion when it characterizes our holding as determining that the Ross Group\u2019s leasehold collateral mortgage encumbered the tangible Foundry Property \u201cwhen it was repurchased by Debtor,\u201d and in concluding \u2014 based on this mischaracterization \u2014 that \u201cthe leasehold collateral mortgage and the federal tax liens encumbered that property at precisely the same moment.\u201d First, that incorrectly portrays both the holding and the analysis of the panel opinion; second, the operable facts of the instant case are substantially different or distinguishable from the facts in <em>McDermott.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>In <em>McDermott, </em>the mortgagor/tax lienee had no preexisting ownership or interest of any nature whatsoever in the subject properties; consequently, the date on which the lienee acquired the property indisputably was the first date on which the previously existing encumbrances could attach to that property. In stark contrast, the Debtor here owned the land in Tangipahoa Parish, built the facilities and located the tangible property thereon, (1) <em>before </em>consummating the financing deal with the Parish, under which the Debtor retained both possession and all incidents of ownership other than record title, pignoratively transferring record title only and \u201cleasing\u201d the property back while retaining the right to regain record title (upon elimination of the bond indebtedness) by exercising the so-called repurchase option (redemption agreement); (2) <em>before </em>entering into the loan transaction with the Ross Group involving, <em>inter alia, </em>the leasehold mortgage which included the Debt- or\u2019s assignment of the repurchase agreement to the Ross Group; and (3) <em>before </em>the filing of the federal tax liens. Not only was the recording of the collateral leasehold mortgage prior in time to the recording of the federal tax liens, but given the purely financing or pignorative nature of the arrangement and the absence of surrender by the Debtor of possession and ownership, the collateral mortgage became effective against all Foundry property <em>not </em>upon exercise of the repurchase agreement but from the very beginning <em>(ab initio). </em>Only by payment of the debt to the Ross Group or release or cancellation of its collateral mortgage could the Foundry property be freed of such encumbrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-14\">Finally, although we did not reach the question of the identity of the true beneficiary of the Debtor\u2019s exercise of the repurchase agreement (because we did not need to), we note in passing that \u2014 -because the repurchase option had been collaterally assigned to the Ross Group as mortgagee and remained thus assigned as of the time of its exercise \u2014 the redemption by the Debtor would have to be deemed to be for the benefit of the assignee of that option, i.e., the Ross Group, as mortgagee. Thus, regardless of confusion, if need be even record title would have passed from the Parish to the Ross Group, not the Debt- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>or, upon any exercise of the repurchase option, at least to the extent of the then-current balance due on the Debtor\u2019s indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-4\">When the panel opinion\u2019s Louisiana Civil Law analysis is considered in its entirety (the correctness of which the government, in its petition for rehearing expressly does not question), the position of the government that the panel \u201cignored material federal tax lien law in reaching its determination\u201d is shown to be demonstrably fallacious. Indeed, it is the government that would have us ignore the Civil Law analysis with which it does not quarrel when it urges us to apply McDermott<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and other clearly inapposite jurisprudence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1130-10\">. 507 U.S. 447, 113 S.Ct. 1526, 123 L.Ed.2d 128 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1130-11\">. True, a statement or two in the panel opinion, when viewed in a vacuum and out of context, provide the government with the proverbial reed against which to lean its characterization; but just as truly, that reed is too slender to support the government\u2019s position. For instance, we used the Latin phrases <em>ipso facto </em>and <em>nunc pro tunc </em>inadvisedly when we should have (and meant to) use <em>ab initio. </em>Slip op. at 37. Given the purely \u2014 and obviously \u2014 pignorative nature of the financing arrangement between the Debtor and the Parish, the Debtor/Mortgagor never relinquished ownership or possession of the tangible property or the land in question, only record title for encumbrance purposes, so that the Ross Group\u2019s mortgage attached <em>ab initio, </em>i.e., from the outset. There was nothing inchoate about it in the <em>McDermott </em>sense; the right of seizure and sale might be \"inchoate\u2019\u2019 until the debt secured is defaulted upon but the efficacy and ranking of the encumbrance is not inchoate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">. 507 U.S. 447, 113 S.Ct. 1526, 123 L.Ed.2d 128 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ABFY\">. <em>E.g., United States v.
