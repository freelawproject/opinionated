The defendants demurred generally, and the bill was dismissed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b58-6\"><em>Held, </em>that complainants\u2019 interest in having the mistake corrected was undoubted, and as the record in the foreclosure case, if not the decree itself, furnishes the means of determining <em>what </em>land was really meant, the lapse of time is no bar to such correction, as all the papers must be read together.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b58-7\"><em>Held, </em>further, that as the bill asks for an amendment of the decree, and shows sufficient cause for making it, the effect of the demurrer is destroyed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b58-8\"><em>Held, </em>further, that if a resale of the land should be found necessary, the purchasers of the remaining half of the land are necessary parties, and complainants would be entitled to the benefit of all their outlay for taxes paid on the land; but that if the mortgagor\u2019s conduct should be found to amount to a waiver, no resale would be necessary, unless defendants hold in good faith.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b58-9\"><em>Held, </em>further, that while considerable change may be required in' the bill, it contains enough equity to furnish the means of amendment, and as defendants\u2019 demurrer is <em>general, </em>they have no right to a dismissal of the bill.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-10\">Appeal <em>from </em>Eaton.

Chapin </em>and <em>Isaac, P. Christiancy, </em>for complainants :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-5\">Under the decisions of this Court, not one of the defendants can claim to be an innocent purchaser or encumbrancer. Every one of them was bound by the notice of <em>lis pendens, </em>and to examine the records: <em>Alterauge v. Christiansen, </em>48 Mich. 67; <em>Heim v. Ellis, </em>49 Id. 241; and such examination would have revealed the mistake in the decree and notice of sale, and in the commissionex,\u2019s deed; also the <em>subsequent </em>deed, containing the <em>right </em>description, and the deed by the right description to complainant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-6\">The defendants, therefoi\u2019e, had full constructive notice of the mistake in the decree, notice of sale, and commissionei\u2019\u2019s deed, and of complainants\u2019 claim, and they each and all knew that, except for this mistake, the deeds, contract, and mortgage were void, and could only be made operative by taking advantage of such error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-7\">Under such circumstances, there can be no question of the right of complainants to x-elief, and the protection of a court of equity; and \u201c mistakes are corrected, even where they occur in the records and proceedings of couifs and exist in the reeox\u2019ds themselves; and this will be done, not by reviewing the judgments or proceedings of these courts, but by restraining the parties who may take advantage of such mistakes from doing so, or by compelling them to execute proper papers for the purpose of such correction <em>Loss v. O'Bry, </em>22 N. J. Eq. 52; Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. \u00a7\u00a7 165, 166; <em>Quivey v. Baker, </em>37 Cal. 465; <em>Gump's Appeal, </em>65 Penn. St. 476; <em>Waldron v. Letson, </em>15 N. J.

The only interest they have was acquired at a foreclosure sale, upon a decree which failed to describe the land, and is that of a purchaser at a defective foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-10\">No notice of sale of <em>these </em>premises was ever given as required by law, which omission rendered the sale unwar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ranted and illegal: Rev. Stat. 1846. Chap. 79, Sec. 1; <em>Ireland v. Woolman, </em>15 Mich. 253; and a deed given under defective foreclosure proceedings is merely an assignment of the mortgage: 1 Jones on Mortg. \u00a7\u00a7 811-12; <em>Jackson v. Bowen, </em>7 Cow. 13; <em>Gilbert v. Cooley, </em>Walk. Ch. 494; <em>Nims v. </em>Sherman, 43 Mich. 50; and this places complainants in the position of mortgagees who are barred from foreclosing, since tlieir mortgage matured August 1, 1853, and more than thirty years have elapsed without any indorsement, and they have taken no proceedings to foreclose it: <em>Baent v. Kennicutt, </em>57 Mich. 271.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABn\">A bill could have been tiled at any time within -five years preceding September 30,1884, as pleadings date, as to allegations, from date of tiling: <em>Allen v. </em>Carpenter, 15 Mich. 41.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-6\">A.person guilty of laches ought to be able to furnish a reasonable excuse where the rights sought to be regained wer\u00f3 lost by mere delay: <em>Campau v. Chene, </em>1 Mich. 400; Jennison\u2019s Ch. Pr. 59.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-8\">\u25a0The bill sets'forth no contract between Ingersoll and Merrifield regarding this land. The policy of our statute is to have every agreement in reference to-land in writing, othef than a leasehold interest for one year: How. Stat. \u00a7 6179; <em>Hammond v. Hannin, </em>21 Mich. 382; <em>Taylor v. Boardman, </em>24 Id. 287; <em>Scott v. </em>Bush, 26 Id. 418; and an agent cannot \u2022be <em>verbally </em>empowered to make a binding contract for his principal for the purchase of land: <em>Powell v. Conant, </em>33 Mich. 398; <em>Colgrove v. Solomon, </em>34 Id. 494; and the same rule applies to an agent for the <em>sale </em>of land, and if Ingersoll had no such authority he was no agent: <em>Hammond v. Hannin, </em>21 Mich. 382.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-11\">The most that complainant could do, had he told Ingersoll of this defect and given\u2019him the money with which to purchase the land, would-be to sue at law for the recovery of the money; he could-not disturb Ingersoll\u2019s title: How. Stat. \u00a7 5569; <em>Weare v. </em>Linnell, 29 Mich. 227; <em>Tyler v. Peatt, </em>30 Id. 63; <em>Cobb v. Cook, </em>49 Id. 11.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AA\">Campbell, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0H\">Complainants seek relief under the following circumstances: In 1850 one Jane W. Foot I mortgaged the N. E. I of section 33, in township 3 N., of range 3 W., to one Charles B. Cham\u2019plin, who assigned it to Horace S. Isinon, who foreclosed it in chancery, and ob; .tained a decyee June \u20196, 1856. This decree contained\u2019 an error whereby it ordered\u2019 the S. E: \u00a3 instead of the N. E; <em>\\ </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>to be sold. If the decree was in the usual form, it contained such a reference to the mortgage as would have furnished on its face the means of correction. As no copy of it was attached to the bill in this cause, we do not know its. precise form.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The sale under this decree was made to the complainant, Mr. Ismon, under the same erroneous description. Ismon transferred by proper description the E. <em>\u00bd </em>of the N. E. \u00bd of section 33 to parties under whom complainants hold title; They have paid taxes, but have never taken actual possession ; but it has been known as theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In 1881 defendant Arthur Ingersoll applied to complainants to become their agent for its sale. Upon investigating the title, the error in the decree was discovered, and it was concluded not to sell until it could be rectified. Ingersoll secretly found out Mrs. Eoot, and got a deed from her, and mortgaged the property to defendant Edgerton, and then sold to defendant Piatt, under whom the remaining defendants claim. The bill seeks relief against these parties, and to rectify the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">All the defendants joined in a demurrer, which was probably designed to be a general demurrer fcjr want of equity, although not conforming exactly to that pleading. It contains no specific suggestions, and has been treated as a general demurrer. \"We may so regard it, and, as no other grounds appear, it must be governed by the rules applicable, to such a demurrer. The court below dismissed the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">If this bill had been specially demurred to, it contains serious defects. There is not enough averred, inasmuch as complainants are not in possession, to show that this mistake in the decree was rectified on the sale, so as to identify the land sold as the true parcel. Neither is it shown, although very probably such was the fact, that the conduct or acquiescence of Mrs. Eoot after the decree waived any such defect in the sale. If it becomes necessary to correct the decree and resell, then the parties interested in the other half of the land should have been brought in.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">But there is no doubt of complainants\u2019 interest in having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the mistake rectified. As the chancery record, if not the decree itself, furnishes means of determining what land wa3 really meant, the lapse of time will not prevent the correction, as all the papers must be read together: <em>Emery v. Whitwell, </em>6 Mich. <em>474; Montgomery v. </em>Merrill, 36 Mich. 102; <em>Souvais v. </em>Leavitt, 53 Mich. 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The bill asks for an amendment of the decree, and shows sufficient cause for making it. This is enough to destroy the effect of the general demurrer. Complainants show, also, sufficient reason for having the decree carried into effect if it should turn out that a new sale is necessary; and if that is done, they would, of course, be entitled to the benefit of all their outlays for taxes. But in order to have a resale, the purchasers of the rest of the property covered by the decree should be brought in. If Mrs. Foot\u2019s conduct has amounted to a waiver, no resale would be necessary, if defendants do not hold in good faith, as on the bill they do not appear to.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">While all these considerations may render it necessary to make considerable changes in the bill, it has enough equity to furnish-means of amendment, and defendants, by raising no points by their demurrer to defects of parties or other omissions, have no right to a dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The decree dismissing the bill must be reversed, with costs of both courts, and defendants required to answer. Complainants may amend at any time within forty days, or dismiss their bill without prejudice, if they shall choose to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
