The \u201cground wire\u201d was attached to an iron rod driven into the earth at \u00a1the inner edge of the sidewalk beside the store window, some months \u25a0before, for telegraph purposes, at which time a plank in the sidewalk was removed, and when replaced was not fastened down, and, by reason of the rod and wire, projected a few inches <em>into </em>the street beyond \u25a0the <em>outer edge </em>of the sidewalk. Defendant\u2019s employees, in making said attachment, removed this loose plank, and replaced it in its for- . uner position. Some time afterwards plaintiff, in alighting from his \u00a1buggy, stepped upon the end of the plank, which flew up, striking ' (him violently in the face and injuring him quite severely.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b361-10\">\u2022 <em>Held, </em>that defendant was not responsible for the accident. 1 It did \u25a0nothing to <em>create </em>the danger, and had no duty to perform in regard to \u00a1a sidewalk on premises over which it had no authority or.supervision; \u2022and that any principle that would impose liability in such a case would hold an individual liable for future mischief from any plank \u25a0or other thing which he may intentionally or casually.have disturbed, \u00a1and put back again where he found it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-11\">Error to Kent.

The owner in possession, and the occupant .of the premises, are responsible for any injuries resulting from imperfect construction of a sidewalk, or openings in it, or from the sidewalk becoming out of repair and dangerous; and any such opening or excavation which makes the sidewalk or highway less safe for public travel is a nuisance, and the person who' Created or <em>continues </em>the nuisance is liable, irrespective of the question of negligence: 2 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (2d ed.) \u00a7 <em>794; Dygert v. Schenck, </em>23 Wend. 445; <em>Congreve v. Smith, </em>18 N. Y. 79; <em>Congreve v. Morgan, </em>Id. 84; <em>Irvine v. Wood, </em>51 Id. 224; <em>Davenport v.

The owner is responsible in a case where he leases property with' such a nuisance in the highway, and the tenant or occupant becomes also responsible when he takes possession and uses the premises in their defective condition. It is no defense, to ah action against a'ten\u00e1nt or occupant of premises for such a defect in the highway that the premises were out of repair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>and dangerous when he took-possession; Coupland <em>v.

If he makes any use \u25a0of an erection placed by others on his premises, such use is \u25a0certainly evidence tending to show that he adopts and maintains it. Whether such use is sufficient to show that he did adopt and maintain it is for the jury to determine upon all the circumstances of the case. It certainly is not necessary that the injury should result from the particular use.which the defendant made of the <em>obstruction Inhabitants of Stoughton v. Porter, </em>95 Mass. (13 Allen) 191.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-5\"><em>Wm. H. Wells </em>and <em>Ashley Pond, </em>for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-6\">There was no evidence that the act of defendant was negligent, or that it occasioned the injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-7\">\u2022 The act of the defendant in connecting the ground wire \u2022of the instrument with the rod driven into the ground at the side of the building, in order safely to dispose of excessive electric currents, was not in itself unlawful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-8\">If the street had been a legal highway, it was one of the purposes for which the owner or occupant of adjacent property could'lawfully use it. - -</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-9\">The use of a highway in connection with contiguous property is not <em>per se </em>a nuisance. It becomes a nuisance if it causes an unreasonable obstruction to travel, or is perilous in itself ; or if the manner of use is negligent: <em>Fisher v. Thirkell, </em>21 Mich. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-10\">If one places an obstruction in-a highway, or makes an excavation in it, or otherwise makes use of it for .private ends, his duty is to restpre it to its former condition. This is all the public can require of him: <em>Dygert v. Schenck, </em>23 Wend. 446; Wood\u2019s Law of Nuisance, \u00a7 276.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-11\">The defendant\u2019s act'was not a malfeasance, because it was lawful in itself, and did not' cause an -impairment of the former condition of the walk.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-12\">The effort of counsel was to bring the c\u00e1se within <em>Fisher </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>v. Thirkell, </em>21 Mich. 1, but manifestly there was no tenancy whatever.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b364-4\">Campbell, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abo\">Plaintiff sued defendant for a personal' injury, which is charged in the declaration as the result of defendant\u2019s carelessness in taking up a sidewalk plank, and not fastening it, whereby, when it was stepped on, it flew up- and injured plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The facts were that defendant set up its instruments in-the drug store of one Loomis, in the village of Sparta, Kent county, and he became its agent. The wires passed into the store at the inner end of the sidewalk, where- there was an iron post just below the level of the plank,, to which an attachment was made for some purpose connected with the-working of the instruments. This post was already there-when the arrangements were made. To reach it a plank had to be lifted up, which was already loose, and it was put back, and left in the same condition, with, the outer end projecting somewhat beyond the other plank.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In September, 1883, some months after the wires were fastened, plaintiff drove up beside the- walk, and stepped upon the end of this loose plank, which flew up- in his face,, broke his nose, and otherwise injured him..</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Defendant did not own or control the store,and had nothing to do with maintaining the sidewalk in order. The walk was-left by defendant in the same condition in which it was found.. Under such circumstances it is impossible to hold defendant responsible for the accident. It did nothing to create the-danger, and had no duty to perform in regard to- a walk on premises over which it had no authority or supervision. The court below so ruled, and there was no error in the ruling. Any principle that would impose liability in such a case-would hold any individual liable for future mischief from, any plank or other thing which he may intentionally or casually have disturbed, and put back again where he found, it\u00bb The doctrine has no foundation in reason\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"AIO\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-9\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
