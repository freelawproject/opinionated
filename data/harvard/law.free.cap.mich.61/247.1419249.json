The omission in a complaint for larceny in justice\u2019s court, and in the warrant issued thereon, of the <em>Christian </em>name of the owner of the <em>stolen </em>property, is an <em>irregularity </em>which \u25a0 respondent might <em>waive, </em>and which could be <em>cured </em>by amendment under How.

II. Bartow </em>and <em>F. D. M. Dams, </em>for respondent:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-5\">Th<em>e first </em>complaint was <em>not fatally </em>defective in omitting the Christian name of the owner of the stolen property; such defect was at most a mere irregularity, curable by amendment under How. Stat. \u00a7 9537, which, while referring to indictments, is applicable to criminal proceedings in justice\u2019s court: <em>Near v. Van Alstyne, </em>14 Wend. 230; and the filing and service of notice of the omitted name amounted to such amendment. The respondent could no longer be misled, and the court thereupon had jurisdiction to try said cause; and having acquired jurisdiction, a conviction or acquittal is a bar to further prosecution for the same offense, although the proceedings are so defective that they might be reversed on error: Tiff. Cr. Law, 400; <em>Stevens v. Fassett, </em>27 Me. 266; if this be so, the trial and disagreement of the jury placed respondent in legal jeopardy, and he is protected by the constitutional inhibition: 1 Bishop\u2019s Cr. Law, \u00a7 1016; <em>People v. Jones, </em>48 Mich. 555; <em>People v. Webb, </em>38 Cal. 467; <em>Hines v. State, </em>24 Ohio, 134; <em>Joy v. State, </em>14 Ind. 139.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-8\">Jeopardy having thus attached, the prosecuting officer is not entitled during the trial to enter a <em>nolle pros., </em>or if he enters it, even with the consent of the court, or withdraws a juror and thus prevents further hearing, the legal effect is an acquittal: 1 Bishop\u2019s Cr. Law, \u00a7 1016; <em>People v. Jones, </em>48 Mich. 555; and he may plead such former acquittal, or prove it under plea of not guilty, or may do both: How. Stat. \u00a7 9070; <em>Clem v. State, </em>42 Ind. 420.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-11\"><em>Moses Taggart, </em>Attorney General, for the People:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-12\">To constitute a sufficient plea in bar of former acquittal, the offenses must be identical.in fact and law, and this allegation should be specifically made: 1 Bishop\u2019s Cr. Proc\u2019d, \u00a7 580; <em>Rex v. Dann, </em>1 Moody, 424;</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-14\">An examination of the plea shows that in the <em>first </em>complaint the stolen property is alleged to be the property of \u201cMr. Smith,\u201d and in the <em>second </em>of Stanley P. Smith, and the complaining witness is different in each complaint; hence respondent\u2019s plea was insufficient: <em>Com. v. Andrews, </em>2 Mass. 408; 1 Russell on Crimes, p. 62; 1 Bishop\u2019s Crim. Law, \u00a7 1053; <em>Morgan v. State, </em>34 Texas, 677.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-16\">The only way of taking advantage of a former acquittal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>is by this plea, and not by motion in arrest of judgment: 1 Bishop\u2019s Crim. Proc\u2019d, \u00a7 579; <em>State v. </em>Barnes, 32 Me. 530; hence respondent\u2019s motion for a discharge, based on the claim that the evidence showed his former trial and acquittal for the same offense, was not well founded, even if the facts were as claimed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-4\">To constitute such former trial and acquittal a bar, the trial must have been on a valid complaint or indictment, so that the judgment rendered would be legal and binding on respondent: Archbold\u2019s Crim. Pr. &amp; Pl. (8th ed.) pp. 338-47; <em>Kohlheimer v. </em>State, 39 Miss. 548; <em>Com. v. </em>Roby, 12 Pick. 503; 1 Bishop\u2019s Crim. Law, \u00a7 1021.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-5\">The first complaint was made simply upon information, and alleges \u201c that the complainant hath just cause to suspect, and does suspect, that respondent did feloniously steal,\u201d etc., the property. It was insufficient to confer any jurisdiction on the justice: <em>People v. Heffron, </em>53 Mich. 527; and while this Court, in <em>People v. Harding, </em>Id. 486, suggested that the privilege and right was enlarged by the Const. Art. 7, \u00a7 29, we do not understand the court to intimate that an absolutely void proceeding can be held a trial on the merits and a bar to further prosecution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-7\">It has been held that where an indictment is quashed upon defendant\u2019s motion, he cannot assert thereafter that it was good and insist that he was placed in jeopardy thereunder : 1 Russell on Crimes, p. 60 (n.); <em>Joy v. State, </em>14 Ind. 139; and it is suggested that this rule should beheld applicable to this case, even though respondent\u2019s motion was denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-8\">A trial resulting in a disagreement of the jury is no bar to a future trial: Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim. 404; <em>People v. Goodwin, </em>18 Johns. 202; <em>People v. Schoeneth, </em>44 Mich. 490-1; <em>People v. Harding, </em>53 Id. 482-88; <em>State v. Nelson, </em>26 Ind. 366; <em>U. S. v. Perez, </em>9 Wheat. 579; <em>Com. v. Tuck, </em>20 Pick. 356; <em>Ex parte Laughlin, </em>41 Cal. 211.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b303-10\">Sherwood, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahk\">The respondent was prosecuted before a justice of the peace, in the county of Ionia, for stealing a horse-blanket of the value of three 'dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Upon the trial the jury disagreed, and were discharged, and the canse was continued until the fifteenth of December, 18S5, at which time the prosecuting attorney <em>nolle prosequied </em>the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">On the same day, and after the discharge of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>a new complaint was made, and warrant issued by the same justice, charging the respondent with the same offense; and, on being arrested and taken before the justice, he pleaded the first proceedings against him, and his discharge by the court, in bar. To this plea demurrer was interposed by the prosecuting attorney. The demurrer was sustained by the justice, and respondent excepted. A trial was then had, and the respondent was convicted of the larceny. He then took his appeal to the circuit court, where the same ruling was had upon the demurrer; and, on trial being had in the circuit, he was again convicted, and he now brings the case here on exceptions before sentence for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The only exceptions of importance go to the sufficiency of the plea in bar, and the refusal of the court to quash the proceedings on motion of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The complaint and warrant in the first case did not state the first name of the party who owned the stolen property, but notice was thereafter given to respondent what the name was. It was a matter which might have been waived by the respondent, and the irregularity was one which might have been cured by amendment under our statute: How. Stat. \u00a7 9537; <em>People </em>v. Henssler, 48 Mich. 49. The complaint in the first case, with such amendments as might have been properly made thereto, or-if the irregularities to which our attention has been called had been waived by the respondent, would have been sufficient to support a judgment against the respondent had the first jury convicted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The question still remains, regarding the complaint and warrant in that case sufficient to have supported a conviction if one had been had, does the disagreement of the jury and the <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the case, and discharge of the respondent, furnish him a perfect defense on the trial for the same offense upon the merits? If the case had not been <em>nolle prosequied </em>it certainly would not: <em>People v. </em>Green, 13 Wend. 55; <em>U. S. v. </em>Perez, 9 Wheat. 579; <em>People v. </em>Webb, 38 Cal. 467; <em>People v. Dowd, </em>44 Mich. 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">It is not claimed by the defense, as I understand the case, that had the public prosecutor, at any time before the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>was impaneled, discontinued proceedings against the respondent, he would have imperiled the people\u2019s right to further prosecute him. If this be so, and the jury\u2019s failure to agree-did not place the respondent in jeopardy, it is a little difficult to see how both these things occurring could place him in jeopardy. I confess my judgment fails to approve the reasoning by which such a result can be worked out.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">In all such cases there may be special and good reasons why the prosecutor may desire to commence the proceedings against the respondent <em>de </em>novo, and avoid technicalities which always beset every step taken in the progress of a criminal trial when the respondent makes a contest, and which so frequently deprive the people of a successful result when the proceedings are reviewed in courts of last resort; and such a course, when taken in good faith, is not subject to criticism, but rather to be encouraged on the part of public prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">I find no error in. the proceedings had in this case requiring us to discharge this -respondent, and the circuit judge is advised to proceed to judgment in the case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-6\">Champlin,\" J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b305-7\">Campbell, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9M\">(dissenting). In this case the jury, after being out only fifteen minutes, announced they were ready to render their verdict, and then stated they disagreed. I do&gt; not think that so speedy a discharge, which was evidently determined on by the jury for themselves, is within any admissible discretionary power of a justice, and it was, I think, illegal, and no further trial was proper.</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-8\">Morse, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
