It was based upon the proposed purchase of land, and to hold this portion of the agreement <em>incidental </em>to or <em>severable </em>from the other portions does violence to every part thereof. A promise to <em>sell </em>land to a <em>third </em>party is within the statute: <em>Trowbridge v.

Of course, if either of these points is well taken, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The language of the statute relied upon (How. Stat. .\u00a7 6181) is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Every contract for the leasing, for a longer period than \u25a0one year, or for the sale of any lands, or any interest in lands, shall be void, unless the contract, or some note or memorandum thereof, be in writing, and signed by the party fey whom the lease or sale is to be made, or by some person ithereunto by him lawfully authorized by writing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">This statute has frequently been before this Court for construction, and it has been held that a contract which is void under the statute of frauds cannot be used for any purpose: <em>Chamberlain v. Dow, </em>10 Mich. 319; <em>Hall v. Soule, </em>11 Id. 494; <em>Holland v. Hoyt, </em>14 Id. 238; <em>Grimes v. Van Vechten, </em>20 Id. 410; <em>Scott v. Bush, </em>26 Id. 421; <em>Detroit, H. &amp; I. R. R. Co. v. Forbes, </em>30 Id. 176; <em>Hillebrands v. Nibbelink, </em>40 Id. 646; <em>Sutton v. Rowley, </em>44 Id. 112. Such a contract is regarded as a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">It has been also held that not only is a verbal contract for the sale of lands void, but that a verbal agreement by one to purchase an interest in lands for another is void:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Dwight v. Cutler, </em>3 Mich. 573; <em>Bomier v. Caldwell, </em>8 Id. 463; <em>Hogsett v. Ellis, </em>17 Id. 364, 365; <em>Abell v. Munson, </em>18 Id. 312; <em>Scott v. Bush, </em>26 Id. 418; <em>De Moss v. Robinson, </em>46 Id. 62; <em>Wetmore v. Neuberger, </em>44 Id. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>It now remains to' consider liow stands the case of the plaintiff under the statute and the foregoing decisions of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The action is to recover damages for refusing to perform an agreement to form a copartnership involving the purchase of lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The contract of copartnership which is set up in the declaration, and which it is averred the defendants agreed to make, was for the purchase of land containing a large quantity of pine timbei\u2019, from which the manufacture and sale of lumber was to be the business carried on. The land had not yet been purchased when the agreement sued upon is alleged to have been made, nor had anjr contract yet been made for the purchase thereof from the owner. By the terms of the agreement the defendants were to negotiate for the purchase for the parties, take the title in their names, and pay the purchase money therefor; the defendants to be the owners of two-thirds and the plaintiff one-third of the property, when thus purchased, and the plaintiff to 'reimburse the defendants for his one-third of the purchase price in his sawing and converting the timber into lumber for sale. Clearly, we think, the agreement sued upon included a contract for the sale of land which was not in writing, and void under the statute of frauds, above given.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The contract for the purchase of the land was included in the agreement to engage in the copartnership, and is made the basis thereof, and the failure of the defendants to perform their undertakings relating thereto, as stated in the agreement sued upon, constitutes the plaintiff\u2019s sole ground for the damages he claims to have sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In the case of <em>Levy v. </em>Brush, 45 N. Y. 589, it was held, where a verbal agreement was entered into between the plaintiff and defendant, by which the latter agreed to purchase land, and pay therefor from his own funds the necessary amount for that purpose, for the joint benefit of both, the plaintiff to reimburse one-half the money so paid, the deed to be taken in the names of both, the defendant having made the purchase, and taken the contract in his own name, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u00a1refused to convey one-half to the plaintiff, that no action would lie to compel the execution of the agreement; that the case was within the statute of frauds; and that the defendant had a perfect right, both at law and in equity, to refuse performance.</p>\n<p id=\"A0d\">In <em>Rawdon v. </em>Dodge, 40 Mich. 698, the agreement was verbal that Dodge should cause to be conveyed to Kawdon an interest in land held by one Sayles; and Mr. Justice Graves, in delivering the opinion of the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB6\">\u201c It is not claimed that written evidence was not necessary to show the agreement for the transfer of the equity of re-demption, or that there was any such evidence, and the record imports that no proper writing was ever made. The agreement was that an interest held by Sayles in the land should be conveyed to Kawdon, and the transaction was within the words and policy of the statute. How. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 6119-6181. The fact that the interest to be transferred was not then in Dodge, but was vested in Sayles, could make no difference. It was a contract for the sale of an interest in land, and it is not important that the title then resided in a third person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">See, also, <em>Wright v. De Groff, </em>14 Mich. 164; <em>Scott v. Bush, </em>29 Id. 523; <em>Erben v. Lorillard, </em>19 N. Y. 299; <em>Purcell v. Coleman, </em>4 Wall. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Other authorities might be cited, but we think the above are conclusive upon the point, and show clearly that the agreement relied upon by the plaintiff is within the statute of frauds, and that the following instruction requested by the defendants\u2019 counsel should have been given to the jury, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">' \u201c The contract upon which this action is based, and which is set up in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, is not alleged to be in writing, and therefore, being within the statute of frauds, is of no force to bind any one, and it is your duty to find for the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">There is no occasion \u2018for considering the other questions raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new \u00bfrial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b603-11\">'The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-12\"> See <em>Carr v. Leavitt, </em>54 Mich. 542, for a case where a contract involving the xmrchase and sale of land was held <em>not </em>within the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
