Respondents were convicted of failing to keep their saloon closed oo Sunday. The evidence disclosed that they carried on their business in a building containing three rooms on the ground floor, one used for the sale of tobacco and cigars, one for the sale of liquor, and the third as a card-room; that the cigar and tobacco room was in the front end of the building, facing the street, over the front door of which was the word '\u2022 Saloon,\u201d tbat this room was divided from the one where liquors were sold by a partition, in which were two doors, one near the center and the other opening into the liquor-room from behind the tobacco-counter; that the card-room was in the rear, andi that the only way of entering the liquor-room was from the tobacco and cigar room or by the back door of the building. Testimony was given tending to show that persons were seen <em>in </em>the room where liquors were sold, and going <em>out </em>of the <em>back </em>door of the building, on the Sunday in question, and it was undisputed that the tobacco and cigar room was open and parties entered same by the front door; but respondents testified that the doors leading therefrom were fastened and not opened on the Sunday named</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"APd\"><em>Held, </em>that the court properly left it for the jury to say <em>what </em>rooms constituted the saloon.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-8\">2.

Under the facts stated in the testimony we think the question was properly submitted to-the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The court, in charging the jury, in commenting on the character of the defendants\u2019 business, used the following language :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">\u201cYou, gentlemen, may be prejudiced against a man who-is engaged in the liquor traffic; you may possibly think that it is a very poor business for a man to be engaged in ;. no one would, perhaps, quarrel with you if you did. There is probably no saloon-keeper in the State of Michigan but who is ashamed of the business himself, unless he has been in the business so long as to destroy all sense of that kind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">This had better have been omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The liquor business is as lawful as any other business under the laws of this State when it is carried on within the restrictions established by the Legislature, and rights thereunder should be respected and protected by courts as carefully, and) to the same extent, as those existing in any other kind of business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is with the legal features of the business, like-irregularities in any other business, that courts have to do, and those only, when cases are brought before them for adjudication; and the same caution should be observed'by the trial judge in conducting the proceedings before the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that is required in other cases, and nothing allowed tobe done or said which would operate to the prejudice of either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Jurors are apt in discovering the leaning of courts, in anjease, so long as they have respect for the judgment of the presiding judge, and almost invariably adopt his views upon questions of fact as well as of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We feel quite satisfied, however, in this case, whatever error might have occurred in this direction was fully cured by the other portions of the charge, and the circuit judge is advised to proceed to judgment in the case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b301-6\">Campbell, C.
