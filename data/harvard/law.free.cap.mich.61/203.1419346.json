Complainant was induced to join with her husband in a deed of a farm in Ohio, on which they had resided since their marriage, by his representations that he would invest a portion of the purchase price in a small place near a neighboring city, and place the balance at interest, thereby insuring for them a more comfortable support. Soon after the sale her husband visited the State of Michigan, and on his return informed complainant that he had purchased a farm in the last-named State, to which the parties removed, and on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>they lived until the husband\u2019s death. After this event, complainant learned that the deed to the Michigan farm had been taken in the name of the children of her husband by a former wife, who had reconveyed to him a life-estate in the land, and who <em>soon </em>afterwards conveyed it to defendant Woodworth. After their father\u2019s death they denied the right of complainant to any interest in the land, whereupon she filed a bill to establish her dower rights therein.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-4\">On a review of the testimony [see opinion] the court affirmed the decree of the lower court in complainant\u2019s favor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-5\">2.

It fixed the property in deceased for his life, the same as if the deed' from Holmes had been made directly to him, and the only real difference was that he could not dispose of the title so as to cut off his lawful heirs at his death. The whole transaction is in effect similar to that of a will for some consideration, and, had it not been tainted with fraud upon complainant, might have been regarded as a proper testamentary act; but if such it would not defeat complainant\u2019s right of dower: 1 Jarman on Wills, pp. 36 and 37 (n. 10); <em>Miller v. </em>Stepper, 32 Mich. 198.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-13\">The deceased, having paid the entire consideration for the lands, would, at common law, have had a trust estate therein. Under our law a widow may have a dower interest in an equitable estate. Were it not for our statute abolishing such trust estates, there would be no question about complainant's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>right. But, although the statute may be a sufficient answer to any such claim on the part of one furnishing the means but having property deeded to a third person, still we do not perceive how this should cut off the right of his widow, especially if the property was thus conveyed with an intent to defeat her of her dower. In <em>Brown v. </em>Bronson, 35 Mich. 415, the property was conveyed <em>before </em>the marriage, consequently the husband of the complainant did not, at any time during the marriage, have an interest in the land that would have been recognized in his behalf by any court of justice, either in law. or in equity; yet her right was sustained. This was only following the well-settled principle that-dower is a right to be favored and carefully guarded and protected by the courts: <em>Cranson v. Cranson, </em>4 Mich. 236; <em>Greiner v. Klein, </em>28 Id. 16; <em>Miller v. Stepper, 32 </em>Id. <em>194; Tabele v. Tabele, </em>1 Johns. Ch. 45; <em>Swaine v. Perine, </em>5 Id. 482.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-4\">Our statute granting the widow a-right of dower in the real estate of her deceased husband, as also that of uses and trusts, seem to have been copied from similar ones in New York. In that state, however, it appears to be well settled' that where the purchase money of premises is paid by a husband, but the conveyance taken in the name of a third person, still the wife will have a dower interest in such lands in case of the husband\u2019s death. The law of that state is clearly <em>distinguished </em>from that of the common law upon this question: <em>Hawley v. James, </em>5 Paige, 452-3; <em>Ambrose v. Ambrose, </em>1 P. Wms. Rep. 321.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-5\">The claim is made that defendant Woodworth was a <em>bona .fide </em>purchaser of these premises, and for that reason should be protected against any dower interest that complainant may have. This ground we do not think tenable for several reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">1. He was not a purchaser in good faith; he lived-near' by, and was well acquainted with the deceased\u2019s family; he knew it w,as- not the money of the heirs that paid for the land, that there was a claim that complainant had a dower interest; and he himself claims to have bought the land to accommodate Anson Bear, one of the \u2019 other defendants. <em>p</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajb\">2. His own testimony shows that \u2022 Anson Bear acted as his agent in negotiating the purchase of the land from the other heirs; hence whatever knowledge or notice of complainant\u2019s rights Anson Bear may have had was notice to him. This principle is well sustained: <em>Huff v. Farwell, </em>67 Iowa, 298; <em>Henkel v. Welsh, </em>41 Mich. <em>666.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-8\">3. Had he been a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, as claimed, still, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>this case, we do not think that such fact would avail him anything. 1 Story\u2019s Eq. Jr. \u00a7 630.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-4\"><em>Foote c&amp; MeCcoll </em>and <em>Van Zile &lt;&amp; </em>Fox, for defendants :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-5\">The questions involved in this case, and upon which it must be decided, are-three, viz.:</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-6\">1. Was complainant\u2019s husband, at any time during their marriage, <em>seized </em>of an estate of <em>inheritance </em>in the lands in \u25a0question ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-7\">2. Was he, or any person acting for or in his behalf, guilty \u25a0of fraud which resulted in depriving complainant of her dower in this land, or of such a fraud as a court of law or equity would, in order to correct, set aside the conveyance to the defendants so far as it affected_ complainant\u2019s dower?</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-8\">3. If the conclusion arrived at in answering these questions will not warrant a-decree for the complainant, then was -Jacob Bear possessed of such an <em>equitable </em>title as will warrant the court in awarding her such dower ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-9\">The statute provides that the widow shall be entitled to dower, etc., \u201cof all the lands whereof her husband <em>was seized \u2022of an estate of inheritance, </em>at any time during the marriage, unless she is lawfully barred thereof.\u201d How. Stat. \u00a7 5733.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-10\">The proofs, and the allegations in the bill and answer, show that Jacob Bear never had any legal title to the lands, except the life-estate; that they were conveyed directly to his children by and with his consent and approval; and that he after-wards recognized the title in his children by taking a life lease from them of the premises. We submit, therefore, that there is no proof in this case upon which to base an argument that J acob Bear was ever possessed of any <em>legal </em>title amounting to an estate of inheritance in the lands in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-11\">The widow\u2019s dower in lands is a mere continuance of the estate of inheritance of her husband, and is derived from and dependent upon it; consequently when <em>his </em>estate is defeated <em>\u25a0her </em>right of dower ceases. In no case can a widow maintain \u2022a claim for dower against a party whose title is <em>paramount </em>to that of her husband.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-12\">In this case the title of these defendants, and especially of John Woodworth, is <em>paramount </em>to any title that was ever obtained by Jacob Bear. <em>Emerson v. Harris, </em>6 Metc. 475-7-8; <em>Firestone v. </em>Firestone, 2 Ohio St. 415; <em>In re </em>Ransom, 17 Fed. Rep. 331.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-13\">Before dower can attach the husband must at least be seized of an <em>equitable </em>estate of inheritance in the land in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>'dower is claimed at the time of Ins death: <em>In re Ransom, </em>17 Fed. Rep. 331; <em>Lobdell v. Hayes, </em>4 Allen, 190; <em>Abbott v. Bosworth, </em>36 Ohio St. 607; <em>Rand v. Kendall, </em>15 Ohio R. 671.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-4\">It is nowhere claimed in this case that Jacob Bear ever had or was entitled to receive, either in law or equity, an \u2022estate of inheritance in the land in question. In an action \u2022at law it was necessary to allege the estate that was entitled to dower: <em>Emerson v. Harris, </em>6 Metc. 177.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">The widow, in her action for dower, can recover only upon the strength of her husband\u2019s title, and she <em>must show a seizin in him during coverture, </em>or she will fail in her suit: Tyler on Infancy and Coverture, p. 640; <em>Poor v. Horton, </em>15 Barb. 185; <em>Keator v. Dimmick, </em>16 Id. 158.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">If the land had been conveyed directly to Jacob Bear, by Holmes, and he had conveyed to his children at the time Holmes made his deed, the widow would not have been entitled to dower, for the reason that she was a non-resident of the State: How. Stat. \u00a7 5753; <em>Ligare v. Semple, </em>32 Mich. 113-5; and if it should be contended that the conveyance from Holmes to the children of Jacob Bear will in eqrcity be considered, and subjected to the same rules of law, as a conveyance to Jacob Bear, and from him to his children \u2014 -which is the most that can be claimed \u2014 the authority above cited disposes of complainant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">Defendant John. Woodworth, the present owner, was an innocent purchaser of the land, having no knowledge of complainant\u2019s claim: Kerr on Frauds, 312-13; <em>Loomis v. Brush, </em>36 Mich. 45-8; <em>Holcomb v.

W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>fractional \u25a0\u00a3 of section 5, in town 3 N., range 4 W., excepting the east 9.28 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">That in August, 1882, she returned to Ohio, and there learned that the farm had not been deeded to her husband, but that he had caused the same to be conveyed to his children, and had done so for the purpose of cutting complainant off forever <em>from </em>having any right of dower or interest therein ; that on her return home to Eaton county she informed her husband of what she .had heard concerning the conveyance to his children, whereupon he positively denied that such was the case, but that the same was deeded to himself ; that Anson Bear, who was then working the farm on shares, positively denied to her that the deed ran to the children, and she did not learn differently until after the death of her husband, which occurred on December 18, 18S2.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">That soon after the death of her husband she was informed by some of the children of Jacob Bear that she had no right upon said place, or interest therein ; and upon investigation she charges that Jacob Bear, at the time he purchased the premises of Horatio N. Holmes,'caused the deed thereof to be made to his said six children direct from said Holmes; that none of said children paid any part of the consideration of said purchase, and that her husband paid the whole of the consideration and purchase price of said land out of the proceeds from the sale of the Ohio farm, and before the delivery of the deed to the children th.ey executed back to him certain deeds purporting to convey to him a life-estate in said lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">That about the thirtieth day of March, 1883, defendants Anson Bear, Joseph Bear, and Henry Bear, also Mary Culp, Louisa Thomas, and Matilda Stahl, executed a warranty deed of said lands to John Woodworth; that the consideration named in such deed is $5,100, and the title now appears\u2019 to be in him, but on information and belief she charges that said Woodworth well knew her rights in the land described in the deed to him; that he has never taken possession or exercised any rights of ownership of said land, but the premises have all the time, since the death of Jacob Bear, been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>in the possession of his six children, and now is in the possession of Anson Bear, whom she believes to bo the owner thereof ; that the deed to Woodworth was made for the sole aud only purpose of defeating her ont of her dower in such lands, of which Woodworth was knowing at the time, and she, on belief, charges that Woodworth, at the time of the delivery of the deed to him, executed a deed or other conveyance back to said parties, or some of them, or made some other agreement for such conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">She states that these lands were the only lands owned by her husband at the time of his death ; that no provision was ever made.by her husband for her ; that she has never had out of his personal estate to exceed the sum of $125 since his death, and no support therefrom ; that when her husband sold his property in Ohio, about nine months before bis death, he was worth at least $6,000 ; that, supposing her said husband would deal fairly with her, and not attempt to defeat her just rights in the property they had so jointly accumulated, she had used much of her own property to assist her own children, whom she had been impelled to require to shift for themselves in earlylife while her husband had the use of her said property ; that she now has but little means left, is lame from the effect of a broken limb, so that she is compelled to walk with a cane, and is liable to become dependent upon her friends and relatives for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">That the procuring of the deed from said Horatio N. Holmes to his children and taking back a life-estate, as herein-before stated, was but a testamentary act on the part of Jacob Bear, and could in nowise defeat complainant of her dower in said land; that the parties defendant refuse to recognize her right to dower in the premises described; and she prays that the deed from the heirs of Jacob Bear to John W^oodworth may be set aside, and declared void as to complainant, and that she may, by a proper decree, be declared to be entitled to a dower estate in the lands described; that the defendants be required to yield up to her her dower interest, and to account to her for her one-third part of the rents and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>profits of the lands since her husband\u2019s death; that, if necessary, the deed from Horatio N. Holmes to .said children of \u25a0Jacob Bear may be set aside, or so reformed as by such decree she may be shown to have a clear and legal title to her dower; and, if necessary, a commission may be issued for the purpose .of assigning and setting out her dower, or third part of said real estate; and for other and further relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Defendant Woodworth filed a separate answer, in which ihe admits the sale and conveyance on the thirtieth of March, 1883, for the consideration mentioned in the deed, of $5,100, and says that he actually paid to said grantors of said land the consideration named in said deed, and that he bought the same in good faith, as an innocent purchaser, for his own use and benefit, and without any knowledge or notice of auy claim of dower on the part of complainant in or to the land, \u25a0or of any right or claim of right to the land, and without any notice or knowledge of any understanding or agreement between complainant and the said Jacob Bear, deceased, in regard to this or any other land; that the legal title is still vested in him and held by him, and he has never executed any conveyance thereof, or any written agreement to com vey said land, to any one, nor has he ever received any pay or compensation for said land from any one.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">But he says that there is a verbal understanding in regard to the sale of said land to one of the defendants, Anson Bear, who is a relative by marriage, which understanding he may at some future time carry out on Ids part, but as yet it has no legal or valid existence, and which he submits is a private matter between himself and said Anson Bear, and entirely irrelevant and immaterial to this cause; that at the time of said purchase there was no understanding whatever that any \u25a0of said defendants should retain any right, title, or interest, equitable or otherwise, in and to said land, or that he should be bound to sell or convey the same back to any of them, or that by his taking said conveyance it would place the title beyond the reach of complainant\u2019s claim of dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Matilda Stahl, Mary Culp, Joseph .Bear, Henry Bear, An-son Bear, and Louisa Thomas answered jointly and severally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>admitting the marriage, and the ownership of the land in Ohio; also admit complainant\u2019s ownership of 40 acres, but on information and belief say that she was heavily indebted on the same, and in danger of losing it, and that Jacob Bear, immediately after the marriage, paid off the incumbrance with the understanding- that she would deed the same to him; that this was done, and Jacob Bear occupied and cultivated and improved it until some years afterwards, when trouble grew up in the family, and it was then agreed between complainant and Jacob Bear that they shoirld separate and live apart from each other, and that'said Jacob Bear deeded back the 40 acres to complainant, with the express understanding that it was to be in full satisfaction of her dower in and to all the property owned by the said Jacob Bear, and that she then agreed to release her right of dower in and to all the property then owned by the said Jacob Bear whenever he should desire, and that the execution of the instrument by complainant, by which she released her dower in and to the 70 acres, was only the carrying out of the arrangement before entered into, and that complainant had no interest in and to the proceeds from said farm; that when the 40 acres was deeded to Jacob Bear it was wild and uncultivated, except a small clearing, and when he deeded it back it was in a high state of cultivation, and worth at least $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">On information and belief they say that nothing was said, when they conveyed the 70 acres, about buying a small place in Fostoria, in Ohio, and loaning .money, but they submit that if such was the fact and understanding she would have gained nothing thereby; but they deny positively that such was the arrangement and understanding between complainant and Jacob Bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">They admit the purchase of the premises in question, by Jacob Bear, of Iioratio N. Holmes, and that it was deeded direct to them, and that they conveyed a life-estate therein to Jacob Bear; but they deny ever having any talk with complainant in regard to the title to said land, or as to who held the title, previous to the death of said Jacob Bear, on the eighteenth day of December, 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>They admit the conveyance to Woodworth, and deny that it was without consideration; aver that the consideration named in the deed actually passed between the parties, and was paid to them by said Woodworth; on information and belief say that Woodworth was wholly ignorant of the claim now made by complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Anson admits being in possession of the land; denies being the owner thereof; says that John Woodworth is the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">They deny that the sale to Woodworth was for the purpose of defeating or defrauding complainant; say that the \u25a0sale was made in the utmost good faith. They say that after the death of Jacob Bear complainant sold the JO acres deeded !to her by Jacob Bear in satisfaction of her dower rights, for \u25a0$2,000; that neither at the time of the death of Jacob Bear, nor from thence until sometime after the sale of said land to Woodworth, and just a short time before the filing of her bill, did complainant make any claim to a right of dower in said lands, and she never pretended to have any interest therein, and that she is now estopped from setting up any \u2022claim which would affect the rights of an innocent purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The cause was heard below upon pleadings and proofs, and a, decree rendered in favor of complainant. Defendants \u25a0appeM.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Defendants\u2019 counsel contend that there are but three questions involved in the case, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">1. Was complainant\u2019s husband, Jacob Bear, at any time \u25a0during the marriage, seized of an estate of inheritance in the lands in question ?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">2. Was Jacob Bear, the husband of the complainant, or any person acting for or on his behalf, guilty of fraud which resulted in depriving the complainant of her dower in this land, or of such a fraud as a court of law or equity would, in \u2022order to correct it, set aside the conveyance of this land to these defendants so far as it affected her dower ?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">3. If the conclusion arrived at in answering these questions will not warrant a decree for the complainant, then was Jacob Bear possessed of such an <em>eqt\u00e1t\u00e1ble </em>title as will warrant the court in awarding dower to the complainant?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">We need not consider the first nor the third of these pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>positions, as the theory of complainant\u2019s bill', andj her proofs, are based upon the second proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Dower has always been favored in both courts of law and equity. The act must be unambiguous, and the intention .plain, that will induce courts to declare that the right of the wife or widow to dower is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In this case there is no question respecting the right of .complainant, as the wife of Jacob Bear, to an inchoate right of dower in the lands owned by Jacob Bear in Ohio, previ- \u25a0 ous to the sale thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The important question is whether that sale was brought about, and his wife induced to sign the deed relinquishing her right to dower in those lands, by false representations-or artifice of Jacob Bear that he was to invest the proceeds of -that, farm in other lands in or near Fostoria, Ohio, and with the secret intention of coming to Michigan and purchasing land, and so placing the title as to prevent complainant from having any right of dower therein.</p>\n<p id=\"AC4z\">In view of the whole testimony we are led to the -.conclusion that the sale of the Ohio farm, and the purchase of the land in question in the manner disclosed by the record, did operate as a fraud upon the rights of complainant, and was designed to deprive her of her dower interest in both the Ohio and Michigan lands. That the transaction, as carried! out, had that result, cannot be denied; and it is reasonable to suppose that the parties intended the consequences which the result produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The evidence supports the charges contained in the bill of complaint. It shows that he obtained the signature of his wife to the deed of the farm in Ohio under 2-epresentations that induced the belief that her husband was going to'Fostoria, or near there, to live; that within a couple of days after the sale was consummated he left for Michigan, with-out acquainting his wife of his intention to go there, and upon that occasion the land was purchased from Holmes and the deed executed to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">From what is said by Anson Bear in his testimony, the scheme to sell the land in Ohio- and purchase the land in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>question must have been agreed upon before the sale of the Ohio land. He testifies that there Avas a land contract for the purchase of the land from Holmes which preceded the deed. The contract is not produced, nor its date or terms proved, but enough appears to show that the purchase of the Michigan land did not originate in the visit which Jacob Bear first made after the sale of the Ohio farm.</p>\n<p id=\"AhF\">If the object, was not to defraud the complainant of her dower in the land purchased and paid for by Jacob Bear, why Avas the deed executed to the children of Jacob Bear, and a life lease for his life alone taken back? In this manner no proA-ision whatever was made for his wife after his death if she should survive him.'</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">We regard it as no answer for these children of Jacob Bear to say that their father conveyed to her the land the complainant once owned, and which she had conveyed to him, and of which he had the use for 14 years. He gave her back her own, and it could not constitute a consideration for her release of .doAver to lands of Avhich he was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">It is also said that complainant and Jacob Bear were nonresidents of Michigan when these lands Avere conveyed to the children of Jacob Bear, and that non-resident wives are not entitled to dower in lands in this State conveyed by the husband while a non-resident. <em>Ligare v. </em>Semple, 32 Mich. 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Such would be the law in cases free from fraud; but Avhere the purchase and sale of land in Michigan is a part of the scheme to perpetrate a fraud upon the wife for the purpose of depriving her of her dower right, the principles laid down in the case cited have no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We do not, under the testimony in this case, regard defendant Woodworth as a purchaser in good faith, without notice of complainant\u2019s rights, and we think that his rights as purchaser must be subordinated to complainant\u2019s, as widow of Jacob Bear, to dower in the lands described in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">The decree of the circuit court is affirmed, with costs, and the cause must-be remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance therewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b269-10\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
