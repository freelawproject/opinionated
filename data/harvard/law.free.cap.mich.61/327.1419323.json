In construing a contract of guaranty, the general rule arising from the implication of the language used is that when the amount of \u2022 the guarantor\u2019s liability is limited, and the <em>time </em>is not, it will bo held to be a continuing guaranty.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-6\">8.

Pike, </em>27 Ohio St. 498.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-4\">A guarantor, like a surety, is bound only by the strict letter or precise terms of the contract and is, in this respect a favorite of the law, and a claim against him is <em>strictissimi </em>juris; <em>Kingsbury v. Westfall, </em>61 N. Y. 356; and the contract is construed, if not strictly, <em>accurately; </em>2 Parsons on Contracts, 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-5\">The liability of the surety is not to be extended by implication beyond the terms' of his contract: Brandt on Surety-ship, \u00a7 79 ; <em>Miller v.

Stat. \u00a7 6185), and it is evident that defendants intended to become sureties for somebody who was to incur a liability for indebtedness to plaintiff to the extent of two hundred dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-12\">The admission of one of the co-sureties was competent evidence: <em>Schmidt v.

(5th ed.) 492 (note 5); <em>Bronson v. Green, </em>Walker\u2019s Ch. 59; <em>Bird v. Hamilton, </em>Id. 361; <em>Norris v. Showerman, </em>Id. 206; <em>Dudgeon v.

Shea, </em>36 Id. 398.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-5\">In interpreting a contract the intention and purpose of the parties in making it are first to be ascertained: 2 Parsons on Cont. (5th ed.) Sec. 3,499; and thecontract should be supported rather than defeated: Id. 503.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-6\">All contracts should be construed <em>contra proferentem: </em>Id. 506; <em>Mason v. Pritchard, </em>12 East, 227; and this rule applies to an accepted guaranty: 2 Parsons on Contracts (5th ed.) 509; <em>Bastow v. Bennett, </em>3 Camp. 220; <em>Browning v. Beston, </em>Plowd, 140.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-8\">The instruction given by the court was warranted by the evidence and surrounding facts and circumstances, which were legitimate sources of information, open to the court and jury to show the intention of the parties: <em>Norris v.

Worden, </em>42 Id. 160.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b384-9\">Champlin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A50\">Suit was brought by the plaintiff against the defendants before a justice of the peace, in which the plaintiff declared against the defendants in an action of assumpsit upon all the common counts, and on a memorandum of suretyship as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u201c Detroit, October 22, 1883.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">\u201cIt is hereby mutually agreed that William E. Moloney and Ralph Phelps, Jr., is to become the surety of CharlesSavenac, for the sale of cigars, to James L. Mathews, to the extent of two hundred dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201cRalph Phelps, Jr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">\u201c W illiam E. Moloney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">At the trial in the circuit court, to which the case had been appealed, it appeared that Mathews was a manufacturer of cigars in the city of Detroit, and had entered into an arrangement with Challes Savenac to sell cigars for him, and return the money to Mathews, for which Mathews-was to give five dollars a thousand \u201call round,\u201d and defendants signed the written agreement above set forth for the purpose of becoming responsible for the money Savenac did not return, and delivered the same to the plaintiff, who thereupon furnished Savenac with samples, and he proceeded to sell cigars for the plaintiff. Under these facts, the court construed.the contract as if it read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">\u201c Detroit, October 22,1S83.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">\u201c It is hereby mutually agreed that William E. Moloney and Ralph Phelps, Jr., is. to become the surety of Charles Savenac to James L. Mathews, for the sale of cigars, to the extent of two hundred dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Vo think the court construed the contract of surety-ship correctly, in the light of the surrounding circumstances. If construed literally, it would be meaningless. By the transposition of a single phrase, the intention of the parties is expressed in clear and unambiguous language.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">The record further shows that Savenac failed to return to the plaintiff money received by him on the sale of cigars, to the amount of $161).Of. It also appears that the sales made by Savenac for the plaintiff amounted to more than $1,000, and defendants\u2019 counsel contends that the contract of surety-ship did not extend beyond the sale of $200 worth of cigars, and was not continuous; and, plaintiff having received returns exceeding $200, the defendants are not liable in this action. This would be a narrow construction to place upon the terms of the contract. It is the extent of the liability, and not the extent of the sales, that is limited to $200</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The general rule arising from the implication of the language used is that when the amount of the liability is limited, and the time is not, the contract should be construed as a continuing guaranty: <em>Gard v. Stevens, </em>12 Mich. 295.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWb\">In all cases the contract should be so construed as to carry into effect the intention of the parties ; and such intent must be ascertained from the language of the instrument, and the facts and circumstances attending the execution thereof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Yiewing the contract under consideration in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, it is plain that the guaranty was intended to continue so long as Savenac should continue to sell cigars for Mathews, or until ended by notice from the sureties that they would not continue to be responsible any longer; the extent of their liability being fixed at $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The court permitted plaintiff to testify to admissions of defendant Phelps as to the liability of defendants upon the contract. This the counsel for defendants insists is error, for the reason that admissions made by Phelps could not bind his co-surety, Moloney. The admissions of a copartner and of a joint contractor have been held admissible in evidence to bind, not only themselves, but their co-defendants; but whether the admissions of .a surety are proper evidence to bind a co-surety is a question wliich ngpd not be determined in this case. No testimony was introduced- on behalf of defendants. The testimony of the plaintiff made out a case under which he was entitled to recover without the admissions as to liability of defendant Phelps. The error, if any was committed, could not by any possibility have prejudiced the defendants, and the judgment will not be reversed for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Perceiving no error prejudicial to defendants, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b386-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\"> See <em>Farmers' &amp; Mechanics\u2019 Bank v.
