Plaintiff\u2019s testatrix died, leaving as her <em>entire </em>estate a promissory note given to her hy defendant\u2019s decedent, on which some payments were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>indorsed. Four adult children survived her, and\u2019 five children of a deceased daughter, two of whom were minors, but all resided near her. A son who had not been heard from for several years was reported to have died in California, leaving a son who, at time of her death, resided in Oregon; but the evidence of either being alive at date of application for administration upon her estate, as hereinafter stated, was vague and unsatisfactory. On the day of the funeral <em>her four </em>surviving children had a consultation in regard to the note at the house of the maker, who was deceased\u2019s son-in-law, who offered to pay the funeral expenses and doctor\u2019s bill, and erect a tombstone for deceased, in satisfaction of the amount due on the note, which proposition was agreed to and the note delivered to him, and he cut his name therefrom in the presence of said heirs, without objection from any one. He paid the funeral expenses and doctor\u2019s bill, and erected the tombstone, and the adjustment thus made was treated as a settlement of the note until the application of plaintiff to be appointed administrator of His mother\u2019s estate, made nearly fourteen years after her death. Soon after this event the maker of the note died, and defendant was appointed administrator of his estate, whereupon plaintiff presented the note to the commissioners on claims for allowance. Upon a hearing the claim was disallowed, but on appeal to the circuit court a verdict was obtained for the amount claimed due thereon. Proof of the alleged settlement was made on the trial, but excluded, from the consideration of the jury, under the charge of the court, for the reason that the heirs were not <em>all </em>present, and the administrator, the legal representative of the estate, was not bound thereby. The court also refused certain requests proposed by defendant, copies of which are found on page 191 of the opinion.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b236-4\"><em>Held, </em>that the question of such alleged settlement, and of the performance by defendant\u2019s testator of the conditions by him to be performed, should have been submitted to the jury, and if established \u2014it not being claimed that any fraud was practiced on either side, or mistake made \u2014 such settlement was upon a sufficient consideration, and binding upon all the heirs present and participating therein, or assenting thereto.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b236-5\">2. Only the <em>legal </em>estate in <em>personal </em>property vests in an administrator, the equitable being in the heirs or other persons entitled to distributive shares thereof; and the administrator\u2019s estate is a <em>trust </em>created <em>only </em>for the purpose of laying hold of the estate and making <em>such </em>distribution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b236-6\">8.

Duren, </em>3 Strobhart (S. C.) 448; <em>DeCordova v.

I insist not. It is shown that adult and minor heirs were not present, and it does not appear that they knew of her death or of this pretended settlement; then how can they or this administrator be' bound? But the heirs present are not shown to have agreed to anything; they at most said nothing in reply to the proposition for settlement. Where parties meet to adjust their mutual accounts by a settlement covering <em>all </em>claims, and one of them withdraws while some accounts remain unsettled, and refuses to go further, the whole settlement is defeated: <em>The Tioga Manufacturing Co. v. Stimson, </em>48 Mich. 216; and if this be so the absence of Gaylord Foote or his son, and of the children of the deceased daughter, had the like effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-9\">The minds of the necessary parties did not meet on any state of facts which would constitute a settlement; there was no such mutual assent as is necessary in such a case (Chitty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>on Contracts, 8); and the offer and acceptance cannot of themselves constitute a contract unless the acceptance is absolute arid unconditional: <em>Finley Shoe &amp; Leather Co v. Kurtz, </em>34 Mich. 92; <em>Ahearn v. Ayres, </em>38 Id. 692-3; <em>Eggleston v. Wagner, </em>46 Id. 610-23; <em>Wagner v.

Dunbar, </em>43 Mich. 410); and if a part of a contract is void for any cause, the contract falls, for the assent is to it asa whole: <em>Jackson v. Evans, </em>44 Mich. 510-13; and it was unconscionable for the maker of the note to claim that he had paid it, nor could he have enforced snch a claim: <em>Dorrill v. Eaton, </em>35 Mich. 302; <em>Gibson v. Pelkie, </em>37 Id. 380; <em>Myer v. Hart, </em>40 Id. 517-24; <em>Butler v. Duncan, </em>47 Id. 95-7; <em>Storrs v.

There is to be no interest on the above amount, or on any or either of the payments, as long as the said Mahitibal Foote may see fit to make it her home with the undersigned, Elisha Foote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">\u201c <em>Sherwood, </em>May 18, 1853. Elisha Foote.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">After this note was given, Mahitibal went to live with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Elisha, and continued to reside with him, occupying separate rooms in the house,- until she died, on the twenty-second day of September, 1867. While she lived, Elisha paid to Mahitibal on the note, May 18, 1853, $50; June 19, 1854, $50; June 13, 1862, $35. These payments are all indorsed on the note. There is also on the note an entry in pencil r \u201cPaid on the note, $266.15.\u201d This item is controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Mahitibal was 82 years old when she died. At the time of her death her children then known to be living were Gilbert W. Foote, above mentioned, Sarah L. Goss, Clarissa S. Foote, and Augusta Foote. She had another daughter, Anna Childs, who had died several years before the death of Mahitibal, leaving five children, two of whom were minors when Mahitibal died. There was also another of Mahitibal\u2019s children by the name of Oliver Gaylord Foote, about whom but little seems to have been known for many years before his mother\u2019s death, except that it was reported that he went to California and there died, leaving a soil by the name of Oliver James Foote, who resided, as understood, in Oregon at the time of the death of his grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">It was claimed, however, upon the trial, by one of the witnesses, that Oliver Gaylord Foote wrote to some one in St. Joseph county inquiring after his mother\u2019s estate two or three years after her death. It was also rumored that this son was alive seven or eight years ago. The evidence is very vague as to whether this father or son were either of them alive at the time the administration was applied for on Mahitibal\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The record, which contains all the evidence in the case, further shows that Mahitibal made a will, reading as follows.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>This was made about three months previous to her death. She resided at the time, as did one of the witnesses to the will, who was her granddaughter, a child of Mrs. Goss, at Mendon, St. Joseph county.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">It was conceded upon the trial that at the time application was made for administration there were no claims against the estate of Mabitibal. It further appears, so far as the record shows anything upon the subject, that she left no property at her decease, except what might be owing upon the above-mentioned note, if-anything was then due her thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">It further appears that on'the day of her funeral, and after the burial had taken place, all the children then known to be living, viz., Gilbert W. Foote, Sarah L. Goss, Clarissa S. Foote, and Augusta Foote, assembled at the house of Elisha Foote, the maker of the note, and had a consultation in regard to the same, and the claim made by' Elisha against the note. The interview upon the subject seems to have been a friendly one, and the discussion had was as to what should be done with the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Elisha asked the heirs to bring forward the note. Augusta produced it. He then told them he wanted a settlement, as the heirs, were then all together; \u201cthat he thought they could arrange the matters without trouble, and have it set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>tied; that the note called for $800, and he was to pay no interest on it as long as she saw fit to live in his family; that instead of living in his family he had to furnish her with two separate rooms, and warm them for her; that if they would give up the note he would pay the funeral expenses and doctor\u2019s bill, and buy a tombstone for deceased, and call it square;\u201d Or they might, if they -were not satisfied, settle it by law, and he would put in his claim against it, <em>\u201c </em>which would more than balance the note.\u201d They might do either yvay, as they chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">To this proposition Clarissa said she had no claim on it; Gilbert W. .Foote, the present administrator, said he had no claim, and thought it better be settled in the way proposed, and have no trouble about it; Mrs. Goss said she did not want anything that did not belong to her, but all that did, and neither she nor Augusta objected to making the arrangement proposed; and, after further talk about the matter, and after the note and indorsements had been read by John Foote, and a further suggestion from one of the grandchildren that Elisha had earned the note, the note was handed to Elisha, who, in the presence of all of them, cut his name off the note and put it in his pocket, without any objection from any one; and he subsequently paid Mahitibal\u2019s funeral expenses, her doctor\u2019s bill, and purchased the gravestone, as he had promised; and, so far as the record shows anything, it tends to show that the adjustment made of the matter of the note, there at the home of Elisha, has ever since been treated and regarded as a settlement of the claim now- made until the death of Elisha, a few years since \u2014 in fact, until Gilbert <em>W. </em>Foote made application to be appointed administrator of Mahitibal\u2019s estate, the last of the year 1882; and on the seventeenth of April, 1883, said will was admitted to probate, and he received his appointment as such administrator with the will annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Soon after the death of Elisha Foote, and on the third day of J anuary, 1883, his son Frederick S. Foote was appointed administrator of his father\u2019s estate-; and, after commissioners were appointed to hear and examine claims against Elisha\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>estate, Gilbert <em>W. </em>Foote, as administrator of Mahitibal, presented the said note to the commissioners for allowance. After hearing the proofs in the matter, the claim was disallowed, and Gilbert <em>W. </em>took an appeal therefrom to the circuit court of St. Joseph county, where the cause was tried before Judge Pealer, by jury; and under the proofs there introduced, and charge of the court, a verdict was obtained, allowing the claim made upon the note in favor of Mrs. Foote\u2019s estate at the-sum of $1,393.93, and judgment was entered thereon accordingly. The administrator of Elisha Foote\u2019s estate now brings error, and the case is before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"ADT\">It will be noticed by the terms of the will Oliver Gaylord Foote was to have $200, but if he should not live to receive it in three years after the' death of the testatrix, then his son was to have $5, and the $200 was to be divided equally between Gilbert W. Foote (the plaintiff) and his three sisters. To Mrs. Goss she gave $6 and forgave a debt of $74; to the five children of Mrs. Childs she gave $10; and to said Gilbert W. and his two sisters Augusta and Clarissa she gave $80 each, should there be that amount left after paying testatrix\u2019s necessary funeral charges and expenses; and if then anything more was left, she gave it to Gilbert, Clarissa, Sarah, and Augusta. Oliver Gaylord appears to have been regarded as dead by the whole family. Mrs. Childs\u2019 heirs would be entitled to two dollars each; the son of Gaylord to five dollars; so that under the provisions of the will the only parties, if Gaylord\u2019s legacy lapsed, \u2014 if there was any estate,\u2014 interested therein, to the extent of.requiring the attention of the court, were really the four residuary legatees, all of whom were present and participated in the settlement claimed to have occurred at the home of Elisha Foote, Sr., on the day the testatrix was buried.</p>\n<p id=\"AHn\">Under these circumstances, and as it clearly1 appears that there were no creditors of Mahitibal Foote\u2019s estate, the defendant\u2019s counsel claim that there should have been no administrator appointed, \u2014 that there was nothing for him to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The legal estate only in personal property vests in the administrators; the equitable estate therein is in the heirs, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>other persons entitled to distributive portions thereof. The estate of the administrators therein is a trust for that purpose, and is created only for the purpose of laying hold of the estate and making such distribution. When there are no creditors, the heirs or legatees may collect, if they can, the estate together, and make such distribution among themselves as they may agree to and carry into effect, without the intervention of any administrators; and the law favors such arrangements. In such cases it is only where the heirs or legatees fail to make such collection and distribution that administration becomes necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">When such arrangement and distribution have been made and executed, it will be binding, both in law and equity, as between the parties making it, whenever the rights of creditors do not intervene. And where there are no creditors, the heirs or legatees may divide up and distribute the personal property of the decedent, without converting it into money, in such manner as they see fit; and when such division has been executed, even though it is not such as the decedent has made by his will, or such as the law would make when there is no will, it will be binding upon all the parties to the agreement: <em>Walworth v. </em>Abel, 52 Penn. St. 370; <em>Calhoun v. Hays, </em>8 Watts &amp; S. 132; <em>Bavington v. Clarke, </em>2 Pen. <em>&amp; W. </em>123; <em>McMahan v. McMahan, </em>13 Penn. St. 380; <em>Lee v. Gibbons, </em>14 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>R. 105; 3 Redf. Wills, 89; <em>Carter v. Owens, </em>41 Ala. 217; <em>Fretwell v. McLemore, </em>52 Ala. 124; <em>Hibbard v. Kent, </em>15 N.

Gillett, </em>39 Mich. 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">By the terms of the claimed settlement in this case all the estate was disposed of, and the heirs with whom Elisha, Sr., made the settlement were fully satisfied, and among whom was the heir who has been appointed administrator of Mrs. Eoote\u2019s estate. It is not claimed any fraud was practised upon either side in making the settlement, or any mistake made; all the parties to the agreement were familiar with the facts and circumstances under which it was made. If such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>.settlement was made as claimed, we think it was upon a sufficient consideration, and all the parties present and participating therein, or assenting thereto, are bound thereby, and estopped from making any claim to said note, or to any of the proceeds thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The order appointing Gilbert W. Foote administrator of Mahitibal\u2019s estate is riot so brought before us that we can review the proceedings had in that case, or pass upon them intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">It is not easy to discover, if there was a settlement and an agreement among the heirs of Mahitibal as to what disposition should be made of the note, and upon what conditions, what necessity there could be, upon the facts stated in the record, for administration upon her estate, especially after the conditions were performed and the disposition made as agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Whether or not such settlement had been had and conditions performed were certainly proper questions to have been submitted to the jury in this case, if the plaintiff could maintain the suit at all; but the court told the jury: \u201cYou will have nothing to do with the settlement; '* * <em>* </em>there</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">will simply be the question of how much will be due on this noteand the court further charged the jury that they should deduct the amount which was indorsed on the note before Mrs. Foote\u2019s death, and render their verdict against the defendant for the balance. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Upon these subjects counsel for the defendant requested the court to charge the jury that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">\u201c 1. Whether a settlement of a claim is right or wrong, the law holds a party to diligence who proposes to avoid it. If he acquiesces for an unreasonable length of time, he will be bound by it. If he seeks to repudiate it, he must do so at the first opportunity, or account for and excuse the delay. By acquiescence for an unreasonable length of time, without excuse, he affirms the settlement, whether it was originally right or not. In this case those interested in the claim, if any ever existed, waited for more than fourteen years after, as the defense claim, it had been adjusted. This was an unreasonable length of time to wait. If, therefore, such settlement as is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>claimed was effected of the claim, you will find for the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">2. When a matter is settled by the parties in interest, and there is no unfairness, and all the facts are equally known to both sides, the settlement is final. This principle acquires new force when death has interposed to close a party\u2019s lips.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">3. If the deceased, Elisha Eoote, settled with some of the heirs for their interest in the obligation sued on, you will deduct from the face of the note the share which, under the will, those of the heirs participating in the settlement of the claim would have been entitled to out of it, and only allow the balance of the claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We think, as the case stood when the charge was made, these three requests were entirely proper, and should have been given, and the failure so to do was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The proceeding authorized by the statute for the purpose of examining, allowing, and adjusting claims against an estate, whether before commissioners or the courts, is an equitable one, and governed by equitable principles ; and the administrator of Elisha Foote\u2019s estate, in this case, was entitled to avail himself of any equitable, as well as legal, defense which existed against the claim presented for allowance against Elisha\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">We think it substantially appears from the record that all the heirs of Mahitibal were present at the time the note was given up and canceled, then or since known to be living, except, perhaps, some of the children of Firs. Childs; but these all lived in the vicinity of Flahitibal at the time of her death, or knew all about the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">And it further appears that for more than fourteen years after that meeting of the heirs and that arrangement was made with the note, whatever it was, all parties had acquiesced in it, and no one of them had ever claimed any interest in the note until Gilbert W. made his application for the appointment of himself administrator, and this was not done until after Elisha, Sr., had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">He and the other heirs evidently knew of the existence of the will all this time, and of its provisions ; for Gilbert produces it for probate, and the object of which at this late day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>is made clearly to appear by the proceedings now. before us. No other object or purpose of these probate proceedings appears.except to try to compel payment of said note by the defendant, as Mahitibal had no other estate when she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In view of the fact of the settlement made, and which, in considering this record, must be regarded as made, as proposed to be shown, and was shown, upon the trial, and excluded by the court, this proceeding is most unjust and inequitable. Whatever interests the heirs may have had at the time Mrs. Foote died in the claim now made against Elisha\u2019s estate certainly was taken in consideration at the time of the settlement, and the provisions of the will now probated disclose, taken in connection with the other testimony in the case, that the entire interest in the note (except a few dollars given to parties who have never made any claim thereto), subject to the equitable set-off of Elisha, passed to the heirs who made the settlement; and, if such settlement of the note was actually made, it would be clearly unjust not to allow the defense now made by Elisha\u2019s administrator to prevail. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Had a few more months elapsed before Mahitibal\u2019s death, the claim now made by Gilbert W. Foote would have been barred, both at law and in equity, by the statute of limitations, beyond any question; and it is claimed by defendant\u2019s counsel that more than fourteen years having elapsed since the death of Mrs. Foote,- and the parties for whose benefit the claim is now made having all this time had the custody of the will, and neglected their statutory duty to present the same to the court, and secure probate thereof, and in the meantime Elisha Foote having died, the claim now made by the testatrix\u2019s administrator should, in equity and good conscience, he held barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We think there is much force in this position, and we -are not prepared to say it is not w\u00e9ll taken. We do not, however, deem it necessary to fully decide that question now, as the other errors noted are sufficient to make a reversal of the judgment necessary. But it is very certain that justice to all parties interested in the provisions of a will requires that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>under the statutes in this State as they now exist, a party holding the will, or one having knowledge of its existence, and under which he claims an interest in the legacies, must secure its probate within a reasonable time after be knows of the death of the testator; or, failing so to do, he may bar himself from making claim under its provisions to the benefits thereof; and we think a lapse of fourteen years after a knowledge of the death of the testator, under such circumstances (and as they appear iu this record), an unreasonable time, and that such defense to the claim of the plaintiff sought to be enforced against the estate of Elisha was a proper one to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Every person having the custody of any will is required, within thirty days after he knows of the death of the testator, to deliver the same into the probate court having jurisdiction of the case, or to the executors named therein. And it is made the duty of the judge of probate to appoint a time and place for proving it, and give notice thereof, either personally or by publication, to the persons interested; and, if no sufficient cause is shown on the hearing against it, on proofs made by at least one of the subscribing witnesses, admit the same to probate.
