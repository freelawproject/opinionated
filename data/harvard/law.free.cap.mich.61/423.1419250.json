Plaintiff thereafter sold Hines machines on credit, taking his notes therefor, which were all duly paid. Afterwards an arrangement was made whereby Hines and one Green associated themselves together as agents for plaintiff, and thereafter plaintiff dealt with said Hines &amp; Green, who became indebted to plaintiff, and this suit was brought on said bond to recover for <em>such </em>default.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b477-8\"><em>Held, </em>that the liability of the <em>sureties </em>was limited to the transactions and default of Hines <em>alone, </em>they having made no contract to become liable for the defalcations of the jin\u00bb of Hines &amp; Green, and that the court cannot create such liability for them.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-9\">Case made from Eaton.

Co. v. </em>Brock, 113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Mass. 194; <em>Boston Hat Manufactory v.

The cause was tried before Judge Hooker, without a jury. The court made a finding of the facts and of the law, and thereon rendered a judgment for the plaintiff for $500. We now have the record before us upon a case made after the judgment, for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">The court found the following facts :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">\u201c 1. The White Sewing Machine Company made an arrangement with defendant Hines to act as their agent in the sale of sewing-machines, on March 16, 1881.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201c 2. At the same time they took from him his bond, with the other defendants as sureties, in penal sum of five hundred dollars, with ten per cent, thereon in case of suit, conditioned that said Hines should pay any and every indebtedness or liability then existing, or which might thereafter \u2022exist or be incurred on the part of said Hines, to said company'or its assigns, whether it should exist in the shape of \u25a0book-accounts, notes, or leases, renewals or extensions of notes, \u25a0accounts, or leases, acceptances, indorsements, consignments \u2022of property or merchandise, failure to deliver or account for the same, or any part thereof, or otherwise, and whether such indebtedness shall be incurred under any contract between said White Sewing Machine Company and- said Hines, or \u25a0otherwise, and whether the same shall arise out of the purchase and sale of sewing-machines, or otherwise. The bond further provided that it was made, and should be construed, without reference to any other instrument or agreement whatever; a copy of which, marked \u00a3A,\u2019 is hereto attached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">\u00a3\u00a3 3. Plaintiff thereafter sold said Hines large numbers of sewing-machines upon credit, amounting to several thousand dollars, taking his notes therefor, all of which were duly paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVQz\">\u201c4. In July, 1884, said Hines, and one Green, and plaintiff\u2019s general agent, had a meeting, when it was agreed that defendant Hines and Green should associate in the business of selling sewing-machines, plaintiff\u2019s general agent agreeing to furnish them thereafter at a lower price in certain quantities named.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201c5. From that time the company\u2019s dealings were with Hines &amp; Green.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201c 6. The sureties upon the bond were ignorant of these transactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201c 7. Said outstanding notes amount, with interest to the eighteenth day of January, 1886, to the sum of $610.34, which amount at said date was due and owing to plaintiff by said Hines &amp; Green.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">\u201c 8. Said sum was due and unpaid when this action was \u25a0commenced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The following finding of law raises the only question necessary to consider, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">\u201cThe indebtedness of Hines &amp; Green is a liability of Hines, within the meaning of the bond, and is covered by it; and the plaintiff should have judgment for the sum of $500, and'costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>This finding was duly excepted to by defendants\u2019 counsel,, and is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">We think the exception is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The liability of the sureties was limited to the transactions and default of Hines alone, and the court should have so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">They had made no contract to become liable for the defalcations, omissions, or neglect of the firm of Hines &amp; Green,, and the court is not allowed to create such liability for them<em>: </em>Brandt, Sur. \u00a7 338; 2 Kent, Comm. 124; <em>Dobbin v.
