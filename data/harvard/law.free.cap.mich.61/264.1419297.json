The attorneys for the parties failed to agree on a time for a retrial, and pending the discussion of the question, and without waiting for the court to pass thereon, defendant\u2019s attorney left the court-room, and the justice, in his and defendant\u2019s absence, adjourned the case until the following day, at ten o\u2019clock a. m., for such retrial, notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>which action was given to defendant\u2019s attorney at about the adjourned ' hour, who soon after came into the justice\u2019s office \u2014 plaintifE and his attorney being absent \u2014 and stated to the justice that his client was absent in Detroit and was not ready for trial, and that neither he nor his said attorney should appear further in the case. No application was made or cause shown by defendant or his attorney, after the discharge of the jury, for an adjournment, and the justice, after waiting one hour, proceeded to try the case without a <em>second </em>jury, no demand having been made by defendant nor fees paid therefor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b319-4\"><em>Held, </em>that the action of the justice must be sustained; that the failure of defendant to demand a <em>second </em>jury and pay the fees required by law was a waiver of the right to a jury trial, and authorized the justice to try the case. <em>McGraw v.

Sturgeon, </em>29 Mich. 426-9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3j\">Had such a course been pursued by defendant his subsequent absence would not have waived the right thus secured to a jury trial: <em>Boatz v. Berg, </em>51 Id. 9-11; but parties are deemed to waive such right unless demand is made as provided by law: Const. Art. 6, \u00a7 27.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b319-12\">Sherwood, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACz\">This cause was .brought in justice\u2019s court. It is assumpsit upon a promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">To the declaration the defendant pleaded the general issue. A trial was had before' the justice, by jury, and the jury failed to agree, and were discharged by the justice. The parties failed to agree upon a time for another trial, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>court adjourned the case for trial until the following day, at 10 o\u2019clock a. m., and caused the defendant to be notified of the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">It further appears that it was 6 o\u2019clock p. m. when the jury was discharged and the cause was set for trial; that about the hour to which the cause was adjourned for the second trial the defendant\u2019s attorney came into court, and informed the justice that his client had gone* to Detroit, and that neither he nor the defendant would be ready for trial, and neither would appear further in the case; that no motion was made for a continuance by the defendant or his counsel, nor request made that the second trial should be by jury, and no jury fee was paid or tendered for that purpose; that after waiting an hour after the time had arrived for the second trial, the plaintiff appeared, and by his attorney asked that the trial proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The cause was then tried before the justice without a jury, and resulted in judgment for the plaintiff. The cause was then removed into the circuit court for the county of Ionia, by writ of certiorari, and upon the hearing Judge Smith affirmed the judgment of the justice. The case is now before us on error.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The alleged errors are\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">1. The justice failed to fix the time for retrial, before the defendant and his attorney left the court-room.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">2. Sufficient length of time of notice for second trial was not given defendant before the trial was had.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">3. The cause was tried the last time without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">4. Forty-eight hours should have been allowed to elapse before trying the cause the second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">The statute relied upon reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI5\">\u201cWhenever a justice shall be satisfied that a jury sworn in any cause before him cannot agree on their verdict, after having been out a reasonable time, he may discharge them ; and thereupon a new jury shall be selected and summoned as hereinbefore directed, within forty-eight hours, unless the parties agree upon a longer time, or consent that the justice may render judgment on the evidence already before him, which, in such case, he may do.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The record shows that the defendant and his attorney made no application to fix a different time from the one fixed upon by the justice to retry said cause, and left the room before the court had time to determine the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">It does not appear that want of earlier notice of the time appointed for the second trial was complained of before the justice by defendant\u2019s attorney, or that any effort was made by him to avoid injury which might occur to defendant by having the cause then tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The third ground of error is untenable. The defendant had neither demanded a jury nor-paid the fees for one. This question has been before this Court before. <em>McGraw v. </em>Sturgeon, 29 Mich. 429; <em>Boatz v. </em>Berg, 51 Mich. 9-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Upon the fourth ground of .error assigned we need only refer to the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is only when a jury has been properly demanded, and the party is entitled to have the cause tried by such jury, in cases where the parties fail to agree as to the time for trial, when the statute fixes the time within which the jury should be summoned. The record presents no such case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">We are unable to sustain any of the errors assigned upon this record, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b321-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-13\">How.
