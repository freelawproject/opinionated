Jackson, </em>92 N. Y. 591; <em>Forster v. Forster, </em>129 Mass. 566; <em>Mattingly v. D. C., </em>97 U. S. 687; <em>Grim v. Weissenberg S. Dist., </em>57 Penn. St. 433; <em>Hart v.

The circuit judge evidently took the view that <em>it was, </em>and x\u2019endered judgment for the defendant. This ruling and judgment presents the only question for our considei\u2019ation.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Under the rulings of this Court, the defect mentioned in the supervisor\u2019s certificate would render the proceedings taken by the collector under his warrant void, and, unless the act of 1885 cures the infirmity, the plaintiff was entitled to recover: <em>Clark v. Crane, </em>5 Mich. 151; <em>Silsbee v. Stockle, </em>44 Id. 561; <em>Hogelskamp v. Weeks, </em>37 Id. 126; <em>Sinclair v. Learned, </em>51 Id. 335; <em>Daniels v. Watertown, </em>55 Id. 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In this case it is not made to appear that the tax assessed against the plaintiff\u2019s property for the year 1879 was excessive, or that there was any defect, omission, or irregularity in the assessnxent roll, tax roll, or wai\u2019rant attached to the assessment roll, except the omission of the clause in the certificate of the supervisor above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">This Court has already held, in this curative legislation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>support tax proceedings, that if the Legislature has antecedent power to authorize a tax, it can cure, by a retroactive law, an irregularity or want of authority in levying it, intrusted to \"the officer who perforins that duty; and that whatever the Legislature can dispense with in advance, it can dispense with retroactively, by enacting that its omission shall not invalidate or prejudice: <em>People v. Ingham Co. Sup'rs, </em>20 Mich. 95; <em>Hart v. </em>Henderson, 17 Id. 218; <em>Albany &amp; Boston Min. Co. v. Auditor </em>General, 37 Id. 391; <em>Sinclair v. Learned, </em>51 Id. 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">It is claimed by counsel for the defendant that the decision of the circuit judge is supported by the cases of <em>Sinclair v. </em>Learned, and <em>People v. Ingham Co. Sup'rs; </em>also by the late case of <em>Anderson v. Santa Anna, </em>33 Alb. Law J. 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\"We do not think those cases support the doctrine contended for, when applied to the facts in this case. In the first case no vested rights were interfered with. In the second \u2022case the act of 1869, which was claimed to.cure the defect \u2022complained of, was passed before the ejectment was brought. 'The last case only applies the doctrine held by this Court, that, unless prohibited by the constitution, the Legislature has the power, when its. action will interfere with no vested rights, to enact curative statutes retroactive in their effect, for the purpose of validating proceedings taken in this class of cases, which would be otherwise irregular, when it has antecedent power to authorize the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The difficulty in this case is, there has been a sale of property levied upon, and the rights of parties became vested befor\u00e9 the curative legislation took effect, and such rights \u2022cannot be interfered with in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, with costs, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-8\">Campbell, O.
