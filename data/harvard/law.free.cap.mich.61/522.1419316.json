On April 1, 1881, the firm was dissolved, <em>Peter </em>Flory taking the <em>joint </em>property and assuming the <em>firm </em>debts: and on Nov. 28, 1882, he mortgaged to defendant the property covered by the <em>two-</em>prior mortgages, for $500, being the sum due thereon, which mortgage was intended as additional security therefor. This mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>was never renewed, but <em>all three </em>were filed in the proper office. December 1, 1882, <em>Peter </em>mortgaged the same property to <em>Enos </em>to secure a note due him, which mortgage was duly filed and thereafter renewed, and in which the mortgagor covenanted that the property was free from all incumbrances, except the $500 mortgage held by the defendant. In April, 1884, defendant sold the property upon his last two mortgages, and applied the proceeds in payment of his debt.\" Nov. 24, 1884, <em>Enos </em>assigned <em>his </em>mortgage to plaintiff, <em>without consideration, </em>who brought this suit, claiming priority for said mortgage on account of defendant\u2019s failure to renew his $500 mortgage. Upon this state of facts the Court held:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-4\">1. A second mortgagee whose mortgage was taken subject to a prior mortgage duly filed, given to secure a debt of a firm of which he was <em>then </em>a member, cannot claim priority for a mortgage executed <em>to </em>him by <em>the other </em>copartner by reason of the non-renewal of the <em>prior </em>mortgage. No such advantage was ever intended by the statute, under <em>such </em>circumstances, its object being to prevent, not facilitate, fraud.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-6\">2. Where a mortgage contains a clause showing that it is made subject to a prior one, filing is unnecessary to maintain such priority, which can never be secured for the <em>second </em>mortgage, as against the <em>first, </em>except by the agreement of the parties. Such a stipulation runs with the mortgage; is binding upon the parties, and continues during the life of the security; and it is intended to take the place of the statutory filing, as between all parties bound thereby when it is made, or who become subsequently interested in it or the mortgaged property.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-8\">3.

No renewal of this mortgage was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Under the arrangement made between Peter and Enos, it appears Peter became indebted to Enos $500 and over, and which remained in open account until December 1, 1882, when Peter gave a chattel mortgage to Enos covering the property mortgaged, as above stated, to the defendant, for the sum of $588.44, to secure a note of that amount falling due January 1, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">This mortgage contained the following clause, viz. (after describing the property):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Which said above-described goods, chattels, and property, at the date hereof, * * ai'e free and clear from all liens, conveyances, incumbrances, and levies, except a mortgage to C..C. Comstock, on said stock, for $500.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">This mortgage was, on the twenty-fourth day of November, 1884, assigned by Enos to his son, Andrew A. Elory, the plaintiff, for the purpose of enabling him to prosecute this suit; and it further appears that he gave no value for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The mortgage was duly renewed on the twenty-second day of November, 1883, and again November 25, 1884, by filing renewal affidavits. All the mortgages were filed in the proper office where made, and Enos Elory is a party to the first two.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">JBy virtue of the defendant\u2019s $200 and $500 mortgages last made, he took possession of the mortgaged property, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>sold the same at public auction, and applied the proceeds to the payment of his indebtedness, on the twelfth day of April, 1884. On the twentieth day of February, 1885, plaintiff brought suit for the value of the property against the defendant, relying upon the mortgage given by Peter to Enos, and assigned to him, for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The case was tried in the Kent circuit, and, under the charge of the court, the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for the sum of $565.92. Defendant brings error.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The assignments of error are seven in number, but may be considered under two heads:</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">1. Did defendant, by failure to renew his $500 mortgage (by filing the affidavit required by statute), which became due April 1, 1883, under the circumstances stated, lose priority over the mortgage of plaintiff, which had been duly renewed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">2. Could Peter Flory, by turning out to defendant the property in question, to pay a partnership debt, cut off the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage?</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The main questions involved are also clearly presented in the following requests of defendant\u2019s counsel in their requests to charge, and which were refused by the court, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\"><em>\u201c3. </em>If, at the time of the conversion charged against defendant, Enos and Peter Flory, as partners, were indebted to defendant in amount equal or exceeding the value of the goods covered by plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, then, if defendant applied the amount realized from the sale of said goods to the reduction of said indebtedness, and the goods wei\u2019e turned out by Peter (one of said partners) in payment of said debt, then defendant is not liable, and your verdict must be for defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">\u201c 6. The priority of defendant\u2019s^mortgage being recognized by plaintiff\u2019s mortgage being made virtually subject thereto, plaintiff cannot now dispute the validity of defendant\u2019s mortgage because of no affidavits of renewal being filed, they not being required in order to entitle defendant\u2019s mortgage to preference over plaintiff\u2019s.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">\u201c 8. It appears from the evidence that the mortgage, under which plaintiff claims,, is, by its terms, subject to the mortgage made by Peter Flory to defendant for $500. That was notice to Enos Flory and to plaintiff of defendant\u2019s mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>gage, and by reason of such notice the priority of defendant\u2019s 'mortgage cannot be questioned by plaintiff. As against plaintiff\u2019s mortgage it was unnecessary for defendant either to record or renew his mortgage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">\u201c 11. It appears from the evidence that prior to April 1, 1881, Enos and Peter Elory were partners, and that on that \u25a0day, or the day before, the partnership was dissolved, and a settlement- had, by which Peter was found to be indebted to Enos in the sum to secure the payment of which plaintiff\u2019s chattel mortgage was given, December 1, 1882. blow, inasmuch as plaintiff\u2019s mortgage was made after defendant\u2019s $500 mortgage, and to secure an indebtedness which accrued prior to defendant\u2019s said mortgage, plaintiff\u2019s mortgage is not a <em>bona fid'e, </em>incumbrance as to that of defendant, and defendant\u2019s said mortgage is a prior lien to that of plaintiff\u2019s, although it was not renewed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">It is claimed by counsel for plaintiff this case should be ruled by <em>Briggs v. </em>Mette, 42 Mich. 12. \u00a5e do not, however, take this view of the case. The statute invoked by the plaintiff will be found in the margin. In the case of <em>Briggs v. Mette </em>it does not appear that the holders of the second mortgage had any actual notice of the first; neither does it appear that the second mortgage was given for a precedent debt; nor does it appear that the second mortgagee was liable for the indebtedness which was secured by the first mortgage. All of these facts appear in this case; and, in addition thereto, that the second mortgage contains a clause expressly making it subject to the first mortgage. Besides, <em>Briggs v. Mette </em>was decided previous to the statute providing for the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>charge of chattel mortgages after payment, and authorizing compulsory measures to be taken for that purpose.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The second mortgagee, who takes his mortgage subject to a prior one, which has been duly filed, cannot, by the neglect of the first mortgagee to file renewal affidavits, obtain a preference for his mortgage, when the first mortgage was given to secure the second mortgagee\u2019s own indebtedness, and that of his partner, from the latter of whom he receives his mortgage. No such advantage was ever intended by the statute, under such circumstances. The object of the statute was to prevent, and not to facilitate, fraud, and any construction which would accomplish the latter would be wrong and unj ust.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Where a subsequent mortgage contains a clause that it is made subject to a prior one, as between those mortgages filing is not necessary to maintain the relation the two sustain to each other 'until the first is paid. Priority of the second mortgage, as between the two, can never be obtained, except upon the agreement of the parties. Such stipulation runs wit'll the mortgage, and, whether it is on file or off, always tells the same story to all persons whose interests require its .perusal. It is a stipulation, binding upon the parties, show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ing how the mortgaged property is to be regarded, and continues soTong as the mortgage continues. It is intended to take the place of filing, as between all parties bound thereby when it is made, or who become subsequently interested in it or in the mortgaged property. It is a continued notice to all persons claiming by, through, or under it, and takes the place of statutory filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The record shows that Enos is the real party plaintiff; that the plaintiff gave no consideration for the mortgage, and holds it for his father; and that his rights are all subject to the equitable rights of the defendant. Tie can claim nothing Enos could not, were the latter plaintiff, and is chargeable with all the equities and knowledge of the same that exist in favor of the defendant, as he gave nothing for the mortgage,, and holds it as mere trustee for his father. He is not an incumbrancer in good faith, within the meaning of the statute, as against the defendant, as we have already said that the mortgage of defendant did not cease to be valid by neglect to file renewal affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">It is of little consequence what information Enos Elory obtained from Peter in regard to the payment of defendant\u2019s mortgages. Enos was one of the makers of part of defendant\u2019s mortgages, and all were made to secure his indebtedness. The proper place to seek such information was at the township clerk\u2019s oifice, or by going to his creditors. He certainly should know when his own indebtedness is paid, \u2014 at least, he will be presumed to know that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">As to the priority of liens of the several mortgages, the court said to the jury :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201c I therefore instruct you that the time having elapsed for the filing of an affidavit, the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage is entitled to priority over the mortgage of the defendant,. Comstock, of $500,.and the defendant cannot assert this mortgage as a lien upon the property as against the mortgage of the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">This, we think, was error, under the view taken of the case;, and we also think the requests of defendant\u2019s counsel above given were proper to go to the jury; and for these errors we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>think judgment at the circuit .should be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b584-4\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\"> \u201cEvery such mortgage shall cease to be valid, as against the creditors of the person making the same, or subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith, after the expiration of one year from the filing of the same, or a, copy thereof, unless within thirty days next preceding the expiration of the year the mortgagee, his agent or attorney, shall make and annex to the instrument or copy on file as aforesaid an affidavit setting forth the interest which the mortgagee has, by virtue of said mortgage, in the property therein mentioned; upon which affidavit the township or city -clerk shall indorse the time when the same was filed: <em>Provided, </em>that such affidavit, being made and filed before any purchase of such mortgaged property shall be made, or other mortgage received or lien obtained thereon, in good faith, shall be as valid to continue in effect such mortgage as if the same were made and filed within the period as above provided.\" How.
