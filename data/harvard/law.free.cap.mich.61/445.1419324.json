The principles of this case have never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>been departed from, but have been reasserted whenever the occasion arose: <em>Gt. W. Ry.

There can be no mitigation of <em>actual </em>damages, and proof of good faith does not mitigate: 3 Suth. Dam. 733, and cases; <em>Tefft v. Windsor, </em>17 Mich. 486; <em>Van Deusen v.

In so doing, and for the purpose of anchoring one of its light towers, under the direction of the defendant, .the company planted one' of its guy-posts, from eight to ten feet high, and about nine inches in diameter, in the street lawn, on the south side \u25a0of Joy street, in front of the residence of the plaintiff, which was located at the south-east corner of Joy street and Third avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The post was placed in the lawn, which was used for shade trees and ornamental purposes, about midway between the -curb and sidewalk, a little one side of the walk leading from the plaintiff\u2019s yard to the carriage block, on Joy street.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">The plaintiff protested against the use of his street lawn for such purpose, and forbade the defendant setting the guy-post therein. His remonstrances were unheeded, and the post was placed in the lawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">The plaintiff was offering his house and lot for sale at the time, and considered the use made of his premises by the company a damage to the property of at least $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">When the plaintiff learned of the intention of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ant to thus mar the beauty of his lawn, he took counsel of an attorney as to the right of the company to thus appropriate the use of his property,.and was informed that the planting of the post in his lawn was without authoidty, and that he had the legal right to remove the same. Acting upon advice thus received, after, the post was set, and the guy-line was attached thereto, he took a saw and cut into the post about four inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">A short time thereafter the defendant came to his house, and demanded that plaintiff should pay him six dollars for the post, and setting the same, and informed him that he had ordered his arrest, and that an officer would be there in a few moments for that purpose. The officer soo.n came, and, as the plaintiff claims, at the instance of the defendant, arrested him, in the presence of his wife and children, and took him to the residence of the superintendent of police; and, after detaining him there about 20 minutes, without any complaint having been made or warrant issued (it then being between 8 and 9 o\u2019clock in the evening), the officer, accompanied by the defendant a portion of the way, took him to the Fremont street station, and there searched him, and took from him his watch, some keys, a pocket-knife, and his money; and then locked him into a station cell, 8 by 10 feet, built of stone, and lined with iron, with a stone floor, and furnished with no bed or furniture, except two 'wooden benches, about 16 inches wide, extending the length of the cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">That in this condition he was imprisoned throughout the night, and until about 9 o\u2019clock the next morning, when he was taken from the cell, and, accompanied by an officer, \u25a0through the street, to a police office; and there kept until \u2022about half-past 11 o\u2019clock, when the defendant appeared, and made a complaint against him for willfully and maliciously injuring \u201c personal property of the Brush Light Company, to-wit, one guy-post,\u201d on the twelfth day of August, 1884, \u201cto the damage of six dollars.;\u201d and, after detaining him there until about 12 o\u2019clock, the police justice discharged him, upon his own recognizance, he declining to plead until he could see his counsel. What further was done with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>plaintiff in the police court does not appear from the record, although we are informed by the brief of one of the counsel that the case against him was subsequently heard, and the plaintiff was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The plaintiff, feeling himself greatly aggrieved and injured in the premises, brought this suit against the defendant in the superior court of Detroit, alleging as his cause of action his wrongful detention and imprisonment, \u201cwhereby he was greatly injured in name and-credit, and suffered great pain and mortification and disgrace, to his damage twenty thousand dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The defendant pleaded the general issue, and gave notice that he would show on the trial thereunder \u201c that the plaintiff willfully and maliciously and feloniously did destroy and injure the personal property of the Brush Electric Light Company, to-wit, one wooden post, which was there used to support the guy-lines pertaining to a tower, the property of said company, contrary to the statute in that behalf made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the people of the State of Michigan ;\u201d and further gave notice that he would show <em>\u201c </em>that he had reasonable and probable cause to believe that plaintiff was and had been guilty of willfully maliciously, and feloniously destroying and injuring the said guy-post, as above set forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The cause was tried before Judge Chipman, by jury, and a vei\u2019dict obtained for $4,500 against the defendant, who now brings error.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The record contains all the testimony taken in the case upon the trial, and the charge of the court in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Twenty-seven errors are assigned, and most of them relied upon for reversal. Six relate to the decisions of the court overruling defendant\u2019s objection to testimony offered by counsel for plaintiff; one to the ruling of the court in sustaining the objection of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to a question put upon cross-examination. We have carefully examined the exceptions upon which these assignments are based, and are satisfied none of them are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Of the remaining errors assigned, eleven are to the refusals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>of the court to charge as requested, and nine relate to exceptions taken to as many different portions of the charge of the court. An examination of the requests and the charge shows several of the defendant\u2019s requests were given by the court. The remainder were properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The exceptions needing most consideration are those relating to the charge on the question of damages. The able briefs of counsel on both sides have been carefully reviewed, and the authorities consulted, but we are unable to concur in the conclusions reached by the learned counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u25a0The court, in his charge to the jury, assumed that defendant had the right to plant the post in the lawn where he did, so that if there was any doubt or question upon that subject the charge was in the defendant\u2019s favor, and it is unnecessary to discuss that question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">It is not questioned or disputed that the arrest was made without any warrant or other process being issued for that purpose, and whether or not it was made by direction of the defendant was properly submitted to the jury, and they found against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The court further charged the jury that if the plaintiff Avas guilty of any offense in cutting the post, he Avas not guilty of felony, but of a misdemeanor;\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">\u201c That no arrest can be made for a misdemeanor unless by Avarrant, upon complaint duly made, or by an officer or bystander Avho actually sees the offense Avhich constitutes the misdemeanor. In the case of felony it is different. There, upon proper information, \u2014 such information as would justify a reasonable man in acting upon it, \u2014 an arrest may be made without Avarrant, and by one who does not see the actual commission of the offense. For the purposes of this case, I instruct you that the arrest, if an arrest was made, being without Avarrant, was an illegal arrest. * 'x' * The law of the land, under the circumstances of this case, demanded a Avarrant, <em>f * </em>* because, if made at all, it was made by a party who did not see the commission 'of the misdemeanor, and therefore had no authority to make-the arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">We think these instructions stated the law applicable to the case correctly. The facts upon which they were based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u2022were substantially undisputed, and we do not think the offense, if any was committed, was anything more than a misdemeanor, if all the testimony given upon this point is to be taken as true: 2 Cooley, Bl. 243; 4 Bl. Comm. 244; 2 Bish. Crim. Law, \u00a7 1000; <em>Black v. </em>State, 2 Md. 376; <em>State v. </em>Beekman, 27 N. J. Law, 124; <em>Hanway v. </em>Boultbee, 4 Car. <em>&amp; </em>P. 350; <em>Rex v. </em>Bright, Id. 387; <em>People v. </em>Smith, 5 Cow. 258; <em>State v. </em>Briggs, 1 Ark. 226; 4 Brok. Comm. 5, note 5; Rex <em>v. Powell, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Adol. 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Upon the subject of damages the court charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\u201c There are two kinds of damages, \u2014 the law has divided them into two classes. * * <em>* </em>In the first place, there are what are called actual \u2019 damages. Then there are what are called <em>\u2018 </em>vindictive \u2019 or \u00a3 punitory \u2019 damages, or what our own Supreme Court calls \u00a3 added \u2019 damages, for want of a better name. Actual damages are such compensation for the injury as would follow from the nature and character of the act. Actual damages, in this case, would be compensation for such injuries as would fall upon any man who underwent the same treatment which Mi-. Boss is shown to have undergone in this case. What are those damages ? What are the elements? There is the pain and suffering which any man would be supposed \u2014 which the average citizen would be supposed \u2014 to suffer under those circumstances. There is being shut up, \u2014 the physical discomfort. There is the sense of shame, mortification, wrong, and outrage. All these matters enter into the actual damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u201cYou are to view Mr. Boss as you would any other man in that regard. You are to be guided in that matter by your common sense, because there is no other rule, \u2014 there is no other way of getting at it. Your common sense is to determine what naturally and inevitably would be the suffering of the average citizen under such circumstances; because the law will not allow your feelings to be harrowed, will not allow you to be put to shame and mortification. In the eye of the law, those attributes of manhood, \u2014 those sentiments, those sensitivenesses, so to speak, \u2014which come from the better quality of our nature, are matters which are not to be trifled with, any more'than a man\u2019s -bones or his flesh. All these things the law considers precious. All these things the law considers as subjects of injury, and for injuries of this kind the law gives compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u201c What would the average man naturally suffer, under those circumstances, from this imprisonment, \u2014 from what took place, \u2014 from what Mi*. Ross was subjected to that night ? What the average man would suffer under those circumstances would be the actual damage. But, beyond actual damages, the law gives what are called \u2018 added5 damages. Those grow out of the wantonness or atrocity, so to speak, of the act. Those are given where an act is so wanton, so despotic, of so oppressive a character, or where it entails such shame, such publicity, upon a party, as to have the effect of exciting his feelings more than an act committed under less wanton, less oppressive circumstances. In such cases the law says the damages should be greater because the injury to the feelings is greater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">\u201c Now, is that the case here ? The actual damages nothing can mitigate. That which a man has actually suffered nothing can mitigate. But these \u2018 added \u2019 damages, as they are called, may be mitigated by all the surroundings of the case. Is this a case for these added damages \u2014 these punitory, exemplary damages \u2014 in addition to the actual damages? That is for you to determine. All the circumstances of the act are to be taken into consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201cIf you consider, under the explanation I have given you, that this is a case for these added, exemplary damages, \u2014 these damages over and beyond the actual damages, \u2014 then your next question will be whether there is anything to mitigate it; whether there was anything in the conduct of Mi*. Ross to excite Mr. Leggett to anger; whether Mr. Leggett, under the circumstances, had a right to be angry ; whether, if angry, Mr. Ross\u2019 conduct naturally provoked it; whether Mr. Ross did anything to bring the injury upon himself, in the respect that he naturally excited, angered, and provoked Mr. Leggett. That is for you entirely. If you think the case is one for these added or extra damages, are there facts and circumstances, which will mitigate and take from, them ? But remember, gentlemen, above all things :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201c <em>First. </em>You are to follow the rule of law I have given you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\"><em>\u201cSecond. </em>You are to ascertain whether Mr. Leggett is responsible. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\"><em>\u201cThird. </em>If he is responsible, you are to give the actual damages, no matter how small or how high.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">\u201c <em>Fourth. </em>You are to ascertain whether the circumstances are such as call for added, exemplary damages, and, if so, what they should be,\u2014 whether they should be anything; whether they should be mitigated by reason of any provocation; or whether they should be rendered to their full extent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>We think this charge is within the rule best supported by the authorities, and within the spirit of the decisions, so far as any have been made in this Court, inasmuch as the arrest was clearly without authority. <em>Allor v.

We have in the above quotation from the charge all that he said upon the subject, excepted to by defendant\u2019s counsel, and wre do not think the exception well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">It is of little consequence by what name the damages given are called, provided the case is one involving that class of ihjuries for which the plaintiff is entitled to recover. 'They may be called \u201cexemplary,\u201d \u201cpunitory,\u201d \u201cvindictive,\u201d \u201c compensatory,\u201d or \u201c added \u201d damages. The important question always is, in every case, was the character of the wrong suffered, or injury sustained, such as may be lawfully atoned for or compensated in money.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Actual damages are those which the injured party is entitled to recover for wrongs received and injuries done when none were intended. Damages beyond these, where the injuries and sufferings were intended, or occur through carelessness or negligence amounting to a wrong so reckless and wanton as -to be without palliation or excuse, are frequently and properly given, and have been variously designated by the terms above mentioned. The first are measured by known \u2022and well-defined rules. No rule can be laid down, properly measuring or limiting the damages allowable . in the other \u25a0class of cases, except they must not be oppressive, or such as to shock the common sense of fair-minded men; and they are therefore left to the reasonable discretion of the jury. A more definite rule cannot well be given as to these, as what would be right and just must depend entirely upon the circumstances of each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The jury, by their verdict, found the defendant guilty of the unlawful acts and trespasses to the person and feelings of the plaintiff complained of in his declaration, and if the wrongs inflicted by such unlawful acts were not intended, the lack of such intention could not prevent the pain and suffering experienced by the plaintiff by his false imprisonment, or prevent the physical discomfort \u2014 the sense of shame, mortification, outrage, and disgrace \u2014 inflicted upon and endured by the plaintiff; and, if so, they were but the natural consequences of the injury the plaintiff received by the treatment of the defendant, and they were all elements to be taken in \u25a0consideration by the jury in determining the actual damages, and no error was committed by the court in so charging the jury. It is no objection to this view that the same elements, or some of them, must be considered in fixing the amount of exemplary damages, when such are given.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Nowhere in the record or briefs of counsel do we find the damages awarded in the case claimed to be excessive, provided the plaintiff\u2019s declaration should be found sustained, and that question is settled by the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The case, as presented by the record, is not one calling for any very great amount of refining upon this subject, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>do not feel called upon, under the facts appearing in this case, to apply any technical rules, if such exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The record, we think, shows a fair trial, and no error is committed requiring a reversal, and the judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
