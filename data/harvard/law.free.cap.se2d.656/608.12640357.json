He further determined that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Plaintiffs employment caused or significantly contributed to his development of gout, or arthritis. Plaintiff was awarded temporary total disability benefits pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2097-29\">\n    N.C.

Both parties appealed to the Full Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In an Opinion and Award filed 5 February 2007, a majority of the Full Commission affirmed Deputy Commissioner Houser's Opinion and Award with modifications, finding that Plaintiff was not at maximum medical improvement and ordering further medical treatment for Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From the Opinion and Award of the Full Commission, Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff, a 38-year-old high school graduate, worked for Defendant as a recreational center custodian for approximately 15 years. His duties included sweeping, mopping, dusting, polishing, washing windows, washing baseboards, disposing of trash, and removing gum from floors and bleachers. In performing these duties, Plaintiff was required to use a mechanized buffer on the floors and a machine to shampoo the carpet. Additionally, Plaintiff worked some overtime for Defendant on weekends, stripping and waxing gym floors in several recreational centers throughout Winston-Salem. His primary duty during his overtime work was to operate' the stripping and buffing machinery, which necessitated the nearly constant gripping and twisting of his hands and wrists. Plaintiff performed all of these duties throughout his 15-year period of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to filing his workers' compensation claim, Plaintiff had been diagnosed with the following: gout, arthritis, hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, underlying idiopathic cardiomyopathy, shortness of breath, chest pain, bilateral knee pain, obesity, atrial fibrillation, tingling and numbness in his hands, hypertension, diabetes, and degenerative joint disease in his knees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Anthony DeFranzo, who treated Plaintiff for his carpal tunnel syndrome and was aware of Plaintiffs prior medical conditions, testified to the following: Plaintiffs gout and arthritis were aggravated by his employment but were not caused by his work activities; the combination of Plaintiffs gout, arthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome resulted in a significant disability in both hands; Plaintiffs employment exposed him to an increased risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as opposed to members of the general public not so exposed; and Plaintiff had not yet reached maximum medical improvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. James T. Burnette, Ph.D., CPE, an ergonomist, reviewed Plaintiffs work activities and determined that they were repetitive in nature and exposed him to an increased risk of developing bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as opposed to members of the general public not so exposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Appellate review of an Opinion and Award of the Full Commission is limited to a determination of whether the Full Commission's findings of fact are supported by any competent evidence, and whether those findings\n   support the Full Commission's legal conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

Compensable Injury\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant first contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the Full Commission's determination that Plaintiff's carpal tunnel syndrome is a compensable injury. Specifically, Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence for the Full Commission to find that Plaintiff's employment with Defendant increased his risk of contracting carpal tunnel syndrome. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For an injury to be compensable under our Workers' Compensation Act, it must be either the result of an \"accident arising out of and in the course of employment or an `occupational disease.'\"\n   <em>\n    Hansel v.

He explained:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [F]rom what I understand, [Plaintiff] did multiple duties as a custodian using his hands to do various tasks all day; but he also used vibrating equipment like floor buffers and things.

So there's about a ten (10) times increase ... of carpal tunnel syndrome in patients that do lots of work with their hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, when directly asked whether Plaintiff's job duties would \"increase his risk of [developing] carpal tunnel syndrome[,]\" Dr. DeFranzo replied, \"Yes.... [P]atients that do repetitive work [with their hands] have an increased incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome.\" This testimony is sufficient evidence to support the Full Commission's finding that \"Plaintiff's employment with Defendant ... exposed him to an increased risk of developing bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as opposed to members of the general public not so exposed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    Keller v.

For treatment of Plaintiffs bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, Dr. DeFranzo recommended surgical release procedures. On June 12, 2004, Dr. DeFranzo performed a release on Plaintiff's left wrist. Dr. DeFranzo medically excused Plaintiff from all work pending an appointment with a rheumatologist and referred him to physical therapy. Dr. DeFranzo recommended performing the right release procedure after Plaintiff had sufficiently recovered from the left release procedure. As of the hearing date before the Deputy Commissioner, Plaintiff had not undergone this right wrist procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   10.

Defendant argues, however, that Plaintiff did not offer any evidence that it would be futile for him to search for a job. In support of this argument, Defendant relies on Dr. DeFranzo's testimony that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   this kind of a person could have a security job, for instance, where they're just punching a time clock.

I thought that [Plaintiff] had about a five (5) percent permanent impairment in each hand from carpal tunnel syndrome ... and that the gout and osteoarthritis was so severe in this patient that he may have actually had a fifty (50) percent disability in each hand; but five (5) percent of that impairment would be from carpal tunnel syndrome in each hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Q. Doctor, is the Plaintiff's carpal tunnel syndrome debilitating to any extent?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A. The carpal tunnel syndrome itself has given him a five (5) percent disability in each hand, however, his arthritis and his gout have given him significant more disability. And in my opinion, I thought he had probably a fifty (50) percent disability in each hand. His joints are extremely stiff and they do not move, which limits his grip strength, and he has pain when he attempts to use his hands repetitively now. And all those factors together contribute to his disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Q. Doctor, you-in your letter-assigned the patient a permanent partial disability rating of up to fifty (50) percent of his hands?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Would it be necessary for you to give an accurate opinion of his partial and permanent disability-would it be necessary for you to see him again or would it be helpful?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   A. Yes. When we do a disability rating, we actually measure the motion in each joint-each and every joint of the hand....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On cross-examination, Dr. DeFranzo further testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Q. Is there any way to say-to categorize the job or, you know, any sort of attributation of the job as contributing to his carpal tunnel \"x\" percent over the gout or over the arthritis that he has?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   A. If it's osteoarthritis and gout-and the gout is reasonably well controlled, in my opinion is probably, you know, sixty (60) percent the job, since he did it for fifteen (15) years, and forty (40) percent the other factors. That would be probably my assessment; however, I think his disability purely from carpal tunnel syndrome is probably going to be five (5) percent in each hand from carpal tunnel syndrome. So the majority of his disability is from the arthritis and the gout, and the stiffness in his hands and lack of motion, which are caused by the arthritis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Q. I know you gave a five (5) percent PPD rating for carpal tunnel, but there's another rating of fifty (50) percent. Do I understand it correctly that you're saying, \"I'm giving him a fifty (50) percent as of February, but really to make this an accurate diagnosis, I'd like to see him again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   A. Yes, it-I'm just saying that five (5) percent of his disability is from the carpal tunnel syndrome in each hand; however, his hands just don't work ninety-five (95) percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   He's got at best-I thought-at that time about a fifty (50) percent use of his hands, not from just the carpal tunnel syndrome, but from all the other contributing conditions. Now, a large part of that sixty (60) percent might be work-related if it's just wear-and-tear osteoarthritis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendant argues that the above testimony shows that carpal tunnel syndrome accounts for only five percent of Plaintiffs disability. We disagree. To the contrary, it appears that the five percent \"disability\" to which Dr. DeFranzo testified most likely represents a permanent partial disability (or functional impairment) rating and not the extent to which Plaintiffs carpal tunnel syndrome contributed to his overall disability. As in\n   <em>\n    Counts,\n   </em>\n   a permanent`partial disability rating is not evidence of the extent to which Plaintiffs carpal, tunnel syndrome contributed to his inability to earn wages. At best, Dr. DeFranzo's testimony is equivocal as to whether he was expressing an opinion on a permanent partial impairment rating or attempting to apportion the percentage to which Plaintiffs occupational disease contributed to his disability. When evidence is capable of more than one interpretation, the Commission is not required to accept an interpretation urged by`one party over other obvious interpretations. It is also notable that Dr. DeFranzo was never asked what percentage of Plaintiffs inability to earn wages was attributable solely to his carpal tunnel syndrome. As in\n   <em>\n    Errante\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Counts,\n   </em>\n   we thus conclude here that the evidence was insufficient to require the Commission to apportion the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pitman v.

Advisory Medical Committee reports suggested that the plaintiff was completely incapacitated for work by reason of silicosis. However, the testimony and report of a physician tended to show that the plaintiff had, in addition to silicosis, a chronic obstructive lung disease which was due to smoking and possibly to asthma. The physician also stated that 50 percent of the plaintiff's total respiratory impairment was unrelated to the silicosis. The Commission found that the plaintiff was \"totally disabled because of his pulmonary condition.

Moreover, the evidence does not establish that Plaintiff Would have been disabled as the result of his pre-existing\n   health conditions in the absence of the work-related carpal tunnel syndrome. Even after Plaintiff was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and gout, and suffered two mini strokes, he continued to work with no change in his performance or duties.

The results of those studies were so significant for carpal tunnel syndrome that Dr. DeFranzo did not feel Plaintiff should continue to work until after surgery. Plaintiff was written out of work on 4 March 2004 and never released back to work. Plaintiff underwent surgery on his left hand on 19 April 2004, but surgery was never done on Plaintiffs right hand.

However, as Defendant points out, Plaintiff discontinued his treatment for financial reasons. More specifically, Plaintiffs health insurance expired after he left work due to his medical conditions. Thus, unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Aderholt,\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs inability to seek medical treatment here was hardly a voluntary \"decision to discontinue treatment.\" Furthermore, unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Aderholt,\n   </em>\n   evidence in this case indicates that Plaintiff will resume the treatment required to stabilize his carpal tunnel syndrome when he is financially able to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Accordingly, as the evidence tends to show that Plaintiffs medical treatment for his carpal tunnel syndrome may not be complete, that Plaintiff requires further medical evaluation at a minimum, and that Plaintiffs condition has not stabilized, the Commission correctly\n   determined that Plaintiff has not reached maximum medical improvement.

These findings and conclusions when coupled with Dr. DeFranzo's testimony cited by the majority at pages 15 through 17 of the Opinion are, in my opinion, sufficient to require the Commission to make additional findings regarding what portion of Claimant's disability is related to his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   I would, therefore, remand this case for further findings regarding what percentage of Claimant's disability is attributable to his job with the City.
