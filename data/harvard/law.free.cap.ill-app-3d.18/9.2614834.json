Rev. Stat. 1971, ch. 38, par. 16\u20141 (a)(1)). He was placed on probation for a period of one year with the condition that he pay restitution of ten dollars.</p> <p id=\"b29-14\" pgmap=\"29(145) 30(21)\">Defendant\u2019s only argument on appeal is that the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. At trial, Millicent Crenshaw testified that she was a student at South Shore High School. On November 21, 1972, as she was going into her locker, defendant took her wallet containing $10 from the shelf of her locker. Despite her request for the return of the wallet and money, defendant refused. A short time later, she again met the defendant in the lunchroom and again requested the return of her wallet and the $10. Defendant returned her wallet but refused to return the $10. This evidence was sufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction, even though the defendant presented evidence to the contrary. No error of law appears in the record and a full opinion by this court would have no precedential value. A review of the entire record leads to the conclusion that there is no reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p> <p id=\"b30-3\" pgmap=\"30\">The judgment of the circuit court of Cook County is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b30-4\" pgmap=\"30\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b30-5\" pgmap=\"30\">STAMOS, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
