He was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, forfeitures of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the grade of Private El. The convening authority approved forfeitures of $523.00 pay per month for twelve months, and otherwise approved the adjudged sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Although the case was submitted to this court \u201con its merits,\u201d we specified the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-7\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED TO THE SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF THE ACCUSED BY IMPROPERLY INSTRUCTING THE MEMBERS ON THE PROCEDURES TO USE IN VOTING ON PROPOSED SENTENCES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-8\">We have concluded that the military judge erred when he instructed the members that the voting procedures to be used were \u201csimilar to if [sic] candidates were running for office\u201d and that the members could \u201cvote on the top two\u201d proposed sentences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">During the sentencing phase of the trial, the military judge properly instructed the nine members on the proper procedures to use in considering proposed sentences. The president of the court then asked, \u201c[d]o we tally the votes after each [proposed sentence]?\u201d The military judge replied as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-10\">MJ: Well, you vote on\u2014what you do is, you\u2014every member does not have to propose a sentence but, if they do, every member has the right to propose a sentence. Now, maybe, a couple of people may not want to. After you discuss it, you know, there may be a general consensus on certain types of punishment and maybe four people submit proposals. You vote on each one, starting with the lightest. You say, \u201cHow many are in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-11\">favor of this and how many are in favor or [sic] this and that,\u201d and then you\u2019d collect all the ballots. Then you tally them up, similar to if [sic] candidates were running for office. You have Proposed Sentence A\u2014which may be, let\u2019s just say, a reprimand; that\u2019s the total sentence. The next one may be a reduction in grade and forfeiture, and the next one may be five years\u2019 confinement and a bad conduct discharge, and the next one may be ten years\u2019 confinement and a dishonorable discharge. Each one of those\u2014you vote on them as a block. You know, \u201cHow many are in favor of A,\u201d and you do that by secret, written ballot; B, C, and D, and you collect all those votes. Then you\u2019ll count them up. \u201cHow many votes do we have for A, how many for B, C and D?\u201d The second time around\u2014let\u2019s say, the first time around, you get a split of 3, 3 and 3 or something of that nature. You know, you obviously don\u2019t have a sufficient amount for any one of them to be accepted as the sentence of the court. So, the next time around, a member may say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s just vote on the top two,\u201d\u2014maybe it\u2019s A and D or A and C\u2014and so, fin\u00e9, you vote on those two and then, the same way until a sentence receives the required concurrence, which would be two-thirds if it\u2019s ten years or less, and three-fourths if it\u2019s more than ten years. Does that pretty well explain it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-12\">[President] Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-13\">MJ: Counsel have anything else they want me to add to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-14\">TC: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-15\">DC: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-16\">Government appellate counsel would have us believe that the instructions on voting, when taken as a whole, were not misleading or prejudicial. We reject that argument, and decline to presume that correct procedures were followed. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>30 M.J. 1150 (A.C.M.R. 1990). The military judge bears the responsibility for providing the court members with the correct instructions on the procedures to follow in voting for a sentence. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>21 M.J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>924 (A.C.M.R.1986). In our view, portions of these instructions on sentencing procedures were clearly defective and prejudicial to the appellant even though the trial defense counsel did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"AuQ\">Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1984, Rule for Courts-Martial 1006 [hereinafter R.C.M.], sets forth the procedures to be used by the members in deliberating and voting on an appropriate sentence. \u201cDeliberations may properly include full and free discussion of the sentence to be imposed in the case.\u201d R.C.M. 1006(b). A sentence proposal \u201cshall be in writing and shall contain the complete sentence proposed.\u201d R.C.M. 1006(c). All members \u201cvote on each proposed sentence in its entirety beginning with the least severe and continuing, as necessary, with the next least severe, until a sentence is adopted by the concurrence of the number of members required____\u201d R.C.M. 1006(d)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">The military judge failed to follow the requirements of R.C.M. 1006 in his instructions to the members. First, the military judge improperly instructed the members that the procedures were \u201csimilar to if [sic] candidates were running for office.\u201d Secondly, he compounded the problem by saying that the proposals, i.e., A, B, C and D, were to be voted on \u201cas a block.\u201d The meaning of this comment is ambiguous at best, and may have been interpreted improperly by the members. Thirdly, the military judge told the members that they were to vote by secret written ballot for the various proposals, to \u201ccollect all those votes,\u201d to \u201ccount them up,\u201d and to compare the number of votes for the different proposals. That instruction is inconsistent with his previous instructions. Fourthly, he presented a hypothetical situation where the nine member\u2019s votes were split 3, 3 and 3. These instructions, taken as a whole, were in error as to the only procedure that may be used by members in voting on sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">Voting during sentencing is unlike a political race that may have to be conducted with run-off ballots. In a court-martial, each individual proposed sentence (with its possible components of confinement, forfeitures, reduction, etc.) is voted on to see if the necessary concurrence is obtained. Thus, it would be impossible to get a three-way-split vote if the voting was conducted properly. Members are to vote on only one proposal at a time. In the example provided by the military judge in this case, the proper instruction would have been to vote on the lightest sentence proposal first, then to have the junior member collect and count the votes and then pass them on to the President to be verified and revealed to the other members.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">A military judge should issue additional instructions to the members if they do not understand the procedures to follow during sentencing. Apparent deviation from the approved procedures, however, may be determined to be a violation of military due process. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>18 U.S.C.M.A. 436, 40 C.M.R. 148 (C.M.A.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">The findings of guilty are affirmed. The sentence is set aside. A rehearing on the sentence may be ordered by the same or a different convening authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">Senior Judge NAUGHTON and Judge BAKER concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
