We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-22\">Appellant is a Texas prisoner who was convicted and sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment for aiding and abetting one Donald McGaha in the fatal shooting of her husband. In an opinion that disposed of all but one of the alleged errors that appellant presented to the court below,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction. Events transpiring subsequent to this affirmance formed the basis for a petition for rehearing in that court, alleging that appellant had been convicted on the basis of perjured testimony of the prosecution\u2019s chief witness, Donald McGaha. This petition for rehearing was denied without opinion. Appellant then applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>for habeas corpus relief in the court below, which suspended proceedings to enable her to seek relief in the Texas courts. The convicting court conducted an evidentiary hearing limited to the alleged use of perjured testimony and the trial judge\u2019s allegedly erroneous refusal to include a transcript of the voir dire examination in the record on appeal to enable appellant to substantiate her claims of wrongful inclusion and exclusion of women from the jury venire. The state court denied relief in an order affirmed without opinion. Thereupon, without holding an evidentiary hearing, the court below also denied relief; and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">With a few exceptions, appellant\u2019s allegations of errors committed by the state trial court are wholly without merit, and the court below was well within the bounds of its discretion in adopting the comprehensive opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals in lieu of holding an evidentiary hearing. McDonald v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1969, 405 F.2d 884. We therefore turn to appellant\u2019s more substantial contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The most serious of these is that she was denied due process because the state trial judge permitted extensive still and motion picture photography of the trial proceedings. The facts surrounding this claim are much in dispute. The record reflects that after considerable testimony had been taken, appellant objected to the presence of photographers while the court was in session. The court sustained this objection, and appellant did not object further. Appellant contends that photography continued after her objection was sustained; but the trial judge, in his qualifications to appellant\u2019s formal bill of exception, stated that he did not allow any photography after appellant\u2019s objection except during recesses when pictures of appellant and her attorney were taken with their permission, and that all photography occurring prior to appellant\u2019s objection had been conducted in an orderly, unobtrusive manner. On the basis of these conflicting claims, the Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that the situation at trial did not approach the \u201cRoman holiday\u201d atmosphere of Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966), and that it was not inherently lacking in due process under Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965). The court below approved this holding after reviewing the record before it, which apparently included some of the photographs taken at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\"> We approach' with great care appellant\u2019s contention that she was denied due process by the trial court\u2019s permitting motion picture and still photography of the proceedings, for such practices are widely disfavored. Television coverage of a trial is considered inherently prejudicial, even absent a showing of actual harm to the defendant. <em>Estes, supra,. </em>That rule reflects some considerations that apply with equal force here. Not only may still and motion picture photography have unfavorable psychological effects on the participants in a trial, <em>see Estes, supra, </em>but the mere presence of photographers and photographic equipment may destroy the atmosphere necessary to decide the fate of an accused.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number> Bearing these factors in mind, we are nevertheless compelled to reject appellant\u2019s contention. Resolution of this question depends largely on proof of what took place at the trial, <em>cf. </em>Nichols v. Henderson, 6th Cir. 1968, 389 F.2d 990, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 955, 89 S.Ct. 384, 21 L.Ed.2d 366 (1968). Even though the methods of proof available to appellant on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals were relatively restrictive (bill of exception with trial judge\u2019s qualification; bystanders\u2019 bills, containing affidavits of disinterested lay observers), and even though the courtroom photography claim has not been the subject of an evidentiary hearing in any court, we do not believe that a remand for an evidentiary hearing would produce any more reliable and complete a record of the events at trial than has already been considered by both the Court of Criminal Appeals and the court below. We are unable to say that the conclusions of either court are clearly erroneous, and thus turn to a consideration of appellant\u2019s contention that she was convicted on the perjured testimony of Donald McGaha.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">At appellant\u2019s trial, McGaha testified in detail that he had shot appellant\u2019s husband at her encouragement and with her aid. He denied that he had been promised anything by the State in return for his crucial testimony \u2014 \u201cnot even so much as a cold drink of water.\u201d After McGaha\u2019s subsequent conviction and imprisonment for this murder, he volunteered to appellant\u2019s counsel a sworn statement that his testimony at her trial had been false, including his denial that his testimony had been given in exchange for a promise of leniency. McGaha subsequently executed a second affidavit re-affirming the truthfulness of his testimony at trial and denying the truthfulness of the first affidavit. In the state district court habeas hearing, McGaha was questioned at length by both sides, and steadfastly maintained that his trial testimony had been true.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Relying on Green v. State, 94 Tex.Cr.R. 637, 252 S.W. 499 (1923), McConnell v. State, 82 Tex.Cr.R. 634, 200 S.W. 842 (1918), and Wadkins v. State, 102 Tex.Cr.R. 292, 277 S.W. 684 (1925), appellant contends that McGaha\u2019s executing the first affidavit contradicting his trial testimony required giving her a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">None of the cases cited by appellant is in point, because none deals with a recanting witness who subsequently withdraws his recantation and reaffirms the testimony he gave at trial. On the other hand, this court has dealt with this set of facts in many cases presenting the analogous situation of appeals from orders denying motions for new trial based on recantation by prosecution witnesses. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Nolte, 5th Cir. 1971, 440 F.2d 1124; United States v. Smith, 5th Cir. 1970, 433 F.2d 149; Ledet v. United States, 5th Cir. 1962, 297 F.2d 737; Newman v. United States, 5th Cir. 1956, 238 F.2d 861. We have held consistently that a new trial is not warranted when the substance of the recantation has been thoroughly discredited. As in <em>Smith, supra, </em>it is obvious that McGaha\u2019s second affidavit and his testimony at the state district court habeas hearing removed any firm basis for doubting the truthfulness of his testimony at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">We likewise reject appellant\u2019s contentions that women with children under age eighteen were discriminatorily excluded from the venire, and that a Mrs. Hilliard, whom the jury commissioners considered \u201cintelligent and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>sponsible,\u201d was wrongfully included, the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to quash the venire, one of the jury commissioners testified that women were selected for the venire from which appellant\u2019s jury was chosen; and in his qualifications to appellant\u2019s bill of exceptions regarding this hearing, the state trial judge asserted that women with school-age children were included on the venire, and in fact did serve as jurors in other-cases. But even if we ignore this evidence and accept appellant\u2019s view of the facts, appellant has still not met her burden of showing discrimination against a distinct, identifiable class in the selection of the venire. Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545, 87 S.Ct. 643, 17 L.Ed.2d 599 (1967); Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475, 74 S.Ct. 667, 98 L.Ed. 866 (1954); United States v. Kuhn, 5th Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 179. We note that the Texas statutes in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s trial required the clerk of the court to furnish to the jury commissioners a list of potential veniremen who were exempt from petit jury service, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2107, including \u201cfemales who have legal custody of a child or children under the age of sixteen (16) years.\u201d Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2135. If it is true that the jury commissioners excluded women with children under the age of <em>eighteen, </em>rather than <em>sixteen, </em>then they may have excluded a group larger than that specified by the Texas statutes. But whether the jury commissioners complied with the letter of Texas law in their choice of veniremen is a different question from whether their error, if any, assumed constitutional magnitude. There is nothing to suggest that women with children between the ages of sixteen and eighteen \u2014 or, for that matter, women with children under sixteen \u2014 constitute a recognizable class against whom discrimination in jury selection is prohibited. Surely appellant would not argue that community prejudices manifest a recognition of these groups as distinct classes, <em>see Hernandez, </em>supra; and she has not attempted to show that women At with school-age children are a group whose exclusion \u201cwill deprive the jury of a perspective on human experience\u201d without which appellant could not be fairly tried. Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493, 92 S.Ct. 2163, 33 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">Likewise, we cannot accept appellant\u2019s contention that the jury commissioners wrongfully included among the veniremen a Mrs. Hilliard, the wife of a Baptist minister and a woman whom they considered intelligent and responsible. Not only has appellant failed to explain how Mrs. Hilliard\u2019s presence on the venire prejudiced her, but she has failed to persuade us that, in selecting Mrs. Hilliard, the jury commissioners were not simply fulfilling their statutory duty of selecting veniremen \u201cof good moral character, of sound judgment, well-informed, and, so far as practicable, able to read and write. . . . \u201d Tex. Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2110.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\"> Lastly, we reject the argument that the state trial judge wrongfully denied appellant\u2019s request that a transcript of the voir dire examination be included in the record on appeal, to enable her to establish her claims of wrongful exclusion and inclusion. The transcript of the voir dire \u2014 the interrogation of members of the venire by the lawyers who tried the case \u2014 might be relevant to a claim that the State improperly used its peremptory challenges to effect a discriminatory selection of the jury that tried appellant, <em>see </em>Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965); but it is immaterial to an allegation that discrimination occurred at an altogether different stage in the proceedings, the jury commissioners\u2019 selection of the venire from which appellant\u2019s jury was ultimately chosen. The \u201crecord of sufficient completeness\u201d contemplated by Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956), comprehends only those matters germane to points raised on appeal. Mayer v. City of Chicago, 404 U.S. 189, 92 S.Ct. 410, 30 L.Ed.2d 372 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-10\">.
