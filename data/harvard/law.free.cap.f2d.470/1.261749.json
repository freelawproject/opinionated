Chief District Judge Robert A. Grant of the Northern District of Indiana is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b82-6\">KILEY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Plaintiff, a resident of Pennsylvania, filed this three count diversity complaint to recover damages for severe emotional injury suffered as a result of the deliberate refusal of Life of America Insurance Company (Insurer), of Chicago, to pay her the proceeds of Insurer\u2019s policy covering the life of her husband. The district court dismissed the suit. Plaintiff has appealed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">In Count I plaintiff sought recovery of the face amount of the policy. In Count II she sought compensatory damage for Insurer\u2019s \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d in refusing to pay her the policy proceeds when its duty was clear and when it knew of plaintiff\u2019s and her family\u2019s financial distress. In Count III she sought compensatory and punitive damages 1) because Insurer allegedly defrauded decedent into the insurance contract by its promise of payment of benefits immediately upon proof of the insured\u2019s death from \u201caccidental causes,\u201d while at the time its practice was not to pay meritorious claims; and 2) because Insurer allegedly sought by \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d to compel plaintiff \u2014 so increasingly financially distressed \u2014 to accept less than the face value of the policy or be forced to sue for payment of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The district court dismissed Counts II and III as stating no claim on which relief could be granted, and then dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d Count I. After the complaint was dismissed plaintiff filed an action in the Circuit Court of Cook County based on Count I to recover the face amount of the policy and attorney\u2019s fees under Ch. 73, \u00a7 767, Ill.Rev.Stats. That case was settled. Only Counts II and III, therefore, are before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">Taking the allegations, properly pleaded in Counts II and III, as true, the following facts are stated: Defendant\u2019s life insurance policy covering plaintiff\u2019s husband issued September 22, 1967. Under the policy Insurer agreed to pay plaintiff $5,000 immediately upon due proof of death from \u201caccidental causes.\u201d On December 17, 1967, insured was an accidental victim of a homicide. Plaintiff met all conditions of the policy and repeatedly demanded payment, but Insurer refused to pay. Decedent left plaintiff with several children, but no property of value. She had no money, none even for the funeral expenses. Denied payment by Insurer, she was required to borrow money to support her family, while her financial condition worsened. The family was required to live with, and accept charity from, relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">Further: Insurer knew or should have known of the death of decedent from accidental causes and of plaintiff\u2019s dire need of the policy proceeds. Yet Insurer repeatedly and deliberately refused her demands for payment, and as a proximate result she was caused to suffer \u201csevere distress and disturbance of [her] mental tranquility.\u201d Instead of paying her the proceeds of the policy, and being fully aware of the accidental cause of decedent\u2019s death and of plaintiff\u2019s financial distress, Insurer breached the policy promise to pay immediately upon proof of death. Insurer, knowing full well that plaintiff needed the proceeds of the policy to provide necessaries for her children, applied \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d in refusing to make payment on the policy, and in \u201cinviting\u201d plaintiff to \u201ccompromise\u201d her claim by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>implying it (Insurer) had a valid defense to the claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The issue before us with respect to Counts II and III is whether plaintiff\u2014 beneficiary of her husband\u2019s life insurance policy- \u2014 may on the foregoing \u201cfacts\u201d recover damages for severe mental distress allegedly suffered as a result of Insurer\u2019s conduct. Illinois law controls our decision, and, in anticipation <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the Illinois Supreme Court would hold as we do, we decide the issue in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">We have no doubt, in view of Knierim v. Izzo, 22 Ill.2d 73, 174 N.E.2d 157 (1961), that the Illinois Supreme Court would sustain plaintiff\u2019s complaint against Insurer\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">In <em>Knierim, </em>plaintiff filed a wrongful death action alleging, inter alia, that defendant Izzo threatened her with the murder of her husband, carried out the threat, and thereby proximately caused her severe emotional distress. The trial court dismissed her complaint, but the Illinois Supreme Court reversed and held that plaintiff had stated a cause of action for an intentional causing of severe emotional distress by Izzo\u2019s \u201coutrageous conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The court recognized the \u201cnew tort\u201d of intentional infliction of severe emotional distress, following similar recognition by an \u201cincreasing number of courts,\u201d and cited several state decisions. 174 N.E.2d at 163. The court rejected reasons given by other courts not recognizing the \u201cnew tort.\u201d As to the reason that mental disturbance is incapable of financial measurement, the court pointed out that \u201cpain and suffering\u201d and \u201cmental suffering\u201d are elements of damage, respectively, in personal injury and malicious prosecution cases. 174 N.E.2d at 163. As to the reason that mental consequences are too evanescent for the law to deal with, the court noted that psychosomatic medicine had learned much in the past \u201cthirty years\u201d about the bodily effects of man\u2019s emotions, and that symptoms produced by \u201cstronger emotions\u201d are now visible to the professional eye. 174 N.E.2d kt 164. As to the reason that recognizing the \u201cnew tort\u201d would lead to frivolous claims, the court observed that triers of fact from their own experiences would be able to draw a line between \u201cslight hurts\u201d and \u201coutrageous conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And finally, as to the reason that mental consequences vary greatly with the individual so as to pose difficulties too great for the law, the court adopted an objective standard against which emotional distress could be measured. The court thought that the standard of \u201csevere emotional distress to a person of ordinary sensibilities, in the absence of special knowledge or notice\u201d would be a sufficient limit for excluding \u201cmere vulgarities * * * as meaningless abusive expressions.\u201d 174 N.E.2d at 165. The court noted that the \u201creasonable man\u201d is well known to triers of fact who are also well acquainted with \u201cthe man of ordinary sensibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">The court added a cautionary note, expressing confidence that Illinois trial judges would not permit litigation to introduce \u201ctrivialities and mere bad manners\u201d under the cloak of the \u201cnew tort.\u201d The court concluded \u2014 with implications from the famous Warren-Brandeis article on the \u201cnew tort\u201d or privacy \u2014 that peace of mind is a personal interest of sufficient importance to receive the law\u2019s protection against intentional invasion by \u201coutrageous conduct,\u201d and that the allegations in Mrs. Knierim\u2019s complaint stated a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">In <em>Knierim </em>the court, inter alia, relied upon State Rubbish Collectors Associa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tion v. Siliznoff, 38 Cal.2d 330, 240 P.2d 282 (1952), and Restatement, Torts \u00a7 46 (1948 Supp.). In <em>Siliznoff </em>the California Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Roger Traynor, recognized the \u201cnew tort\u201d for the first time and held that Siliznoff could recover from the cross-defendant Rubbish Collectors Association for mental distress caused by the Association\u2019s severe threats to beat him up, destroy his truck and put him out of business unless Siliznoff offered to pay over certain proceeds to the Association. Later, the California Supreme Court <em>en banc </em>affirmed a trial court judgment against an insurance company, including $25,000 for mental suffering caused by the insurance company\u2019s earlier unreasonable refusal to accept a settlement within the limits of the liability policy. Crisci v. Security Ins. Co. of New Haven, 66 Cal.2d 425, 58 Cal.Rptr. 13, 426 P.2d 173 (1970). There Mrs. Crisci\u2019s mental distress claim was in addition to her loss of property caused by the insurance company\u2019s failure to settle. The court thought that where there were substantial damages apart from the mental distress, the danger of fictitious claims was reduced. Subsequently in Fletcher v. Western National Life Ins. Co., 10 Cal.App.3d 376, 89 Cal.Rptr. 78 (1970), an appellate court relying upon <em>Siliznoff </em>and <em>Crisci, </em>held that the defendant insurance company\u2019s threatened and actual bad faith refusals to make payments under the disability policy were essentially tortious in nature and could legally be the basis for an action against the company for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The decision rested on the finding that the refusals were maliciously employed by the company in concert with false and threatening communications directed to the badly injured plaintiff-insured for the purpose of causing him to surrender his policy or disadvantageously settle a nonexistent dispute. 89 Cal.Rptr. at 93. The court found sufficient evidence showing emotional distress of the \u201crequisite severity\u201d (i. <em>e., </em>outrageousness), and thus affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of judgment N.O.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We think that the California court in <em>Fletcher, supra, </em>set out correctly the elements of a prima facie case for the tort of \u201cintentional infliction of severe emotional distress\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">(1) Outrageous conduct by the defendant ;</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">(2) The defendant\u2019s intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress;</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">(3) The plaintiff\u2019s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">(4) Actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant\u2019s outrageous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">See <em>Knierim, supra; </em>Restatement 2d Torts, \u00a7 46(1); Prosser, Torts \u00a7 11 (3d Ed.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">It is our view that were this case before the Illinois Supreme Court, that court would find the foregoing elements substantially correct; and that plaintiff here has sufficiently pleaded the elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">It is recognized that the outrageous character of a person\u2019s conduct may arise from an abuse by that person of a position which gives him power to affect the interests of another; and that in this sense extreme \u201cbullying tactics\u201d and other \u201chigh pressure\u201d methods of insurance adjusters seeking to force compromises or settlements may constitute outrageous conduct. Restatement 2d Torts \u00a7 46 Comment (e); Prosser, Torts \u00a7 11 at 49-50. It is also recognized that the extreme character of a person\u2019s conduct may arise from that person\u2019s knowledge that the other is peculiarly susceptible to emotional distress by reason of some physical or mental condition or peculiarity. Restatement 2d Torts \u00a7 46 Comment (f); Prosser, Torts \u00a7 11. See Keenan, The Insurer and the Tort of the Intentional Infliction of Mental Distress, Insurance Counsel Journal 335 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">Here Insurer\u2019s alleged bad faith refusal to make payment on the policy, coupled with its deliberate use of \u201ceco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>nomic coercion\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>by delaying and refusing payment it increased plaintiff's financial distress thereby coercing her to compromise and settle) to force a settlement, clearly rises to the level of \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d to a person of \u201cordinary sensibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Furthermore, it is common knowledge that one of the most frequent considerations in procuring life insurance is to ensure the continued economic and mental welfare of the beneficiaries upon the death of the insured. See <em>Crisci, </em>66 Cal.2d 425, 58 Cal.Rptr. at 19, 426 P.2d at 179. The very risks insured against presuppose that upon the death of the insured the beneficiary might be in difficult circumstances and thus particularly susceptible and vulnerable to high pressure tactics by an economically powerful entity. <em>Fletcher, </em>89 Cal.Rptr. at 95. In the case before us Insurer\u2019s alleged high pressure methods (economic coercion) were aimed at the very thing insured against, and we think that the insurance company was on notice that plaintiff would be particularly vulnerable to mental distress by reason of her financial plight.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"> In deciding as we do, we note that insurance business affects a great many people, is subject to substantial governmental regulation and is stamped with a public interest. Memorial Gardens Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Smith, 16 Ill.2d 116, 156 N.E.2d 587 (1959); People ex rel. Bolton v. Progressive Gen. Ins. Co., 85 Ill.App.2d 427, 229 N.E.2d 350 (1967); <em>Crisci, supra; Fletcher, supra. </em>We also note that insurance contracts <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are subject to the same implied conditions of good faith and fair dealing as are other contracts. Appleman, Insurance \u00a7 1612 (1967); I.L.P., Insurance \u00a7\u00a7 101, 141 et seq. (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">It is true that settlement tactics may be privileged under circumstances where an insurer has done no more than insist upon his legal rights in a permissible way. But we do not think that a refusal to make payments based on a bad faith insistence on a non-existent defense is privileged conduct against the complaint here.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">We hold, however, that plaintiff may not recover punitive damages<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because in our view Knierim v. Izzo, <em>supra, </em>will not support an anticipation that the Illinois Supreme Court would sustain a judgment allowing punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">In <em>Knierim </em>the Illinois Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">We believe, nevertheless, that punitive damages cannot be sanctioned as an additional recovery in such an action. Since the outrageous quality of the defendant\u2019s conduct forms the basis of the action, the rendition of compensatory damages will be sufficiently punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">The court then went on to hold effectually that the trial court did not err in dismissing the \u201cportions of Counts III and IV that related to . punitive damages.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We fail to see, in the face of that language how we can anticipate that punitive damages are permissible in an action under the \u201cnew tort\u201d in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">For the reasons given, the judgment of the district court dismissing Counts II and III of plaintiff\u2019s complaint is hereby reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-10\">. Attached to the complaint is a copy of Insurer\u2019s letter of January 12, 396S. The letter suggests that in view of a police investigation not likely to be completed until the \u201cvery distant future,\u201d plaintiff miglit like to suggest an offer to \u201csettle\u201d rather than wait for the police report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b83-18\">. See 1A Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 0.309 [2] at 3326 et seq. 2d Ed. (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b85-6\">. We think it is clear that an action of the type involved here sounds both in contract and in tort.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\">. Defendant argues that Ill.Rev.Stat. Ch. 73 \u00a7 767, Attorney Fees, limits plaintiff's recovery to |1,000. However, defendant cites no decision for its position. Anil we think that the statute by its terms is limited to attorney fees and does not militate against our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b85-20\">. In this respect the Illinois court stopped short of the California courts which approve punitive damages in the \u201cnew tort.\u201d 89 Cal.Rptr. at 95.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
