KAUFMAN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">The Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (the Veterans), an unincorporated association whose members served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade which fought on the losing side in the Spanish Civil War in the years before World War II, and three of those members, instituted this action in the District Court in early 1967. That Court\u2019s summary dismissal of the complaint was vacated by this Court in an opinion filed February 14, 1969, written by Judge Prettyman and joined by Chief Judge Bazelon with Judge Danaher dissenting. Veterans of Abraham Lincoln Brigade v. Attorney General, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 222, 409 F.2d 1139 (1969). Therein (at 1139,) the majority remanded this case on the same basis as this Court had earlier \u201cremanded for hearing . . . certain phases\u201d in Industrial Workers of World v. Clark, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 165, 385 F.2d 687 (1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 948, 88 S.Ct. 1036, 19 L.Ed.2d 1138 (1968). In the latter case, Judge Leventhal, writing for himself and Judge Robinson, with Judge Danaher dissenting, reviewed the original establishment in 1947 of the so-called \u201cAttorney General\u2019s List\u201d by Executive Order of President Truman, and its reconstitution in 1953 pursuant to an Executive Order promulgated by President Eisenhower subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 71 S.Ct. 624, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was designated on the lists published under both the 1947 and 1953 Executive Orders. The 1953 Order provided procedures for challenging listings but required any organization which had been listed under the 1947 Order to file a written notice of such challenge within ten days from the effective date of the 1953 Order. The IWW did not seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>a hearing within such ten-day period and while it \u201ckept up correspondence with the Attorney General intermittently over the years protesting its inclusion in the Attorney General\u2019s List, no court challenge\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was instituted until 1965. Judge Leventhal held that in view of the IWW\u2019s failure timely to challenge the 1953 listing it was not an \u201cabuse of discretion for the District Court [in the case instituted by the IWW in 1965] to refuse to consider the IWW\u2019s challenges to its 1953 listing,\u201d but added:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">That determination, however, does not dispose of the case .... To say that the IWW can no longer demand a judicial hearing on the validity of the 1953 listing is a far cry from concluding that the organization is <em>eternally </em>ousted from resort to the courts for other, subsequent complaints. It is settled that justiciable rights are involved here. See Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. Mc-Grath, <em>supra. </em>First Amendment rights are at stake. In such a situation we think the chief law officer of the United States is under a legal duty to adhere to minimal standards of fairness and reasonableness when he acts. [At 692; emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Additionally, Judge Leventhal commented (at 693) that \u201c[ultimate resolution may come to require some consideration of the factual background for [IWW\u2019s] designation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Like the IWW the Veterans was originally designated by the Attorney General as a Communist organization in 1948 and was placed on the reconstituted list in 1953. When this case was last before this Court, Judge Prettyman (409 F.2d <em>supra </em>at 1140), noting that the Veterans had \u201cstruggled constantly and vigorously for years against classification as a Communist-front organization\u201d commented specifically, in a short opinion remanding this ease for further proceedings, that it presented a problem similar to that posed in the <em>IWW </em>case. After this Court\u2019s February 14, 1969 order and the denial of a petition for rehearing on March 14, 1969, the District Court, on November 20, 1969, in turn remanded the case \u201cto the Attorney General of the United States for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion of the Court of Appeals dated February 14, 1969.\u201d On November 25, 1969, counsel for plaintiffs wrote the following letter to the Attorney General:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">On November 3, 1969, I wrote you on behalf of our client Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade requesting removal of its name from the Attorney General\u2019s List and, in the event of your unwillingness to do so, a statement of the grounds for your refusal. I have not received any response from you.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Since writing you, District Judge John J. Sirica has signed the order submitted by the plaintiffs in Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, et al. v. The Attorney General, directing that the case be remanded to you \u201cfor further proceedings in accordance with the opinion of the Court of Appeals dated February 14, 1969.\u201d A counter order submitted by the Government was not signed by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Under the circumstances, I reiterate my request that you remove the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade from the listing for the reasons noted in our letter of November 3. Specifically, I call your attention to the grounds stated in the decision of the Court of Appeals, i. e., \u201cthe abandonment by mutual agreement of the effort to achieve registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Again I request that in the event that you should refuse to remove the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade from the list, you be good enough to set forth specifically the ground or grounds for your refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">The Attorney General did not respond to, or take any action in connection with, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>counsel\u2019s said letter. Subsequently, on March 5, 1970, plaintiffs filed a motion in the District Court to enforce that Court\u2019s November 20, 1969 remand order. Thereafter, on April 13, 1970, the Attorney General filed in the District Court a motion to dismiss \u201cfor the following reason\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Pursuant to this Court\u2019s Order on Remand entered November 20, 1969, the Attorney General reviewed the matter of the listing of the plaintiff organizations under Executive Order 10450 in light of the judgment and opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"AI5\">As a result of such review, the Attorney General on April 7, 1970, signed Order No. 428-70, amending the List of Organizations designated pursuant to Executive Order 10450, by inserting after the names of the organizations the following: \u201cprior to April 20, 1966.\u201d The listing as amended will read as follows with respect to plaintiff organizations:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Abraham Lincoln Brigade (prior to April 20, 1966) Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (prior to April 20, 1966) .</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The Attorney General\u2019s April 7, 1970 action amending the listing was taken without any prior notice\u2019 to plaintiffs and without affording the Veterans the opportunity of any hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">On November 25, 1970, the District Court denied, without amplification, plaintiffs motion to enforce the District Court\u2019s November 20, 1969 remand order directed to the Attorney General. In this appeal which followed, plaintiffs once again seek to have this Court reexamine certain First Amendment and other non-procedural constitutional questions posed but not reached in both Industrial Workers v. Clark, <em>supra, </em>and in this case when it was here before. This Court declines so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">In Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, <em>supra, </em>plaintiffs <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> attacked the listing by the Attorney General pursuant to President Truman\u2019s Executive Order. The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Mr. Justice Burton for himself and Mr. Justice Douglas, reversed the grant by the court below of motions to dismiss, holding that upon the facts alleged by plaintiffs in their complaints, which for purposes of the dismissal motions were taken as admitted, the Attorney General could not designate the plaintiff organizations as Communist without affording them \u201cany opportunity to substantiate their allegations\u201d (341 U.S. at 126, 71 S.Ct. at 625). Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s concurrence rested on the broader basis that due process required notice and hearing before listing. Mr. Justice Douglas, in a separate concurring opinion, wrote (at 178, 71 S.Ct. at 652) that \u201c[njotice and opportunity to be heard are fundamental to due process of law.\u201d Mr. Justice Jackson, in his concurring opinion, expressed similar views. In all, six opinions were filed by the eight Justices who heard the case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> including opinions by all five of the Justices who voted for reversal. The views of the dissenters were set forth in a single opinion filed by Mr. Justice Reed for Mr. Chief Justice Vinson, Mr. Justice Minton and himself. The three dissenters wrote that the Attorney General could act, as plaintiffs had alleged he had acted, without affording an opportunity for hearing. On the other hand, only Mr. Justice Black reached the conclusion (at 143-144, 71 S.Ct. at 634) that \u201cthe executive has no constitutional authority, with or without a hearing, officially to prepare and publish the lists challenged by petitioners,\u201d because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>such listing is irreconcilable with the First Amendment and also because such actions \u201cpossess almost every quality of bills of attainder\u201d in violation of U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10. Mr. Justice Black\u2019s views were specifically rejected by the three dissenters.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Views substantially similar to those expressed by Mr. Justice Black in <em>Jt. Anti-Fascist </em>have been previously pressed upon this Court in <em>IWW </em>and when this case was here before in 1969. In each instance, an acceptance of Mr. Justice Black\u2019s thinking would have required reversals with directions to enter judgments for plaintiffs, rather than reversal and remand for further proceedings by the Attorney General. While it is of course never too late in the day to do as justice requires, in the case of this appeal it is not necessary to adopt Mr. Justice Black\u2019s position in <em>Jt. Anti-Fascist </em>in order to reverse and to order stricken the names of the Brigade and the Veterans from the Attorney General\u2019s list, and thus to eliminate the abuse of governmental process inherent in the continued listing of those organizations without affording them the hearing required by this Court\u2019s remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The reason for this Court\u2019s remand order of February 14, 1969 was to afford to plaintiffs herein an opportunity for a hearing which five Justices in <em>Jt. AntiFascist </em>and the majority opinion of this Court in <em>IWW </em>held they were entitled to have. On remand, <em>without </em>affording any opportunity for hearing and <em>without </em>any notice to plaintiffs, the Attorney General continued the listing of the Veterans and the Brigade by adding the words: \u201cprior to April 20, 1966.\u201d The burdens of unjustified listing, discussed by Justices Burton, Douglas, Black, Frankfurter, and Jackson in <em>Jt. AntiFascist </em>and by Judge Leventhal in <em>IWW, </em>are not lessened by the inclusion of those or similar words. To the contrary, those words violate the spirit of, and effectively drive a horse and wagon through, this Court\u2019s February 14, 1969 remand order. Plaintiffs herein were entitled as a matter of their constitutional rights to have the Attorney General of the United States, the chief law enforcement officer of this country, fully and expeditiously comply with an order of this Court from which the Government sought no review in the Supreme Court. In view of the Attorney General\u2019s failure so to do, the continued listing of the Brigade and the Veterans cannot be tolerated. The judgment of the District Court is reversed and remanded to the District Court and that Court is directed forthwith to issue an appropriate order requiring the Attorney General to delist those organizations. It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-13\">. Industrial Workers of World v. Clark, <em>supra </em>385 F.2d at 688.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b524-9\">.

Attorney General, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 222, 409 F.2d 1139 (1969), Judge Pretty-man, writing for the majority, had ordered a remand \u201cfor hearing on certain phases\u201d of the appellants\u2019 claim. I dissented, firmly of the opinion that the door then was being opened to permit, on constitutional grounds, a long-belated attack upon the power of the Executive. My dissent there recited language posed by appellants themselves on brief as they challenged their having been listed. I felt that their long delay in seeking such relief should bar further consideration of the grounds relied upon by the appellants. Neither then nor now did I reach issues as to the constitutionality of Executive action, first taken in 1947 with the issuance of President Truman\u2019s Executive Order 9835, later revoked and replaced by President Eisenhower\u2019s Executive Order 10540.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Instead, intervening developments point the direction we may properly take here. Judge Kaufman has correctly pointed out that we directed the District Court to remand the case \u201cto the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>General of the United States for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion of the Court of Appeals dated February 14, 1969.\u201d We find that the Attorney General took no steps to accord with the terms of the majority opinion. Instead, he adopted the device of retaining the listing of the appellants up to April 20, 1966 which date had been fixed pursuant to the joint motion of the Veterans and the Attorney General consequent upon the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Brigade Veterans v. SACB, 380 U.S. 513, 85 S.Ct. 1153, 14 L.Ed.2d 46 (1965). He so acted without notice to the appellants of his intended <em>ex parte </em>amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellants were accorded no hearing respecting that change.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Questioned during argument of the instant case respecting the failure to comply fully with the terms of Judge Pret-tyman\u2019s order of remand, Government counsel found himself compelled to concede that the issues respecting designation and a continued listing of the Veterans could have been resolved only on the available evidence <em>as of 1970. </em>We were informed, \u201cIt probably would have been impossible to establish a basis for a listing.\u201d Under the circumstances I believe this business has gone far enough and this is the time to end it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Kaufman has made crystal clear the course of events involved in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">I thus join my colleagues in reversing the judgment of the District Court presently under scrutiny. I agree that the District Court should now be directed forthwith to issue an appropriate order requiring the Attorney General to delist the appellant organizations.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">.

Here the Attorney General would have us assume that his amendment of the listing might be supported on the record as it stood up to April 20, 1966.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
