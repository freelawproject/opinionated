In order for Bayliff to recover against the railroad he must, under Texas law, establish that the crossing where the accident occurred is \u201cextra hazardous\u201d. See Fitch v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Transportation Co., 5 Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-20\">The only point raised in this appeal is whether, on the issue of \u201cextra hazardous crossing\u201d, there was \u201cevidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions\u201d. Boeing Company v. Shipman, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 365. This case was initially allowed to go to the jury, resulting in a verdict for plaintiff Bayliff in the amount of $20,000. The district court then granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict for the railroad, holding that the crossing had not been shown to be \u201cextra hazardous\u201d. It is from this ruling that Bayliff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-21\">After a close reading of the sparse testimony presented on plaintiff\u2019s behalf, and after viewing the exhibits in the record, pictures of the accident scene, we find that the district court did not err in holding that the crossing had not been shown \u201cextra hazardous\u201d and the entry of the judgment notwithstanding the verdict for the railroad is</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
