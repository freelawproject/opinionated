NLRB, 144 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 257, 445 F.2d 730, 733 (1971). Moreover, it would seem that the Board also \u201ccould very well be spared the time consuming energy necessarily exhausted in the determination of [this] type of dispute * * <em>Id., </em>144 U.S.App.D.C. at 259, 445 F.2d at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-13\">In this appeal the Board petitions for enforcement of its order against respondent based on its finding that the union violated Section 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act by fining Supervisor Albert Brown $25 because of the performance of his duties. The executive committee of the local did indeed fine Brown $25 for failing to notify the local union that the supervisor had performed work reserved to members of the union under the bargaining agreement. However, long before issuance of the complaint in this case by the General Counsel the International reversed the local\u2019s ruling and the $25 was returned to the supervisor. There is no suggestion that the International acted under compulsion or fear of the Board, or that the local or the International had acted in bad faith in any way in connection with this case, or that the local\u2019s action in this case was part of a pattern of harassment against supervisors. Under the circumstances, why the General Counsel filed his charge and the Board persists in this litigation is difficult to understand. We agree with Chairman Miller of the Board dissenting from the Board\u2019s order on the ground that the issue in suit is moot.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-14\">Enforcement denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1355-11\"> The Board\u2019s reliance on NLRB v. Mexia Textile Mills, Inc., 339 U.S. 563, 70 S.Ct. 833, 94 L.Ed. 1067 (1950), to support its contention that this is a live controversy is misplaced. In <em>ilexia </em>the employer alleged on appeal that since the Board\u2019s action it had complied with the Board\u2019s order to bargain in good faith with the union, but that an agreement had been prevented by the union\u2019s \u201carbitrary, capricious and intransigent attitude.\u201d 339 U.S. at 566, 70 S.Ct. 826, 94 L.Ed. 1067. In those circumstances the Court held \u201cthat the employer\u2019s compliance with an order of the Board does not render the cause moot, depriving the Board of its opportunity to secure enforcement from an appropriate court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 70 S.Ct. at 828. Here the respondent vacated its alleged unlawful action and ended the dispute before the complaint of the General Counsel was even filed. <em>Compare </em>United Slate, Tile &amp; Composition Roofer, Damp &amp; Waterproof Workers Assn, Local No. 220, 177 NLRB 632, 652 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
