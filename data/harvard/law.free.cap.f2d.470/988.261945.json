On March 30, 1972, the court below dismissed the suit for failure to allege the presence of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d warranting interference in prison administration, citing, <em>inter alia, </em>Flint v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1970, 433 F.2d 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-18\">Nineteen days after this order of dismissal was entered, we announced our decision in Campbell v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1972, 460 F.2d 765, in which we held that summary dismissal of a civil rights suit alleging a \u201cgrave and immediate threat to health or physical well being\u201d was improper. 460 F.2d at 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-19\">It is understandable that the district judge, reading <em>Flint, supra, </em>without the benefit of our subsequent opinion in <em>Campbell, supra, </em>would have concluded that summary dismissal was proper in this case. Moreover, it might well be argued that appellant did not allege as extreme a case as was present in <em>Campbell. See </em>McCombs, The Fundamentals of Internal Medicine 313-315 (1965). Nevertheless, since appellant did allege that appellees\u2019 conduct subjected him to the risk of \u201cserious bodily injury and possible death,\u201d Complaint p. 4, he should have been afforded the opportunity to substantiate his claim. <em>Campbell, supra; </em>Williams v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1972, 461 F.2d 1080. <em>See also </em>Bowman v. Hale, 5 Cir. 1972, 464 F.2d 1032; Hutchens v. Alabama, 5 Cir. 1972, 466 F.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-20\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
