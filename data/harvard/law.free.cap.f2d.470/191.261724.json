Edmund L. Palmieri, United States District Court Judge, Southern District of New York, granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. 341 F.Supp. 944 (S.D.N.Y.1972). This court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint in open court on November 15, 1972, on the ground that there was no substantial federal question and hence the court lacked jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) (1970). This action was commenced by Richard David and purportedly on behalf of all other \u201cunemployed persons without financial resources who require telephones installed in their residences in New York State,\u201d to have the telephone deposit tariff declared violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The tariff provision challenged (Public Service Commission Tariff No. 800) authorizes the New York Telephone Company to require applicants for service whose financial responsibility is not established to its satisfaction, to deposit a sum up to an amount equal to the estimated charges for two months for the facilities and service. There is statutory authority for this provision, N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law \u00a7 120 (McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, e. 48, Supp.1972). The same Equal Protection challenge was rejected by the California Supreme Court in Wood v. Public Util. Comm\u2019n, 4 Cal.3d 288, 93 Cal. Rptr. 455, 481 P.2d 823 (1971), and the United States Supreme Court after considering that argument (see Appellant\u2019s Jurisdictional Statement filed in the United States Supreme Court at 7-13), dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 404 U.S. 931, 92 S.Ct. 293, 30 L.Ed.2d 245 (1971). Since jurisdiction under \u00a7 1343(3) depends on the statement of a substantial federal question (Almenares v. Wyman, 453 F.2d 1075, 1082 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 944, 92 S.Ct. 962, 30 L.Ed.2d 815 (1972)), we affirm the dismissal of the complaint here on that ground. Ahern v. Murphy, 457 F.2d 363 (7th Cir. 1972); Port Authority Bondholders Protective Committee v. Port of N. Y. Authority, 387 F.2d 259 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
