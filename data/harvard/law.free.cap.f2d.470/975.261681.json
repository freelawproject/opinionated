The present suit was instituted by Schwinn claiming that Murray Ohio has infringed since about 1965, and continues Trademark Registration No. 570,518, to infringe, the former\u2019s United States dated February 17, 1953. That trademark applies to the knurl design appearing on the inner face of Schwinn\u2019s tubular rims, which is described in the Registration as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-19\">\u201cThe trade-mark consists of two endless parallel lines, each consisting of a multiplicity of cross parallel lines, knurled into the inner surface of a bi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>cycle rim of metal on opposite sides of the spoke apertures formed in such rim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">The District Court found from the un-contradicted evidence that the knurled markings are \u201ccommercially necessary to mask, hide or camouflage the roughened and charred appearance resulting from welding the tubular rim sections together,\u201d with the only other method of achieving this result being \u201cthe more complex and more expensive process of grinding and polishing.\u201d 339 F.Supp. at 980. The Court thus concluded that \u201cSchwinn\u2019s registered trademark is not a valid trademark in that the knurled markings are functional and therefore not entitled to exclusive appropriation as a trademark.\u201d 339 F.Supp. at 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">On appeal, Schwinn initially asserts that the District Court erred in placing upon it the burden of proving nonfunctionality, citing the following language from the Court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-7\">\u201cPlaintiffs offered no evidence of any alternative process which could be used to accomplish the same cosmetic purpose at such a minimal cost.\u201d 339 F.Supp. at 981.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">A reading of the District Court\u2019s opinion clearly reveals that the above-quoted language simply refers to Schwinn\u2019s failure to refute Murray Ohio's evidence that the knurling process is more econ-nomical than grinding and polishing in order to mask the weld marks. The Court properly recognized that registration with the Office of Patents gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the trademark is valid and that the burden was on Murray Ohio to rebut this presumption. 339 F.Supp. at 979-980, 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">Schwinn further contends that there was insufficient evidence upon which the District Court could find that the knurling process is functional. Specifically, Schwinn contends that Murray Ohio failed to introduce any evidence reflecting the current cost of knurling as compared with the current cost of grinding and polishing. From the record before us and in the absence of any contradictory evidence, we conclude that the November 6,1951, letter by Mr. Schwinn, the testimony of Messrs. Pitman and Birlando, and the deposition of Mr. Wiley afforded ample evidence from which the Court could find that the knurling process \u201c \u2018affects . . . the facility or economy of processing\u2019 the rim.\u201d 339 F.Supp. at 980. See West Point Mfg. Co. v. Detroit Stamping Co., 222 F.2d 581, 591 (6th Cir. 1955). We are thus unable to hold that the District Court\u2019s findings with respect to functionality are clearly erroneous, notwithstanding the failure or inability<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of Murray Ohio to provide cost comparisons for the two processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-12\">We thus find no merit in the claims asserted by Schwinn on appeal. The judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">. Murray Ohio has not appealed from the District Court\u2019s holding that there was insufficient evidence to support its counter-claim under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1119-1121 asserting that Schwinn fraudulently procured the trademark registration. <em>See </em>339 F.Supp. at 982-984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"asg-dedup-0\">. Tlie testimony of Mr. Pitman, Vice President of Engineering for Murray Ohio, indicates that Murray Ohio has used only the knurling process on tubular rims since it started producing those rims in 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
