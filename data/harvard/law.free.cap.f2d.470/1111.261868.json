When the appeal was here earlier we affirmed an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, 332 F.Supp. 1009, which dismissed the appellant\u2019s complaint on the appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The claims of the appellant are based upon his being discharged from the position of substitute teacher in the New York City school system without being accorded a full trial-type hearing on the charges against him. Appellant believes that he was denied due process of law. He asserts jurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amendment and under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1964) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) (1964). On the earlier appeal we affirmed the determination of the district court on the ground that the complaint did not state a claim properly cognizable in the federal courts, 448 F.2d 428 (2d Cir. 1971). Our opinion relied upon the distinction between personal liberty and proprietary rights \u2014 as the determinative factor in the exercise of \u00a7 1343(3) jurisdiction- \u2014 enunciated in Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 531, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939). The Supreme Court in Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972) rejected this distinction. It vacated our judgment in the present case and remanded the case to us \u201cfor further consideration in light of Perry v. Sindermann [408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972)], Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, [408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)] and Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972).\u201d Upon such further consideration we hold again that the order of the District Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-10\">The facts of this case are fully set forth in our prior opinion. Appellant Canty was a substitute teacher in the New York City school system and he held (and still holds) a substitute teacher\u2019s license. After teaching for one month in 1969 as a regular substitute at a junior high school in New York City, appellant was given an unsatisfactory performance rating and was discharged on an emergency basis which meant that he was not entitled to the 10 days notice and severance pay which would otherwise have been his due. The discharge did not result in revocation of Canty\u2019s substitute teacher\u2019s license nor did it bar him from teaching as a substitute in the other city schools to which his license was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-11\">Several reasons were given by appellant\u2019s principal for his dismissal, all of them reflecting on Canty\u2019s conduct as a teacher. Canty denied all of those charges and claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that false complaints had been made against him by his students because they were out to \u201cget rid\u201d of him. He filed a complaint with the New York City Human Rights Commission which resulted in a stipulation that that complaint would be dismissed if he were given a hearing by the Board of Education. Such a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>was held pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the Board and the United Federation of Teachers. The result of that \u201cStep 1\u201d grievance proceeding was an affirmance of the principal\u2019s finding that an emergency existed which justified the discharge of the appellant without notice or pay. At the next procedural level (\u201cStep 2\u201d), however, the determination of \u201cemergency\u201d was reversed and Canty was awarded 10 additional days salary. He requested a \u201cStep 3\u201d hearing but this was denied because under the by-laws of the Board of Education his unsatisfactory rating \u2014 the basis for his discharge \u2014was reviewable by the Superintendent of Schools and was not the proper subject for a grievance proceeding. Appellant was granted a hearing before an Assistant Superintendent despite the fact that his request for such a proceeding before the Superintendent was late and the time limitation had to be waived. At the hearing the appellant, his principal, a fellow teacher and a union representative testified. Canty\u2019s appeal was denied. Although appellant had thirty days in which to appeal that decision he did not do so. He later claimed that he did not know of the provision for the further appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">Appellant\u2019s status as a substitute teacher in the New York City school system is \u201cprobationary.\u201d The New York City Board of Education does not give tenure to substitute teachers whether they are assigned on a per <em>diem </em>basis or are \u201cregular\u201d substitutes, as was appellant in this case. See Warner v. Board of Education, 14 A.D.2d 300, 220 N.Y.S.2d 794 (1st Dept. 1961), aff\u2019d, 12 N.Y.2d 924, 238 N.Y.S.2d 313, 188 N.E.2d 525 (1963). The collective bargaining agreement between the United Federation of Teachers and the Board of Education does not give substitute teachers any contract rights to claim tenure. The mere subjective expectancy of tenure did not entitle appellant to the full scale due process hearing to which a government employee is entitled when his employment falls within the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of liberty and property. See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972); Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-8\">The procedures provided by the New York City Board of Education in this case \u2014 including the presentation of witnesses \u2014 were adequate for a review of the issues involved in appellant\u2019s dismissal. With no contract rights, no tenure or rights thereto, a substitute teacher in the position of the appellant is not entitled to a full trial-type hearing. The appellant\u2019s employment was terminable \u201cat any time by the Superintendent of Schools.\u201d By-Laws of the Board of Education of the City of New York, \u00a7 242. If such discharges were reviewable in the Federal Courts on the basis of .mere contentions that the dismissals lacked \u201cdue process,\u201d the discretion vested in the Superintendent of Schools would be meaningless. See Giangrande v. Board of Education, 44 Misc.2d 762, 254 N.Y.S.2d 643 (Sup.Ct. 1964); Freeman v. Gould Special School District, 405 F.2d 1153 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 843, 90 S.Ct. 61, 24 L.Ed.2d 93 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-9\">We affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
