The jury was warranted in finding, however, that a snip with a pair of shears was too inconsequential a matter to consider significant. The paper was as readily available as it would have been had it been cut, and then tied in a package. Defendant\u2019s point that any purchaser of the uncut sheets would have necessarily known they were not genuine is irrelevant. An illegal sale does not require the purchaser to be duped. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
