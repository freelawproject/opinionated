App. \u00a7 462(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-11\">On July 20, 1970, appellant\u2019s local Selective Service Board ordered him to report for induction on August 26. On that day appellant said he was sick and the board rescheduled his induction for October 28. Again he failed to report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-12\">On November 30, 1970, the board received a letter from a psychiatrist saying that appellant \u201cshowed evidence of chronic anxiety,\u201d but it did not suggest that appellant\u2019s mental condition had changed in the last few months. On January 27, 1971, the board ordered appellant to report on February 8, 1971. Appellant appeared as ordered, but he refused to submit to induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-13\">Appellant contends that the induction order was invalid because the board did not review this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-14\">The induction order, issued on July 20, 1970, was never cancelled. The date for reporting was rescheduled on two occasions for appellant\u2019s benefit. The letter from the psychiatrist arrived after the board ordered the appellant to report. United States v. Jenson, 450 F.2d 1258, 1263 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. denied 405 U.S. 1043, 92 S.Ct. 1326, 31 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972). The board therefore could have reopened the case only if appellant showed \u201ca change in [his] status resulting from circumstances over which [he] had no control.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2; United States v. Stacey, 441 F.2d 508 (9th Cir. 1971). Here the board had no authority to reconsider appellant\u2019s classification because the psychiatrist\u2019s letter made no such showing. Appellant suffered no prejudice by the board\u2019s failure to review the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
