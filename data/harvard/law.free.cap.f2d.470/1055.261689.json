Considering, however, the significance of the term \u201cFORM\u201d, as applied to applicant\u2019s goods which are, in effect, \u201cformed\u201d around a particular wire, cable, or the like and that the suggestive, if not descriptive, nature of the term would be readily apparent to purchasers of applicant\u2019s goods, the addition to \u201cSIGMA\u201d of this word is not deemed sufficient to distinguish applicant\u2019s mark \u201cSIGMAFORM\u201d from \u201cSIGMA\u201d, per se, and to avoid a likelihood of confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"AWD\">Although appellant\u2019s products per se are readily distinguishable from the devices of appellee, there is an intimate relationship between sealing products for wires or cables and equipment which includes visible wiring or cables on which appellant\u2019s products may be used. See In re American Cyanamid Co., 435 F.2d 1339, 58 CCPA 962 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">Accordingly, we find there is a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of the goods concurrently sold under the respective marks SIGMAFORM and SIGMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-9\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ady-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1135-19\">.
