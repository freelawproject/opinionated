Parenti guilty of attempting to evade and defeat payments of his 1961, 1962 and 1963 income taxes in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7201.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-24\">On this appeal Parenti challenges as prejudicial error ten of the trial judge\u2019s rulings on the admission of evidence and two of his instructions to the jury. He also challenges as unconstitutional the Government\u2019s use of the \u201cnet worth\u201d method of proof. Finally, he contends that the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict and that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-25\">On review of the record we are of the opinion that Parenti\u2019s challenges to the trial judge\u2019s rulings on the admission of evidence and his instructions to the jury fail to demonstrate prejudicial error. Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150. (1954), is dis-positive of Parenti\u2019s challenge to the \u201cnet worth\u201d method of proof. We are further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>of the opinion that the .evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">Judicial economy would not be served by a detailed discussion of Parenti\u2019s challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and to the trial judge\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence and his instructions to the jury, in light of the exhaustive consideration they were accorded in Judge Troutman\u2019s well-reasoned Opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denying Parenti\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">For the reasons stated the judgment of conviction will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AQ1W\">. Judge Troutman\u2019s Opinion is reported at 326 F.Supp. 717 (E.D.Pa.1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
