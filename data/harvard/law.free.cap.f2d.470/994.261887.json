The usual order to cease and desist any like or related action in the future and requiring the posting of appropriate notices was entered. In addition the company was ordered to recognize and bargain with the appropriate local of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-30\">After review of the record and consideration of the briefs and arguments of counsel, the Court concludes that the findings of fact of the Board are in all respects supported by substantial evidence and that the Board is without error in its conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-31\">It is, therefore, ordered that the order of the Board be and it is hereby enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
