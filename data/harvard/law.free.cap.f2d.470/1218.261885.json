Clarke (\u201cClarke\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">Nordli is a partnership of psychologists serving as professional consultants to businesses and other organizations. Through evaluations (or \u201cassessments\u201d) by tests and interviews, it assists its clients in making judgments about matters such as the hiring, placement, promotion and firing of personnel. There are probably a dozen or two such firms in the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">Nordli hired Clarke in March, 1964. Then 31 years old, he had received a Ph.D. degree in psychology in 1961; had done post-doctoral work at a state hospital from 1962-3; and had engaged privately in diagnosis and psychotherapy for several educational institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-17\">In September, 1964, Clarke signed a letter agreement prepared by Nordli which confirmed his existing employment as a \u201cconsulting psychologist\u201d at a starting annual salary of $12,000. The agreement made provision for vacations, sick leave, and fringe benefits. Clarke could leave, or Nordli could terminate him, upon the giving of specified advance notice. If after leaving Clarke went to work for a Nordli client or prospective client, certain obligations were imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These obligations are the subject of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>Clarke\u2019s principal duties with Nordli were to make psychological assessments of candidates for positions within its business clientele. Two of these were life insurance companies, for which he mainly assessed persons seeking positions as salesmen (he also assessed some prospects for advancement or termination). For a Buffalo, New York, firm, he assessed candidates for middle or lower-middle management positions, and a few candidates for executive positions. A single assessment would take from one to one-and-a-half hours. Clarke would meet the individual and administer a psychological test designed by Nor-dli. He would later prepare a report \u201cpulling together\u201d (as he testified) the test results and interview impressions, which he would usually submit to the client company\u2019s director of industrial relations or personnel. He might also, in some cases, meet again with the person tested and provide \u201cfeedback\u201d, i. e., explain the evaluation to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">At the time Clarke began working for Nordli, ITT was not its client. In April 1964, Dr. Beare of ITT called Mr. Wilson, a Nordli partner, to arrange an appointment to discuss Nordli\u2019s becoming one of ITT\u2019s consulting firms. Wilson could not keep the appointment, and Clarke met with Beare instead. Thereafter, Nordli worked for ITT \u201cin a small way.\u201d In September, 1965, Dr. Beare called Clarke and asked if he was interested in working for ITT. Beare said that he was planning to leave and was looking for someone to replace him. In October, 1965, Clarke, still in Nordli\u2019s employ, made two assessments of candidates for ITT employment in New York. In early November, 1965, he indicated that he would leave Nordli, and did so early in 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">Nordli contends that Clarke\u2019s duties with ITT (until August 1969, when it concedes they became \u201cvery much different\u201d) were such that the latter received \u201cprofessional psychological services\u201d from Clarke within the terms of the employment contract. As ITT had been its client, Nordli claims that it is entitled to 15% of Clarke\u2019s ITT compensation from salary and bonuses from February 1, 1966 until August 1969. Clarke denies any such liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">Clarke\u2019s title at ITT was \u201cManager, Executive Selection and Appraisal.\u201d In September, 1966, it was changed to \u201cDirector of the Executive Selection and Appraisal Branch.\u201d Clarke administered and supervised ITT\u2019s \u201cassessment center\u201d in New York. His staff consisted of one (later two) psychologists, an administrator, and clerical personnel. The center, headed by Clarke, hired outside psychological consultants, like Nor-dli, which under its supervision carried out assessments all over the world of candidates for ITT executive positions. The aggregate fees paid to outside consultants were ten times the budget for the internal employees supervised by Clarke. The assessment center\u2019s function appears to have been to establish standard tests and procedures, coordinate testing, and arrange and supervise a unified program carried out largely by the hired consultants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">From Clarke\u2019s testimony, which the district court found to be truthful, it could reasonably be found that the preparation of test materials and the coordination of the activities and programs of the assessment center was carried out by others than Clarke, but under his overall direction. Written tests were prepared by the man responsible for administration of the center. They were approved by Clarke but not altered by him. The tests were standard psychological tests. They were not the tests used by Nordli (Clarke testified in his deposition to dissatisfaction with the Nordli tests). Interview guidelines were \u201ctypically\u201d given by the administrator of the center. Communications with consulting psy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>chologists were normally through the staff psychologist, who from time to time consulted with Clarke. Clarke did not usually read assessment reports. Clarke denied developing any new assessment concepts and practices and denied maintaining quality control of reports, although he admitted that these matters were within his overall responsibility. Statistical studies of the effectiveness of assessments were maintained by a subordinate. There was no evidence that anything done by Clarke at ITT was copied from practices uniquely developed by Nordli.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">In 1967, when Clark\u2019s title changed, he delegated more of the responsibilities to subordinates. Much of his time was spent developing a \u201crather ambitious\u201d program of executive training.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Clarke testified that he himself conducted a few individual assessments and feedbacks prior to 1967 when subordinates or consultants were not available, but these consumed less than one per cent of his time. He maintained that these were not psychological services, since assessments were often performed by non-psychologists. He was not a licensed psychologist in New York state, although a license would be required in order to practice there. He stated that he had left Nordli because of dissatisfaction with the role of a psychologist, his interests lying more in administration and business organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">The district court concluded that from February 1, 1966 to June 1967, Clarke spent less than one per cent of his time with ITT on professional psychological work, and that since June 1, 1967, none of his ITT activities included or constituted professional psychological work, being more properly characterized as personnel and administrative work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">In August of 1966, Nordli notified ITT that it would no longer provide it with psychological consulting services (which it said it had provided for \u201cabout a year\u201d). In its letter, Nordli alluded to alleged unethical practices involving the pirating of employees, including Clarke. The district court found that Nordli had exacerbated its damages, if any, by \u201cfiring\u201d ITT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">Nordli challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that only Clarke\u2019s very occasional (less than 1%) personal participation in assessments and feedbacks constituted professional psychological services to ITT within the meaning of the contract. It asserts that Clarke\u2019s responsibility for the global activities of outside psychologists hired and coordinated by the assessment center, which he headed, constituted the furnishing \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d of \u201cprofessional psychological services of any sort\u201d to ITT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\">We hold, however, that even were the agreement to be so interpreted, Nordli may not recover. It would be unenforceable both as a restraint going beyond Nordli\u2019s legitimate interest in its own self-protection, and as imposing liquidated damages insufficiently related to any harm to Nordli.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">Bargains between employers and employees which place restrictions upon an employee\u2019s exercise of a gainful occupation after leaving the employer are, and were at common law considered to be, void as in restraint of trade. Restatement of Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 513-515. Sherman v. Pfefferkorn, et al., 241 Mass. 468, 474, 135 N.E. 568, 570 (1922). Exceptions are made, however, if the restriction is reasonable, \u201cand not wider than is necessary for the protection to which the employer is entitled. .\u201d Sherman v. Pfefferkorn, <em>supra </em>at 474, 135 N.E. at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-14\">In cases of agreements forbidding an employee to engage in the same business or line of activity as the employer, attention. is often given to whether the agreement is reasonably limited as to area and duration. But such considerations are merely aspects of the rule, quoted above, that the agreement must be no wider than is necessary to afford reasonable protection to the employer. A further, and here more relevant, aspect of the rule is that an employer may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>not enforce limitations on an ex-employee\u2019s engaging in activities which do no damage to the employer. Novelty Bias Binding Co. v. Shevrin, 342 Mass. 714, 175 N.E.2d 374 (1961), and cases cited therein. <em>See also </em>Baker v. Starkey, 259 Iowa 480, 144 N.W.2d 889 (1966) involving an employee who left a management consultant group.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">In two recent decisions, the Massachusetts Court has refused to enforce non-competition covenants in employment agreements where the plaintiff-employer could not prove that it was damaged by the employee\u2019s work for another firm. Richmond Brothers, Inc. v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, Inc., 357 Mass. 106, 256 N.E.2d 304 (1970); Slade Gorton &amp; Co. v. O\u2019Neil, 355 Mass. 4, 242 N.E.2d 551 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">Clarke\u2019s duties at ITT, whether or not designated \u201cprofessional psychological services\u201d, did not injure Nordli by diminishing or dispensing with the need for Nordli\u2019s services. Assuming, as we do, that Nordli had every right to protect itself reasonably against Clarke\u2019s utilizing his position at Nordli to steal a Nordli client, the facts here do not indicate that that is what happened. It is true that Clarke\u2019s Nordli position was a springboard from which his ITT association was launched; and had he left Nordli to become an independent (or ITT hired) consulting psychologist doing assessments for ITT in competition with Nordli, the situation would be different. However, Clarke took over a management function at ITT. The work he managed included the making of assessments. But his role was not that of a consulting psychologist. He was the liaison between higher ITT management and the assessment of ITT executives. He directed and hired people to do what he had once done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">There is no evidence that the Nordli firm itself would have been a candidate for Clarke\u2019s executive position, or that Clarke\u2019s very occasional fill-in activities in making assessments in any way diminished ITT\u2019s continued reliance upon independent psychological consultants. The vast bulk of ITT\u2019s assessments were performed by independent firms, like Nordli. Indeed, Nordli remained an ITT consultant until it initiated its own withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">We recognize that Nordli\u2019s express reason for withdrawal was what it felt to be unethical practice by ITT (and, perhaps, friction with Clarke resulting from his apparently adverse appraisal of Nordli\u2019s testing procedures); but these matters do not demonstrate that Clarke\u2019s ITT role placed him in competition with Nordli. (Indeed, since ITT\u2019s assessments were performed by outsiders, Clarke\u2019s new role was potentially beneficial to his former employer had they remained on good terms.) The point is that Clarke did not, by reason of his new duties, displace or compete with Nordli, nor is there evidence that he damaged Nordli by using confidential information (such as its tests) for the benefit of others. Like the Supreme Judicial Court in Richmond Brothers, Inc. v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, Inc., <em>supra, </em>we are of the opinion that enforcement of the terms of the agreement is not \u201creasonably necessary for the protection of the plaintiff\u2019s business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">Perhaps because it recognizes the absence of damage based on unfair competition, Nordli stresses its damages allegedly suffered by losing a valuable employee whom it had trained. (This damage would, of course, be the same had Clarke left to go to work for a non-client instead of for a client or prospective client. It would likewise be the same whether he found employment as a psychologist or in some other capacity.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-10\">An employer\u2019s right, however, to place future burdens on an employee merely to forestall or offset the loss of his services is clearly limited:</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-11\">[A]n employer cannot by contract prevent his employee from using the skill and intelligence acquired or increased and improved through experience or through instruction received in the course of the employment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>employee may achieve superiority in his particular department by every lawful means at hand, and then, upon the rightful termination of his contract for service, use that superiority for the benefit of rivals in trade of his former employer. As was said in Herbert Morris, Limited, v. Saxelby, [1916] 1 A.C. 688, at 714: \u2018A man\u2019s aptitudes, his skill, his dexterity, his manual or mental ability ought not to be relinquished by the servant; they are not his master\u2019s property; they are his own property; they are himself.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">Club Aluminum Co. v. Young, 263 Mass. 223, 226-227, 160 N.E. 804, 806. See also Richmond Brothers, Inc. v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., Inc., <em>supra, </em>357 Mass, at 111, 256 N.E.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">Doubtless an employer who has provided specialized training to an employee \u2014 as by a course of studies or the like \u2014 might reasonably contract with the employee for reimbursement if the employee should quit before the employer achieves any benefit. However, the employer may not require its ex-employee to make payments to it unrelated to the employer\u2019s damage, simply as a penalty to discourage or punish a job change. At most, the employer, in appropriate circumstances, might require the employee to reimburse it for a sum, or under a formula, reasonably related to what it cost the employer to train him, or to retrain a replacement, or the like. The.sum or formula would be enforceable only if \u201cthe amount so fixed is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm that is caused\u201d by the loss of the employee \u2014 to borrow words from Section 339 of the Restatement of Contracts, setting forth the requirements for an enforceable liquidated damages provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">Viewed as an advance effort to liquidate Nordli\u2019s actual damages caused by the loss of an employee, the 15% clause is not impressive. We perceive no rational connection between 15% of Clarke\u2019s ITT compensation (which Nor-dli tells us is $24,525 for the five years from 1966-1970, and $14,962.50 for the shorter period now claimed) and whatever damages Nordli sustained by reason of Clarke\u2019s departure after about two years with Nordli.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\"> We recognize that a liquidated damage provision is appropriate where the harm is incapable or very difficult of accurate estimation. Restatement of Contracts, \u00a7 339(1)(b). But the plaintiff had the obligation of demonstrating some basis upon which, when the formula was fixed, it could be said to be a reasonable forecast of damages. We can find none.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no evidence of what it cost to train someone like Clarke, or of Nordli\u2019s costs occasioned by the loss of such an employee. There was no evidence of what training, if any, was needed or was received by Clarke in order to evaluate tests and conduct assessments, over and above his previous education and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">Moreover, the formula itself is plainly deficient viewed as an attempted forecast of Nordli\u2019s damages from the loss of an employee. By its terms, it applies whether Clarke had worked for Nordli for ten years or two years, even though in the former case their investment in him would presumably have been repaid. It makes no distinction between damages occasioned by mere loss of services and the additional damages that Nordli would have been caused had Clarke engaged in direct competition. It applies whether Clarke voluntarily quit or was fired.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>Accordingly, we decline to enforce the contract against Clarke. If read as appellant contends, we find it to be an unreasonable restraint; and, of course, if not so read, it would be inapplicable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1299-18\">. \u201c4 . . . (d) In the event that your employment with the firm is terminated by you or by the firm for any reason whatsoever after the first year of your employment, it is agreed</p>\n<p id=\"AacQ\">(1) that if, at any time (luring a five (5) year jDeriod commencing on the day following the termination of your employment, any clients or prospective clients of the firm shall, directly or indirectly, receive professional psychological services of any sort from you, or from any other partnership or association with which you shall become associated in any manner whatsoever, or from any corporation of which you shall become an officer, director, stockholder or employee; then, you shall pay to the firm, for said five (5) year period or sucli shorter period as you, said other partnership or association or any said corporation shall be, directly or indirectly, performing professional psychological services of any sort for said client or clients, the greater of either (A) an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the gross billings received from said client or clients, by you, by said other partnership or association, or by any said corporation ; or (B) an amount equal to fifteen per cent (15%) of the total remuneration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>received by you by way of income, salary, wages, commissions or otherwise from said client or clients, said other partnership or association or any said corporation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">.

A literal application of the formula, as Clarke demonstrates, could result in at least hypothetical absurdities: for example, if Clarke was employed in any capacity by a corporation doing $1,000,000 of work for ITT, only a small part of which consisted of professional psychological services, he could be said to owe $150,000 to Nordli.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A-uN\">. To the extent Clarke\u2019s less than 1% of professional psychological services (i. e. for feedbacks and assessments) fit the literal language of the contract, we decline to enforce the 15% clause because of the obvious lack of correspondence between any proven damage to Nordli and the liquidated sum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
