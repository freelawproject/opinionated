Oliver appeals from a district court order adjudging him guilty of two specifications of summary contempt, entered at the conclusion of a criminal trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-25\">Oliver represented four of fifteen defendants charged with mutilating draft records. All defendants admitted the charge. Oliver\u2019s four defendants, however, sought to present a theory of defense based on insanity. They contended that at the time of entering and destroying the records they were acting under insane delusions. The specifications of contempt are based upon Oliver\u2019s questioning of a witness and his argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-26\">At the conclusion of the trial, and after the jury had returned its verdict in favor of the government, the district court, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>F.R.Crim.P. 42(a), entered its contempt order and fined Oliver $500 on each specification. The only issue before us is whether it can \u201cclearly be shown\u201d from the record that Oliver\u2019s conduct rose to the level of contemptuous \u201cmisbehavior\u201d which \u201cobstructed\u201d the judge in performance of judicial duty. In re McConnell, 370 U.S. 230, 234, 82 S.Ct. 1288, 8 L.Ed. 2d 434 (1961); United States v. Sopher, 347 F.2d 415 (7th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Oliver\u2019s cross-examination of one of the defendants, not one of his clients, shows the following colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">BY MR. OLIVER:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Q. On direct examination you testified that you walked down a hall; is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">A. Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Q. And I show you what has been marked as Government Exhibit 16-C (2). Is that a portrait of that hall? A. Yes, that looks like it.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Q. A long, long hall; is that right ?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">Q. And is there any sign down at the end of that hall?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">A. I can\u2019t see one.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">Q. Can you make out the little sign? Is there a sign there ?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-15\">MR. HOFFMAN: If there is a sign, why doesn\u2019t Mr. Oliver just read the sign?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">MR. OLIVER: Well, my eyes aren\u2019t so good. Is there a sign there that says, \u201cAbandon Ye All Hope Who Enter Here\u201d ?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-17\">(Laughter)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-18\">MR. HOFFMAN: I object, your Hon- or.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">(Laughter, applause and shouts)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-20\">THE COURT: Clear the courtroom. There will be no more of that. Clear the courtroom of all spectators. (Tr. 3228-3229).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-24\">Later, outside the presence of the jury, Oliver explained to the judge why he had asked the questions, when there had been no \u201csign\u201d in the picture:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-25\">The reason I asked that, your Honor, is because this particular Government exhibit is reminiscent, I should think, of any child\u2019s notion of the gateway to Hell. That is what it looks like. And if there isn\u2019t a sign there that says that, there ought to be one there. And if there isn\u2019t one that you can see in the picture, there certainly is one that appears in the imagination of any sensitive person, I think.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-26\">The court found that Oliver \u201cdeliberately asked a provocative and inflammatory question, unfounded in the evidence, which disrupted the trial [and which] was committed within the presence of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-27\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 a district judge has power to summarily punish \u201c [m] isbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(1); see also F.R.Crim.P. 42(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The elements of summary contempt \u2014 as recently interpreted by this court in United States v. Seale, 461 F.2d 345 (7th Cir., decided May 11, 1972)- \u2014 are 1) <em>Intentional </em>conduct constituting 2) <em>misbehavior </em>which causes 3) an <em>actual and material disruption </em>or obstruction of the administration of justice 4) <em>within the court\u2019s presence. </em>And</p>\n<p id=\"b92-28\">where, as here, the conduct complained of is that of an attorney engaged in the representation of a litigant, the search for these essential elements of the crime of contempt must be made with full appreciation of the contentious role of trial counsel and his duty of zealous representation of his client\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>In re Dellinger et al., 461 F.2d 389 at 397 (7th Cir., decided May 11, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In dealing with an attorney\u2019s contempt, the Supreme Court noted in In re McConnell, 370 U.S. 230, 236, 82 S.Ct. 1288, 8 L.Ed.2d 434 (1961):</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">[W]hile we appreciate the necessity for a judge to have the power to protect himself from actual obstruction in the courtroom . . . it is also essential to a fair administration of justice that lawyers be able to make honest good-faith efforts to present their clients\u2019 cases. An independent judiciary and a vigorous, independent bar are both indispensable parts of our system of justice. To preserve the kind of trials that our system envisages, Congress has limited the summary contempt power vested in courts to the least possible power adequate to prevent actual obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">370 U.S. at 236, 82 S.Ct. at 1292; <em>Dellinger, </em>461 F.2d at 397; see also United States ex rel. Robson v. Malone, 412 F.2d 848, 850 (7th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Accordingly, this court has required that lawyers be given \u201cgreat latitude\u201d and \u201cextreme liberality\u201d in the area of vigorous advocacy. In <em>Dellinger </em>the court stated :</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Attorneys have a right to be persistent, ' vociferous, contentious, and imposing, j; even to the point of appearing obnox- <em>j </em>ious, when acting on their client\u2019s be-jf half. An attorney may with impunity j take full advantage of the range of ( conduct that our adversary system allows.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\"><em>Id. </em>461 F.2d at 400. Furthermore, the court thought that in close cases where the line between vigorous advocacy and actual obstruction defied strict delineation, doubts should be resolved in favor of vigorous advocacy. <em>Id. </em>461 F.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\"> In view of this \u201cextreme liberality\u201d afforded trial counsel in their representation of clients, and resolving any doubts in favor of vigorous advocacy, we do not think that the conduct charged in the first specification rises to ,the level of \u201cmisbehavior\u201d necessary to support a contempt citation. Oliver\u2019s question was related to defendants\u2019 proffered theory of defense and touched on the insane \u201cpreceptions\u201d and \u201cdelusions\u201d which the defendants claimed to have held prior to making the raid on the draft board files. The finding that the questions were asked deliberately is at least ambiguous. We disagree with the government that Oliver\u2019s conduct amounts to a \u201cpalpable obstruction,\u201d sufficient without the element of intent. Unless the conduct of the spectators can be attributed to him, Oliver cannot be held responsible for their conduct. Furthermore, the lack of any finding by the district judge that Oliver knew or should have known that the questions exceeded the bounds of conduct approriate to his role as trial counsel we think substantiates our view that Oliver\u2019s conduct did not exceed the \u201coutermost limits\u201d of vigorous advocacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">It is not enough that the questions were provocative or inflammatory. If lawyers were barred from asking provocative and penetrating questions at trial merely because they may provoke or inflame, then an essential goal of every fact finding process \u2014 the discovery of truth \u2014 would indeed be thwarted. In any trial where emotions run high, we think it inevitable that some questions will provoke witnesses or spectators or inflame their passions. And we are not persuaded that the questions were not founded in the evidence under defendants\u2019 theory. But even if it was evidentially improper, we see no reason why the trial judge could not \u2014 by use of the least power necessary \u2014 have stricken it from the record with an appropriate instruction to the jury to disregard the question. Nor is it enough for the government to argue that Oliver engaged in a \u201cstrategy of misconduct.\u201d The government concedes that each act was insufficient in and of itself to warrant disciplinary action. This supports our view that Oliver\u2019s conduct was not beyond the outer bounds of zealous advocacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>We hold that the record does not \u201cclearly show\u201d that the conduct cited in the first specification of the contempt order was conduct so inappropriate to Oliver\u2019s role as trial counsel as to exceed the \u201coutermost bounds\u201d of vigorous advocacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In Oliver\u2019s closing argument he said:</p>\n<p id=\"Are\">Members of the jury, I am sorry I wasn\u2019t able to do more in developing the facts in this case for you. I am sorry I wasn\u2019t able to do more in arguing the ease for you. I did want to put a few things together for you, and I am conscious of the fact that my remarks have been to some extent somewhat disjointed, because I was touching on a number of areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">That is one reason they may have seemed a little disjointed, but I have a problem these days in courts. There was a time when I thought I knew something about the rules of evidence and what evidence was admissible and what evidence wasn\u2019t admissible, and what I was permitted to ask questions on, and what I could say in arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">I used to think I knew about that kind of thing, but I have learned in this case that I just don\u2019t know anything about that. (Tr. 3895-3896).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The district judge found that the remarks \u201cwere contemptuous of the court and .of the court\u2019s rulings, and brought improper matters to the attention of the jury . . . within the court\u2019s presence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">We are not persuaded by the government that Oliver\u2019s closing remarks rose to the level of an \u201cactual and material obstruction,\u201d <em>Seale, </em>461 F.2d at 370, 371, necessary to support a contempt citation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(1). This court\u2019s decision in United States ex rel. Robson v. Malone, 412 F.2d 848 (7th Cir. 1969), is of no aid to the government\u2019s argument here. The record does not show, and the judge\u2019s specification itself does not cite, any actual disruption of the trial proceedings. Apparently the judge did not think it necessary to excuse the jury for the purpose of admonishing Oliver. No physical disorder in the courtroom, no laughter, shouts or other abusive language directed at the judge or the proceedings resulted from the argument, and nothing to show any intent of Oliver to bring about the result. The remarks were not boisterous, and there was no significant delay in the proceedings which continued in an orderly fashion. And no reason is shown why the judge could not have purged the remarks by instructing the jury to disregard them, as the least exercise of power necessary. We are aware that Oliver\u2019s remarks may have suggested disrespect for the court\u2019s rulings. However, as the Supreme Court stated in In re Little, 404 U.S. 553, 92 S.Ct. 659, 30 L.Ed.2d 708 (1972), where a defendant arguing pro se made similar comments of disrespect:</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">The fires which it [misconduct] kindles must constitute an imminent, not merely a likely, threat to the administration of justice. The danger must not be remote or even probable; it must immediately imperil. .</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">404 U.S. at 555, 92 S.Ct. at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-14\">We hold that the record does not \u201cclearly show\u201d that the conduct cited in the second specification of contempt \u201cactually and materially obstructed\u201d so as to \u201cimmediately imperil\u201d the judge in the performance of his judicial duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-15\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-17\">. United States v. Chase et al., 468 F.2d 141 (7th Cir. 1972). The <em>Chase </em>case involved fifteen defendants charged with substantive and conspiracy counts of destroying Selective Service records. Ten defendants were convicted. The convictions of eight of the ten were affirmed by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-21\">. li'.R.Crim.R. 42 Criminal Contempt</p>\n<p id=\"b92-22\">(a) Summary Disposition. A criminal contempt may be punished summarily if the judge certifies that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court. The order of contempt shall recite the facts and shall be signed by the judge and entered of record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
