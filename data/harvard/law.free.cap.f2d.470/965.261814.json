Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1045-28\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1045-29\">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit against six individual defendants and two partnerships <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to compel their compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>with the reporting procedures prescribed by section 709(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-8(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The disputed reports were eventually submitted to the Commission several months later during extensive pretrial proceedings. We vacate the summary judgment for the defendants insofar as it denies an injunction and remand with instructions that the District Court restrain future violations of the Act unless the defendants are able to show affirmatively that they will comply with the law and that an injunction is therefore not needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">The assertion that the EEOC somehow has no standing to prosecute the present action must be flatly and unequivocally rejected. Beyond any possibility of doubt Congress conferred upon the Commission explicit statutory authority to seek judicial relief against an employer\u2019s willful noncompliance with the reporting provisions of Title VII.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since the Act prescribes no other civil or criminal penalties for such noncompliance, an injunction is obviously the only effective remedy for a deliberate refusal to obey the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">Moreover, the fact that the recalcitrant employers here have belatedly produced the reports under fire after an unsuccessful five-year effort by the Commission to secure voluntary compliance' is of virtually no significance. \u201cThe power to grant injunctive relief survives the discontinuance of the illegal conduct sought to be enjoined. The purpose of an injunction is to prevent future illegal and wrongful acts. The [defendants\u2019] past conduct is a relevant factor to be considered.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Offner v. Shell\u2019s City, Inc., 5 Cir., 1967, 376 F.2d 574, 576; United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, 1952, 343 U.S. 326, 333, 72 S.Ct. 690, 695-696, 96 L.Ed. 978, 985; Plaquemines Parish School Board v. United States, 5 Cir., 1969, 415 F.2d 817, 824; Bailey v. Patterson, 5 Cir., 1963, 323 F.2d 201, 205-206, cert. denied sub nom. City of Jackson v. Bailey, 1964, 376 U.S. 910, 84 S.Ct. 666, 11 L.Ed.2d 609; see also United States v. Edwards, 5 Cir., 1964, 333 F.2d 575, 581 (dissenting opinion) and cases cited therein. For an illustrative example of our traditional approach to situations in which employers have deliberately violated Federal legislation providing for fair employment, see Goldberg v. Mathews, 5 Cir., 1962, 303 F.2d 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">While this record contains abundant evidence that the defendants have consistently declined in the past to submit the required reports, we are unwilling to make the initial forecast of what their course may be in the future. Nevertheless, we may hold on these facts that injunctive relief is mandatory unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>District Court finds on the basis of clear and convincing proof that there exists no reasonable probability of further noncompliance with the reporting provisions of the Act. United States v. Edwards, <em>supra. </em>The burden of negating that probability lies with the defendants, and in these circumstances it will b\u00e9 a monumental one. Cf. United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 1953, 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897, 97 L.Ed. 1303, 1309; Goldberg v.
