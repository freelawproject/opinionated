Oliver has appealed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-25\">At the close of the proceedings in United States v. Chase, et al.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the district court on June 3, 1970, Oliver had conversations in the court\u2019s witness room. The following morning a Chicago newspaper published a story stating that Oliver had \u201ctalked about\u201d getting into the trial because he believed he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201cmake a contribution to the peace movement,\u201d and that he had \u2014 in response to newspaper reporters\u2019 questions \u2014 said at the time:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">I really feel that these cases are the most important cases ever tried in this country. I feel the future of this country as a democracy depends on their outcome, and right now I\u2019m very pessimistic about the outlook.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The story went on to state Oliver was asked questions about two of the four defendants he was representing who failed to show up on June 3, the final day of the trial. \u201cOliver smiled and shrugged his shoulders,\u201d and answered:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Just say I\u2019m accustomed to disasters on every side. This is just another such disaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">I just hope they\u2019re both okay. I hope we don\u2019t find they are lying in a ditch someplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">On June 11 the Executive Committee <em>sua sponte </em>issued a citation charging that Oliver had used the court\u2019s witness room \u201cfor the purpose of holding an interview or interviews with news media personnel;\u201d that he purportedly made comments concerning his motive for being in the <em>Chase </em>case and the failure of two of his clients to appear; and that as a result of his interviews the newspaper article mentioned in the paragraph above appeared. The citation charged violation of Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(5) and 7-107(D) of the Illinois Code<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Local Criminal Rule 1.07(d) which proscribe certain statements to news media by attorneys in criminal cases. The citation noted prior warnings to, and discipline of,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Oliver for infractions of similar canons and rules \u201cwhich endanger the rights of all parties to a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">Oliver moved to dismiss the citation, claiming violation of his First and Fifth Amendment rights. The Executive Committee denied the motion. Oliver thereafter sought a stay in this court of the citation proceedings. This court denied the stay, but ordered the Executive Committee to hold a hearing upon the merits of Oliver\u2019s claim that the Rules were unconstitutional. Oliver then filed an answer before the Committee. He called for strict proof of the charges that he used the witness room for the purpose of holding interviews with news media personnel. He admitted the newspaper article was published but called for proof of allegations in the citation of the quotations in the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-16\">The Executive Committee heard evidence upon the citation, answer and arguments, made findings of fact and drew conclusions of law. It found Oliver \u201chad a conversation\u201d with a newspaper reporter on June 3, that the newspaper story followed, containing the comments quoted in the citation, and that Oliver had previously been \u201cwarned and disciplined\u201d as noted in the citation. It concluded that Local Criminal Rule 1.-07(d) and Disciplinary Rules 1-102 and 7-107 of the Illinois Code were not unconstitutional and that Oliver\u2019s conduct was in \u201cdirect violation\u201d of the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-17\">The only issue is whether there is a basis in the record for the Executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Committee\u2019s conclusion that Oliver\u2019s comments violated the Rules <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as charged in the citation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Disciplinary Rule 7-107(D) proscribes \u201cmaking an extrajudicial statement that a prudent lawyer would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication and that relates to the trial, parties, or issues . . . [and] that [is] reasonably likely to interfere with a fair trial.\u201d Local Rule 1.07(d) does not contain the above quoted limiting words. The government asks us to read into Local Rule 1.07(d) the limitation that the statements have \u201ca reasonable likelihood that such dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.\u201d Those words, the government argues, appear in Section (a) of the Local Rule and were \u201cintended to and ... apply\u201d in the succeeding sections of Rule 1.07. In deciding the issue before us\u2014 whether there is a basis in the record for the Executive Committee\u2019s conclusion that Oliver violated the <em>Rules </em>\u2014 we shall assume, without deciding that both Local Rule 1.07(d) and Disciplinary Rule 7-107(D) proscribe only statements which \u201ca prudent lawyer would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication and that relate [s] to the trial, parties or issues . . . and that are reasonably likely to interfere with a fair trial or prejudice the due administration of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-14\">There is no express finding by the Executive Committee that Oliver\u2019s comments were \u201creasonably likely to interfere with a fair trial\u201d\u2019 in the <em>Chase </em>case,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or that they would \u201cotherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.\u201d Nor is there a finding that Oliver knew or should have known his comments would have that effect. Neither is there a finding that he knew or should have known that his questioner was a newspaper reporter who would publish Oliver\u2019s answers to the questions asked. We see no merit in the government\u2019s argument that the Executive Committee\u2019s bare conclusion of violation implicitly \u201cperforce\u201d found that Oliver knew his questioner was a reporter, and that the comments were made for public dissemination and were reasonably likely to threaten the due administration of justice. Disbarment of an attorney for one year is a serious penalty and should not be imposed except upon express fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>tual findings of the elements necessary to support the charges of violation of the Rules in the citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Furthermore, we conclude, as a matter of law, that had express findings been made, there is nothing in the record which would support express findings that Oliver\u2019s comments were reasonably related to the \u201ctrial or the parties or issues\u201d in the <em>Chase </em>ease. Having in mind the purposes of the Rules to prevent interference with a fair trial and prejudice to the due administration of justice, we hold that the comments cannot be reasonably related to the <em>Chase </em>trial or its issues or its parties so as to offend, in a meaningful way, the purposes of the Rules. This is true even if there were sufficient evidence to support an inference that Oliver knew his questioner was a reporter or that Oliver was indifferent to whether the comments would be disseminated. The comments, in our view, cannot reasonably be taken as relating materially to the \u201cissues\u201d in <em>Chase. </em>We think the comment about the two missing defendants must reasonably be taken to refer to \u201cparties\u201d in <em>Chase, </em>but we are unable to agree that the reference is meaningful within the purposes of the Rules. The reference in the comment to \u201cthese cases\u201d might imply some relationship to the <em>Chase </em>trial; but to say that a <em>Chase </em>juror reading the newspaper story would be influenced one way or another in deciding the issues of the defendants\u2019 guilt or innocence is attributing to jurors too little sense of duty or fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We further conclude, as a matter of law, that the record cannot support express findings that Oliver\u2019s comments were reasonably likely to endanger a fair trial in <em>Chase, </em>or reasonably likely to prejudice due administration of justice. As pointed out in the preceding paragraph, Oliver\u2019s comments could not be reasonably understood as meaningfully relating to the \u201ctrial, parties or issues\u201d before the jury in <em>Chase. </em>Also the comments did not say that if the defendants in <em>Chase </em>were convicted, damage to our democratic system would result. The <em>Chase </em>jury found the defendants guilty. And there is no' basis in either comment for an express finding that Oliver was \u201chinting\u201d that the government was responsible for the mysterious disappearance of his clients or that the government \u201cmurdered his clients and threw them in a ditch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Because the record does not contain essential findings of fact to show Oliver\u2019s violation of the Rules and lacks sufficient evidence to support the essential findings, even if the findings had been made, we cannot agree with the government that we should remand with direction to \u201cclarify the findings.\u201d The problem is not that factual findings need clarification, but that there are no factual findings, and, if there were, no record support for the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">We hold that the record does not support the Executive Committee\u2019s decision disbarring Oliver for one year from practice in the district court. The Executive Committee judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-17\">. See District Court Rule 8 (Northern District of Illinois).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b95-26\">. 468 F.2d 141 (7th Cir. 1972). The <em>Chase </em>case involved fifteen defendants charged with substantive and conspiracy counts of destroying Selective Service records. Ten defendants were convicted. The convictions of eight of the ten were affirmed by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\">. Although the Executive Committee found that Oliver violated DR 1-102, <em>Misconduct, </em>that Rule has no significance in fliis appeal and is not argued by the parties, and we need not discuss it.

(5) Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b96-12\">. This was a reference to In re Oliver, 308 F.Supp. 1183 (N.D.Ill.1970), wherein the Executive Committee reprimanded Oliver and warned him that future similar misconduct . . . \u201cshall subject him to disbarment.\u201d This court on appeal declared that \u2014 in the absence of the element of prejudice to the fair administration of justice \u2014 the policy statement subject of the reprimand and tvarning was unconstitutional.

Leave was given five amici to file briefs in this appeal: American Bar Association, Chicago Bar Association, Chicago Council of Lawyers, American Civil Liberties Union, and Association of Defense Lawyers. The first two amici named argued to sustain the constitutionality of the Rules. The latter three amici challenged the constitutionality of the Rules. Oliver does not directly contend that the rules are unconstitutional. The government\u2019s brief is devoted mostly to discussing the constitutional argument raised by amici. In view of our decision set forth in this opinion, we find it unnecessary to decide or discuss the constitutional points argued by the amici and the government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"A6\">.
