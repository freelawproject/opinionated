T. Cross Company (Cross) has been selling, with increasing success, mechanical pens and pencils bearing its trademark CROSS. The mark has been registered in the principal register of the Patent Office. Whether or not its quality as a surname made it ineligible for registration on the principal as distinguished from the supplemental register, <em>cf. </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052 (e) (3); Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. Marzall, 196 F.2d 772, 773 (D.C. Cir. 1952), criticized in Application of Standard Elektrik, 371 F.2d 870 (C.C.P.A. 1967), the name CROSS has gained a secondary meaning with respect to mechanical pens and pencils and is thus a good trademark at least \u201cagainst all others but those similarly named.\u201d 3 Callmann, Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies \u00a7 77.4(d) at 382 (1969). The Cross pens and pencils are of high quality, carry a lifetime guarantee against mechanical defects, and bear a correspondingly elevated price tag.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-17\">Cross sells both to retailers and in the \u201cspecialty\u201d trade. In the latter the ultimate purchasers are, in the language of the district judge, \u201cdistributors and industrial concerns that buy pens and pencils in large quantity for use by the agency or company personnel or for distribution as gifts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-18\">Defendant Jonathan Bradley Pens, Inc. (Bradley) has been selling mechanical pens and pencils in the specialty trade since 1969 when it took over Morgan Henley Pens, Inc. (Henley). Beginning in 1968 Henley and later Bradley included in their catalogues and their exhibitions at trade shows pens and later pen and pencil sets, in boxes originally labeled LaCrosse and now bearing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>legend, La Crosse by Bradley.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unlike CROSS pens, the pens marketed by defendants do not carry the mark on the pens themselves. Bradley also sold pens under the marks ASTROPOINT and ASTROMATIC \u2014 names which it originated in 1969 \u2014 as well as under so-called \u201cprivate labels\u201d chosen by its purchasers. The judge found that use of the mark La Crosse did not come to plaintiff\u2019s attention until early October, 1972, when Bradley sent out a mailer describing the La Crosse pen and pencil set as \u201cMatching Gold Pen and Pencil Set with the look of simplicity. Inexpensive but looks like the high priced model.\u201d On the back of the mailer defendants said \u201cThe new La Crosse set. Sounds and looks like a more expensive set.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">On learning of this, plaintiff instituted this action, wherein federal jurisdiction was predicated both upon the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 et seq. and diverse citizenship. It requested and, after hearings, obtained a preliminary injunction against defendants\u2019 use of the names LA CROSSE or CROSSET. Defendants appealed and sought a stay; another panel granted this pending argument and expedited the appeal. We declined to extend the stay (except for a few days to permit defendants to take steps necessary to bring themselves into compliance), and now affirm the order granting the temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">D\u00e9fendants\u2019 principal point, doubtless the main reason for our colleagues issuing a stay pending argument of the appeal, was that the district judge professed to have granted the temporary injunction without making the traditional conclusion that plaintiff probably would succeed on final hearing. <em>Cf. </em>Sutton Cosmetics (P.R.) v. Lander Co., 455 F.2d 285, 289 (2 Cir. 1972). His reason for declining to do this was a belief that since the individual assignment system recently adopted by the District Court for the Southern District of New York would almost certainly cause the case to remain with him, such an expression on his part would give \u201cthe appearance of judicial impropriety\u201d and force him \u201cto abandon the ideal of disinterested open-mindedness until all the evidence is presented.\u201d While the judge\u2019s motives were commendable, his fears were exaggerated. An expression that, on the evidence presented at a hearing for interlocutory relief which necessarily is held in some haste, the plaintiff is likely to prevail, involves no prejudgment of what the judge may decide when the entire case is in, and could not reasonably be thought to do so. The saving grace lies in the qualification that the judge is opining solely on the basis of what is then before him. In a patent infringement ease recently decided, we have seen a judge who found probability of success for the patentee on a motion for a temporary injunction conclude that the patent was invalid when the issues were fully explored at trial. Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Davis-Edwards Pharmacal Co., 341 F.Supp. 1303 (E.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d, 443 F.2d 867 (1972). No difficulty such as Judge Carter envisaged has been thought to exist in districts having only a single judge, in three-judge court proceedings or in the many multi-judge districts that long preceded the Southern District of New York in adopting the individual assignment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">The judge\u2019s failure to formulate this conclusion is not, however, a sufficient reason for reversal. It is arguable that in fact he applied the traditional test when he said that plaintiff had established a \u201cprima facie case of infringement\u201d and, for purposes of decision, rejected the only two affirmative defenses proffered by defendants, laches and plaintiff\u2019s consent to the use of its mark by another, the former expressly and the latter implicitly. In any event, it would be folly to reverse the grant of a temporary injunction because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>judge\u2019s failure to pronounce the usual litany if, as is the ease here, we would reverse the denial of a temporary injunction as an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"> This case does not require a weighing of the many conflicting considerations necessary in trademark cases where the products are different. <em>Cf. </em>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 287 F.2d 492, 495 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 820, 82 S.Ct. 36, 7 L.Ed. 2d 25 (1961). Neither is there the factor of ignorance of the plaintiff\u2019s mark which, although not an ultimate defense, might lead the chancellor to deny interlocutory relief, in order to prevent hardship, until all the proof was in. When Henley began to use the word LaCrosse, it knew all about the CROSS pen and pencil, as anyone in the trade necessarily would; indeed, its president, defendant Salinger, had worked in Providence, R. L, where the CROSS pen was made. Again, while lack of deliberate intent also would not be an ultimate defense, the explanation that the name LaCrosse was chosen because of its association \u201cwith the sport LaCrosse which is a very masculine, very rough sport\u201d deserving association with \u201ca very masculine type of pen,\u201d seems exceedingly lame, as often is the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Judge Moore\u2019s classic dissent in Lincoln Restaurant Corp. v. Wolfies Rest., Inc., 291 F.2d 302, 304 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 889, 82 S.Ct. 143, 7 L.Ed.2d 88 (1961); and Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., <em>supra, </em>287 F.2d at 494. LaCrosse and, even more, La Crosse are far closer to Cross than the accused marks in many cases where this court has ruled in favor of a plaintiff. See, <em>e. g., </em>George W. Luft Co. v. Zande Cosmetic Co., 142 F.2d 536, cert. denied, 323 U.S. 756, 65 S.Ct. 90, 89 L.Ed. 646 (1944), (Tangee v. Zande); La Touraine Coffee Co. v. Lorraine Coffee Co., 157 F.2d 115, cert. denied, 329 U.S. 771, 67 S.Ct. 189, 91 L.Ed. 663 (1946), (La Touraine v. Lorraine). Addition of the words \u201cby Bradley\u201d does not save the day; a purchaser could well think plaintiff had licensed defendant as a second user and the addition is thus \u201can aggravation, and not a justification.\u201d Menendez v. Holt, 128 U.S. 514, 521, 9 S.Ct. 143, 144, 32 L.Ed. 526 (1888); see also Jacobs v. Beecham, 221 U.S. 263, 272, 31 S.Ct. 555, 55 L.Ed. 729 (1911). This might even be so with respect to immediate purchasers from Bradley; certainly it could be true in the case of users. The last straw was the recent mailing, as bold an attempt at persuading purchasers that their donees would think they were receiving Cross pens as could be imagined. It should be known by this time that this court does not look with much favor on the businessman who, out of the wealth of words available, chooses as a trademark one which comes as close as he dares to a well-known mark on the identical product.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">As indicated, the only affirmative defenses proffered were plaintiff\u2019s laches and its offer of what defendants were pleased to call a \u201cnaked license\u201d to the well-known Fifth Avenue store, Mark Cross. On the former, the judge credited, as he permissibly could, the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s president that Cross had not been aware of defendants\u2019 references to La Crosse in their catalogues or at trade shows until the recent mailer came to its attention; this was buttressed by the plaintiff\u2019s record in pursuing trademark infringers on numerous other occasions. Since the court did not deal specifically with the Mark Cross incident, we must recount the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">When plaintiff discovered that Mark Cross was marketing a pen bearing the store\u2019s familiar name and/or logo, it promptly protested. The protest resulted in an agreement whereby Mark Cross would redesign its pen so as to remove any use of the word Cross or the Mark Cross logo on the pen itself. Mark Cross remained free to include the pen in advertisements carrying its name and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>logo and, apparently, to use these on the box in the same way that it did with other products. The record is insufficient to enable us to determine whether, from plaintiff\u2019s standpoint, this settlement was less than, more than, or exactly equal to that required by decisions on the vexing problem which occurs when two parties with identical surnames have long used these as marks. See, <em>e. g., </em>Emerson Electric Mfg. Co. v. Emerson Radio &amp; Phonograph Corp., 105 F.2d 908 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 308 U.S. 616, 60 S.Ct. 262, 84 L.Ed. 515 (1939); S.C. Johnson &amp; Son v. Johnson, 116 F.2d 427 (2 Cir. 1940); S.C. Johnson &amp; Son v. Johnson, 175 F.2d 176 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 860, 70 S.Ct. 103, 94 L.Ed. 527 (1949); 3 Callmann, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 85.2, However this may be, the showing of plaintiff\u2019s vigorous effort to limit intrusion by Mark Cross puts this case light years away from the Lanham Act\u2019s definition of abandonment, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127 see also 3 Callmann, supra, \u00a7 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\">. In the box shown us at the argument the type for \u201cLa Crosse\u201d was discernibly larger than \u201cby Bradley.\u201d The La Crosse pen is also ordered under the name \u201cCrosset.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-5\">. The game is generally spelled \u201clacrosse.\u201d We found nothing especially \u201cmasculine\u201d in defendants\u2019 pen. And how \u201cCrosset\u201d came into the picture is unexplained.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
