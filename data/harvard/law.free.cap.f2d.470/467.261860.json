We remand to permit further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The original discharge proceeding was based on twelve specifications charging the appellant with disrespectful conduct toward her superiors. After an evi-dentiary hearing at which appellant was represented by counsel, the hearing examiner held that all charges were \u201cfully supported by the evidence\u201d and were sufficient to warrant appellant\u2019s removal \u201cto promote the efficiency of the service.\u201d This recommendation was adopted, and she was discharged by the personnel director of the Canal Zone\u2019s Health Bureau. That action was sustained by the Governor of the Canal Zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Appeal was taken to the United States Civil Service Commission. The Commission\u2019s Appeals Examining Office dismissed nine of the specifications on the ground that the alleged acts of disrespect were \u201cdefensive material,\u201d within the range permitted an employee in responding to a superior\u2019s adverse comments. The three remaining specifications were held to cite conduct supporting the allegation of disrespectful conduct, and appellant\u2019s removal from Federal service. This decision was affirmed by the Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">At the time of appellant\u2019s discharge, Canal Zone regulations contained a \u201cSchedule of Disciplinary Offenses and Penalties\u201d setting forth some 26 acts of misconduct as warranting disciplinary proceedings and a system of graded penalties applicable to them. The Schedule also prescribed a \u201creckoning period,\u201d which shaped the penalty according to frequency of infractions within the reckoning period. This obviously served to prevent the joinder of stale offenses to elevate the level of penalties. These regulations provided that, in general, removal proceedings might be instituted only after four offenses had been committed within a 24-month period, and that \u201creckoning periods are not cumulative.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to the specific charge of \u201cdisrespectful conduct,\u201d the Schedule set forth the availability of removal as a maximum sanction, even on the first offense. Minimum sanctions were set forth as: reprimand for the first offense; 15 days\u2019 suspension for the second offense; and removal in the event of three occurrences within a 2-year reckoning period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>As we have noted, only three specifications survived the Commission\u2019s scrutiny. These specifications were based on acts that took place December 15, 1966 (#1), on September 7, 1965 (#9), and on August 18, 1964 (#10). These three allegations span a period of 27 months, and hence could not properly, under the \u201creckoning period\u201d provision, be linked in a single disciplinary proceeding as a composite basis for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">While the Schedule does contain language, relied on by appellees, that its use is not obligatory, succeeding paragraphs clarify that departure from the Schedule was contemplated only in case of \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d making the prescribed sanction inappropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But appellant had never previously been the subject of disciplinary proceedings, and her job performance ratings were \u201cSatisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The \u201creckoning period\u201d provision was obviously intended to protect employees involved in a disciplinary action against need to ventilate remote events. Such a procedural safeguard may not be abrogated on a mere presumption of regularity or latitude of administrative action, without at least a reasoned determination explaining the basis and need for invocation of the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exception. There is no such determination in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The Regulation provides (note 4) that the sanction of removal must be imposed following three instances of disrespect within the reckoning period. As to two offenses, removal is permitted, but so also is a sanction as modest as a 15-day suspension without pay. There is need for assurance that the administrative process has decided upon an appropriate sanction on the basis of only those offenses within the 2-year reckoning period prescribed by regulation. In case of doubt the court will remand for an administrative redetermination of the proper sanction. Meehan v. Macy, 129 U.S.App.D.C. 217, 234, 392 F.2d 822, 839 (1968) The <em>Meehan </em>doctrine calls for a remand in this case; limited to a consideration of but two acts of misconduct within the 2-year reckoning period. The other assignments of error urged upon us by the appellant, we find to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Remanded to the District Court to frame an order for further consideration by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\">. While the claim was pending before the Civil Service Commission, appellant, who had obtained employment as a Public Health Nurse with the District of Columbia Government, abandoned her claim for physical reinstatement, and limited her claim so as to seek record restoration for the four months she was off the rolls and compensation for that period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">. On the appeal, taken by Mrs. Slowick, a comment was filed in response by the , Panama Canal Company, as an agency performing under contract all functions of personnel administration for the Canal Zone Government, Mrs. Slowick\u2019s former employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-12\">. The general provision states:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">Depending upon the severity of the offenses involved, removal proceedings may be instituted against an employee for any four offenses committed within a 24-months\u2019 period which include two or more offenses in this schedule, or for the fourth occurrence of any one offense within the applicable reckoning period.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">Reckoning periods are not cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-15\">Canal Zone Government, Executive Regulation No. 5, Enclosure 1, at 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-16\">.

The regulation reads in pertinent part (id: at 1) :</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">SCHEDULE OF DISCIPLINARY OFFENSES AND PENALTIES</p>\n<p id=\"ayj-dedup-0\">1. This schedule is intended as a guide for supervisory personnel in order that, to the extent practicable, there may be general uniformity in penalties for like cases in the agency. Its use is not mandatory and departure from it may be appropriate depending upon the individual circumstances. The list does not cover every possible type of offenses. Penalties for offenses not listed will be prescribed by the Personnel Director consistent with penalties for offenses of comparable gravity.</p>\n<p id=\"ajh-dedup-1\">* !'.! * * *</p>\n<p id=\"AEf\">3. Penalties for disciplinary offenses will, in general, fall within the ranges indicated. In unusual circumstances, depending upon the gravity of the offense, the past record, and the position of the employee, a penalty either more or less severe than those provided for herein may be imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
