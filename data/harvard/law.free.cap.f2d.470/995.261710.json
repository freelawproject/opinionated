The loader was manufactured by co-defendant, Lull Engineering Company, Inc. It was sold by Lull to co-defendant, The Ran-some Corporation. Ransome, in turn, sold it to the third-party defendant, the decedent\u2019s employer, on a lease-purchase arrangement. The case was brought and tried under both theories of strict liability pursuant to Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts Second and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-33\">Trial on the issue of liability began on September 14, 1970, and concluded on September 24, 1970, with findings by a jury in answer to special interrogatories. On the basis of these findings, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against both defendants. Also, a jury finding was made and a judgment entered in favor of the third-party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-34\">In answer to the special interrogatories, the jury found that the accident had occurred because the high-lift loader involved was in a defective condition, unreasonably dangerous to the user, as a result both of design defects for which co-defendant Lull was responsible, and of defects in the loader\u2019s brakes and steering for which co-defendant Ransome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>was responsible. The jury also found that both defendants were negligent; that their negligence was a proximate cause of the accident; and finally that the decedent had neither assumed the risk nor been contributorily negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">After the verdict on liability, by agreement of the parties damages were assessed in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $250,000. Each defendant then filed motions for judgment n. o. v. and for a new trial. The motions were denied by the trial judge in an opinion and order dated October 22, 1971, 334 F.Supp. 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">After carefully reviewing the record and the briefs, and hearing oral argument, we conclude there was no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
