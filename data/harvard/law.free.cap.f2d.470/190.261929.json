During his sodomy trial, Harris took the stand and testified that his accuser had entered his automobile voluntarily. On cross-examination the prosecution confronted Harris with his guilty plea conviction for kidnapping as to this same incident. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this procedure was error at all, it was not error of constitutional dimension and was not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">The district court dismissed Harris\u2019 remaining claims on the ground that they had already been considered in a prior federal habeas corpus proceeding. The record indicates, however, that these allegations were raised in the habeas corpus action in which Harris collaterally attacked his <em>kidnapping </em>conviction. Therefore, the prior habeas ruling does not bar him from raising similar grounds in seeking relief from a sentence imposed after the separate trial and jury verdict on the crime against nature charge. These contentions must be considered on their merits. We intimate no view whatever as to the outcome of such consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
