The alleged offense grew out of an altercation between appellant and an off-duty policeman named Battle which occurred in the apartment building of appellant\u2019s girl friend. Battle was the first to draw his gun (a .38 caliber revolver). This menaced appellant who immediately took cover, and then drew his gun and shot Battle.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-23\">(1) <em>The statutory basis of the offense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-24\">The statute appellant was convicted of violating provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b535-25\">No person shall within the District of Columbia carry either openly or concealed on or about his person, except in his dwelling house or place of business or on other land possessed by him, a pistol, without a license therefor issued as hereinafter provided, or any deadly or dangerous weap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>on capable of being so concealed. . [D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3204, July 8, 1932, 47 Stat. 651, ch. 465, \u00a7 4; Nov. 4, 1943, 57 Stat. 586, ch. 296; Aug. 4, 1947, 61 Stat. 743, ch. 469; June 29, 1953, 67 Stat. 94, ch. 159, \u00a7 204(c)]</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The prohibitions of this statute are subject to certain exceptions and it is the interpretation of these exceptions which presents the principal question on this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00a7 22-3205. Exceptions to section 22-3204.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\"><em>The provisions of section 22-3204 shall not apply to marshals, sheriffs, prison or jail wardens, or their deputies, policemen or other duly appointed law-enforcement officers, </em>or to members of the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps of the United States or of the National Guard or Organized Reserves when on duty, or to the regularly enrolled members of any organization duly authorized to purchase or receive such weapons from the United States, provided such members are at or are going to or from their places of assembly or target practice, or to officers or employees of the United States duly authorized to carry a concealed pistol, or to any person engaged in the business of manufacturing, repairing, or dealing in firearms, or the agent or representative of any such person having in his possession, using, or carrying a pistol in the usual or ordinary course of such business or to any person while carrying a pistol unloaded and in a secure wrapper from the place of purchase to his home or place of business or to a place of repair or back to his home or place of business or in moving goods from one place of abode or business to another. [D.C. Code \u00a7 22-3205, July 8, 1932, 47 Stat. 651, ch. 465, \u00a7 5, emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"AO5\">Appellant contends, and the Government agrees, that his employment as a corrections officer for the District of Columbia jail satisfies the description contained in \u00a7 22-3205 of \u201cjail wardens,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or their deputies.\u201d However, the Government argues that such exception to \u00a7 22-3204 is applicable only to \u201cjail wardens [and] their deputies\u201d <em>\u2018\u2018when on </em>duty,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that, since appellant was not on duty at the time of the charged offense, his conduct is not within the exceptions to \u00a7 22-3204 of the Act. We conclude that the plain wording of the statute compels a contrary conclusion, <em>i. e., </em>that appellant is within the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">It is the Government\u2019s contention that the \u201cwhen on duty\u201d restriction in the exception to a prior statute which preceded the present statute should be read into the deputy jail warden exception in \u00a7 22-3205, but we do not consider that to be a sound interpretation of the existing law. Section 22-3205, as presently constituted, was not an amendment, codification or revision of the statute which immediately preceded it, but was enacted separately as part of a large legislative purpose and in conjunction therewith the earlier (1901) statute was expressly repealed. July 8, 1932, 47 Stat. 651, ch. 465, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">(2) <em>The statutory history of the present statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">The forerunner of the present District of Columbia law prohibiting the carrying of dangerous weapons was contained in the Act of June 13, 1892,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>came section 855 of the 1901 Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In codified form the 1892 statute continued as section 855 of the Code until 1932 when Congress enacted the present statute (D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3205) as part of the Act of July 8, 1932, 47 Stat. 651, ch. 465, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The 1932 legislation was entitled \u201cAn Act [t]o control the possession, sale, transfer, and use of pistols and other dangerous weapons in the District of Columbia, to provide penalties, to prescribe rules of evidence, and for other purposes.\u201d 47 Stat. 651. From its title it is apparent that it had a broader purpose than section 855 which preceded it. The 1932 Senate Committee Report described that purpose as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The intent of the proposed legislation is to provide a fair and effective control of the traffic in firearms in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The bill embraces' a comprehensive program of such control, with six principal features. These are:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">1. Regulation of the sale of pistols to the public, and of firearms and other weapons to law-enforcement officers, Government agencies, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">2. Licensing of dealers in firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">3. Licensing of persons to carry pistols.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">\n<em>k. Prohibiting possession of weapons for which there is no legitimate use.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">5. Prohibiting possession of pistols by persons previously convicted of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">6. Imposition of penalties for commission of a crime while armed, in addition to the penalty for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-17\">S.Rep.No.575, 72nd Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1932). (Emphasis added.) The comparable provisions of the 1901 and the 1932 enactments are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A line by line comparison of these two sections indicates that the 1932 enactment was structured differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ently than the 1901 law and contained a number of alterations in essential wording. Included in these items of different wording is the elimination of the restriction in the 1901 Code limiting the exception for marshals, sheriffs, jail wardens, etc., to instances \u201cwhen any such persons are on duty.\u201d In the 1932 Act the inclusive nature of this provision was stricken by the elimination of the reference to \u201cany of such persons\u201d and marshals, sheriffs and jail wardens, etc., were moved up ahead of militaiy personnel, separated by the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d, and thus removed from the modifying effect of the \u201cwhen on duty\u201d limitation. It is also of some significance that the 1932 Act did not purport to be a codification or revision of the earlier statute and did not purport to amend the prior provision but instead expressly repealed all of section 855.'<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALq\">(3) <em>The interpretation of the present statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">On this appeal it is the contention of appellant that the words \u201cwhen on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>duty\u201d in the 1932 statute, D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3205, \u201cmodify only the conduct of the immediately preceding military groups.\u201d In contrast, the Government contends that members of <em>all </em>of the named groups preceding the phrase \u201cwhen on duty\u201d were intended to be covered by that phrase so as to restrict their right to carry weapons without a license only \u201cwhen on duty\u201d in their various official capacities. Under the Government\u2019s construction appellant would not be able to carry a gun when off duty<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> without violating the statute. We agree that there would be great legislative merit to a statute which prohibited such persons from carrying a pistol when off duty, unless licensed to do so, however, because of the language of the statute and its legislative history, we are unable to find such to be the congressional intent of the present statute for a number of reasons :</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"> <em>First, </em>the construction which the Government advances would be contrary to a normal reading of the language of the statute. Ordinarily, qualifying phrases are to be applied to the words or phrase immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to others more remote. This Rule of the Last Antecedent<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is not an inflexible rule, and is not applied where the context indicates otherwise. Since there is no such indication here, we conclude that the application of the rule would be in keeping with the intention expressed in this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\"><em>Second, </em>had the drafters of the statute intended the phrase \u201cwhen on duty\u201d to modify the earlier portion of the Act referring to deputy jail wardens, they could have left the statute the way it was or omitted the \u201cor\u201d preceding-members of the \u201cArmy, Navy, or Marine Corps,\u201d etc., and inserted a comma before the phrase \u201cwhen on duty\u201d so as to separate it from the clause immediately preceding. That Congress did not do so indicates an intent to change the pri- or law so that the \u201cwhen on duty\u201d limitation would not apply to \u201cmarshals, sheriffs, prison or jail wardens,\u201d etc. This conclusion is particularly supported by the fact that this same technique of separating by \u201cor\u201d the groups which Congress intended to treat separately is followed elsewhere in this section in instances where it is obvious that Congress intended separate treatment. These separate groups in section 22-3205, each of which is separated by a disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d and treated separately include: (a) marshals, sheriffs, jail wardens and other law enforcement officers; (b) military personnel; (c) personnel or organizations authorized to receive weapons from the United States; (d) officers or employees of the United States; (e) firearms manufacturers and dealers and those who repair firearms; (f) purchasers and owners carrying firearms for legitimate reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">The frequency with which Congress indicates in section 22-3205 that the exceptions for the various groups therein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>specified were to vary depending upon the duty status of the individuals in the various groups, reinforces the conclusion that Congress intended its restrictive \u201cwhen on duty\u201d limitation to be applicable only to the antecedent group and not to others more remote. The differing duty statuses which Congress so specified in section 22-3205 include: \u201cwhen on duty\u201d; \u201cgoing to or from their place of assembly or target practice\u201d; \u201cduly authorized to cany a pistol\u201d; \u201cengaged in the business of\u201d; \u201ccarrying a pistol in the usual or ordinary course of such business\u201d; \u201ccarrying a pistol unloaded\u201d etc. to his home, a place of business or place of repair, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><em>Third, </em>a close reading of section 14 of the 1932 Act, which is section 22-3214 of the D.C.Code, prohibiting the possession of certain other dangerous weapons and exempting certain groups from the prohibitions of the statute, makes it clear that Congress in this section was also treating \u201cmarshals, sheriffs, prison or jail wardens, [and] . . . their deputies, policemen or other duly-appointed law-enforcement officers\u201d as a separate class from military personnel. Sec. 14 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">POSSESSION OF CERTAIN DANGEROUS WEAPONS</p>\n<p id=\"acu-dedup-0\">Sec. 14. No person shall within the District of Columbia possess any machine gun, sawed-off shotgun, or any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a blackjack, slung shot, sand club, sandbag, or switchblade knife, or metal knuckles, nor any instrument, attachment, or appliance for causing the firing of any firearm to be silent or intended to lessen or muffle the noise of the firing of any firearms: <em>Provided, however, </em>That machine guns, or sawed-off shotguns, and 'blackjacks may be possessed by the members of the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps of the United States, the National Guard, or Organized Reserve <em>when on duty, </em>the Post Office Department or its employees <em>when on duty, </em>marshals, sheriffs, prison or jail wardens, or their deputies, policemen, or other duly-appointed law-enforcement officers, officers or employees of the United States duly <em>authorized to carry such weapons, </em>banking institutions, public carriers <em>who are engaged in the business of transporting mail, money, securities, or other valuables, </em>wholesale dealers and retail dealers <em>licensed under section 10 of this Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3214, 47 Stat. 654 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">From a mere reading of this section it is obvious that the \u201cwhen on duty\u201d limitation to the exception (which is used twice) is not applicable to \u201cjail wardens,\u201d etc. Likewise, the requirement that they must be \u201cduly authorized to carry such weapons\u201d is not applicable to marshals, sheriffs, jail wardens and \u201cother duly appointed law-enforcement officers.\u201d However, officers and employees of the United States are treated differently. The legislative intent, which is apparent in the different treatment afforded marshals, jail wardens, policemen, etc., by this section, is to exempt such officers who are concerned with law enforcement and the care and custody of prisoners from the restrictions of section 22-3214 with respect to the additional weapons covered by that section. There would be even more reason to limit the application of this exception, permitting possession of machine guns, sawed off shotguns, etc., by jail wardens, to instances when such officials were \u201con duty\u201d than there would be to limit their right to carry pistols to instances when they were \u201con duty,\u201d because most of the weapons (machine guns, etc.) referred to in section 14 (\u00a7 22-3214) are not weapons or implements that marshals, sheriffs, jail wardens, police and other law enforcement officers would ordinarily carry even when on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\"><em>Fourth, </em>while the Government contends that Congress intended that the plain meaning of the 1892 statute,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>codified in 1901,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> should be read into the 1932 enactment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we note that the Senate Committee Report, which accompanied the 1932 bill, does not indicate any intent to incorporate the earlier statute. In fact, the report indicates a somewhat\u2019different basis for the legislation, <em>i. e.:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The bill hereby reported is based on the uniform firearms act drafted by the national conference of commissioners on uniform State laws and approved by the American Bar Association, after many years\u2019 study of firearms legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">S.Rep.No.575, 72nd Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Thus, while it is apparent that the draftsman of the 1932 Act used the earlier Act as the starting point for several sections, the changes he made over the earlier statute indicate an intention to change the earlier law, not to follow it, and this interpretation is supported by the above quotation from the Committee Report and the lack of any reference to the earlier statute in that Committee Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">(4) <em>Our decision in Franklin v. United States</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The Government also contends that its position is supported by our decision in Franklin v. United States, 148 U.S.App.D.C. 39, 458 F.2d 861 (1972). That decision however is distinguishable in that it turned upon the interpretation of D.C.Code \u00a7 4-115 and the regulations thereunder which provided for the appointment of \u201cspecial policemen\u201d and prescribed the situations in which they were authorized to carry firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">For the foregoing reasons we conclude that the exception contained in section 22-3205 for deputy jail wardens was applicable to appellant in the circumstances of the alleged offense and it was accordingly error to charge appellant with a violation of D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3204. His conviction of such offense is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"An_\">Reversed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AaR\">. In the same trial he was acquitted on charges of murder in the second degree, D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2403, and assault with a dangerous weapon, D.C.Code \u00a7 22-502.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\">. \u201cWarden\u201d is defined as \u201cA guardian; a keeper. Tliis is the name given to various officers.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1755 (4tli ed. 1951). The duties of a corrections officer at the D.O. jail include supervision of inmates, transfer of prisoners between institutions, guarding prisoners and guarding walls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\">. The statute places policemen in the same category as deputy jail wardens with respect to the right to carry guns, but police in the District of Columbia contend they have the right to carry guns at all times, whether they are on actual active duty or not, because a D.C. police regulation provides that policemen are \u201con duty\u201d at all times (Tr. 187).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b536-15\"><em>. </em>The 1892 enactment provided:</p>\n<p id=\"Al5c\">lie <em>it enacted by the Senate and, House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, </em>That it shall not be lawful for any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>or persons within the District of Columbia, to liave concealed about their person any deadly or dangerous weapons, such as daggers, air-guns, pistols, bowie-knives, dirk knives or dirks, blackjacks, razors, razor blades, sword canes, slung shot, brass or other metal knuckles.</p>\n<p id=\"Af7P\">Sec. 2.
