Jurisdiction is pursuant to the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-22\">An arbitrator determined that Tully Johnson, a Champion employee and union member, was wrongfully discharged. The arbitrator ordered that \u201cthe griev-ant [Johnson] shall be reinstated with full back pay . . . less any amount earned from other employment. <em>ti</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-25\">During the period between his discharge and reinstatement Johnson earned $1,304.25 from other employment. He also received $520.00 in unemployment compensation from the State of Oklahoma. Champion reinstated Johnson and paid him his back pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>less $1,304.25 and $520.00, contending that the unemployment compensation constituted \u201cearnings.\u201d The union brought this action on behalf of employee Johnson to recover the $520.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The arbitrator\u2019s award authorized only amounts \u201cearned from other employment\u201d to be deducted from the back pay award. Clearly, the language of the award does not allow deduction of unemployment compensation benefits. NLRB v. Gullett Gin Co., 340 U.S. 361, 71 S.Ct. 337, 95 L.Ed. 337 (1951); Marshall Field &amp; Co. v. NLRB, 318 U.S. 253, 63 S.Ct. 585, 87 L.Ed. 744 (1943); Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. v.

The right of Champion to deduct the $520.00 from the arbitrator\u2019s award for back pay is the only question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
