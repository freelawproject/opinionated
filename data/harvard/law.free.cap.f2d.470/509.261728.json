It was the determination of the Board that the respondent union, a member of a multi-union-multi-employer unit, had unlawfully refused to bargain by refusing to be bound by the negotiations of its representatives, such action \u201ccoming after negotiations for a new contract had been all but completed.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It had, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>moreover, it was found, by strikes, picketing, and threats thereof, sought to compel employer-members of the unit to abandon the unit and to execute separate collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The offenses charged do not turn upon the existence or nonexistence of a new national agreement, whether signed or unsigned, executed or executory, but rather upon the attempted withdrawal from the unit under the circumstances described and the concomitant restraint and coercion practiced. See NLRB v. Jeffries Banknote Co., 281 F.2d 893 (CA 9, 1960); NLRB v. Hart, 453 F.2d 215 (CA 9, 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We have reviewed the record and find substantial support therein to support the Board\u2019s factual determinations.
