SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b513-22\">Appellant was charged with first degree murder and carrying a dangerous weapon. The facts, according to the Government\u2019s version of the story, indicated deliberate and premeditated murder. The decedent Price owed appellant part of the purchase price of a truck. Appellant visited Price on the morning of December 19, 1969, at the apartment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>project where Price worked, and asked Price to either pay the money or return the truck.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After Price refused, an argument ensued in which verbal threats were exchanged, but appellant left before any fight erupted. Later in the day appellant went to the house of a friend named Lombre where he obtained a gun. Returning to the apartment project that afternoon, he walked over to Price, who was then fixing an outside door to one of the apartments, pushed him into the apartment, and shot him three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Appellant took the stand and admitted firing the fatal shots, but he claimed to have acted in self-defense. According to his version of the incident, he had called his friend Lombre after his initial confrontation with Price and asked Lombre to drive him back to the apartment project later in the afternoon. His purpose in returning was not to encounter Price again, but rather to talk to Price\u2019s employer who had agreed to try to talk Price into settling the debt. Appellant wanted Lombre to come along for protection<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as he was afraid of Price, not only because Price had threatened him and had warned him not to try to take back the truck, but also because Price was much larger than appellant and appellant knew that Price had killed his own six-year-old son some years earlier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">When appellant arrived at Lombre\u2019s home before returning to the apartment project, Lombre was very sleepy, apparently as a result of holiday season partying, and was thus unable to drive him there as they had earlier agreed. Remembering that Lombre kept a revolver, appellant searched for and found the gun and put it in his jacket, intending to use it only to frighten Price off in the event of a physical attack. When he saw Price working outside one of the apartments, Price called to him to come over and then asked him to step inside the apartment with him. Once inside, appellant testified, Price told him \u201che wanted [him]\u201d and started coming toward him. Appellant warned that he had a gun. Price said, \u201cGo ahead and shoot,\u201d and moved as if to swing at appellant, who then fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">The jury found appellant guilty of carrying a dangerous weapon and second degree murder. Because the trial court committed prejudicial error in refusing to admit certain evidence offered by the defense, we reverse the conviction of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">In order to corroborate appellant\u2019s own version of the killing, the defense attempted to introduce evidence of Price\u2019s violent and dangerous character \u2014 specifically evidence that Price had killed his own six-year-old son in 1965. As this court has long recognized, evidence of the deceased\u2019s violent character, including evidence of specific violent acts, is admissible where a claim of self-defense is raised. Such evidence is relevant on the issue of who was the aggressor<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, where there is evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>that the defendant knew of the deceased\u2019s character, on the issue of whether or not the defendant reasonably feared he was in danger of imminent great bodily injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Evans v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 324, 277 F.2d 354 (1960); Marshall v. United States, 45 App.D.C. 373 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The defense first tried to introduce evidence of the deceased\u2019s character through the testimony of the deceased\u2019s wife, Mrs. Price. When the defense called her to the stand, however, the court questioned the propriety of her testifying and, after a long and confusing colloquy between court and counsel, the court ruled that it would advise Mrs. Price that she need not testify. The court\u2019s decision was apparently based on 14 D.C.Code \u00a7 306(a) (1967) which provides: \u201cIn civil and criminal proceedings, a husband or his wife is competent but not compellable to testify for or against the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">The common law privilege of one spouse not to testify \u201cfor or against\u201d the other is limited in two respects, either of which would bar its application here. First, the privilege applies only when the testimony of one spouse would favor or disfavor \u201cthe other spouse\u2019s <em>legal interests in the very case </em>in which the testimony is offered.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 8 J. Wig-more, Evidence \u00a7 2234, at 231 (Mc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Naughton rev. 1961). (Emphasis in original.) <em>See </em>Halback v. Hill, 49 U.S.App.D.C. 127, 130, 261 F. 1007, 1010 (1919). Mr. Price\u2019s legal interests were in no way at stake in this case and the privilege was therefore inapplicable. Second, the privilege ends with termination of the marital relationship through the death of one spouse. <em>See </em>8 J. Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>at 238-239. The policy of the privilege \u2014 protection of family harmony<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 cannot be served if the marital relationship has already ended.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While this court has held that 14 D.C.Code \u00a7 306 is \u201ca congressional enactment which completely abrogates the common law rule as far as this jurisdiction is concerned,\u201d Postom v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 219, 220, 322 F.2d 432, 433 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 917, 84 S.Ct. 672, 11 L.Ed.2d 613 (1964), we have also had occasion to note that the purpose of Congress in enacting this statute \u201cwas to remove grounds of ineompetency, and not increase them. * * * Therefore a husband or wife, under this statute, can claim no greater privilege than existed at common law.\u201d Halback v. Hill, <em>supra, </em>49 U.S.App.D.C. at 130, 261 F. at 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Thus it was error for the court to hold that under 14 D.C.Code \u00a7 306(a) Mrs. Price had a privilege not to testify. Nor can the court's action be justified on the basis of the privilege not to reveal confidential marital communications. See 14 D.C.Code \u00a7 306(b) (1967). While this privilege survives the death of one spouse, <em>see </em>Hopkins v. Grimshaw, 165 U.S. 342, 351, 17 S.Ct. 401, 41 L.Ed. 739 (1897); United States v. Lewis, 140 U.S.App.D.C. 40, 43 n. 10, 433 F.2d 1146, 1149 n. 10 (1970); McCartney v. Fletcher, 10 App.D.C. 572 (1897), it was nevertheless inapplicable in this case. The confidential communications privilege does not extend to noncommunicative acts, United States v. Lewis, <em>supra, </em>and a communication otherwise privileged loses its privileged character on coming into the hands of a third party, Dicker<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>son v. United States, 62 App.D.C. 191, 65 F.2d 824, cert. denied, 290 U.S. 665, 54 S.Ct. 89, 78 L.Ed. 575 (1933). Under either of these doctrines, the confidential communications privilege would not apply to Mrs. Price\u2019s testimony about her husband\u2019s beating to death their own child. And if counsel for defendant would have questioned Mrs. Price about other aspects of the deceased\u2019s character, conceivably asking her to reveal confidential communications, the appropriate procedure in that event would have been to object to the questions as asked, or to <em>voir dire </em>Mrs. Price out of the presence of the jury to ensure that no such questions would be asked before the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In any case, it was wrong to hold that the witness had the right to refuse to take the stand when it was clear that some of her testimony would have been outside the confidential communications privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">At oral argument counsel for the Government contended that appellant should be barred from challenging the court\u2019s ruling since the defense never actually called Mrs. Price to ask her whether she would exercise the erroneously granted privilege. Our reading of the record indicates, however, that it was clear to all concerned that Mrs. Price was not going to testify unless she had to. In fact, in making its ruling the court brought the matter to a close by stating, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll tell her that she doesn\u2019t need to testify. Have you got anything else?\u201d While the proper procedural course would have been to ask Mrs. Price to exercise her privilege for the record, we can attach no significance to the defense\u2019s failure to do so in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">It also appears from the record that the error in barring this testimony was prejudicial. Appellant admitted the shooting, and his sole defense was self-defense. The evidence he sought to introduce was vital to this defense and, even if it might not have induced the jury to acquit, it might well have induced it to return a verdict of guilt for the lesser included offense of manslaughter instead of second degree murder. <em>See </em>Evans v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Nor is it significant that appellant had already brought some attention to the child killing by mentioning it when he testified on his own behalf. While the jury might have discredited his testimony on this issue, it would have had virtually no choice but to believe Mrs. Price if she had taken the stand and testified that Mr. Price had killed their son.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">The defense also sought to prove Price\u2019s violent character by introducing his conviction of a violation of 22 D.C. Code \u00a7 901 (1967) which makes it unlawful to \u201ctorture, cruelly beat, abuse, or otherwise wilfully maltreat any child under the age of eighteen years * * *.\u201d Price had pleaded guilty to this charge, apparently after the Government dismissed an indictment for second degree murder that had issued after the child killing incident. The trial court barred this evidence also, apparently on the ground that appellant testified that he was fearful because the decedent was a \u201cchild-killer,\u201d while the conviction was only for cruelty to the child. As noted earlier, however, where self-defense is raised and there is an issue as to who was the aggressor, evidence of the deceased\u2019s violent character is relevant and admissible even though unknown to the defendant. See note 4 supra. Thus the defense in this case had a right to prove any violent acts of the decedent, regardless of whether appellant testified that he knew about those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">Counsel for the Government also argues that since it is possible to violate 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 901 in a nonviolent manner\u2014 keeping a child chained or depriving him of food are examples given by the Government \u2014 proof of the conviction is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>admissible under the rule set down in Jones v. United States, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 36, 385 F.2d 296 (1967). The record in <em>Jones </em>indicated that the proffered evidence \u201cconsisted solely in the docket entry, which disclosed only that [the decedent] had been convicted under D.C. Code \u00a7 22-505 (1961 ed.).\u201d 128 U.S. App.D.C. at 38 n. 2, 385 F.2d at 298 n. 2. We held that the trial court properly refused to admit the docket entry into evidence because 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 505 not only makes unlawful the violent act of assaulting a police officer, but also makes it illegal to obstruct, even in a nonviolent manner, a police officer in the performance of his duties. We reasoned, then, that the docket entry did not show \u201cthe nature of the conduct for which [decedent] had been convicted.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In other words, the proffered evidence did not prove any prior violent act on the part of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo </em>to be sure, that such cruelty as depriving a child of food or keeping him in chains is nonviolent, the facts of this case do not fall within the rationale of <em>Jones. </em>In the case at bar, the violent nature of the conduct for which Price had been convicted was indicated by the evidence tendered to the trial court. This was no mere docket entry of a conviction disclosing only the citation of the statute violated, 'but a conviction based on a plea of guilty to an indictment that charged that the decedent Price did \u201cbeat, abuse and otherwise willfully maltreat\u201d his six-year-old son. The proffered evidence thus indicated a past violent act of the decedent Price and was not made inadmissible by our decision in <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Since barring proof of the conviction only compounded the prejudicial error made by the court in informing Mrs. Price that she need not testify about the same occurrence, we must reverse the conviction of second degree murder and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\">. Appellant testified that he and Price had agreed earlier that if Price did not come up with the money by Dec. 19 appellant would take the truck back and could use it until Price paid the debt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">. Appellant also needed a ride back to the apartment. From what is indicated in the record, appellant did not own a car of his own except for the truck which he had sold to Price but which was still registered in his name. He drove out to see Price in the morning in a friend\u2019s car, and when he returned later in the afternoon after his visit with Lombre, he borrowed another friend\u2019s car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-14\">. When asked why lie was afraid of Price, appellant testified: \u201cSeveral reasons maybe. Mr. Price was much larger than I was, kind of solidly built and mean. * * * I knew that if he could beat his six-year old boy to death, he wouldn\u2019t probably hesitate to beat me to death, too.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b514-19\">. It bears emphasis, since the trial court in the case at bar was confused on this point, that as to the issue of who was the aggressor it is irrelevant that the defendant did not know about the deceased\u2019s character. \u201c\u2018[The] additional element of communication is unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>sary; for the question is what the deceased probably did, not what the defendant probably thought the deceased was going to do. The inquiry is one of objective occurrence, not of subjective belief.\u2019 \u201d Evans v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 324, 326, 277 F.2d 354, 356 (1960), quoting 1 J. Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 63, at 470-471 (3d ed. 1940). <em>See </em>State v. Griffin, 99 Ariz. 43, 47, 48, 406 P.2d 397, 399-400 (1965); Harris v. State, Okl.Cr.App., 400 P.2d 64 (1965). <em>See generally </em>Annot., 1 A.D.R.3d 571, 601-603 (1965), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai8\">There clearly was an issue in this case as to who was the aggressor. The prosecution\u2019s theory was that appellant pushed Price into the apartment and fired the first shot into his back. Appellant, on the other hand, testified that he shot Price only after Price started coming toward him as if to swing at him. The other evidence in the case was also inconsistent on this point. The pathologist testified that the first shot hit Price in the back. Mrs. Weaver, who lived in the apartment and was an eyewitness to the shooting, testified as a Government witness that appellant fired the first shot while the two were facing each other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\">. <em>See </em>2 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 246, 248 (3d ed. 1940). Counsel for the prosecution argued during the colloquy with the court that if the issue were the defendant\u2019s belief, then the proof should be limited to testimony by the defendant. He maintained that extrinsic proof of the acts should be inadmissible. This argument is incorrect for the following reasons. The issue in a case of self-defense \u2014 whether the defendant reasonably feared grave bodily injury \u2014 breaks down into two sub-issues: (1) whether the defendant did <em>in fact </em>fear imminent grave bodily injury, and (2) whether the defendant\u2019s fear was that of a reasonable man. When a defendant takes the stand and testifies that he feared the decedent because he had heard1 that the decedent had committed a particular violent act, the jury is, of course, free to question whether the defendant is telling the truth. It is conceivable, for example, that the defendant never heard any such information. Extrinsic proof that the decedent did in fact commit the violent act serves to corroborate the defendant\u2019s testimony as to what he heard, and is therefore relevant to the question whether the defendant did, in fact, fear injury at the hands of the decedent. <em>See </em>Dempsey v. State, 159 Tex.Cr.R. 602, 266 S.W.2d 875 (1954). <em>Dempsey </em>involved a fact situation remarkably similar to our own. Appellant there admitted killing the deceased but claimed he acted in self-defense \u201cbelieving that the deceased, who he knew had recently cut his nephew\u2019s throat, had a pistol or knife and was about to attack him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 876. On appeal the issue was whether it was proper to admit extrinsic proof of the decedent\u2019s violent act when the defendant had already testified about it. The court held: \u201cAppellant testified that he knew the deceased \u2018had just cut his nephew\u2019s throat\u2019. He should have been permitted to prove as a fact such act of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 878.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b515-16\">. Wigmore found it difficult to rationalize this limitation. \u201cIf,\u201d he asserted, \u201cthe fear of causing marital dissension or disturbing the domestic peace were genuinely the ground of the privilege * * *, then the privilege should apply to testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>mony which in any way <em>disparages </em>or disfavors the other spouse, irrespective of Ids being- a party to the cause * \u00ae.\u201d 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence 230-231 (McNaughton rev. 1961). (Emphasis in original.) Wigmore argues that the \u201cattempt to be logical\u201d with the marital privilege came to failure because the underlying theory of the privilege was itself questionable. <em>Id. </em>at 231. As he states: \u201c[The marital privilege] is entertaining (if any error in the law can ever be entertaining) because of its exhibition of the subtle power of cant over reason and of the solemn absurdity of explanations which: do not explain and of justifications which do not justify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"arf-dedup-0\">In any event, the cases indicate that American jurisdictions, including our own, have accepted the common law limitation. <em>See, e. g., </em>Halback v. Hill, 49 U.S.App.D.C. 127, 130, 261 F. 1007, 1010 (1919); People v. Langtree, 64 Cal. 256, 258, 30 P. 813, 814 (1883); State v. Parrott, 79 N.C. 615, 617 (1878); State v.

Lewis, 140 U.S.App.D.C. 40, 43, 433 F.2d 1146, 1149 (1970), which refers to the privilege as \u201cdisqualifying a spouse as a witness in litigation to which the other is a party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\">. <em>See </em>Hawkins v.

There is, however, another serious contention relating to the ineffectiveness of defense counsel which the Court today does not discuss. Although it is not necessary to decide whether this claim alone would warrant reversal, I discuss it since it may be pertinent to any new trial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Among the inadequacies in trial counsel\u2019s representation were the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">1. Defense counsel never sought discovery under Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a) nor did he request the <em>Jencks </em>statements of government witnesses. The <em>Jencks </em>materials were made available only at the court\u2019s initiative. (Tr. 45-6)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">2. Defense counsel, despite the trial judge\u2019s efforts to enlighten him, did not comprehend the difference between impeaching a witness and refreshing his recollection. (Tr. 137-49)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">3. Defense counsel repeatedly evidenced his lack of knowledge as to the proper scope of cross-examination, and he seemed to have difficulty understanding that he could not introduce defense exhibits while the government was presenting its case. The trial judge finally had to explain:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">But you see ... I don\u2019t know how many cases you have tried, but you are the defendant and you offer no evidence until the defense\u2019s case is going on. You could mark exhibits for the defendant, but you don\u2019t offer them until the defense case is going on. (Tr. 298)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">4. The defense attorney was also unfamiliar with the rules governing the introduction of character evidence, including the leading case on the subject, Michelson v. United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>fense counsel had demonstrated considerable ineptitude in questioning his first character witness, the court recessed to give him an opportunity to familiarize himself with the law in the area, citing <em>Michelson </em>and Shimon v. United <em>States? </em>When counsel returned to court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and resumed questioning the same witness, he still exhibited a lack of understanding as to the proper means of eliciting character testimony. There were repeated objections and bench conferences. From two of his character witnesses counsel was unable to obtain any admissible evidence. The examinations of his other three character witnesses produced only one-word answers to his inquiry as to the defendant\u2019s reputation for peace and good order in the community \u2014 two witnesses responded \u201cgood\u201d and a third \u201cexcellent\u201d. On the other hand, the prosecutor was able to recite the fact that appellant had previously been convicted of armed robbery to each of these witnesses; and two of the witnesses who did offer admissible character testimony conceded that they had previously been unaware of appellant\u2019s criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Defense counsel also had some difficulty in securing the admission of evidence as to the deceased\u2019s character. In explaining why such evidence should be admissible counsel could only cite an 1895 case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He explained the lack of any more recent precedent in an exchange which is revealing as to both his resources and his technical knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">COUNSEL: What I want to do is get to the deceased\u2019s character through a witness. . . . And this goes, Your Honor, to the proposition that based on the self defense theory, my client has the right to have the deceased\u2019s character in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">THE COURT: Give me some authority ....</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">COUNSEL: My authority . . . is Travers versus the United States, which is, I believe, is cited at Sixth Appeals, D.C., page . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">THE COURT: Anything more recent than that?</p>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">COUNSEL: Your Honor, I tried to shephardize . . . the case, but the Shepherd . . . citator was absent from the library. (Tr. W. 64).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-20\">5. Defense counsel was similarly inept in handling the issue of marital privilege. He merely asserted to the court that the deceased\u2019s wife\u2019s privilege died with her husband. When asked whether he had any authority for that proposition, he responded :</p>\n<p id=\"b519-21\">I don\u2019t have any authority for that, Your Honor. I couldn\u2019t find any. (Tr. W. 65)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-22\">The court again recessed to allow counsel to research the pertinent law, the trial judge providing him with a citation to the D.C.Code\u2019s marital privilege provision. On his return, counsel was able to. express a policy distinction between the two sections of the statute, but was still without authority to support any of his assertions. The judge\u2019s erroneous exclusion of the wife\u2019s testimony, on the basis of her marital privilege is one of the grounds for our reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-23\">6. Although defense counsel was aware of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction, he appears to have been unfamiliar with the principles of Luck v. United States<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and did not request a <em>Luck </em>hearing. Since he was also unfamiliar with the provision of the D.C. Court Reorganization Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> pursuant to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>appellant\u2019s prior record was introduced as impeachment evidence, the court instructed counsel to \u201ctake a look at it\u201d before the defendant testified. (Tr. 314).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">7. The Court reverses appellant\u2019s conviction in part because of the trial judge\u2019s erroneous exclusion of the decedent\u2019s criminal record. On the second day of trial defense counsel asked that the record \u201cbe brought before the Court.\u201d Explaining that the deceased had a record of \u201cchild neglect or homicide\u201d (Tr. 348), counsel implied that he would introduce the record through a defense witness, the deceased\u2019s former employer. The witness was never asked about the deceased\u2019s criminal record. The next day, defense counsel tried unsuccessfully to introduce the record through the testimony of the deceased\u2019s wife and his sister. It was apparent that the defense attorney had never seen any such record and it soon became equally obvious that he did not even know how to find it. The judge finally inquired:</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">THE COURT: Actually, what you want, isn\u2019t it, is the record of this man\u2019s convictions ?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">COUNSEL: That is right, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">THE COURT: Well, why don\u2019t you subpoena them?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\u00ab\u25a0 -X- -X- * -X- -X-</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">You have had all this time. You have had this case for some time in preparation, haven\u2019t you?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">COUNSEL: I mentioned it to Your Honor yesterday.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">THE COURT: You said nothing about making an application for subpoena. You did so far as those character witnesses are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">COUNSEL: Yes, I asked about it yesterday for the forthwith because the custodian would be necessary because .</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">THE COURT: Well, there is a piece of paper, you know, in this courthouse. You knew well enough to use it for your character witnesses. How old is this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-18\">COUNSEL: A year and a half, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-20\">THE COURT: Is it still in the courthouse ?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-21\">COUNSEL: Is what in the courthouse ?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-22\">THE COURT: The case that you want brought up here, the conviction. The file \u2014 don\u2019t you ?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-23\">COUNSEL: No, Your Honor, it would not be in the courthouse. It would be a police record or an FBI record.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-25\">THE COURT: Well, where was he convicted ?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-26\">COUNSEL: I believe he was .convicted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-27\">\u2022* * * -x- * -X-</p>\n<p id=\"b520-28\">THE COURT: Well, why wouldn\u2019t it be in the courthouse then?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-29\">COUNSEL: I guess it would be, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-30\">THE COURT: Did you ever go down and look for the files?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-32\">COUNSEL: No, I did not. (Tr. W. 78-9)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-33\">The legal discussion of whether the record was admissable took place entirely between the court and the prosecutor; defense counsel demonstrated no familiarity with the cases being discussed and cited none of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-34\">8. Defense counsel\u2019s ignorance of the procedure for requesting lesser included offense instructions led to the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b520-35\">THE COURT: I am just wondering if defense counsel is aware of what he\u2019s doing. You haven\u2019t asked for a second-degree murder, lesser included; you haven\u2019t aked for a manslaughter, lesser included.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-36\">COUNSEL: Well, I assumed that would be given, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>THE COURT: You don\u2019t assume at all. There are two separate counts of this indictment, first-degree murder, premeditated, and second count of carrying a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">COUNSEL: Well, in that case, Your Honor, I would ask for the lesser included offenses in these instructions. (Tr. W. 102)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The foregoing demonstrates the defense counsel\u2019s lack of familiarity with criminal trial practice. But the right to counsel requires a <em>\u201cprofessional </em>advocate\u201d,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> schooled in the law. Anything short of that contravenes the very purpose for the requirement of an attorney, as recognized in the earliest of the Supreme Court\u2019s right to counsel decisions, Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 68-69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 64, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932):</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. . . . Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step of the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">No matter how well-intentioned or diligent, a layman\u2019s representation would not satisfy the Constitutional requirement because of the layman\u2019s lack of skill and knowledge \u201cin the science of law.\u201d The record in this case leaves a substantial doubt as to whether defense counsel, no matter how conscientious his efforts, satisfied the Constitutional requirement of an advocate with sufficient \u201cskill and knowledge adequately to prepare [a] defense\u201d to any criminal charge, to say nothing of the charge in this case \u2014 murder.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-16\">. 335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">. 122 U.S.App.D.C. 152, 352 F.2d 449 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\">.
