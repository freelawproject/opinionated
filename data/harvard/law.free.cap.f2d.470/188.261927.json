See. 78j.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">We conclude that there is no merit in either the contention of appellants (1) that an instrumentality of interstate commerce was not utilized either \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d; (2) that there was insufficient evidence to submit to the jury the question whether the sale of McGregor\u2019s and Jacob\u2019s stock was attributable to the use of a \u201cdeceptive device\u201d; or (3) that the court erroneously charged the jury as to the measure of damages. We conclude, therefore, on the appeal by the defendants below that the judgment must be Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">McGregor and Jacob appeal from the unexplained act of the trial court in dismissing H.L.H. Enterprises, Inc. from the case, after the jury had returned a verdict against Rooks, Chambers (President of H.L.H. Enterprises, Inc.,) and H.L.H. Enterprises, Inc., the purchaser of the stock. H.L.H. filed no brief in this court undertaking to support this unexplained action by the trial court. We conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict against the corporation was fully supported, and, therefore, that the trial court erred in failing to enter a judgment against the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-17\">The case is, therefore, Remanded to the trial court with directions to rein-tate H.L.H. Enterprises, Inc. as a defendant, and to include this defendant in the judgment in favor of McGregor and Jacob.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-12\">. \u00a7 78j.
