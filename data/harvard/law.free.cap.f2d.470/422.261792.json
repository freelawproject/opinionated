NLRB, 379 U.S. 203, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964). Specifically, is a decision made by a manufacturer to convert a self-owned and operated retail outlet into an independently owned and operated franchise dealership a decision subject to the mandatory bargaining requirement of Section 8(a)(5)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.? The Trial Examiner answered the question in the affirmative. However The National Labor Relations Board, appellee, held that General Motors Corporation (GM), intervenor, was not required to so bargain and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), appellant appeals. We agree with the Board and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">1. In addition to its manufacturing operations GM owns and operates various facilities engaged .in the retail sales and servicing of GM trucks and truck parts. One of these facilities, which GM operated from the early 1960\u2019s until the inception of this case, was the Houston Truck Center in Houston, Texas. Since 1965 UAW has represented the employees at the Center under collective bargaining agreements effective through November 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">In early 1969, pursuant to an established corporate policy of disposing of factory-owned outlets, GM entered into negotiations for the sale of Houston Truck Center to Trucks of Texas, Inc., an independent dealership. Rumors of these negotiations reached UAW in April and union representatives insisted that they be kept informed of the matter and that GM and UAW bargain over it before the decision to sell was made. On May 21 the manager of the Center informed union representatives that a private party had made an offer for the Center but no sale had been consummated. He further advised that \u201cthere was no further reason to either discuss the item until such time as [GM] came to an agreement, or there was an occasion that it would be sold and that it would take place.\u201d On the following day, UAW filed this complaint with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">On June 6, GM signed an agreement with Trucks of Texas, Inc. in which it subleased the premises and sold all personal property therein to Trucks for an undisclosed price. Simultaneously, GM awarded a dealership franchise for the sale of GM trucks to Trucks. The latter agreed to operate a full-line dealership at this location and promised to fulfill the truck warranty commitments of the Center. The \u201cselling agreement\u201d provided that if Trucks\u2019 dealership was terminated for any reason, either side could immediately terminate the sublease of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-18\">On June 9 Trucks of Texas distributed literature advising the employees that the facility had been sold and that the new management\u2019s \u201cpersonnel requirements will be substantially different from those of your present employer,\u201d i. e. that no jobs were available for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>any of these employees. On the same date, a GM official distributed literature to the Center employees advising them of their eligibility for coverage under certain GM \u201cbenefit plans,\u201d of their separation rights, etc. and discussed their vacation pay and seniority date to be used in determining the benefits available to them. On June 10 and 11 he met with union representatives and discussed the effect of the sale to Trucks; he offered his personal assistance in locating employment in other GM facilities in the area; and made some concessions that were requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The Trial Examiner ordered that the <em>status quo ante </em>be restored. The Board reversed, finding that the transfer amounted to a \u201csale of the business\u201d and was therefore beyond the terms of the mandatory bargaining requirement of Section 8(a)(5) since the decision was \u201cat the core of entrepreneurial control.\u201d UAW seeks review of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">2. Interestingly enough, both sides rely on Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. N. L. R. B., <em>supra. </em>As we read <em>Fibreboard, </em>however, it is a far cry from this case. In it maintenance work in a large manufacturing plant was contracted out upon the expiration of its collective bargaining with employees who had been performing the same work. The Court found that industrial experience illustrated that the contracting out of maintenance work had been brought within the. collective bargaining framework; that it exists in numerous collective bargaining agreements and is the basis of many grievances, citing United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 584, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960) and Local 24 Teamsters Union v. Oliver, 358 U.S. 283, 79 S.Ct. 297, 3 L.Ed.2d 312 (1959). But UAW contends that <em>Fibreboard </em>should be read so as to require bargaining whenever a management decision results in termination of employment. The short answer to that is that <em>Fibreboard </em>itself declares: \u201cThe Company\u2019s decision did not alter the Company\u2019s operation . . . [T]o require the employer to bargain about the matter would not significantly abridge his freedom to manage the business . . . [379 U.S. at 213, 85 S.Ct. 398 at 404] We are thus not expanding the scope of mandatory bargaining.\u201d Id. 215, 85 S.Ct. 405.1 What UAW would have us do would turn over the management to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Our task is more than the mere parsing of the statutory language. We must make certain that \u201cin each case the interests of the employees and the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act . be carefully balanced against the right of an employer to run his business.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Royal Plating &amp; Polishing Co., 350 F.2d 191, 195 (3 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">In applying the case-by-case approach, the Courts of Appeals have looked to several factors to determine if a decision is one \u201cprimarily about the conditions of employment\u201d or is instead \u201cfundamental to the basic direction of a corporate enterprise.\u201d If the decision appears to be primarily designed to avoid the bargaining agreement with the union or if it produces no substantial change in the operations of the employer, the courts have required bargaining. International Union, U. A. W. v. N. L. R. B., 127 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 381 F.2d 265 (1967), cert. denied 389 U.S. 857, 88 S.Ct. 82, 19 L.Ed.2d 122 [\u201ccontracting out\u201d of one step in a two-step car-parking operation previously done by union employees]; Weltronic Co. v. N. L. R. B., 419 F.2d 1120 (6 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 938, 90 S.Ct. 1841, 26 L.Ed.2d 270 [transfer of work from a union plant to a non-union plant three miles away]. If the decision resulted in the termination of a substantial portion or a distinct line of the employer\u2019s business or involved a major change in the nature of its operations, no bargaining has been required. N. L. R. B. v. Drapery Mfg. Co., 425 F.2d 1026, 1028 (8 Cir. 1970) [shut down of a drapery manufacturing division of a company involving \u201ca major shift in capital investment\u201d that was purely economically motivated]; N. L. R. B. v. Transmarine Navigation Corp., 380 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>933 (9 Cir. 1967) [the operation of a terminal moved to another location with the company accepting minority interest in joint venture]; N. L. R. B. v. Royal Plating &amp; Polishing Co., <em>supra </em>[one of two plants closed down]; see also N. L. R. B. v. Dixie Ohio Express Co., 409 F.2d 10 (6 Cir. 1969) [procedures for loading and unloading substantially altered]; N. L. R. B. v. Adams Dairy, Inc., 322 F.2d 553 (8 Cir. 1963), remanded in light of <em>Fibreboard, </em>379 U.S. 644, 85 S.Ct. 613, 13 L.Ed.2d 550 (1965), reaffirmed, 350 F.2d 108 (8 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 1011, 86 S.Ct. 619, 15 L.Ed.2d 526 [change in distribution method]; Machinists v. Northeast Air-^ lines 80 LRRM 2197 [airline merger]. The difficult cases have been those involving a small but not insubstantial proportion of the employer\u2019s business; in these cases, the results have often hinged on hints of anti-union animus. See, e. g., N. L. R. B. v. Johnson, 368 F.2d 549 (9 Cir. 1966) [floor covering company decided to subcontract installation services immediately after the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement]; N. L. R. B. v. American Manufacturing Co., 351 F.2d 74 (5 Cir. 1965) [subcontracting of truck delivery portion of business where a clear showing of animosity toward union is present].</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">3. The Board and GM contend that the transaction is a \u201csale\u201d since the transfer calls GM the \u201cseller\u201d and Trucks the \u201cbuyer.\u201d UAW says it is only a franchise agreement because of the considerable interest GM retains in the operation to which Trucks succeeded. UAW emphasizes that GM may terminate Truck\u2019s dealership and cancel its sublease at any time; and, in addition, GM retains its marketing position in Houston at the same loacation. Thus, petitioner characterizes the arrangements as a \u201cclassical contracting out situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">While GM\u2019s tagging of the contract as a sale is, of course, not decisive we believe that it was properly so charae-terized. It was succeeded by the execution of a standard GM dealership contract which was in keeping with a national GM policy to switch its remaining manufacturer-owned and operated retail outlets to independent franchises or dealerships. Such a decision is \u201cfundamental to the basic direction of a corporate enterprise.\u201d It is at the core of entrepreneurial control . There is no claim here of anti-union bias on the part of GM and our action is not to be construed as foreclosing such a claim in an appropriate factual situation as our cases clearly show. We therefore find that GM was under no obligation to bargain before entering into this particular transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">4. UAW also contends that GM failed to bargain about the effects of the decision. We cannot agree. We need not repeat the efforts of the GM official on the very day of the transfer and the two succeeding days as well to work out the problems of the employees. It is sufficient to add that UAW itself used the opportunity to good advantage. A single problem raised by UAW transfers was the sole issue not settled to its satisfaction. And even as to it, Trucks\u2019 offer that it would undertake to secure employment for the UAW members <em>at another location </em>operated by an affiliate sparked no interest in the UAW.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-15\">The petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-12\">.

Accordingly, it suggested some countervailing factors by specifying what was not involved in <em>Fibre-board-.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHGk\">The facts of the present case illustrate the propriety of submitting the dispute to collective negotiation. The Company\u2019s decision to contract out the maintenance work did not alter the Company\u2019s basic operation. The maintenance work still had to be performed in the plant. No capital investment was contemplated; the Com-1/ pany merely replaced existing employees with those of an independent \u00bfcontractor to do the same work under similar conditions of employment. Therefore, to require the employer to bargain about the matter would not v/significantly abridge his freedom to manage the business.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\"><em>Y </em>My brethren seem also to recognize<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the Supreme Court thus requires the Board to weigh the employees\u2019 interests protected by section 8(a)(5) against the effect bargaining will have on the employer\u2019s freedom to conduct his | business.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">In the instant case the Board failed to 'make such an analysis. Rather, it began with the assertion that <em>Fibreboard </em>does not govern because the disputed transaction was a \u201csale,\u201d not a \u201csubcontract.\u201d It then looked solely to what it perceived as management\u2019s interests in avoiding the strictures of bargaining over decisions to sell, justifying this approach with the unsupported assertion that \u201cthe ! courts\u201d have adopted this rationale in \u201cclosely related cases:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">[Djecisions such as this, in which a significant investment or withdrawal of capital will affect the scope and ultimate direction of an enterprise, are matters essentially financial and managerial in nature. They thus lie ah the very core of entrepreneurial con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>trol, and are not the types of subjects which Congress intended to encompass within \u201crates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment.\u201d [sic] Such managerial decisions ofttimes require secrecy as well as the freedom to act quickly and decisively. They also involve subject areas as to which determinative financial and operational considerations are likely to be unfamiliar to the employees and their representatives.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0J\">Presenting nothing beyond these broad, and purely speulative, assertions, the Board held that, since the transaction here in question was a \u201csale,\u201d there was no duty to bargain about it. The Board di'd not determine the interest's\u201d of this particular employer in avoiding bargaining over either this particular decision ~or the alleged general policy of disposing of its retail outlets; the Board similarly failed\u201d'to take account of employee interests in bargaining, either in this particular case or in so-called \u201csales\u201d cases generally. Thus, viewed as an application of <em>Fibreboard, </em>the Board\u2019s holding was that whenever an employer \u201csells\u201d part of his operation, his interests in not bargaining about the decision always outweigh the interests of his employees in bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">The Board may adopt an appropriate general rule governing the duty to bargain, but this one is unacceptable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whether a particular transaction constitutes a \u201csale\u201d is a legal conclusion which defines the property rights of the parties to that transaction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even where Congress has explicitly attached additional consequences to that conclusion, as in income taxation, limitation and redefinition of the term have been deemed necessary because the interests involved differ.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And the term \u201csale\u201d has not been incorporated into the National Labor Relations Act for good reason:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whether an agreement constitutes a \u201csale\u201d as a matter of property law may have little or nothing to do with the rel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ative importance of the interests of management and employees in bargaining about the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The approach of the Board in this case amply demonstrates this point. It based its holding that the instant transaction was a \u201csale\u201d on four findings of fact: (1) the document used the words \u201cbuyer\u201d and \u201cseller;\u201d (2) day-to-day management passed to the buyer; (3) title to the property passed to the buyer; and (4) \u201cthere was an arm\u2019s length withdrawal of capital by Respondent and a corresponding investment by the Buyer.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Having thus found a \u201csale,\u201d the Board applied its automatic rule and concluded that the employer had no duty to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">These findings of fact, however, have only the most tenuous connection with the existence in a given case of the kinds of employer interests that the Board itself argued would justify a blanket exemption.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The employer\u2019s duty to bargain may cost him time and it may threaten the confidentiality of his negotiations; these problems exist whether he is negotiating a subcontract, a sale, or a franchise. But these costs can hardly be said to increase because \u201ctitle\u201d passes, because day-to-day management changes hands, because he used the words \u201cbuyer\u201d and \u201cseller,\u201d or even necessarily because capital is withdrawn by the employer and invested by the \u201cbuyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">And, if <em>Fibreboard\u2019s </em>analysis is applied, these findings of fact are even less adequate. They omit many facts neeessary to a determination of the employer\u2019s interests, and they shed no light at all on the employees\u2019 interests. Indeed, the most significant difference between this case and <em>Fibreboard </em>is probably the choice of forms made by the draftsmen who prepared the documents.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">I think the Board\u2019s action under review amounts virtually to an invitation to employers to circumvent <em>Fibreboard. </em>I therefore respectfully dissent from this Court\u2019s affirmance of that action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-5\">.

Having held, however, that \u201cpartial closings\u201d could, under certain circumstances, constitute violations of \u00a7 8(a) (3), the Court did not consider such actions under the other prohibitions of \u00a7 8(a). <em>See id. </em>at 367 n. 5, 85 S.Ct. 994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\">. 191 N.L.R.B. No. 149 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">These findings raise an additional problem, less important only because it is limited to the case before us. The last three are only questionably supported by the record, which in relevant part consists solely of the \u201cagreement\u201d \u2014 which establishes a close symbiotic relationship between GM and the retailer \u2014 with all prices deleted. Joint Appendix 240-63. The agreement includes a franchise agreement, a sublease of the real property, and a sale of the personal property. If the franchise is removed, the sublease may be cancelled by either party, <em>see </em>Joint Appendix 243, and the franchisee may exercise his option to sell the personal property back to GJ1. Joint Appendix 252.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"ABy\">. <em>See </em>text accompanying note 8 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"aac-dedup-0\">. In <em>Fibreboard </em>the Court found it unnecessary to discuss the precise nature of the agreement \u2014 thus suggesting the insignificance of this factor. But one may speculate as to whether the cleaning equipment formerly used by the company employees was conditionally leased or sold to the subcontractor. Compare that possibility with the instant arrangement, set forth in note 13 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
