Howmet Corp., 466 F.2d 1249 (9th Cir. 1972). There, as here, we were faced with employer successorship; closure of one plant; efforts of the bargaining representative at the closed plant to enforce its contract as to its members employed at a second plant in disregard of that plant\u2019s bargaining representative and contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">There we held that under these circumstances arbitration should not be compelled, because \u201cAn award issued by the arbitrator which gave the Union any relief on these issues would, we believe, foster rather than alleviate industrial disharmony by forcing the employer to arbitrate with one union issues which touched the very heart of the employer\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with another union.\u201d 466 F.2d at 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-21\">Reversed and remanded with instructions that these proceedings be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
