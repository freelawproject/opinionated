Under the contract executed on April 19, 1962, between Dear-born and Builders, an assignment of Dearborn\u2019s accounts receivable to Builders was made and two of Builders\u2019 employees were put in charge of Dear-born\u2019s operations. Appellant Mueller was the principal officer so designated and it appears clear to us, as it did to the District Judge, that he had absolute power of control of the operations of Dearborn during the critical times involved here (although we note appellant\u2019s vigorous denial that he ever exercised all of these powers). It also appears that he had knowledge of the fact that Dearborn was in default in payments of taxes withheld from its employees and due to be paid to the United States government (although it is likewise clear that appellant did not make out the tax returns or actually determine priority of payments on debts).</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">Dearborn went into bankruptcy and the government realized only 41.5% of its tax claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">The case was tried before a District Judge who entered detailed findings of fact in general accord with the description of the case set out above. The District Judge dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint and entered judgment on the government\u2019s cross-complaint for $196,283 against both Builders and Mueller.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-9\">Appellant contends that the District Court\u2019s holding that appellant was liable to the United States for failure to cause payment to the United States of the Dearborn employees\u2019 withholding and social security taxes was erroneous as a matter of law. He also contends that the District Court\u2019s findings that appellant was under a duty to collect and pay over said taxes and willfully failed to do so were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-12\">He also contends that the District Judge erred in admission of a C.P.A.\u2019s testimony which was privileged under Michigan law and that he failed properly to compute the amount (if any) which was due on the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-13\">We find no substance to appellant\u2019s contentions that the findings of the District Court were clearly erroneous. We find no prejudicial error in the District Judge\u2019s rulings on admission of evidence, nor in the computation of the judgment. We note that the last issue was not raised before the District Court, and in any event, is without legal merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-14\">We believe that the findings and conclusions of law of the District Judge clearly implied that appellant was a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of 26 U.S. C. \u00a7 6671(b) (1970). But we believe appellant also disputes whether he could legally be held to be such a person under \u00a7 6671(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore liable under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672, which contains this definition:</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-15\"><em>(b) Person defined. </em>\u2014 The term \u201cperson\u201d, as used in this subchapter, includes an officer or employee of a corporation, or a member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer, employee, or member is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-17\">This language does not by its specific words apply to appellant Mueller. He clearly was not an officer or employee of the corporation which owed these taxes. The government concedes this but claims that under settled case law the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>have expanded this definition to include someone who by a contract is given the full power of control associated with the powers of a corporate officer. In this respect the government relies upon Pacific National Insurance Co. v. United States, 422 F.2d 26 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 937, 90 S.Ct. 1838, 26 L.Ed.2d 269 (1970), and United States v. Graham, 309 F.2d 210 (9th Cir. 1962). This court has dealt with this same statute (and cited the <em>Pacific National Insurance </em>case) in Braden v. United States, 442 F.2d 342 (6th Cir. 1971). It does not appear, however, that we have passed on the question of interpreting the statutory definition of a \u201cperson\u201d to include persons actually in control of a corporation, although only as de facto officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">The definition of \u201cperson\u201d employed by Congress is not phrased in terms of exclusion. The language, \u201cThe term \u2018person\u2019 . . . includes an officer or employee of a corporation, or a member or employee of a partnership,\u201d is exemplary in nature. On this point we agree with the following language of the Ninth Circuit:</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">The definition of \u201cpersons\u201d in section 6671(b) indicates that the liability imposed by section 6672 upon those other than the employer is not restricted to the classes of persons specifically listed \u2014 officers or employees of corporations and members or employees of partnerships. \u201c[B]y use of the word \u2018include[s]\u2019 the definition suggests a calculated indefiniteness with respect to the outer limits of the term\u201d defined. First National Bank In Plant City, Plant City, Florida v. Dickinson, 396 U.S. 122, 90 S.Ct. 337, 24 L.Ed.2d 312 (1969). As we said in United States v. Graham, 309 F.2d 210, 212 (9th Cir. 1962): \u201cThe term \u2018person\u2019 does include officer and employee, but certainly does not exclude all others. Its scope is illustrated rather than qualified by the specified examples.\u201d Pacific National Insurance Co. v. United States, <em>supra </em>422 F.2d at 30. (Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-7\">If we turn to the basic section of the Revenue Code which imposes liability, we find support for this interpretation:</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-8\">\u00a7 <em>6672: Failure to collect and pay over tax, or attempt to evade or defeat tax</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-9\">Any person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax, or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-10\">As we read this section, it is squarely addressed to the person or entity responsible for the payment of the withheld taxes. It is knowledge of the tax delinquency and authority over the decision to pay or not to pay the taxes which is at issue \u2014 not who has the duty of filling out the forms. This is the view which numero\u00fas courts have taken, even though the authority possessed by the person did not arise out of any \u201cofficer or employee\u201d status with the \u201cemployer.\u201d United States v. Graham, 309 F.2d 210 (9th Cir. 1962); White v. United States, 372 F.2d 513, 178 Ct.Cl. 765 (1967); United States v. Lawrence, 327 F.Supp. 650 (N.D.Texas 1971); Regan &amp; Co. v. United States, 290 F.Supp. 470 (E.D.N.Y.1968); Walker v. United States, 68-1 U.S.T.C. \u00b6 9370 (W.D.Okl.1968); Melillo v. United States, 244 F.Supp. 323 (E.D.N.Y.1965); National Bank of Commerce of Houston v. Phinney, 65-2 U.S.T.C. \u00b6 9512 (S.D.Texas 1965); Tiffany v. United States, 228 F.Supp. 700 (D.N.J.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-11\">We believe that appellant was a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of 26 U.S. C. \u00a7 6671(b) (1970) who was \u201crequired to . pay over such tax\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 6672, and that he \u201cwillfully\u201d failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>In deciding to endorse this broad interpretation of the statutory definition of a \u201cperson\u201d in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6671(b), and to give \u00a7 6672 the full meaning which we believe Congress intended, we have been conscious of the harsh nature of the penalty provisions as they may affect an individual like appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-4\">The tax sums involved in this proceeding, however, are all definite amounts which have been withheld from employees\u2019 wages in trust for the United States government. Absent stringent measures to protect these funds, they might easily be available to finance a business which was in a hazardous or failing condition. In our judgment Congress intended to prevent this.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1429-10\">. Trial was had before United States District Judge Wade H. McCree, Jr. Judge McCree decided this case, however, after he became a Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, but while serving as a United States District Judge by special designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aat8\">. We note that Congress has dealt specifically with creditor control problems in a statute adopted some years after the tax period involved herein. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3505 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
