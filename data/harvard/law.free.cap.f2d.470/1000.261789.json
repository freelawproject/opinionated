The Board\u2019s decision is reported at 195 N.L.R.B. No. 24. Reference is made to the reported decision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>Board for a detailed recitation of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\">We conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the Board that Spitzer Akron was a successor employer and was obligated to bargain with the Union as the representative of the predecessor employer, all of whom were reemployed by Spitzer Akron. N. L. R. B. v. Burns International Security Services, Inc., 406 U.S. 272, 92 S.Ct. 1571, 32 L.Ed.2d 61 (1972); N. L. R. B. v. Wayne Convalescent Center, Inc., 465 F.2d 1039 (6th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">We further conclude that all other parts of the decision of the Board are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">It is ordered that the decision of the Board be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
