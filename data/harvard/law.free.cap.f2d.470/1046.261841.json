R. Grace &amp; Co., owner of the registration PLUMITE<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for solvents for cleaning drain pipes and plumbing fixtures, opposed appellant\u2019s attempt to register PLUMB OUT. The record establishes that the products of the parties are the same and sustains appellee\u2019s claim to priority by virtue of continuous use by a predecessor-in-title and a licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">It appears from the record that appel-lee\u2019s mark PLUMITE had for many years been used by Dearborn Chemical Company, now a division of appellee, on a drain cleaner; that in 1953 Dearborn granted to Ivano, Inc., an exclusive license to market the product and use the mark thereon. In 1955, Simoniz, Inc. acquired control of Ivano, at which time it was agreed that the former was to be substituted as licensee under the 1953 agreement. Since that time Simoniz has remained the exclusive licensee under the mark. It further appears that from 1953 to date Dearborn and subsequently appellee-opposer have received royalties from their exclusive licensee under the provisions of the license agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">Since priority of use clearly resides with appellee, the only issue is whether appellant\u2019s mark so resembles appellee\u2019s registered mark as to be likely when applied to the goods of appellant to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive. We are impelled by the record to reach the conclusion stated by a majority of the board that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\">When we consider the marks, it is obvious that the term, \u201cPLUMB\u201d and prefix \u201cPLUM\u201d are contractions of the word \u201cplumber\u201d or \u201cplumbing\u201d and therefore highly suggestive of preparations used in plumbing. On the other hand, we must consider the marks of the parties in their entire-ties and when so considered, it is our opinion that \u201cPLUMB OUT\u201d and \u201cPLUMITE\u201d are quite similar in sound. This factor alone could well lead to a likelihood of confusion, particularly where the involved products are over-the-counter items which could be orally requested in hardware or grocery stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-10\">We think it clear that appellant's mark so resembles the mark of appellee as to be likely when applied to appellant\u2019s goods to cause confusion or mistake. The decision of the board sustaining the opposition and refusing registration is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AnNA\">.
