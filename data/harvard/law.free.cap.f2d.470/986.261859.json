We find no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s acceptance of the state findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-19\">The District Court also held that as to any claim for relief that appellant may have by virtue of his lack of knowledge of the specifics of his state right of appeal, appellant has failed to exhaust state remedies. We agree. The California state courts should have an opportunity to rule on appellant\u2019s claim in the light of People v. Acosta, 71 Cal.2d 683, 78 Cal.Rptr. 864, 456 P.2d 136 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
