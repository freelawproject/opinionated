He appeals from the district court\u2019s denial without a hearing of his \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his five-year sentence. We affirm in part and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the prosecution reneged on a plea bargain is without merit as it is based on the statement by his own attorney to him to the effect that a guilty plea would almost insure a term of probation though nothing was guaranteed. There was no evidence of a bargain with the prosecution. The record does not indicate that the plea was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">Nor is there any merit to appellant\u2019s assertion that the trial judge had an obligation to inform him of his right to appeal. Rule 32(a)(2), F.R.Crim.P., provides in part that the court shall advise the defendant of his right to appeal after imposing sentence \u201cin a ease which has gone to trial on a plea of not guilty.\u201d Here, due to Ballinger\u2019s plea of guilty, there was no trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-16\">Finally, appellant urges he was without effective assistance of counsel in that his attorney advised him: \u201cYou can\u2019t appeal a guilty plea.\u201d Since the district court\u2019s order dismissing the petition does not rule on this issue, we remand so that the court may consider this contention.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
