BRYAN, Senior Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b259-27\">Suing under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as tooled by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, Evelyn J. Johnson asked for in-junctive and indemnifying relief against the School Board and Superintendent of' Schools of Russell County, Virginia, for refusal to reemploy her as a teacher, despite her continuous service of 29 years. The point of her complaint is that the defendants, authorized by the State to operate the schools, took this action without first informing her of the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>sons for it and without granting her an opportunity to meet them. This grievance is braced by allegations that the manner of disemployment clashed with the Board\u2019s own regulation as well as State law. She condemns the procedure as odious to 14th Amendment due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The District Court, 327 F.Supp. 471, found that, as is conceded, she was employed only on a one-year basis, without stipulation for tenure. It also found that \u201c[t]he only federally protected right plaintiff claims to be violated by the defendants is \u2018substantive . . . and pretermination procedural due process,\u2019 in other words, protection against discharge except for cause and an administrative hearing prior to termination of employment. The plaintiff disavows the violation of any other federally protected right by the defendants\u201d. In this shape of things, the Court concluded, in agreement with the defendants\u2019 argument, there was no denial of any right, privilege or immunity within the ken of the Civil Rights Act and \u201cno col-orable federal claim\u201d. Hence, the complaint was dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice, for want of [Federal] jurisdiction\u201d, leaving no room for pendent adjudication on the protests under State law and local regulations. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">We reverse on the authority of Supreme Court pronouncements delivered subsequent to the consideration by the District Court: Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), and Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The setting in which the cause came to the District Court was this. Appellant\u2019s career as a teacher in the Russell County Schools extended without break from 1942 until April 13, 1970, when she received a letter from the Superintendent stating that she would not be retained for the 1970-71 session. During her teaching years there was in effect a School Board regulation stipulating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">\u201cIn the event a teacher is not to be given a contract for the succeeding school year, the superintendent or his designated representative must notify the teacher in writing not later than March 15, stating the reasons for his decision. The superintendent shall arrange with any such teacher who desires it a hearing with him and school personnel who have observed the teacher\u2019s work. If the teacher is then dissatisfied with the decision of the superintendent, full and free opportunity shall be granted for an appeal to the school board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">This regulation, the school officials asserted, was superseded by a 1968 Act of the Virginia legislature establishing a uniform and exclusive procedure for the engagement of teachers. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 22-217.1 (Repl.Vol.1969). It prescribed that written notice of nonrenewal of a teacher\u2019s contract must be given on or before April fifteenth, of each year. Id. \u00a7 22-217.4. As the equivalent of \u201ctenure\u201d, the designation of \u201ccontinuing contract\u201d was used. To achieve that status the teacher must serve a probationary term of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">Because at the time of her termination, 1970, appellant had not, and could not, have served the three-year trial period fixed by the 1968 Act, it was assumed that she had not then attained a \u201ccontinuing contract\u201d. The statute was amended in 1969 to allow, \u201cin the discretion of the local school board\u201d, service prior to 1969 to satisfy the probationary term. This option was never exercised in favor of any teacher. Upon completion of probation, teachers would become entitled to continuing contracts \u201cduring good behavior and competent service\u201d. Id. \u00a7 22-217.4. The 1968 enactment also carried the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-13\">\u201c\u00a7 22-217.5. Dismissal of teacher or placing on probation; grounds.\u2014 Teachers may be dismissed or placed on probation for the following rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>sons; Ineompetency, immorality, noncompliance with school laws and regulations, disability as shown by competent medical evidence, or for other good and just cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201c\u00a7 22-217.6 Same; notice to teacher. \u2014 Written notice setting forth the reasons for dismissal or placing on probation and a statement that the teacher may request a hearing before the school board within fifteen days after receiving the notice must be sent to the teacher. A personal interview with the teacher stating the reason for dismissal or placing on probation may be employed in lieu of such written notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201c\u00a7 22-217.7. Same; hearing. \u2014 The hearing before the school board, which shall be private unless the teacher requests a public one, must be set within thirty days of the request, and the teacher must be given at least fifteen days\u2019 written notice of the time and place. At the hearing the teacher may appear with or without counsel and be heard, presenting testimony of witnesses and other evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201c\u00a7 22-217.8. Same; decision of school board. \u2014 The school board shall give the teacher its written decision within five days after the hearing, together with a copy of the transcript of the proceedings, which shall be furnished without cost. A majority vote of the school board is necessary for dismissal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">These four sections, appellees argue, do not apply to nonrenewals but solely to dismissals, emphasizing that Evelyn Johnson was not dismissed. Furthermore, they argue, these provisions cover continuing contract teachers alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">. Appellant pleaded she had rendered \u201cfaithful and competent service\u201d. This allegation the school authorities traversed. She denounced the school officials\u2019 action as irreparably damaging her professional reputation and thereby crippling her ability to earn a livelihood, since teaching was her only occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">We do not resolve these disputes, reciting them only to depict the environment of appellant\u2019s resort to the 14th Amendment. This restraint seems peculiarly fitting since the trial court reached decision exclusively upon the absence of a Federal question. However, we do look to the existence of these controversies to see if they tendered problems demanding consideration of the Amendment in their solution, and thus established a Federal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\"> In this canvass, we find <em>Sindermcmn </em>and <em>Roth, </em>supra, both declaring that injury to professional reputation or livelihood caused by an abrupt termination of an engagement of substantial longevity warrants an inquiry upon whether the means pursued satisfied constitutional due process. These decisions avouch that continuous employment over a significant period of time \u2014such as appellant\u2019s 29 years \u2014 can amount to the equivalent of tenure. When it does, dissolution of the relationship requires prior \u201cnotice and an opportunity to be heard\u201d, or else due process is wanting. Hence, because of her long school connection and the failure of the Board and Superintendent, acting as State representatives, to accord appellant due process, Evelyn Johnson\u2019s charges could rise to 14th Amendment magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">In Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), a professor was appointed to the faculty of a State university on the express understanding that his employment would commence September 1, 1968 and end June 30, 1969. Upon completion of his term th\u00e9 professor was duly notified he would not be rehired for the next academic year. Admittedly without tenure status, he sued in the Federal District Court charging that the determination not to retain him for the following year \u201cinfringed his 14th Amendment rights\u201d. Particularly, he charged that the failure of the University to inform him of the reasons for this action and to afford him a chance to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>heard thereon abrogated his right to procedural due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The Supreme Court ruled that under these facts the professor had no constitutional right to what he sought. \u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s procedural protection of property is a safeguard of the security of interests that a person has already acquired in specific benefits\u201d, said the Court. Although, it continued, in the instant circumstances \u201cthe [professor] surely had an abstract concern in being rehired, ... he did not have a <em>property </em>interest sufficient to require the University authorities to give him a hearing when they declined to renew his contract of employment\u201d. Id. at 578, 92 S.Ct. at 2710.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Nevertheless, the Court impliedly recognized that, even without tenure, if the nonrenewal could \u201cseriously damage his [the professor\u2019s] standing and associations in his community.\u201d Id. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707, his due process claims would be sound. \u201cFor \u2018[w]here a person\u2019s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him, notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential.\u2019 In such a case, due process would accord an opportunity to refute the charge before University officials.\u201d Id. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707 (citations omitted). That is precisely the appellant teacher\u2019s assertion in respect to the school officials\u2019 refusal to renew her engagement of 29 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In Perry v. Sindermann, supra, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), a professor had been employed in a State college system for 10 successive years under annual contracts. Without explanation or hearing, the Regents voted not to renew his contract. In a suit, rested on the 14th Amendment, the professor attributed the Regents\u2019 action to his public criticism of the college administration, thus constituting an intrusion upon his right to freedom of speech. Additionally, he asserted that the failure to give an opportunity for a hearing \u201cviolated the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of procedural due process\u201d. Id. at 595, 92 S.Ct. at 2696.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u201cThe first question presented\u201d, said the Supreme Court, \u201cis whether the [professor\u2019s] lack of a <em>contractual </em>or tenure right to re-employment, taken alone, defeats his claim that the nonre-newal of his contract violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. We hold that it does not.\u201d Id. (accent added). Again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u201cA written contract with an explicit tenure provision clearly is evidence of a formal understanding that supports a teacher\u2019s claim of entitlement to continued employment unless sufficient \u2018cause\u2019 is shown. Yet absence of such an explicit contractual provision may not always foreclose the possibility that a teacher has a \u2018property\u2019 interest in re-employment. For example, the law of contracts in most, if not all, jurisdictions long has employed a process by which agreements, though not formalized in writing, may be \u2018implied\u2019.\u201d Id. at 601, 92 S.Ct. at 2699 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">\u201cA teacher, like the [professor], who has held his position for a number of years, might be able to show from the circumstances of this service \u2014and from other relevant facts \u2014 that he has a legitimate claim ... to job tenure. Just as this Court has found there to be a \u2018common law of a particular industry or of a particular plant\u2019 that may supplement a collective-bargaining agreement, so there may be an unwritten \u2018common law\u2019 in a particular university that certain employees shall have the equivalent of tenure.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">The case was remanded to give the professor an opportunity to prove his entitlement to continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">These authoritative enunciations confirm Evelyn Johnson\u2019s protests of 14th Amendment deprivations as securely pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">In summary, we do not decide whether the school authorities did or did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>not have a right, power or cause not to rehire appellant Johnson. We hold only that she stated a cause of action on the 14th Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. The judgment of dismissal will be vacated and the case remanded for trial on the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-28\">. \u00a7 1983.

The majority relies on Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), and Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). As I can agree with the first, but not the second, basis of the remand, I feel compelled to state separately my concurrence and the rationale of my disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">In Board of Regents v. Roth, <em>supra, </em>408 U.S. at 569, 92 S.Ct. at 2705, the Supreme Court noted that, \u201cThe requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed within the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of liberty and property.\u201d The Court then proceeded to analyze the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cproperty,\u201d and to discuss the application of each concept with respect to a nontenured teacher whose contract is not renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">I. PROPERTY</p>\n<p id=\"Axc\">In <em>Roth, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">\u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s procedural protection of property is a safeguard of the security of interests that a person has already acquired in specific benefits.\u201d 408 U.S. at 576, 92 S.Ct. at 2708.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">\u201cTo have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. <em>He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) 408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2709.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">The Court noted that \u201cproperty interests\u201d are not created by the Constipa\u2014 tion, but, \u201cRather, they are created ariS their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.\u201d 408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709. The teacher there involved, David Roth, had been appointed to the faculty of Wisconsin State University with the express understanding that his employment would begin September 1, 1968, and end June 30, 1969. Since Wisconsin law and the terms of Roth\u2019s appointment would support no claim of entitlement to reemployment, the Court concluded that he had shown no constitutionally protected \u201cproperty\u201d interest in being rehired, and thus was not entitled to procedural due process upon the decision not to renew his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">The Court had occasion to apply the principles set forth in <em>Roth </em>in Perry v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Sindermann, <em>supra, </em>408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570. The teacher, Robert Sindermann, had taught in the state college system of Texas for ten successive years under annual contracts. The Board of Regents of the junior college where Sindermann taught voted not to offer him a contract for the next academic year. Sindermann brought suit in the district court alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the failure to provide him an opportunity for a hearing violated due process. The district court granted summary judgment against Sindermann. The court of appeals reversed, holding that despite Sindermann\u2019s lack of tenure, the failure to allow him an opportunity for a hearing would violate due process if he could show that he had an \u201cexpectancy\u201d of re-employment. The court of appeals ordered exploration of this factual issue upon remand. Sindermann v. Perry, 430 F.2d 939 (5 Cir. 1970). The Supreme Court affirmed the result reached by the Fifth Circuit, but, apparently, did not wholly agree with its opinion. The Court held that a mere subjective \u201cexpectancy\u201d is <em>not </em>a property interest and thus is not protected by procedural due process. However, the Court noted that Sindermann had alleged that his interest in continued employment, though not secured by a formal contractual tenure provision, was secured by a no less binding understanding fostered by the college administration. Sindermann had claimed that the college had a <em>de facto </em>tenure program and that he had tenure under that program; also, that he and others had relied upon provisions of the college\u2019s Faculty Guide and upon guidelines promulgated by the Coordinating Board of the Texas College and University System, all of which might tend to show some form of job tenure. The Court stated, \u201cThus [Sindermann] offered to prove that a teacher, with his long period of service, at this particular State College had no less a \u2018property\u2019 interest in continued employment than a formally tenured teacher at other colleges, and had no less a procedural due process right to a statement of reasons and a hearing before college officials upon their decision not to retain him.\u201d 408 U.S. at 601, 92 S.Ct. at 2699.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In <em>Sindermann </em>the Court concluded that, \u201c[A]bsence of ... an explicit contractual [tenure] provision may not always foreclose the possibility that a teacher has a \u2018property\u2019 interest in reemployment,\u201d 408 U.S. at 601, 92 S.Ct. at 2699, and ordered that Sindermann be given a chance to show that \u201cthe policies and practices of the institution\u201d were as he had alleged. The Court again noted that property interests are created by state law and warned, \u201cIf it is the law of Texas that a teacher in [Sinder-mann\u2019s] position has no contractual or other claim to job tenure, [his] claim would be defeated.\u201d 408 U.S. at 602, n. 7, 92 S.Ct. at 2700.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Referring to both <em>Sindermann </em>and <em>Roth, </em>my brothers state, \u201cThese decisions avouch that continuous employment over a significant period of time \u2014such as appellant\u2019s 29 years \u2014 can amount to the equivalent of tenure.\u201d If my brothers intend by their statement to say that those opinions positively assert this conclusion I would be inclined to disagree, but the Court\u2019s opinions might be so interpreted as to provide some support for it. The teacher\u2019s allegations in the instant case seem to me to be sufficient to show the possible existence, in light of all the circumstances,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the \u201cequivalent of tenure.\u201d Therefore, I join in remanding to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">II. LIBERTY</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">My brothers state, \u201c[W]e find <em>Sinder-mann </em>and <em>Roth, supra, </em>both declaring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>that injury to professional reputation or livelihood caused by an abrupt termination of an engagement of substantial longevity warrants an inquiry upon whether the means pursued satisfied constitutional due process.\u201d I cannot agree. I find nothing in <em>Sindermann </em>which can be so interpreted. And, as I read <em>Roth, </em>the Supreme Court did not so <em>declare. </em>Rather the court of appeals in <em>Roth </em>had so held, but the Supreme Court neither affirmed nor expressly disapproved this holding. The Court did, however, strongly indicate that a mere failure to renew a nontenured teacher\u2019s contract, <em>standing alone, </em>would not suffice to raise a constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The Court said in <em>Roth </em>that it had not attempted to define \u201cliberty\u201d with exactness, but that some of the \u201cincluded things\u201d have been definitely stated, and, \u201cThere might be eases in which a State refused to re-employ a person under such circumstances that interests in liberty would be implicated.\u201d 408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. Two examples were given:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">(1) Where a person\u2019s \u201c \u2018good name, reputation, honor or integrity,\u2019 \u201d 408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707, is at stake. But the Court concluded that on the facts in <em>Roth </em>there was no suggestion that the teacher\u2019s interest in his good name, reputation, honor or integrity was involved since the State, in declining to rehire him, made no charges against him (such as dishonesty or immorality) which might damage his standing in his community; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">(2) Where the State, in declining to re-employ a teacher, \u201cimposed on him a stigma or other disability that foreclosed his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.\u201d 408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. The State had imposed no \u201cstigma\u201d on Roth, however, nor had it imposed on him any \u201cother disability\u201d since, \u201cThe State, for example, did not invoke any regulations to bar [him] from all other public employment in State universities.\u201d 408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">The Court discussed the <em>assumption </em>by the district court in <em>Roth </em>that nonre-tention <em>alone </em>would create \u201c \u2018concrete and practical difficulties for a professor in his subsequent academic career,\u2019 \u201d 408 U.S. at 574, n. 13, 92 S.Ct. at 2707, and the <em>argument </em>of the court of appeals that, \u2018\u201c[T]he substantial adverse effect non-retention is likely to have upon the career interests of an individual professor\u2019 amounts to a limitation on future employment opportunities sufficient to invoke procedural due process guaranties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">\u201c[E]ven assuming <em>arguendo </em>that such a \u2018substantial adverse effect\u2019 under these circumstances would constitute a state imposed restriction on liberty, the record contains no support for these assumptions. There is no suggestion of how nonretention might affect [Roth\u2019s] future employment prospects. <em>Mere proof, for example, that his record of nonretention in one job, taken alone, might make him somewhat less attractive to some other employers would hardly establish the kind of foreclosure of opportunities amounting to a deprivation of \u2018liberty\u2019.\u201d </em>408 U.S. at 574, n. 13, 92 S.Ct. at 2708. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">The conclusion to me seems clear. To sufficiently state a constitutional claim of denial of \u201cliberty,\u201d a nontenured teacher whose contract has not been renewed must plead either that his \u201cgood name, reputation, honor or integrity\u201d has been damaged by, in addition to the nonrenewal, the assignment of reasons for the nonrenewal, or he must plead that the State has imposed on him some \u201cstigma\u201d or \u201cother disability,\u201d in addition to the nonrenewal, which foreclosed his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities. The teacher in the instant case has alleged nothing which might harm her reputation or which might interfere with her ability to get another job except the nonrenewal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>itself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, in my view, she has not made out a constitutional claim in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In Chitwood v. Feaster, 468 F.2d 359 (4 Cir. 1972), this court had before it the appeal of several nontenured teachers whose contracts were not renewed by Fairmont State College in West Virginia. The teachers asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that they should have been given notice of nonrenewal, a statement of reasons and an administrative hearing before the decision not to renew became final. The district court had granted summary judgment against the teachers. In their brief to this court the teachers asserted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">\u201c[T]he complaint provided that \u00e1s a result of defendants\u2019 actions, plaintiffs had been subject to public ridicule and scorn, suffered injury to their professional reputations, had been \u2018deprived of employment, had lost their earning capacity, had incurred expenses, and had suffered emotional stress and . . . pain and suffering.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Despite these allegations in the teachers\u2019 complaint, this court (opinion by Chief Judge Haynsworth) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201cThe [procedural due process] contention has been <em>foreclosed </em>by a subsequent decision of the Supreme Court in Board of Regents v. Roth .... These teachers were not tenured and there was no basis for any reasonable expectancy of permanent employment. While the college might have dealt with them more frankly, under <em>Roth, </em>they had no constitutional right to a statement of reasons for the failure to renew their contracts or to an opportunity for an administrative hearing.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Chitwood v. Feaster, <em>supra, </em>468 F.2d 359, 360.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">In so holding, this court did not deem it necessary to even mention the teachers\u2019 allegations of injury to their professional reputations.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">To the extent that the participating judges of this court in Chitwood v. Feaster were of the view that the teachers had not successfully raised a procedural due process issue, the opinion there might be interpreted as conflicting with the view of my brothers in the instant case and their interpretation of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Roth.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\">. The school board\u2019s regulation (perhaps even if superseded by state statute), and the teacher\u2019s allegation (not mentioned in the majority opinion) that, \u201cBy their remarks to pilaintiff and her friends, defendants induced her to believe that she would receive some tyxio of teaching position for the 1970-71 school year,\u201d might provide additional support for her argument that she had an implied contract amounting, under Virginia law, to <em>de facto </em>tenure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">. The teacher\u2019s complaint stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">10. Plaintiff has been unemployed for the 1970-71 school year, and the County School Board\u2019s failure to renew her contract under the circumstances above set forth after 29 years of faithful and competent service accepted by said Board, irreparably has damaged her professional reputation and irreparably has impaired her ability to earn a livelihood, since teaching is the only occupation in which she has substantial experience.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
