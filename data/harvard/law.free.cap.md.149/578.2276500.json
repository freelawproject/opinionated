With a view to the exercise of his riparian rights under Section 185CO, he prepared for the erection of several weirs in the bay along the shore line of his property, and had purchased a large quantity of materials to be used for that purpose, when the appellant, without giving the notice required by the law, constructed a weir, and was proceeding to erect another, in Fishing Bay, opposite the appellee\u2019s land and within four hundred yards of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the shore. In this suit for a mandatory injunction to compel the removal of the appellant\u2019s weirs, the question, raised by the demurrer to the bill of complaint, is whether the statute conferring the riparian fishing right asserted in the bill is constitutional. The appeal is from an order overruling the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The first contention is that' the title of the act does not conform to the provision of section 29 of article 3 of the State Constitution, that \u201cevery law enacted by the General Assembly shall embrace but one subject and that shall be described' in its title.\u201d The statute is entitled as follows: \u201cAn Act to add a new section to article 10 of the Code of Public Laws of Maryland, title \u2018Dorchester County,\u2019 said section to be known as section 18500, to follow immediately after section 1850 of said article, and to be under sub-title \u2018Eish.\u2019 \u201d There is no difficulty in holding this title to be sufficient; It has been repeatedly decided that a correct title description of an act by Code article and section designations is a compliance with the constitutional requirement. <em>Todd v. Frostburg, </em>141 Md. 693; <em>Key v. Key, </em>134 Md. 418; <em>Rugles v. State, </em>120 Md. 564; <em>Worcester County v. School Commissioners, </em>113 Md. 307; <em>Kingan Packing Asso. v. Lloyd, </em>110 Md. 619; <em>Anne Arundel County v. United Railway Co., </em>109 Md. 377; <em>Barron v. Smith, </em>108 Md. 317; <em>Himmel v. Eichengreen, </em>107 Md. 610; <em>Garrison v. Hill, </em>81 Md. 551; <em>Lankford v. Somerset County, </em>73 Md. 118; <em>German Building Assoc. v. Newman, </em>50 Md. 62. The title here in question describes the act as incorporating a new section, with a specified number, in the Code article relating to. Dorchester County, and under a sub-title indicating accurately the general subject of the legislation. It was not necessary that the title should be more explicit in its description of the statute. The omission of the word \u201cLocal\u201d from the reference to the Code in the title could not have caused any doubt that the Code of Public Local Laws was meant, in view of the other descriptive terms employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">It is further contended that the act violates the constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>tional right, of citizens to the equal protection of the laws. There is said to he an invalid discrimination against the general public, and in favor of riparian land owners, with respect to the privilege of constructing weirs in the waters of Fishing Bay. The pre-emption by any one of a part of tbe bay for that purpose excludes others from the exercise of a similar privilege at the same point during the period of the occupation, hut the opportunity of every citizen to acquire or enjoy such an individual advantage is said to be protected, by the Federal and State \u2019Constitutions from any legislative interference which is designed to benefit a particular class of citizens. This theory, if sound, would he equally available against a number of existing laws giving priority of tide-water fishing rights to riparian proprietors, the following statutes having such effects are cited in the appellee\u2019s brief: Acts of 1922, ch. 207; 1920, ch. 361; 1910, ch. 141; 1906, ch. 527; 1890, ch. 89; 1874, ch. 219; 1872, ch. 292; Code, art. 39, secs. 68, 70. But in our opinion the statute now under consideration is free of constitutional objection. It was passed in the exercise of the State\u2019s power to regulate and control its fisheries, consistently with the right of navigation. <em>McCready v. Virginia, </em>94 U. S. 391; <em>Smith v. State, </em>18 Howard, 75; <em>Hughes v. State, </em>87 Md. 298. The Legislature could prohibit altogether the use of fish nets or weirs in Maryland waters. <em>State v. Applegarth, </em>81 Md. 293. It can prescribe the conditions under which such fishing methods may he used. The privilege can be validly restricted to the citizens of a county with respect to the waters within its boundaries. <em>Cox v. Revelle, </em>125 Md. 587. It was held in <em>Phipps v. State, </em>22 Md. 380, that a statute was valid which authorized, upon certain conditions, \u201cany citizen of any county bordering on the waters of the State, to locate and appropriate within the waters thereof any area not exceeding one acre, for the purpose of depositing and bedding oysters * * The constitutionality of the statute was challenged, as stated in the opinion, \u201con the ground that it confers special and exclusive privileges inconsistent with, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>in derogation of the common right of free fishery in the waters of the State.\u201d But the Court said: \u201cThe power of the Legislature to authorize the erection of wharves and the reclamation of land from the water, for the purpose of encouraging navigation and commerce, has never been questioned, notwithstanding the effect has been to confer privileges and advantages wholly private and exclusive in their character. And there appears to be no substantial reason why it may not, in like manner, grant privileges, affording particular and exclusive 'benefits, for the purpose of increasing generally the product and value of the common right of fishery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">A different principle is sought to be applied to this case on the theory that the priority of weir privilege given by the statute to the riparian owners is not conducive to the preservation of the fisheries for the public benefit. It may, however, be the policy of the statute, by stimulating activity on the part of the owners of riparian lands in the use of the adjacent bay fisheries, to increase their product for public consumption. But the immediate and evident purpose of the act is to regulate the location of stationary nets and weirs in the waters of the bay. As the employment of such fishery methods by the public is permitted, and involves the exclusive use, for considerable periods, of particular water areas, it was competent for the Legislature to regulate such appropriations of portions of the State\u2019s domain. No one is prohibited by the statute from placing weirs in the bay, but with respect to the question of priority among competitors for the same locations, the provision that one owning the neighboring shore should have preference does not seem unreasonable. In giving to riparian owners the initial option to select and occupy weir locations in front of their properties, the act preserves equality among the members of that class of land owners, and makes no arbitrary discrimination against other citizens. It leaves to the general public the unrestricted privilege of fishing in the waters of the bay except by the use of weirs within four hundred yards of the shore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>and at points occupied by the weirs of the riparian land owners. In our opinion the act does not disregard any constitutional limitation in conferring upon such owners the priority of privilege which it defines, and we agree with the lower court in its conclusion that the statute is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs, and case remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
