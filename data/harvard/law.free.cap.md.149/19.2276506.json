The issue of fact at the trial was whether the plaintiff had agreed to regard the- defendant\u2019s assignees of his leasehold interest as being responsible for the rent accruing after the assignment, and had accepted in full and final, settlement with the defendant a check which he gave the plaintiff for the month\u2019s rent due when the assignees took possession. By the verdict of the jury that issue was decided in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. There are six exceptions in the record. Eive were taken because of certain rulings on the admissibility of evidence, and one because of the court\u2019s refusal to withdraw the case from the wry-</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The first exception relates to the Admission of the lease-in evidence. Its introduction was opposed on the theory that it had been materially altered by the plaintiff after its-execution. The testimony on that subject showed that the words, \u201cLease\u201d and \u201c8 East Lexington Street\u201d were written at the top -of the paper after it was signed, and that several weeks before the trial, a pencil mark was drawn by the plaintiff through the word \u201cAgent\u201d appearing in the lease after his name as lessor. It was explained that the mark was made when the plaintiff was directing his stenographer to make copies of the lease form, emitting the word \u201cAgent,\u201d for use in contracting with other tenants. There was no pretense by the plaintiff that he was not described as agent in the-lease when it was signed. It is clear that the line through the word \u201cAgent\u201d has no significance as an intended alteration. Tht penciled words at the top- of the paper obviously have-no such effect. It was proved that the- title to- the- leased premises is in the Chesapeake Realty Company, a corporation, but that the plaintiff owns all of its capital stock. The-lease was signed by the- plaintiff individually, and he acted, and apparently was recognized by the defendant, as the land<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>lord in. his own right. All of the cheeks for the monthly installments of rent, except one given after the institution of the suit, were drawn to the plaintiff\u2019s individual order. Under the circumstances, the trial court was of the opinion that the use of the word \u201cAgent\u201d in the lease made no practical difference so far as the issue involved in the suit was concerned. There is no ground of reversal in the ruling by which the court- allowed the lease to be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The second exception was reserved because the plaintiff was permitted to use, for the purpose of refreshing his memory, some entries, which he had made in his account book, showing the payments of rent by the defendant and thus indicating the extent to which the rent was in arrears. There was no dispute as to the amounts and periods of the payments. The ruling on this point is unobjectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The third and fourth exceptions were correct for the reasons we have stated in disposing of the first exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">A carbon copy of a letter from the plaintiff to the defendant was admitted in evidence, after the mailing of the original to him at his place of business had been proved by the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, and after the defendant and his counsel had denied having it in their possession. The defendant had testified that lie did not remember receiving the letter. A sufficient foundation was laid for the proof and admission of the copy, and a prior and formal notice to produce was unnecessary, because it would have been futile in view of the statements made by the defendant and his counsel. <em>Union Banking Co. v. </em>Gittings, 45 Md. 181. The objection to the copy of the letter as evidence was properly overruled. <em>Goodman v. </em>Saperstein 115 Md. 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">ISTo reference is made in the appellant\u2019s brief to the sixth exception, relating to the refusal of the court to withdraw the case from the jury. The admitted evidence was clearly sufficient to justify the submission of the case to the jury for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">\n<em>Judgment a-ffirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
