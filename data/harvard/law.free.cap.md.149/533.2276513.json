The -alleged libel was in the following letter, signed and sent by the defendant to a merchant of the City of New York, a creditor of the plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">\u201cNovember 21, 1922.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">\u201cMr. Leon I.

Lake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">\u201cLWL :D.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">To the declaration, in which the letter was. sent out in full, the defendant filed a general issue plea and a plea of justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">In the trial of the case three exceptions were taken to the rulings of the court, two upon the evidence and one on the prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the court, at the request of the defendant, directed a verdict for him on the ground that the plaintiff had offered no evidence legally sufficient to entitle her to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">The court below, as we gather from a statement made by him, found in the record, hold that the letter was a qualified privileged communication, with the burden upon the plain-1 iff to show malice on the part of the defendant, and finding there1 was no evidence or malice legally sufficient to go to the jury, the case wa:s withdrawn from its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">The privilege in this case is certainly not more than a qualified privilege;, as held by the court below, nor do we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>understand that anything more is claimed for it by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">It is said in 17 <em>R. C. </em>L. 341, that \u201ca communication made in good faith on any subject matter in which the person communicating has an interest, or in reference to which he has a duty, is privileged if made to a person having a- corresponding interest or duty, even though it contains matters which, without this privilege, would be actionable. * * * A publication loses its character as privileged, and is actionable, on proof of actual malice, or, at least such gross disregard of the rights of the person injured as is equivalent to malice in fact. In the case of a qualified privileged communication the occasion on which it was made rebuts the inference <em>ptima facie </em>arising from a statement prejudicial to the * * * plaintiff, and puts the burden on him to prove that there was malice in fact.\u201d <em>Maurice v. Worden, </em>54 Md. 233; <em>Beeler v. Jackson, </em>64 Md. 593; <em>Fresh v. Cutter, </em>73 Md. 87; <em>Brinsfield v. Howeth, </em>107 Md. 278; <em>Jump v. Barnes, </em>139 Md. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Malice, as here used, \u201cin its legal sense means a wrongful act, done intentionally, or with evil intent, without just cause or excuse, or as a result of ill will. Malice does not necessarily imply spite against any individual, but rather, in many instances, merely a wanton disposition grossly negligent of the rights of others.\u201d 17 <em>R. C. L. </em>321.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The appellant, who' had been in business in Leonardtown. Maryland, for a number of years, moved to&gt; Baltimore, where she, in 1922 was engaged in the \u201cladies ready-to-wear cloaks, suits and dress business\u201d at '2227 E. Monument Street. At times she purchased goods from the Juliet Cloak Company of Mew York.' In one of its shipments to her she was not satisfied with the goods and would not receive them, but after being told by the company that they would be sold at auction if not received by her, she sought counsel and was advised by him to adjust the matter if she could, which she did through her attorney, co-operating with the appellant, the company\u2019s attorney, whereby a small reduction was made from.the amount originally charged for the goods, and it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>arranged that the amount so agreed, upon should be paid in monthly installments, which is shown to have been paid as fellows: One hundred dollars on August 29th, 1922, seventy-five dollars on September 29th, 1922, seventy-five dollars on October 30th, 192<em>2 </em>and the balance, seventy dollars and thirty cents, which was due on November 29th, on the 9th of December, 1922. It seems, however, that suit had been brought upon this claim, about the time of the adjustment, by the company, through the appellee as its attorney, and such suit was pending during the period covered by said payments. The appellant, desiring to discontinue business in Baltimore City and to return with her husband, an invalid, to Leonardtown, where she intended again to- resume business, on the 20th day of September, 1922, entered into an agreement with Bebecea Keisner and S. Harry Koisner, who were represented by S. S. Levin and Israel Gomb\u00f3rov, their attorneys, to sell unto them her \u201centire business including all fixtures and the balance of her lease on the store and garage,\u201d for the sum of twenty-nine hundred dollars, of which amount she was paid five hundred dollars in cash, and the balance was to he paid \u201con the date of settlement, Tuesday, September 26th, 1922,\u201d at which time and upon payment of the balance of the pui'ehase money the transfer of the property was to ho made \u201cin accordance with the sales in hulk act.\u201d As the sale of the stock of goods and merchandise came within the provisions of said act, the. purchasers were furnished a. list \u201ccontaining the names and addresses of all the creditors of said vendor, together with the amount of indebtedness duo or owing by said vendor to each of such creditors.\u201d The aggregate indebtedness to\u00a1 the creditors, as shown by the list, amounted to thirteen hundred eighty-nine dollars and fifty-eight cents, not including a claim of the United Cloak and Suit Company of one hundred ten dollars and seventy-five cents, the correctness, of which was disputed by the plaintiff, and upon which suit was then pending in the Superior Court of Baltimore City. Eor some reason, not shown by the record, the balance of said purchase money was never paid and the property was. never transferred to the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"AXX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The appellee, when called upon by the appellant to explain why he had written the letter to Wachtel, said \u201cI sent the letter, but Gomborov and Levin are in back of this.\u201d The appellant\u2019s husband, who heard the conversation between his wife and the appellee, in giving his version of it, said that the appellee, in reply to his wife\u2019s question as to why he wrote the letter, stated, \u201cI will be honest with you,\u201d and \u201che picked up a piece of paper off of his desk and he says, \u2018You recognize this\u2019 ?\u201d It was the list of the creditors of the appellant already mentioned, and the appellee then said \u201cWell, I have got it here. Here is where I got that information. I have been tricked in by Mr. Samuel Levin and Gomborov.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Mr. Louis Schapiro testified that Mrs. Deekelman, the appellant, showed him a letter written to one of her Mew York creditors (Wachtel) by the appellee, and that he spoke to the latter regarding it, and asked him on what information the letter was written, and he replied, \u201cMr. Levin came to him stating that he represented a, certain party on a case against Mrs. Deekelman (the appellant) and on certain information that Mr. Levin gave to him he wrote that letter. Mow, what that information was T do not know.\u201d And, when asked if that was the only reason given he said, \u201cThat is the only reason that I can recall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">It was on the 21st day of November, 1922, after three of the installments had been paid on the claim of the Juliet Cloak Company, the only claim against the appellant, so far as the record discloses, in which the appellee was in anywise interested, and only eight days before the last installment of seventy dollars and thirty cents would become due, that the appellee wrote the letter complained of, having before him at such time the statement containing the names* of her creditors and showing\" the aggregate amount owing to them at the time it was furnished, only a short while before, to be fifteen hundred dollars and thirty-three cents, including the disputed claim of one hundred ten dollars and seventy-five cents, and likewise showing the amount agreed to be paid by Mrs. Keisner and her husband for the stock of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>goods, etc., to he twenty-nine hundred dollars'. In this letter the appellee said that the appellant was \u201cabsolutely insolvent\u201d and that it was necessary to institute the bankruptcy proceedings, suggested by him, \u201cto head off the sheriff in his execution\u201d upon the judgments yet to he recovered in the suits then pending against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">While it is a question for the court whether a; communication, if made in good faith, without malice and in the belief that it was true, i's privileged, if there be evidence tending to show the lack of good faith and actual malice, the plaintiff has the right to have the jury pass on the facts. <em>Jump v. Barnes, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The evidence offered by the plaintiff, including that above stated, reflects, we think, upon the question of the good faith of the appellee in the use of the language prejudicial to the appellant found in the letter, and wa's, in our opinion, sufficient to take the case to the jury upon the question of malice. Especially is this true when considered in connection with the plea of justification interposed by the defendant, in which he, in effect, says, \u201cI wrote the letter and the alleged libelous words found therein are true.\u201d The position of the defendant in this case is not unlike that of the defendant in <em>Jump v. Barnes, supra. </em>In that case the language complained of was. likewise found in a letter written by the defendant. In it he said, \u201cAnother party in town told me he saw the corn and it was rotten when loaded in if, or a good portion of it <em>wa's; </em>he says it was about as bad a lot of corn as he ever saw loaded to be sent to the market for salo.\u201d Judge Boyd, speaking for the Court, said, \u201cIf he (the defendant) wanted to he fair and justify his own conduct, he ought at least to have explained who it was, and produce him as a witness, if he could, instead of asking to have the ease taken from the jury at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence.\u201d So in this ea'se, the appellee, we think, after the introduction of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, should have explained his conduct in respect to the charges made against the appellant, instead of asking to have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>case taken from the jury at the conclusion of the evidence of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">We now come to the exceptions taken to the evidence. The 'first is to the admission of the written contract or agreement of sale between the appellant and the Keisners, for the s'ale of her stock of goods, etc. The appellant, the plaintiff 'below, had offered evidence as to such sale and its terms and conditions, when upon cross-examination of the plaintiff it was ascertained by defendant\u2019s counsel that the agreement of sale was in writing. Upon being asked for the contract, if she had it, the witness gave it to defendant\u2019s counsel. It was then offered by him and admitted in evidence against the objection of the plaintiff. If the fact of the sale and the terms thereof were proper to he introduced in evidence, then the written agreement was the best evidence of those facts, but in any event, as such facts had already been given in evidence, there was certainly no injury done the plaintiff in its&gt; admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">It is. hard to determine to what the second exception applies. The plaintiff was being interrogated as to the five hundred dollars paid to her in cash under said contract, when she was a\u2019sked, \u201cTour position was then that you wanted to turn over the property to them, and get the twenty-four hundred dollars 'and they wanted to get hack the five; is that the situation Answer, \u201cThey did not ask for the five.\u201d The counsel for the plaintiff then said, \u201cI object to going into the demerits and merits of that suit. It don\u2019t make any difference whether she won it or lost it.\u201d Then followed a discussion between the court and the respective counsel, which resulted in the court over-ruling the objection, and the exception wias taken to its ruling thereon. If the objection was to the answer, we can discover no possi ble injury that was done the plaintiff by the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Because of the errors committed by the court below in its rulings upon the prayers, the judgment will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">\n<em>Tudgmerd reversed and a new trial awarded, the appellee to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
