HELMER <em>v. </em>JOHH H. GEIS.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b110-14\"><em>Decided November </em>5th, <em>1925.</em></decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s third prayer was as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-7\">The plaintiff prays the court to instruct the jury that if they find the garnishee, John P. Helmer, was on March 14th,, 1924, the date on which the attachment in this case was laid in his hands, or is now indebted to the said Ira A. Doughty* then the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict against the garnishee, John P. Helmer, for the amount of the judgment of the plaintiff against said Doughty, namely, $2',215.59, provided this amount does not exceed such sum as the jury shall have found to be due and owing by the garnishee, John P. Helmer, to the said Ira A. Doughty, but should they find the garnishee to be indebted to said Doughty in an amount less than the judgment of the plaintiff against said Doughty, then the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict against said garnishee for the amount so found to be due by said Helmer to said Doughty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-8\">The garnishee\u2019s prayers were as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-9\"><em>First. </em>\u2014 The garnishee prays the court to instruct the jury, that under the pleadings in this case- there is no evidence legally sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to- recover and therefore their verdict must be for the garnishee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-10\"><em>Second. </em>\u2014 The garnishee prays the court to instruct the jury, that under the pleadings and evidence in this case, there is no- evidence legally sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover, and therefore their verdict must be for the garnishee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-11\"><em>Third. </em>\u2014 The garnishee prays the court to instruct the-jury, that if they find from the evidence that Ira A. Doughty, debtor, mentioned in these proceedings, entered into- a contract with the garnishee, John P. Helmer, to build for him, the said garnishee, two- houses; and if they shall further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>find that said Doughty failed to complete said contract and that at the time said Doughty discontinued work on said \u2022contract, all payments then due and owing to him the said Doughty under said contract had been paid to him by the .said garnishee, John P. Helmer, if the jury shall so find and if they shall further find that the discontinuance, aforesaid, was not occasioned through any fault of the said garnishee, John P. Helmer, then their verdict must be for him the said garnishee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b112-5\">The cause was argued before Bond, C. J., Pattison, Henee, Adkins, Offutt, Digges, and Walsh, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-6\"><em>Thomas E. </em>Mason, with whom was <em>J. Abner Bayler </em>on the brief, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-7\"><em>Thomas Bwrling </em>Hull, with whom was <em>Oscar O. </em>Martinet, Jr., on the brief, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-8\">Adkins, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALP\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">John H. Geis <em>&amp; </em>Company, appellee, sued out an attachment against Ira A. Doughty as an absconding debtor, and the attachment was laid in the hands of John P. Helmer a's garnishee. After the docketing of the suit Doughty confessed judgment in favor of appellee in the short note case for $2,235.59. This was on an account for materials furnished Doughty by appellee, most or all of which were for two houses which Doughty contracted to erect for appellant. It is conceded that the attaching creditor\u2019s rights against the garnishee are in no respect superior to those of the original debtor, and the creditor\u2019s right to recover depends upon whether Doughty could have recovered in a suit by him against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">So the question here to be decided is, was appellant indebted to Doughty at any time between the laying of the attachment and the trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>That question was fairly submitted, to tbe jury by plaintiff\u2019s third prayer, which together with garnishee\u2019s three rejected prayers will be set out by tbe reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Tbe fifteenth bill of exception was to tbe ruling on tbe prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Tbe garnishee\u2019s first two prayers, while in form variance prayers, were obviously intended as demurrers to the evidence, and will be so treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">These prayers are based on the theory that there was a special contract between Doughty and the garnishee and that the work to he done under it was abandoned by Dongbty before completion without legal justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">It is conceded that there was a special contract; and the law is well established that where such a contract is executory, and the plaintiff has performed part of it, and then without legal excuse refuses to perform the rest of it, he cannot recover either in a suit on the contract or on a <em>quantum meruit. Denmead v. Coburn, </em>35 Md. 44; <em>Cill v. Vogler, </em>52 Md. 663; <em>Pope v. King, </em>108 Md. 45; <em>Meyer v. Frenkil, </em>113 Md. 36; <em>Turner v. Eagan, </em>116 Md. 35; <em>Oldewurtel v. Bevan, </em>117 Md. 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">But the evidence of plaintiff's tends to show that while Doughty left Baltimore during the progress of the work and was absent in Eorth Carolina, for about six weeks, he did not leave with the intention of abandoning the work and did not in fact abandon it; that at the time he left the houses were nearly completed, and that practically all that remained to be done was in the hands of snh-contraetors; that Doughty\u2019s partner had been looking after the work, and when he died a few weeks before Doughty left, he, Doughty, put the work in charge of one of his employees; that practically all the materials had been purchased by Doughty, and the balance required was ordered from plaintiff by the man whom he left to supervise the work and charged to Doughty\u2019s account; that the work was completed by Doughty\u2019s employees and sub-contractors under contracts made with him and with materials provided by him or purchased on his account; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>while in Earth Carolina he was informed that the garnishee had taken charge of the work. There was also- evidence that on Doughty\u2019s return the garnishee refused to permit him to resume supervision of the work but told him that when the work was completed the garnishee would deduct the- cost to him from the amount he owed Doughty and would settle the difference if they could come to- any agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">This, if the jury believed plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, was an acknowledgment of an existing'indebtedness from -garnishee to Doughty, if the balance remaining unpaid under the contract should exceed the amount paid by garnishee to complete the houses; and this difference was conceded to be over two thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">There was, therefore, evidence from which the jury could have found either a substantial performance by Doughty and acceptance by garnishee, or that completion was prevented by the improper interference of the garnishee.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">We find no- error in the refusal of these prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Garnishee\u2019s third prayer was properly- refused. It assumes an abandonment of the work by Doughty. It disregards plaintiffs\u2019 testimony as to- substantial performance by Doughty and acceptance by garnishee. <em>Presbyterian Church v. Hoopes etc. Co., </em>66 Md. 603; <em>Turner v. Eagan, </em>116 Md. 40; <em>Walsh v. Jenvey, </em>85 Md. 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">The first fourteen exceptions relate to rulings on evidence. We find no prejudicial error in any of them, and none was pointed out by appellant either in his brief or oral argument. Some reference was made to leading questions, but it does not appear from the record that they were objected to on that ground. <em>Iron Clad Mfg. Co. v. Stansfield, </em>112 Md. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs to appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
