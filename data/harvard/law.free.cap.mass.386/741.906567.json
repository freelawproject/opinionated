We conclude that the statutes governing adoption do not permit foster parents to petition for adoption while the child\u2019s mother is opposing a care and protection proceeding brought by the Department of Social Services (Department)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the juvenile session of a District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Court. We also conclude that in the circumstances the foster parents have no constitutional right to adjudication of the merits of their adoption petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In January, 1979, a nineteen month old child was admitted to a hospital for treatment of serious burns. In February, 1979, a Department social worker filed a petition for care and protection of the child in the juvenile session of a District Court under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 24-27. These sections established a procedure by which the Department may obtain custody of a child suffering from, or in danger of, abuse or neglect. Under \u00a7 24, the court may order immediate removal of the child to the Department\u2019s care. A hearing follows under \u00a7\u00a725 and 26 to determine whether the child is \u201cin need of care and protection.\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, as amended through St. 1978, c. 552, \u00a7 29. If the court so determines, it may, depending on the best interests of the child, commit the child to the custody of the Department or make other arrangements for the child\u2019s care. Under \u00a7 27, the child, her parents or guardian, the Department, or anyone appearing on the child\u2019s behalf may appeal the court\u2019s order for a de novo trial in the juvenile appeals session of a District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">In the present case, the judge in the District Court awarded temporary custody to the Department on February 21, 1979. The Department placed the child with foster parents, the petitioners in this case, on March 10. In April, 1980, a full hearing was held in the care and protection proceeding, and the District Court judge awarded permanent custody to the Department. The child\u2019s mother appealed to the juvenile appeals session, and her appeal is still pending. The child, meanwhile, has remained with the foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">On March 24, 1981, the foster parents filed petitions in the Probate Court for temporary and permanent guardianship with custody, and for adoption. On the same day, the Probate Court judge granted temporary guardianship. The Department and the child\u2019s mother later entered the proceedings. The Department moved to vacate the temporary guardianship order and to dismiss the adoption petition. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>guardian ad litem was appointed for the child, and opposed the Department\u2019s motions. After a hearing, the probate judge allowed the Department\u2019s motions. The foster parents appealed the judgment dismissing their adoption petition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we granted their application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The probate judge did not identify the grounds for his decision to dismiss the foster parents\u2019 adoption petition. The Department\u2019s motion to dismiss, however, was based on contentions that the foster parents had no \u201cstanding\u201d to petition for adoption, and that the Probate Court could not determine issues of custody and adoption while a care and protection proceeding was pending in the District Court. Therefore, we treat the probate judge\u2019s order dismissing the foster parents\u2019 petition as based on these preliminary questions only, and not as an adjudication of the ultimate issues of the welfare, needs, and interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">1. <em>\u201cStanding\u201d under the adoption statutes. </em>The statutes governing adoption establish a number of preliminary conditions to adoption in addition to the requirement that adoption must serve the welfare of the child. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6. See <em>Krakow </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>326 Mass. 452, 455-456 (1950). The parties disagree as to whether the foster parents\u2019 petition meets these conditions, characterizing the issue as one of \u201cstanding.\u201d Although the statutory conditions are variously phrased in terms of who may sue and what conditions are necessary to the entry of a decree, we accept the parties\u2019 characterization for purposes of convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">We begin with a summary of the adoption statutes. Basic conditions for adoption are set forth in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 1, which provides that any person of full age may petition the Probate Court to adopt a person younger than himself unless the two are related in certain enumerated degrees. Subsequent sections, however, establish additional limitations, the application of which depends on the circumstances surrounding the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Section 2A lists five \u201cconditions\u201d upon which adoption may be based. One of the five must be met before a Probate Court judge can enter a decree. The five conditions are (1) placement for adoption by the Department or a licensed agency; (2) a blood relationship between the child and the petitioner; (3) a relationship of stepchild and stepparent between the child and the petitioner; (4) nomination of the petitioner in a will, or (5) the Department\u2019s approval of the petition. Thus the effect of \u00a7 2A is that, outside the limited group of family members and testamentary nominees, adoption must be arranged by the Department or meet with its approval.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This rule is subject to one qualification. A petitioner aggrieved by the Department\u2019s failure to approve may \u201cappeal\u201d the Department\u2019s decision to the Probate Court hearing the petition. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2A (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">When the child\u2019s parents have not consented to adoption, additional conditions must be met. General Laws c. 210, \u00a7 2, states a general requirement of written consent by the child\u2019s lawful parents. This provision is qualified by two exceptions contained in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3. First the judge may allow a petition brought by a person having \u201ccare or custody\u201d of the child, despite the lack of parental consent, if the court finds that the adoption is in the child\u2019s best interests. Alternatively, the Department may initiate an independent proceeding to dispense in advance with the need for parental consent to adoption of a child in the Department\u2019s \u201ccare or custody.\u201d In either case, two requirements are imposed. The petitioner, or the Department, as the case may be, must have the \u201ccare or custody\u201d of the child, and the court must find that the adoption without parental consent is in the child\u2019s best interests. See <em>Petition of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number><em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 581-585, 587-592 (1981); <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>367 Mass. 631, 642-646 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The Department contends that the foster parents\u2019 petition must fail because it lacks both the Department\u2019s approval as required by \u00a7 2A,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and consent of the child\u2019s parents, as required by \u00a7 2. We agree with the petitioners that lack of approval by the Department does not warrant dismissal of the petition. As noted above, the petitioners were entitled to appeal the Department\u2019s decision to the Probate Court. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2A (E). Such an appeal is incorporated in the adoption petition, and permits the judge to override the Department\u2019s decision as a part of his determination of the merits of the petition. See <em>Adoption of a Minor, </em>362 Mass. 842, 845 (1973); <em>Adoption of a Minor, </em>338 Mass. 635, 639 (1959). The Department argues that the foster parents cannot invoke this appeal procedure because they have not formally sought and been denied the Department\u2019s approval. This argument invokes the principle that when an available administrative proceeding can contribute to sound disposition of a case, courts should defer to the agency\u2019s \u201cprimary jurisdiction.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Administration, </em>377 Mass. 217, 220-222 (1979). Here, there is no reason for deferral. The Department is a party to the adoption proceeding. Its participation, and the report it must submit under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 5A,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ensure that the judge has the full benefit of its views and expertise. <em>Id. </em>at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">We agree, however, with the Department\u2019s second contention, that the foster parents\u2019 petition does not qualify for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>an exception to the requirement of parental consent. As we have explained, a determination under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, that adoption without parental consent is in the child\u2019s best interest, is available only to petitioners who have \u201ccare or custody\u201d of the child. In a literal sense, the foster parents are now caring for the child. Nevertheless, they do not have care of the child in the sense that that term is used in \u00a7 3 <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">We have, in the past, read the phrase \u201ccare or custody\u201d broadly. As the foster parents point out, the two words are used disjunctively. Therefore, care alone will suffice, and no prior adjudication of custody is necessary. See <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 585 (1981). In <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>367 Mass. 631, 642-644 (1975), we determined that a licensed child care agency had \u201ccare or custody\u201d when the mother had voluntarily placed the child in its care, and had not made serious efforts to reclaim her child until after the agency filed its petition to dispense with consent to adoption. We emphasized, however, that the mother\u2019s previous acquiescence in the Department\u2019s care of the child provided the basis for a finding of care or custody. <em>Id. </em>See <em>id. </em>at 647-651 (Hennessey, C.J., dissenting). In <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 585 (1981), we acknowledged that the Department had \u201ccare\u201d of the child, for purposes of \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>even when it was not clear that the mother had placed the child voluntarily in the Department\u2019s care.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Again, the mother appeared to have acquiesced in the Department\u2019s general care, although not in all of its actions, up to the time of the petition to dispense with consent to adoption. See <em>id. </em>at 576-580.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The present case differs from prior cases in that here the child\u2019s mother was vigorously opposing a separate petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>for care and custody of the child when the adoption petition was filed. We believe that \u201ccare,\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>means care acquired either with the consent or acquiescence of the parents, or through a statutory procedure for involuntary transfer of care or custody. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23 (C) (Department proceeding in Probate Court to obtain responsibility for child); G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 24-27 (petition for commitment of child to Department custody or other disposition in child\u2019s best interests); G. L. c. 201, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5 (proceedings for guardianship and custody). When a lawful parent has asserted the right to care and custody of her child in a separate proceeding not yet finally resolved,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> care remains at issue, and cannot be deemed to rest with the Department. The foster parents, for their part, derive their rights and status with respect to the child entirely through the Department. If the Department does not have care of the child, for purposes of \u00a7 3, neither can the foster parents have care of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Our interpretation brings the adoption statutes into harmony with the policies of G. L. c. 119, which governs care and protection of children, and of the Department\u2019s enabling act, G. L. c. 18B. Removal of a child from nonconsenting parents is an extreme measure, in derogation of important family interests. Under our statutes, such removal must be based on a judicial determination that the parents are currently unfit to care for the child.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 583, 587 (1981). General Laws c. 119 provides several procedures by which the Department may assume responsibility for a child whose parents are unable to provide necessary care and protection. The Department may petition the Probate Court under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23 (C), for an order placing the child in its care. Alternatively, any person may petition the District Court under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 24-27, for commitment of the child to the Department\u2019s care or for any other appropriate arrangement for care or custody (the procedure utilized here). These proceedings, as well as the Department\u2019s actions as caretaker, must reflect the \u201cpolicy of this commonwealth to direct its efforts, first, to the strengthening and encouragement of family life for the protection and care of children; to assist and encourage the use by any family of all available resources to this end; and to provide substitute care of children only when the family itself or the resources available to the family are unable to provide the necessary care and protection . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1972, c. 785, \u00a7 5. Accord, G. L. c. 18B, \u00a7 3 (A) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">If the bare fact of physical care were enough to support a petition to adopt without parental consent despite the parent\u2019s pending claim to care and custody, the Department and those claiming through it could circumvent the care and protection procedures of G. L. c. 119. Although the ultimate issue of parental unfitness could not be avoided, <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 589 (1981), the orderly progression from parent to substitute care to adoption, and the policy in favor of reconciliation between parent and child, would be disrupted. Moreover, the parellel proceedings could result in conflicting orders by two courts on custody, visits, and all matters relating to the welfare of the child. Such a result would be intolerable, and could only harm the interests of the child. We conclude, therefore, that when a child\u2019s lawful parent is actively opposing a pending petition for care and custody of the child, neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the Department nor any other person has such \u201ccare or custody\u201d of the child as is necessary to initiate an adoption proceeding without parental consent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Our holding should not be read to detract in any way from the Department\u2019s authority to provide protection and substitute care during the pendency of an appeal from an order committing a child to its care. Our conclusions are based on, and limited to, the language of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, and the relationship between care and protection proceedings and adoption proceedings when both are opposed by the child\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">2. <em>Constitutional interest. </em>The foster parents assert that, apart from the adoption statutes, they are entitled as a matter of due process of law to \u201caccess to the courts to seek adoption.\u201d We have no difficulty in rejecting this claim as presented, on the ground that the foster parents have no \u201cliberty interest\u201d in adoption. The statutes bearing on foster care confer no right on the foster parents to adopt a child entrusted to them. Underlying the provisions for substitute care is the policy, quoted above, favoring preservation and restoration of the family whenever consistent with the child\u2019s welfare. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 1. Through the period of foster care the Department, and in some circumstances the lawful parents, retain substantial rights and responsibilities with respect to the child. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23. Further, the Department may remove a child from foster care whenever \u201cin its judgment the welfare of the child or its protection from neglect or abuse so require.\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 22, as appearing in St. 1972, c. 785, \u00a7 8. The only provision directly concerning adoption by foster parents states that, should the child \u201cbecome eligible for adoption,\u201d foster parents should be notified, and may \u201crequest consideration\u201d as adoptive parents. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23 (F), as amended through St. 1973, c. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>We do not suggest that constitutional \u201cliberty interests\u201d are entirely dependent on the terms of State law. Nevertheless, expectations created by laws that bring a relationship into being must bear upon the liberty interests surrounding that relationship. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Organization of Foster Families for Equality &amp; Reform, </em>431 U.S. 816, 845-846 (1977); <em>Drummond </em>v. <em>Fulton County Dep\u2019t of Family &amp; Children\u2019s Servs., </em>563 F.2d 1200, 1207 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 437 U.S. 910 (1978). Here, there was no basis for an expectation of eventual status as adoptive parents, and therefore, no constitutional requirement of a hearing on the question of adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">At the heart of the foster parents\u2019 constitutionally-based argument may be a claim to a day in court before the child is removed from their home. See <em>Cennami </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 403, 409-415 (1977); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Organization of Foster Families for Equality &amp; Reform, supra </em>at 842-847; <em>Kyees </em>v. <em>County Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, </em>600 F.2d 693, 697-699 (7th Cir. 1979); <em>Drummond </em>v. <em>Fulton County Dep\u2019t of Family &amp; Children\u2019s Servs., supra </em>at 1206-1209. <em>Sherrard </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>484 F. Supp. 728, 739-743 (W.D. Mich. 1980), aff'd per curiam, 644 F.2d 542 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 828 (1981); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>State, </em>165 N.J. Super. 392, 400-406 (1979); <em>W.C. </em>v. <em>P.M., </em>155 N.J. Super. 555, 563-564 (1978). The unity and privacy of family are, indisputably, entitled to constitutional protection. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Organization of Foster Families for Equality &amp; Reform, supra </em>at 842-843, and cases cited. The bonds of affection that evolve over time in a foster home may, despite the governing statutes and regulations, lend to the foster family many attributes of a natural family. <em>Id. </em>at 844-845. On the other hand, the rights of the natural family, as well as the interests of the child, could be harmed by procedures that enlarge and prolong a struggle for custody. See <em>id. </em>at 846-847. We need not, however, determine the full extent of the interests of foster parents, because we are convinced that they do not require adjudication of the present adoption petition. We have been advised that since this case was argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the foster parents have been permitted to participate to some extent in the care and protection proceeding pending in the District Court. Their right to be heard can best be tested by an appeal of any limitations on their participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In sum, neither the Department nor the foster parents claiming through it have \u201ccare or custody\u201d of the child in the sense that these words are used in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, to describe a necessary condition of adoption without consent of the child\u2019s lawful parents. Nor are the foster parents constitutionally entitled to a hearing on the issue of adoption. Therefore, the judge correctly dismissed the foster parents\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-16\"> For convenience, we shall use the term \u201cDepartment\u201d to refer to both the Department of Social Services and its predecessor, the Department of Public Welfare.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The question of guardianship is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b758-6\"> The Department\u2019s central role in all adoptions is reinforced by G.

In addition, G. L. c. 28A, \u00a7\u00a7 11,15, and 16, impose criminal penalties for placement of a child, for purposes of adoption, with anyone outside the child\u2019s family, unless placement occurs through the Department or a licensed agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\"> There is no question that the petitioners fail to satisfy any of the first four conditions of \u00a7 2A.

Such a position, taken after the fact, could not defeat the petitioners\u2019 claims to care or custody at the time the petitions were filed.
