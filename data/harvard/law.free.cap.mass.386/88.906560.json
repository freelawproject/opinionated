On their appeal, the plaintiffs challenge the rulings of the trial judge concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>the admissibility of evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They object to the admission of certain testimony of two defense experts concerning the cause of the minor plaintiff\u2019s injuries and to the denial of their request to present a rebuttal witness. There was no error; we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">For a general background of the case, we summarize certain of the evidence. The plaintiff Christine Drake testified to sustaining an injury to her left hand while attending school on September 12, 1977, and to being treated by the defendant, who placed a circular plaster cast on her arm from her fingers to her elbow. Three days later her fingers had turned blue; they were swollen and cold. Her mother took her to the defendant, who removed the cast and replaced it with a cast of a different kind. Three days later, her fingers were still blue and swollen. The fingers started to \u201cclaw up.\u201d She returned to the defendant who recommended an operation. Christine\u2019s parents took her to another doctor, and she was admitted to a hospital in September. After five days of observation and physical therapy, she was discharged. One attending physician gave a diagnosis of sympathetic dystrophy, a condition in which the sympathetic nervous system becomes hyper-reactive and causes constriction and spasm of the blood vessels, and damage to the tissues. She was again hospitalized in October and November, 1977, from February to June, 1978, and in August, 1980. It was only after an operation during this last admission that her hand was permanently unclenched.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">There was a substantial dispute as to whether the clenched hand was caused by the tightness of the cast or was caused by circumstances having nothing to do with any physical injury, at least an injury caused by the defendant. A medical witness for the plaintiffs testified that the type of cast first applied was inappropriate; that the cast was too tight; that the defendant did not supervise the patient adequately; and that the clenched hand was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. Another witness for the plaintiffs, an orthopedic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>surgeon, testified on cross-examination that there was a psychological element to the problem; that under anesthesia the fingers could be straightened; and that the defendant had caused no serious physical injury to Christine. The defendant offered two expert witnesses who testified that the clenched hand was not the product of any physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief was based on a claim that the defendant\u2019s negligence in putting on a cast that was too tight and in not properly supervising Christine\u2019s treatment caused physical injuries, particularly the clenched hand. Although in the course of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, there was evidence that Christine had certain psychological problems, the plaintiffs made no attempt in their case-in-chief to demonstrate that a negligently caused physical injury caused psychological problems which in turn caused the clenched hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The defendant\u2019s experts, both orthopedic surgeons, testified in effect that Christine\u2019s clenched hand had no connection with anything the defendant had or had not done, and that the clenched hand was the product of a psychological rather than a physical problem. One characterized it as \u201cconversion hysteria,\u201d and the other described the condition as a \u201cclenched fist syndrome,\u201d not related to physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The plaintiffs argue that the judge erred in permitting these orthopedic witnesses to testify to a psychological basis for Christine\u2019s clenched hand. We shall assume that the plaintiffs properly raised the question of the qualifications of these witnesses. These orthopedic surgeons had treated Christine. They had seen similar cases in which a clenched hand had no underlying physical cause but was the consequence of a psychological disorder. They did not testify as to the cause of the psychological disorder but simply to the absence of a direct physical cause for the clenched hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The judge was warranted in finding that these orthopedic specialists in surgery to the hand were qualified to express the opinions they did. It is a matter on which the discretion of the presiding judge is to be respected if there is evidence to warrant the judge\u2019s conclusion that a witness was compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tent to express an opinion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seit, </em>373 Mass. 83, 92 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>367 Mass. 169, 182 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>365 Mass. 149, 152 (1974). The judge\u2019s ruling that the witnesses were qualified to testify to the cause of the clenched hand is particularly justified in this case because they had treated Christine. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>382 Mass. 347, 351 (1981); <em>Kramer </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>336 Mass. 465, 467-468 (1957); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>329 Mass. 333, 335 (1952); <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Rider, </em>99 Mass. 622, 625 (1868).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">At the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s case, the plaintiffs sought to present a rebuttal witness. The defendant was aware that the plaintiffs might offer such a witness, although that information was transmitted by letter rather than by supplemental answers to interrogatories filed pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (b) (4), 365 Mass. 772 (1974).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From the colloquy between the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and the judge, it appeared that the witness would not be immediately available. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel said that the witness would testify that Christine\u2019s physical injury \u201cwould be an adequate producing cause of the psychiatric damage that she was treated for . . . at Children\u2019s Hospital ... in the Psychosomatic Unit.\u201d When pressed as to whether the witness would say the physical injury was the cause of the psychological damage, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel indicated that the witness would testify that \u201cthe physical injury caused a psychiatric reaction.\u201d We assume that the physical injury referred to was an injury allegedly resulting from the defendant\u2019s negligence. The defendant, in opposing the plaintiffs\u2019 right to present a rebuttal witness, argued that, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>witness were allowed to testify, the defendant would have to present witnesses in surrebuttal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We pause at this point to discuss the law concerning the right or privilege of a party to present rebuttal evidence. A trial judge has substantial discretion whether to permit the presentation of rebuttal evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>379 Mass. 623, 632 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>302 Mass. 265, 267-268 (1939). We subsequently discuss the judge\u2019s ruling in terms of an abuse of discretion and conclude that she did not abuse her discretion. There are circumstances, however, in which a party may present rebuttal evidence as a matter of right and in which the denial of that right would be an error of law. Such cases arise when a party seeks to present evidence to refute evidence of the other side. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, supra </em>at 267; McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 4, at 6 (2d ed. 1972); K.B. Hughes, Evidence \u00a7 182 (1961); 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1873 (Chadbourn rev. 1976). There is no right to present rebuttal evidence that only supports a party\u2019s affirmative case. We must, therefore, first analyze what the plaintiffs sought to show in rebuttal to determine whether they had a right to make their intended presentation. We conclude that the plaintiffs did not have an absolute right to present that rebuttal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The plaintiffs sought through their rebuttal witness to present a new theory of causation: the physical injury caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence produced a psychological condition that caused the clenched hand. This new theory, in effect, accepted the defendant\u2019s evidence that the clenched hand was not directly caused by any physical injury. It did not rebut the testimony of the defendant\u2019s experts. Instead, it accepted the existence of a psychological cause of the clenched hand and sought to connect the psychological con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>dition to the injury allegedly caused by the defendant. Of course, the new theory contradicted the defendant\u2019s contention that there was no underlying physical cause of the clenched hand. It was, however, more the making of an affirmative case than a contradiction of the defendant\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">It was the plaintiffs\u2019 burden to prove a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence and the clenched hand. We do not accept that a plaintiff may present one theory of causation in his case-in-chief and, as a matter of right, present a different theory of causation in rebuttal. This is not a case in which a defense theory was suddenly advanced to the plaintiffs\u2019 surprise. The plaintiffs knew well before trial that there was a question whether there was a psychological cause for the clenched hand. The issue could and should have been faced in the plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief. Then the defendant could have presented his defense in a single, organized response to the plaintiffs\u2019 entire case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The question remains whether the judge abused her discretion in denying the plaintiffs the opportunity to present the proffered witness. The circumstances recited above demonstrate that there was no abuse of discretion. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel could not state precisely when that witness would be available. It is clear that the proposed witness was not in the courtroom and would not be for at least an hour. The subject of his testimony was one which could have been presented in the plaintiffs\u2019 direct case. The plaintiffs were not surprised by the testimony they sought to rebut. The rebuttal testimony would have introduced a new theory of causation known to the plaintiffs before trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We conclude that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the plaintiffs the right to present a rebuttal witness. This is an issue on which we give substantial dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>cretion to the judge conducting the trial. For that reason, a party would be well-advised to obtain the judge\u2019s ruling on the matter of his right to present a rebuttal witness before resting his case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">We note finally that, even if we had decided that it was error to deny rebuttal, the error would not have been so prejudicial as to require reversal. The rebuttal witness, as far as we can discern from the record, was a psychiatrist who would have testified on causation. His testimony would not have been related in any way to the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. If the defendant had been negligent in causing the cast to be too tight, or in some other way, there was evidence warranting a finding of damages for Christine\u2019s discomfort and for the cost of further medical services, quite apart from the clenched hand itself. Thus, it seems most likely that the jury based their verdict on the failure to prove negligence and not on the absence of proof of any damages flowing from the defendant\u2019s negligence. In this circumstance, we can see in retrospect that the plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the refusal of the judge to permit them to present a rebuttal witness who would have testified not to the defendant\u2019s negligence, but only to matters relating to causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> We allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-6\"> In that letter, dated six days before trial commenced, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel wrote that his witness would testify \u201cthat the tight cast which caused a circulatory impairment resulting in flexed fingers, contributed substantially, at a later date, to the ongoing psychiatric problems that Christine Drake suffered when she was treated at the Children\u2019s Hospital during the period of February, 1978 up to the present time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\"> The defendant also argued that the witness could not be presented because the plaintiffs failed to comply with Mass. R. Civ. P. 26, 365 Mass. 772 (1974). We need not decide whether the judge\u2019s ruling would have been warranted because the plaintiffs failed to comply with any requirements of rule 26 applicable to the disclosure of a rebuttal witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\"> There is a suggestion in the argument of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to the judge that the case was already \u201cin on the question of the emotional aspect.\u201d If so, then the testimony of the rebuttal witness was offered only to bolster the plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief and was in no sense rebuttal testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
