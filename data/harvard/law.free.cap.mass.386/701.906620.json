L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a statute that places a time limit on the liability of architects and contractors. General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2B, is not a statute of limitations but a statute of repose. A statute of limitations normally governs the time within which legal proceedings must be commenced after the cause of action accrues. See, e.g., <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>381 Mass. 611, 618-619 (1980). A statute of repose, however, limits the time within which an action may be brought and is not related to the accrual of any cause of action. The injury need not have occurred, much less have been discovered. See, e.g., <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>North Bergen, </em>61 N.J. 190, 199-200 (1972). As a statute of repose, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, precludes recovery against those within the protection of the statute for any injury which occurs more than six years after the performance or furnishing of the design, planning, construction, or general administration of an improvement to real property. Simply put, after six years, the statute completely eliminates a cause of action against certain persons in the construction industry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Since G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, abolishes a cause of action in tort, the following issues arise: (1) whether G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, may be applied to work completed prior to its effective date, and if so, whether the application of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, in those circumstances violates the due process guarantees of the United States or Massachusetts Constitutions; (2) whether, on its face, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, violates the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Federal or State Constitutions and the right to a remedy by recourse to the laws guaranteed by the Massachusetts Constitution; and (3) whether G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, may bar a claim alleging breach of express or implied warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">We hold that the Legislature intended that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, apply to claims involving work completed before the statute took effect. We also believe that the application of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, in these circumstances is consistent with the due process guarantees of the Massachusetts and United States Constitutions. In addition, we think that, on its face, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, does not violate the due process and equal protection guarantees of the State and Federal Constitutions and the right to a remedy by recourse to the laws guaranteed by the Massachusetts Constitution. Finally, we conclude that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, bars the plaintiff\u2019s warranty claims, because in this case, the elements of these claims are identical to this claim of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We summarize the facts. In February, 1963, the defendant Eduardo F. Catalano agreed to design a student center on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) campus. Catalano completed and delivered all design drawings and other documents in July, 1963. By October, 1965, M.I.T. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>accepted and occupied the building. After September, 1967, Catalano did not perform any additional services in connection with the student center. In July, 1968, the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, as appearing in St. 1968, c. 612, to be effective October, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The plaintiff, Gary Klein, claims that he was injured on April 23,1976, while leaving the Harvard Cooperative Society \u201cTech Coop\u201d located in the student center. The injuries allegedly occurred when the outer door struck him and caused the plate glass panels of the door to shatter. The glass allegedly cut and damaged the nerves in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In February, 1979, the plaintiff commenced this action against Catalano individually and Eduardo F. Catalano Architects and Engineers, Inc. (Architects and Engineers), claiming negligence on the part of both Catalano and Architects and Engineers, and breach of express and implied warranties by Architects and Engineers. Prior to trial, the defendants filed motions for summary judgment claiming that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, barred the plaintiff\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). In support of their motions, the defendants filed three exhibits: the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, Catalano\u2019s agreement with M.I.T., and Catalano\u2019s affidavit stating that Architects and Engineers never performed any services in connection with the \u201cTech Coop.\u201d After a hearing, a judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motions based on G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B. Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), another judge ordered the entry of final judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">1. <em>Application of G. L. c. 260, </em>\u00a7 <em>2B, to torts arising out of work in connection with improvements to real property completed prior to the statute\u2019s effective date.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">a. <em>Statutory argument. </em>The plaintiff claims that the judge erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, because the Legislature did not intend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, apply to work in connection with improvements to real property completed prior to the statute\u2019s effective date. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Elementary rules of statutory construction require us to look to the statutory language itself as the principal source of insight into the legislative purpose. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). We construe the words of the statute according to their \u201cusual and natural meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 354 (1974). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>359 Mass. 386, 387 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2B, as amended by St. 1973, c. 777, \u00a7 2, provides that \u201c[ajctions of tort for damages arising out of any deficiency or neglect in the design, planning, construction or general administration of an improvement to real property shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues; provided, however, that in no event shall such actions be commenced more than six years after the performance or furnishing of such design, planning, construction or general administration.\u201d The statute does not depend on the date of the improvement to real property but depends on the time the design, planning, construction, or general administration of the improvement to real property was furnished. We hold that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, applies to this action, although the defendants completed their work before the statute took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">b. <em>Constitutional argument.. </em>The plaintiff claims that the judge erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, because application of the statute to work completed prior to the statute\u2019s effective date violates the due process guarantees of the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions. In making this argument, the plaintiff assumes that the application of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, in those circumstances is retroactive. We do not agree with the plaintiff\u2019s assumption that the application of the statute is retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">\u201cIt is only where vested substantive rights of the parties have been adversely affected that we can say a statute oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ates retroactively, and it is only then that we need analyze the nature of the governmental interest involved in order to determine whether the statute, as applied, violates due process.\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>366 Mass. 779, 781 (1975). There is a \u201cdistinction between a cause of action which has accrued and the expectation which every citizen has if a legal wrong should occur to find redress according to the rules of statutory and common law applicable at that time. . . . \u2018[N]o person has a vested interest in any rule of law entitling him to insist that it shall remain unchanged for his benefit.\u2019 <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>White, </em>243 U.S. 188, 198 [1917]. <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U.S. 113, 134 [1876].\u201d <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 10-11 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In this case, the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued when he was injured on April 23, 1976, almost eight years after the statute\u2019s effective date. Thus, any application of the statute in this case does not adversely affect any vested substantive rights of the plaintiff. The application of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, in these circumstances does not violate the due process guarantees of the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">2. <em>Facial Validity of G. L. c. 260, </em>\u00a7 <em>2B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The plaintiff claims that the judge erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment because G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, violates the due process and equal protection guarantees of the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions and the right to a remedy by recourse to the laws guaranteed by the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">a. <em>Standard of review. </em>We note at the outset that the plaintiff has a \u201cheavy burden in seeking to overcome the statute\u2019s presumption of constitutionality. See <em>El Paso </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>379 U.S. 497, 508-509 (1965). \u2018Every rational presumption is indulged in favor of the validity of an act of the General Court. Enforcement of such legislative enactment will not be refused unless its conflict with some provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>sion of the Constitution is established beyond reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 Mass. 181, 190 (1978), quoting <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>290 Mass. 427, 429 (1935). Since G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, \u2018\u201ctrammels [no] fundamental rights\u2019 and \u2018is drawn upon [no] inherently suspect distinctions,\u2019\u201d <em>Blue Hills Cemetery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Embalming &amp; Funeral Directing, </em>379 Mass. 368, 371 (1979), quoting <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>440 U.S. 1, 17 (1979), it follows that \u201c[u]nless the act of the Legislature cannot be supported upon any rational basis of fact that reasonably can be conceived to sustain it, the court has no power to strike it down as violative of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>307 Mass. 408, 418 (1940). A court must sustain economic legislation if it has a permissible legislative objective and if the legislation bears a rational relation to that objective. <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 14 (1971). \u201cWhether [the statute is] wise or effective is not, of course, the province of [courts].\u201d <em>Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 505 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lammi, ante </em>299, 300 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">b. <em>Due process. </em>The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution demands that a statute that regulates economic activity \u201cbear a \u2018reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective.\u2019 <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 14 (1971). Under the analogous provisions of our State Constitution,<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> we must determine whether [the statute] \u2018bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or some other phase of the general welfare.\u2019 <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number><em>Director of the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>307 Mass. 408, 418 (1940).\u201d <em>Blue Hills Cemetery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Legislation in Embalming </em>&amp; <em>Funeral Directing, </em>379 Mass. 368, 373 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2B, was enacted in response to case law abolishing the rule that once an architect or builder had completed his work and it had been accepted by the owner, absent privity with the owner, there was no liability as a matter of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Inman </em>v. <em>Binghamton Hous. Auth., </em>3 N.Y.2d 137 (1957); <em>Montijo </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>219 Cal. App. 2d 351 (1963). See also 1968 Sen. Rep. No. 1050, A Statute of Limitations for Malpractice Against Architects, Engineers and Surveyors, 16-18. These cases greatly increased the liability of architects, contractors, and others involved in the construction industry. \u201cThe architect or contractor was confronted not only with an unlimited class of potential claimants, but also, in many instances, with an extension in duration of the liability for negligence.\u201d Comment, Limitation of Action Statutes for Architects and Builders, 18 Cath. U.L. Rev. 361, 363 (1969). An injury could occur many years after the architect or contractor had completed his work. Since an ordinary statute of limitations did not begin to run until either the date of the injury or its discovery, those involved in construction were subject to possible liability throughout their professional lives and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>into retirement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the urging of those involved in the construction industry, the Legislature placed an absolute outer limit on the duration of this liability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See Collins, Limitation of Action Statutes for Architects and Builders \u2014 An Examination of Constitutionality, 29 Fed\u2019n of Ins. Counsel Q. 41, 41-46 (1978); Rogers, The Constitutionality of Alabama\u2019s Statute of Limitations for Construction Litigation: The Legislature Tries Again, 11 Cum. L. Rev. 1,1-3 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Limiting the duration of liability is a well recognized public purpose.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThere comes a time when [a defendant] ought to be secure in his reasonable expectation that the slate has been wiped clean of ancient obligations, and he ought not to be called on to resist a claim \u2018when evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.\u2019\u201d <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>North Bergen, </em>61 N.J. 190, 201 (1972), quoting Developments in the Law: Statutes of Limitations, 63 Harv. L. Rev. 1177, 1185 (1950). Otherwise, those engaged in the design and construction of real property may have to mount a defense when \u201c[architectural plans may have been discarded, copies of building codes in force at the time of construction may no longer be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>in existence, persons individually involved in the construction project may be deceased or may not be located.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Burk, </em>90 N.M. 688, 694 (Ct. App. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2B, places a limit on the liability of those involved in design and construction. In establishing the six-year limit, the Legislature struck what it considered to be a reasonable balance between the public\u2019s right to a remedy and the need to place an outer limit on the tort liability of those involved in construction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>ture could reasonably have concluded that a period of six years allows sufficient time for the most meritorious claims to accrue.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Hazelet &amp; Erdal, </em>410 Mich. 1, 16 (1980). We believe that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, does not violate the due process guarantees of the United States or Massachusetts Constitutions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Allen-Bradley Co., 371 F. </em>Supp. 698 (W.D. Va. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The plaintiff also claims that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, violates the due process guarantees of the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions and the right to a remedy by recourse to the laws guaranteed by the Massachusetts Constitution, because it abolishes his cause of action without providing a substitute remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We agree with the plaintiff that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, does abolish his cause of action against these defendants without providing an alternative remedy. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Since his injury occurred more than six years after the defendants completed their work, the plaintiff is barred from commencing an action to recover for injuries received as a consequence of design, planning, construction or general admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>istration of an improvement to real property. Nevertheless, we believe that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, is constitutional.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The United States Constitution allows the Legislature to abolish causes of action once recognized by the common law to further permissible legislative objectives. <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>280 U.S. 117, 122 (1929). Thus, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In addition, we see no basis for treating a law that abrogates a tort remedy differently from any other law that regulates economic activity. \u201cThere is no cause here for application of the \u2018compelling state interest\u2019 test which is employed where a statute impairs fundamental rights protected by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 13 (1971). Since G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, is rationally related to a permissible legislative objective, see 708-710, <em>supra, </em>it does not violate the due process guarantees of the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Further, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, does not violate the right to a remedy by recourse to the laws guaranteed by the Massachusetts Constitution. \u201cSocietal conditions occasionally require the law to change in a way that denies a plaintiff a cause of action available in an earlier day. . . . This court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>would encroach upon the Legislature\u2019s ability to guide the development of the law if we invalidated legislation simply because the rule enacted by the Legislature rejects some cause of action currently preferred by the courts. To do so would be to place certain rules of the \u2018common law\u2019 and certain non-constitutional decisions of the courts above all change except by constitutional amendment. Such a result would offend our notion of the checks and balances between the various branches of government, and the flexibility required for the healthy growth of the law.\u201d <em>Freezer Storage, Inc. </em>v. <em>Armstrong Cork Co., </em>476 Pa. 270, 280-281 (1978). <em>See Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 12 (1971). See also cases cited in note 15, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In upholding G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, we realize that in some cases this statute may impose great hardship on a plaintiff who has suffered injury and has a meritorious claim. However, \u201carguments as to hardship . . . [are] appropriate respecting the enactment of legislation. They are not controlling in the interpretation of existing statutes.\u201d <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Eastern Mass. St. Ry., </em>254 Mass. 28, 33 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">c. <em>Equal protection. </em>The plaintiff claims that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, violates the equal protection guarantees of the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions, because it applies only to actions alleging deficiencies in design, planning, construction or general administration of improvements to real property. The plaintiff argues that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, is similar to statutes in other States which grant immunity from suit only to architects, engineers, and contractors and which deny protection to suppliers, owners, tenants, and others in control or possession at the time the defect caused the injury. Thus, the plaintiff asserts that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, creates an unreasonable and arbitrary classification scheme which results in disparate treatment for similarly situated individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">In making this argument, the plaintiff does not claim that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, violates his own right to the equal protection of the laws. Thus the plaintiff lacks standing in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>own right to argue that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, deprives materialmen, owners, tenants and others in control or possession, of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">We recognize that, as a rule, a plaintiff who lacks individual standing may not assert the rights of others not before the court. <em>See Barrows </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>346 U.S. 249, 255 (1953). This rule is based in part on the notion that a third party cannot effectively vindicate the rights of others. See <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 114 (1976). However, that rationale does not apply to this case. In this case, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, bars the plaintiff from suing those defendants who are protected by G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the equal protection issue is as great as that of the materialmen, owners, tenants, and others in control or possession, who he claims are excluded from the statute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We think that the plaintiff has standing in a representative capacity to raise the rights of the potential defendants excluded from the statute. See <em>McClanahan </em>v. <em>American Gilsonite Co., </em>494 F. Supp. 1334, 1342-1344 (D. Colo. 1980); <em>Cudahy Co. </em>v. <em>Ragnar Benson, Inc., </em>514 F. Supp. 1212, 1216 (D. Colo. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Having determined that the plaintiff has standing, we proceed to determine whether G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the equal protection guarantees of the United States or Massachusetts Constitutions. \u201cUnder the equal protection clause, in the absence of a suspect classification, our role remains \u2018limited to determining whether the classification involved rationally \u201cfurthers a legitimate State interest.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Blue Hills Cemetery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Embalming ir Funeral Directing, </em>379 Mass. 368, 376 (1979), quoting <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Martignetti, </em>374 Mass. 784, 791 (1978). See <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>440 U.S. 1, 17 (1979); <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 27-28 (1971). See also <em>Cudahy Co. </em>v. <em>Ragnar Benson, Inc., </em>514 F. Supp. 1212, 1217 (D. Colo. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, has the effect of granting immunity from suit only to architects, engineers, contractors, and others involved in the design, planning, construction, or general administration of improvements to real property and of denying that protection to suppliers, owners, tenants, and others in possession or control. Nevertheless, the statute does not violate the equal protection guarantees. See, e.g., <em>President of Georgetown College </em>v. <em>Madden, </em>505 F. Supp. 557 (D.

After the date of registry in the mortgage office of acceptance of the work by the owner, there exists the possibility of neglect, abuse, poor maintenance, mishandling, improper modification, or unskilled repair of an improvement to immovable property by the owner, lessor or tenant. It is difficult for the architect or contractor to guard against such occurrences because, after the acceptance by the owner, the architect or contractor ordinarily has neither control of the improvement nor the right to enter or inspect the improvement.\u201d <em>Burmaster </em>v. <em>Gravity Drainage Dist.

They can thus maintain high quality control standards in the controlled environment of the factory. On the other hand, the architect or contractor can pre-test and standardize construction designs and plans only in a limited fashion. In addition, the inspection, supervision and observation of construction by architects and contractors involves individual expertise not susceptible to the quality control standards of the factory.\u201d <em>Burmaster </em>v. <em>Gravity Drainage Dist.

A limit on liability may be necessary to encourage those professionals to experiment with new designs and materials. \u201cInnovations are usually accompanied by some unavoidable risk. Design creativity might be stifled if architects and engineers labored under the fear that every untried configuration might have unsuspected flaws that could lead to liability decades later.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Hazelet &amp; Erdal, </em>410 Mich. 1, 18 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Finally, it is well recognized that \u201c[w]hen legislative authority is exerted within a proper area, it need not embrace every conceivable problem within that field.

General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2B, expressly provides a limitation only for actions of tort. Nevertheless, we believe that in this case G.

[I]n the absence of a special agreement he does not imply or guarantee a perfect plan or satisfactory result.\u201d <em>Mississippi Meadows, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hodson, </em>13 Ill.

App. 175, 182-183 (1975). \u201cArchitects, doctors, engineers, attorneys, and others deal in somewhat inexact sciences and are continually called upon to exercise their skilled judgment in order to anticipate and provide for random factors which are incapable of precise measurement. The indeterminable nature of these factors makes it impossible for professional service people to gauge them with complete accuracy in every instance .... Because of the inescapable possibility of error which inheres in these services, the law has traditionally required, not perfect results, but rather the exercise of that skill and judgment which can be reasonably expected from similarly situated professionals.\u201d <em>Mounds </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number><em>View </em>v. <em>Walijarvi, </em>263 N.W.2d 420, 424 (Minn. 1978). See <em>Trustees of Union College </em>v. <em>Kennerly, Slomanson &amp; Smith, </em>167 N.J. Super. 311, 318 (1979). See also <em>Broyles </em>v. <em>Brown Eng\u2019r Co., </em>275 Ala. 35, 39 (1963). Moreover, unlike a mass producer of consumer goods, \u201can architect has but a single chance to create a design for a client which will produce a defect-free structure. Accordingly, we do not think it just that architects should be forced to bear the same burden of liability ... as that which has been imposed on manufacturers generally.\u201d <em>Mounds View </em>v. <em>Walijarvi, </em>263 N.W.2d 420, 425 (Minn. 1978). We believe that, unlike a manufacturer, an architect does not impliedly guarantee that his work is fit for its intended purpose. Rather he impliedly promises to exercise that standard of reasonable care required of members of his profession.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Thus, the elements of the plaintiff\u2019s action for negligence and breach of implied warranty are the same. <em>Audlane Lumber &amp; Builders Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>D.E. Britt Assocs., </em>168 So.2d 333 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1964). Consequently, we believe that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, necessarily bars the plaintiff\u2019s breach of warranty claims.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>frustrate the purpose behind G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B. The Legislature enacted G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, to limit the liability of architects, engineers, contractors, or others involved in the design, planning, construction, or general administration of an improvement to real property. See 708-709, <em>supra. </em>If the plaintiff could maintain his action for breach of implied warranty, the statute would not have its intended effect. The plaintiff whose negligence claim is barred by G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, could bring essentially the same action under a breach of implied warranty theory. This is a result we cannot tolerate. \u201c[I]t [is] the judge\u2019s duty ... to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the statute by their representative body. It is in this way . . . that the doctrine of separation of powers is given meaning.\u201d <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>383 Mass. 682, 687 (1981), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leis, </em>355 Mass. 189, 202 (1969) (Kirk, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">We add that an architect may provide an express warranty of a certain result. In that event, the plaintiff may maintain an action for breach of express warranty. Cf. <em>Clevenger </em>v. <em>Haling, </em>379 Mass. 154, 157 (1979); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>363 Mass. 579 (1973). But, in this case, the architect did not expressly guarantee a specific result. He merely agreed to provide specifications. \u201cWhen a party binds himself by contract to do a work or to perform a service, he agrees by implication to do a workmanlike job and to use reasonable and appropriate care and skill in doing it.\u201d <em>George </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>333 Mass. 496, 497 (1956), quoting <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>Factory Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>298 Mass. 141, 143 (1937). Thus, the defendants provided only an implied warranty that they would exercise the standard of care required of their profession. In this circumstance, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, bars all the plaintiff\u2019s warranty claims. We conclude that the judge properly granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b716-11\"> General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2B, inserted by St. 1968, c. 612, provides that no actions of tort \u201carising out of any deficiency or neglect in the design, planning, construction or general administration of an improvement to real property\u201d shall be commenced \u201cmore than six years after the performance or furnishing of such design, planning, construction or general administration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-12\"> Although G.

Recognizing the significant interest the plaintiff has in the outcome of this litigation, we accept the plaintiff\u2019s premise that G.

See <em>Blue Hills Cemetery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Embalming ir Funeral Directing, </em>379 Mass. 368, 373 n.8 (1979). We think that G.

However, we had criticized the privity doctrine in cases decided prior to the statute\u2019s enactment. See, e.g., <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>342 Mass. 89 (1961); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Yardley &amp; Co., </em>319 Mass. 92 (1946). Moreover, when the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, it was aware of the movement to abolish privity. See 1968 Sen. Rep. No. 1050, A Statute of Limitations for Malpractice Against Architects, Engineers and Surveyors, 16-17. Thus, although G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, predated our decision in <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Whalen, supra, </em>the Legislature enacted this statute in response to the increased liability of architects and contractors. Cf. <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>North Bergen, </em>61 N.J. 190, 194-198 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\"> In this respect, such an extended period of liability is similar to that imposed on persons in other professions. <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>381 Mass. 611 (1980) (doctors); <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>365 Mass. 83 (1974) (lawyers).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\"> In <em>McClanahan </em>v. <em>American Gilsonite Co., </em>494 F.

In reaching this decision, the court said that the statute \u201coffends [the] concept of the rule of law by raising the suspicion that those who have sufficient political power or who can afford a persuasive lobbyist may achieve immunity from accountability to the laws that govern others. Such a result is intolerable in our justice system.\u201d However, as long as a law is reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective, it is valid. It is not relevant that the law is the product of lobbying by special interests, such as an industry or profession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">In <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>381 Mass. 611, 619 &amp; n.12 (1980), we recognized that an outer limit could serve a public purpose and suggested that the Legislature could place an outer limit on the time for bringing medical malpractice actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b724-6\"> We recognize that stale claims do not pose problems for defendants alone. The passage of time also handicaps plaintiffs, who bear the ultimate burden of proving negligence. See <em>Kallas Millwork Corp. </em>v. <em>Square D Co., </em>66 Wis.2d 382 (1975); <em>Overland Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Sirmons, </em>369 So.2d 572, 574 (Fla. 1979). We also realize that statutes like G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, may be unwise, because they bar all claims that accrue after a certain time whether these claims are meritorious or frivolous. See Comment, Limitation of Action Statutes for Architects and Builders \u2014 Blueprints for Non-action, 18 Gath. U.L. Rev. 361, 363 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">However, it is not our role to determine whether the Legislature acted wisely when it enacted G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lammi, supra </em>at 300; <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>383 Mass. 682, 687 (1981); <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Skrupa, </em>372 U.S. 726, 728-730 (1963). \u201cEstablishing, limiting and withholding rights is peculiarly within the power and competence of the legislature so long as the legislation is not arbitrary and the classification is reasonably related to the legislative purpose.\u201d Comment, Limitation of Action Statutes for Architects and Builders \u2014 Blueprints for Non-action, <em>supra </em>at 385. We believe that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, represents a reasonable exercise of the State\u2019s police power. The Legislature could reasonably conclude that the statistical improbability of meritorious claims after a certain length of time, see note 13, <em>infra, </em>and the inability of the courts to adjudicate stale claims weigh more heavily than allowing the adjudication of a few meritorious claims.

We hold that the Legislature may enact a statute that abolishes a common law cause of action without providing a substitute remedy if the statute is rationally related to a permissible legislative objective.

Although the plaintiff does not belong to either group, he has standing to raise this issue. This case is distinguishable from <em>Paro </em>v. <em>Longwood </em>Hosp., 373 Mass. 645 (1977). In that case, we said that a victim of medical malpractice lacked standing to argue that G.

A victim of medical malpractice cannot adequately represent the interests of all other tortfeasors. In this case, the plaintiff can effectively litigate the interests of those who, he claims, are excluded from the statute\u2019s protection. Like a materialman, owner, tenant, or person in control or possession, the plaintiff wants G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, held unconstitutional so that he may sue the architect, engineer or contractor whose negligence allegedly caused his injury.

Some courts have limited these warranties to situations that involve routine work similar to that involved in the mass production of consumer goods. <em>Schipper </em>v. <em>Levitt &amp; Sons, </em>44 N.J. 70, 82, 90-92 (1965). Cf. <em>Broyles </em>v. <em>Brown Eng\u2019r Co., </em>275 Ala. 35, 40 (1963). We decline to follow that approach. Otherwise \u201cthe finder of fact will be forced in every case to determine, as a preliminary matter, whether the alleged architectural error was made in the performance of a sufficiently simplistic task. Defects which are found to be more esoteric would presumably continue to be tried under the traditional [negligence] rule. It seems apparent, however, that the making of any such threshold determination would require the taking of expert testimony and necessitate an inquiry strikingly similar to that which is presently made under the prevailing negligence standard. We think that the net effect would be the interjection of substantive ambiguity into the law of professional malpractice without a favorable trade-off in procedural expedience.\u201d <em>Mounds View </em>v. <em>Walijarvi, </em>263 N.W.2d 420, 425 (Minn. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"Anft\"> In other circumstances, we have said that breach of warranty claims are so similar to actions in tort that they are subject to statutes expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>governing tort claims. See, e.g., <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., ante </em>95, 98-99 (1982) (implied warranty); <em>Salem Orthopedic Surgeons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>377 Mass. 514 (1978) (express warranty).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
