Howell, Jr., appealed, alleging error in the judge\u2019s charge to the jury. The Appeals Court summarily reversed, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 1019 (1981). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">At trial the victim testified to facts which would warrant a jury verdict of assault with intent to commit rape. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>identified the defendant as the culprit. The defendant\u2019s theory at trial was that the witness had been the victim of an assault with intent to rape but that she was mistaken in her identification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant offered evidence that he did not meet the description of the assailant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that he was home with his sister at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Howell argues that the trial judge impermissibly invaded the province of the jury because he told the jurors that \u201c[i]n this case the evidence \u2014 but it is your recollection that controls \u2014 says Mr. Howell did assault [the victim] with intent to commit rape upon her.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the defendant, the inclusion of such a misstatement in the charge requires reversal of his conviction. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Howell did not object at trial to that portion of the charge he now contends is erroneous. Thus, the sole question before us is whether the charge as given created \u201ca substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>380 Mass. 545, 547 (1980). Moreover, the absence of an objection is relevant on whether there is a substantial likelihood that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 147-148 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>In this case, the judge\u2019s charge, read as a whole, accurately conveyed to the jurors that they were the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and that it was their recollection of the evidence which controlled the fact finding process. The judge instructed the jury correctly on the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof. He also instructed the jury that they had to be \u201csatisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that [the incident] did happen.\u201d Further, on more than one occasion the judge instructed the jurors that identification had to be proved \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The judge then gave a full instruction on identification in accordance with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296, 310-311 &amp; n.1 (1979). The judge also instructed the jurors on alibi evidence in accordance with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>367 Mass. 500, 502 n.1 (1975).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\u201cError in a charge is determined by reading the charge as a whole, and not by scrutinizing bits and pieces removed from their context.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 153 (1980). We \u201cview the charge in its entirety since the adequacy of instructions must be determined in light of their over-all impact on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-232 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In this case the flawed portion of the charge represented a slip of the tongue and was adequately corrected by a proper \u201cemphasis on the necessity of moral certainty of guilt,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>378 Mass. 217, 233 (1979), and by other language in the charge. \u201c[A] fair reading of the instructions, not treated in isolation but considered in light of the entire charge . . . , refutes any argument that the judge directed findings of fact, thereby invading the province of the jury to the prejudice of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ambers, </em>370 Mass. 835, 840 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-16\"> Howell\u2019s additional conviction of assault and battery was placed on file. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432,437-438 (1975). On the conviction for assault with intent to rape, Howell was sentenced to a term of eight to twelve years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> In closing argument, defense counsel told the jurors that \u201cthe main issue is the business of what one calls identification.\u201d Later he told the jurors that \u201c[t]here is no question ... in anyone\u2019s mind that this victim had something that took place which is a horrible, horrible thing. No question about that. But the big question and the question that is of paramount importance is whether this defendant was the man.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> The victim stated that her assailant\u2019s front upper tooth was missing and that she bit her assailant\u2019s hand. The defendant offered evidence that there were no bite marks on his hands and that he did not have a missing front tooth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\"> In the very next sentence the judge told the jurors that the defense counsel \u201calluded to the fact that something did happen to this [victim].\u201d Shortly thereafter the judge told the jurors that \u201cunless you find that an assault and battery or an assault with intent to commit rape did, in fact, occur \u2014 we are not now discussing who is the party who did that \u2014 unless there is a finding and unless there is evidence sufficient to support the position that there was an assault and battery and there was an assault with intent to rape, why then no one is guilty of anything.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\"> The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>376 Mass. 867 (1978), is misplaced. In that case the trial judge\u2019s bias, displayed \u201cin many and diverse ways, deprived the defendant of a fair and impartial jury trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 869. Further, when defense counsel attempted to protect his client\u2019s rights, he was threatened with contempt. <em>Id. </em>at 871. There is no such judicial misconduct in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
