He was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment, and his claim of appeal was entered on April 29, 1976. Subsequently, the defendant\u2019s appointed trial counsel was replaced by a succession of three appointed counsel, the first two of xyhom in turn filed motions for a new trial. The second motion was heard in June, 1979. Prior to that, the defendant\u2019s appeal of his convictions had been ordered dismissed, for want of prosecution, by a judge of the Superior Court. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33F, repealed by St. 1979, c. 346, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-7\">The motion for a new trial was denied on January 2, 1980, whereupon the defendant filed a notice of appeal. The matter was entered in the Appeals Court. Subsequently, the defendant\u2019s third and present posttrial counsel filed a motion in the Superior Court to vacate the order dismissing the appeal of the convictions. The motion was granted on May 20, 1981. This appeal was also docketed in the Appeals Court. We ordered the appeals both from the denial of the motion for a new trial and from the convictions transferred to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-8\">Since the defendant has never had an appeal from his convictions, both appeals are properly before us. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bertrand, </em>385 Mass. 356 (1982). Both appeals raise the same issue \u2014 whether the Commonwealth improperly suppressed evidence of an arrangement with the key witness against the defendant at trial. We have reviewed the entire record of the defendant\u2019s trial as well as the transcripts and exhibits from the motion for a new trial. We conclude that the convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-9\">There was evidence of the following facts. In the early morning hours of July 9, 1975, a gasoline service station in Springfield was robbed. The attendant was shot to death. A Springfield police officer, responding to a call at 5:45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>a.m., arrived at the station shortly thereafter and found the body of the victim, Jeffrey McCarl. The victim had been killed by two gunshot wounds to the back of his head. Bullet fragments recovered from his body and cartridge casings found nearby indicated that the murder weapon was a .22 caliber firearm. The cash register had been robbed of approximately $147, and the victim\u2019s wallet was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">Some weeks later, a patient in the Central State Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, one Samuel Hunt, advised police in that city that he desired to confess a crime. On August 3, 1975, in the presence of two homicide detectives, Hunt, who was nineteen years old at the time, made a written confession. In it he recited, with marked familiarity, the details of the robbery and murder in Springfield. According to this confession, Hunt was the sole perpetrator of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">Hunt was returned to Massachusetts by two Springfield detectives. When he arrived, he was brought to the gasoline station, where he re-created the crime for the officers. On August 5, 1975, he gave Springfield police a second written confession, which included details of the crime similar to those in the first statement. As in the earlier document, Hunt made no mention of any other person\u2019s being involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\">Hunt was indicted and sent to Bridgewater State Hospital for observation. G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15 <em>(b). </em>In October, 1975, Hunt, acting under what he claimed was divine guidance, implicated the defendant Collins. This was the first knowledge that Springfield authorities had of the involvement of any person other than Hunt in the events of July 9. The defendant was indicted shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-8\">Hunt was the key prosecution witness at the defendant\u2019s trial. The prosecutor informed the jury in his opening remarks that \u201cwe will have Mr. Hunt here to testify. I will tell you now that he is a co-defendant and he faces similar charges that are here being faced by Mr. Collins. They are not, and the evidence will show, that they have not been disposed of at this point.\u201d When Hunt was called, the judge held a voir dire on the question of his waiver of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>right against self-incrimination. Hunt was questioned by both his special counsel and the judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hunt claimed that he had made no arrangements with the prosecutor in return for his testimony. Furthermore, he stated he understood that, by his testimony at trial, he was exposing himself to an almost certain conviction of murder in the first degree. He was then allowed to give testimony before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">In response to one of the first questions put to him before the jury, Hunt denied having had any prior discussion of the case with the assistant district attorney, Mr. Gibbons. He testified that on July 7, 1975, he had been hitchhiking outside Nashville, Tennessee, when the defendant stopped and picked him up. The defendant was driving a yellow Datsun truck at the time. The two drove northeast, stopping first in Connecticut. From there they drove to Springfield and stopped near the service station at approximately 4:30 a.m. on July 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">Hunt testified that the two alighted from the truck and walked toward the station while the defendant tucked a gun in his belt. From that point Hunt\u2019s trial testimony tracked his confessions except, of course, that his role of observer now overshadowed that of participant. In all accounts, what transpired was the cold-blooded execution of a nonre-sisting robbery victim. In Hunt\u2019s account at trial, Collins murdered the attendant after relieving him of the keys to the cash register. Hunt claimed that, before the killing, he took the wallet from the victim at the defendant\u2019s direction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">The two men remained in Springfield for one night and then drove to Provincetown.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From there, in the company of a woman they had recently met, they drove to Vermont, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>where the truck broke down in the early morning hours of July 12. A Vermont State trooper came upon the defendant while investigating a report of a disabled vehicle. After running a check on him on the National Crime Information Center computer, the officer arrested him on an outstanding warrant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hunt was brought to the station for investigation, but was released shortly thereafter. He returned to Louisville.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">On cross-examination Hunt admitted making the two written confessions, which he claimed were lies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the same time he denied that his testimony against the defendant was given in exchange for leniency, although he admitted he hoped to receive lighter treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">The defendant called a witness who testified to Hunt\u2019s bias against the defendant. This same witness testified in voir dire that Hunt had told him he expected a lighter sentence in return for his testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury that \u201c[o]ne of the items [defendant\u2019s counsel] brought out was that Mr. Hunt has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is expecting some break. I can assure you from the testimony that Mr. Hunt has given in this case, I don\u2019t know what type of consideration that the Commonwealth could extend to him, but he is going to have to face the full impact of the law j ust on the testimony he has given here before you. And so there is nothing, nothing that I can do for him or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts can do for him. He is going to have to face the music. He has got to face a trial for this just as Mr. Collins has.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b20-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Subsequent to the defendant\u2019s conviction, Hunt offered to plead guilty to murder in the second degree. At a hearing on the matter, the judge asked whether any promises or offers of rewards had been made to Hunt for his plea. In response, the district attorney stated, \u201cYour Honor, may the record indicate, of course from time to time, both Mr. Gibbons and I had suggested to Mr. Gordon [Hunt\u2019s special counsel] and also to the previous counsel [Mr. Hurley] that we would entertain a plea to second degree murder and reduce it from first to second; that is the only promise that was made.\u201d The plea was accepted, and the district attorney requested that the court recommend incarceration somewhere other than the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole, where Collins was confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">Three months later Hunt\u2019s guilty plea was retracted. However, on November 10, 1976, Hunt again pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree. The plea was once again accepted and the district attorney requested that, out of appreciation for Hunt\u2019s testimony, any sentence imposed for the robbery be made concurrent with the sentence for murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">In June, 1979, Hunt testified at a hearing on Collins\u2019s motion for a new trial. He recanted his trial testimony and claimed that Collins was neither involved in the crime nor anywhere near the scene. Once again, he claimed sole responsibility for the robbery and the murder. Mr. Edward N. Hurley was called. He had represented Hunt in regard to the indictments which charged Hunt with murder in the first degree and armed robbery. On or about August 9, 1975, Mr. Hurley had spoken with the district attorney about a possible plea. At a time before his office was aware of Collins\u2019s alleged involvement, the district attorney informed Mr. Hurley that he would recommend a second degree murder sentence in exchange for a plea by Hunt. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Hurley had made this fact known to Hunt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In October, Mr. Hurley had attempted to negotiate a manslaughter plea in exchange for \u201can additional phase of the case uncovered,\u201d but the district attorney had refused to consider a lower plea. Despite this, Hunt met with Springfield detectives that month and implicated Collins.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">When the closing remarks of Assistant District Attorney Gibbons, the prosecutor at the Collins trial, were read to him, Mr. Hurley confirmed that, despite Gibbons\u2019s assertions to the contrary, both he and Hunt were aware, as of August, 1975, that he was going to be able to plead to murder in the second degree. This plea was not, he claimed, conditioned upon Hunt\u2019s testimony against Collins because, at the time the offer was made, there was no expectation that Hunt would testify against anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\"><em>Findings and rulings on the motion for a new trial. </em>Among the findings and rulings issued by the judge who denied the motion for a new trial are the following: (1) The district attorney\u2019s pretrial offer to Hunt to recommend acceptance of Hunt\u2019s plea to murder in the second degree was not motivated by a desire to elicit additional information since, at that time, the district attorney had no knowledge of anyone else\u2019s participation in the crime. The district attorney\u2019s offer had not been accepted by Hunt at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial. (2) Hunt\u2019s implication of Collins was voluntary and was not motivated by a desire for leniency. (3) His recantation at the motion for new trial hearing, however, was false and was motivated by Hunt\u2019s concern for his well-being and by an animosity toward the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">The judge ruled that there was no nexus between Hunt\u2019s trial testimony and the prior recommendation of the district attorney.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, he reasoned that there was no evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>official promises to, or pressure on, Hunt which could be disclosed or used to impeach. The recommendation of leniency itself was not, he ruled, evidence that could impeach Hunt\u2019s credibility. Therefore, he held that it was neither exculpatory nor material, and the prosecutor had no duty to disclose the unaccepted offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The judge likewise ruled against the defendant on the allegation that the prosecutor had permitted the use of perjured testimony, viz., Hunt\u2019s claim that he testified without promises, threat, or pressure. He concluded that since there was no quid pro quo shown for Hunt\u2019s testimony, this statement was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">Finally, the judge considered the closing remarks of the prosecutor at trial. He found that the prosecutor had given the jury the impression that there was nothing he or the Commonwealth could do for Hunt, when in fact he knew he would be likely to recommend a sentence for murder in the second degree in exchange for a plea. The judge ruled that, while the prosecutor was justified in relying on Hunt\u2019s failure to accept an offer which had been outstanding for eight months, the closing was nonetheless misleading. He concluded, however, that the misstatement was not so material as to warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">We disagree. In our view the failure of the prosecutor to disclose the outstanding offer presents a close question, but one that must nevertheless be resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor. When the failure to disclose is coupled with the blatant misrepresentation made by the prosecutor in his closing argument to the jury, the conclusion that the conviction cannot stand is inescapable.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">Evidence tending to impeach the credibility of a key prosecution witness is clearly exculpatory. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, 385 </em>Mass. 165, 175 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>376 Mass. 1, 22 (1978).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The existence of \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>understanding or agreement between the government and a key government witness\u201d is exculpatory evidence which must be revealed to the defendant, provided it is \u201cmaterial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, </em>382 Mass. 166, 175 (1980). <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154-155 (1972). <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959). See <em>DeMarco </em>v. <em>United States, </em>415 U.S. 449, 450 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>367 Mass. 454, 460 (1975). See also <em>Zeigler </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>659 F.2d 254, 263 (1st Cir. 1981) (two-pronged test to determine whether failure to disclose terms of plea bargain requires reversal).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">We have recognized three situations where a failure to disclose material, exculpatory evidence warrants a new trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, supra </em>at 177-178 &amp; n.5, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103-107 (1976). First, where, either through misfeasance or nonfeasance by the prosecutor, false testimony is introduced concerning an arrangement between the witness and the prosecutor, a strict standard of materiality is applied. A conviction will be set aside if there is \u201cany reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>Gilday, supra </em>at 177, quoting from <em>Agurs, supra </em>at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">In addition, when a defendant has made a specific and relevant request for exculpatory evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s failure to respond to such a request will be excused only if \u201cthe error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Gilday, supra </em>at 178, quoting from <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Finally, if the defendant has not requested exculpatory information, or has made only a general <em>Brady </em>request, the failure to disclose will result in a new trial \u201cif the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>exist.\u201d <em>Gilday, supra </em>at 178 n.5, quoting from <em>Agurs, supra </em>at 112. See <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">This case falls within the category of the second and third principles. The defendant\u2019s pretrial motion for exculpatory evidence was granted November 25, 1975. Thus, we conclude that the evidence of the arrangement with Hunt would tend to create a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt which did not exist otherwise. We do not think it necessary, as the motion judge concluded, that such an \u201carrangement\u201d be limited to situations where the favorable recommendation is explicitly hinged on receipt of favorable testimony. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, supra </em>at 176-177. The failure to disclose \u201cmust be evaluated in the context of the entire record. If there is no reasonable doubt about guilt whether or not the additional evidence is considered, there is no justification for a new trial. On the other hand, if the verdict is already of questionable validity, additional evidence of relatively minor importance might be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, supra </em>at 23, quoting from <em>Agurs, supra </em>at 112-113. As the keystone of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, Hunt\u2019s testimony was particularly vulnerable to even slight blows to its credibility. The fact that Hunt had an offer of leniency, and, even more important, one that was in abeyance, was a circumstance which could lead the jury to the conclusion that the witness had reason to seek favor with the government by his testimony. We are aware of the effect that any inference of prosecutorial favoritism might have on a jury\u2019s estimation of a witness\u2019s credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. 755, 760 (1979), and cases cited. Such information was capable of creating a reasonable doubt which did not otherwise exist as to guilt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, supra </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Given the circumstances of this case, however, the omission need not be judged by the reasonable doubt standard. See <em>id. </em>at 23-24 &amp; n.13. At a voir dire, Hunt was specifically asked <em>from </em>the bench whether anyone had made him any promises, and he stated that none had been made.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At that point, the prosecutor was bound to reveal to the court the existence of the outstanding offer of a plea to murder in the second degree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, supra </em>at 173-174.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">This is true even though this offer was made to Hunt at a time when the Commonwealth was unaware of the defendant\u2019s alleged participation in the crime. It was not a quid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>pro quo for Hunt\u2019s testimony at trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Michel, supra </em>at 461-462 (fact finder fully aware of details of negotiations in exchange for witness\u2019s testimony); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bernard, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 499, 508-509 (1978) (defendant was aware of the quid pro quo, cross-examined witness closely as to nature of agreement). The fact that the questions to Hunt were typically phrased in terms of rewards in exchange for testimony saved his answers from constituting perjury. At the same time, such phrasing had the effect of keeping the jury from a clearer perception of the possibility of Hunt\u2019s bias. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>375 Mass. 380, 388-389 (1978). Thus, although the questions to Hunt might have been framed more specifically, and although the cases generally speak in terms of agreements in exchange for testimony, we are of the opinion that their thrust encompasses a request for evidence of <em>any </em>material arrangements between the Commonwealth and its key witness. Contrast <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeLeo, </em>422 F.2d 487, 498-499 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1037 (1970) (even where information material, no prejudice results where defense counsel already has information sought). The failure to disclose such an arrangement was improper. See <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 155; <em>Commonwealth v. Gilday, </em>382 Mass. 166, 175 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">We consider whether, if the arrangement between Hunt and the Commonwealth had been disclosed to the jury, their verdict might have been different. Applying this standard we conclude that the verdict and judgment must be set aside. Having examined the transcripts, we find nothing to assure us that the jury would not have been swayed by knowledge of the agreement. This was not a case where the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was so overwhelming that the consequences of the failure to disclose were only minimal. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>Compare <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, supra </em>at 25, with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, supra </em>at 178-179. The matter was not explored by defense counsel in a manner sufficient to create a \u201csatisfactory substitute for the material withheld.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, supra. </em>It is true that the jury heard Hunt express a hope that he would receive lighter treatment as a result of his testimony. In different circumstances, we might conclude that the jury\u2019s knowledge of the offer of a plea to murder in the second degree would not do damage to the credibility of a witness who had so testified. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bynum, </em>567 F.2d 1167, 1170 (1st Cir. 1978). Cf. <em>Mastrian </em>v. <em>McManus, </em>554 F.2d 813, 823 (8th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Mastrian </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>433 U.S. 913 (1977) (mere general expectation of leniency need not be revealed to jury absent express or implied promise). Here, however, Hunt insisted that he had no reason to expect leniency. Furthermore, within seconds of expressing the hope for leniency, he denied having such hopes. This, when viewed together with the several different accounts of the crime Hunt had given, gave extra weight to the existence of the offer as a factor to be weighed in assessing Hunt\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Though a plea to murder in the second degree would not offer a chance of parole for fifteen years, it is not difficult to weigh its appeal to the witness as compared to a life sentence without hope of parole. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, supra </em>at 20. The jury would be sure to make a similar estimate in comparing Hunt\u2019s different accounts of the crime. We have no doubt that the believability of Hunt\u2019s testimony, vis-a-vis his earlier confessions, was greatly enhanced for the jury by the fact that it appeared to be given under the shadow of a term of life imprisonment. Likewise, we have no doubt that the prosecutor was well aware of this.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\"><em>Prosecutorial error. </em>Even were we to conclude that the failure to disclose the arrangement with Hunt was not grounds for reversal, we have an independent ground for reversal based on that portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>marks which touched on Hunt\u2019s future prospects (see <em>supra </em>at 5). The judge who denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial ruled that \u201cthe closing was misleading to the extent that the prosecutor indicated there was nothing he or the Commonwealth could do for Mr. Hunt where, in fact, he was authorized to recommend a plea to second degree murder.\u201d The judge, however, viewed the misstatement \u201cin light of the totality of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument\u201d and concluded it was not material enough to warrant a new trial. We have viewed the misstatement with regard to the \u201centire circumstances in the case\u201d to reach the opposite conclusion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116, 118 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">As we have said earlier, the prosecutor must have been able to assess the impact on the jury of knowledge of Hunt\u2019s chances after the defendant\u2019s trial. His closing remarks give the appearance of careful construction intended to impart a very definite meaning. Compare <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>DeChristo-foro, </em>416 U.S. 637, 646-647 (1974). The image of Hunt he chose to present to them was not that of a man who had made some arrangements with the authorities to ensure a lesser punishment. Rather, he presented a man who, solely out of principle, had chosen to testify to a series of events which would land him in prison for the rest of his life. In this light, Hunt\u2019s testimony could be cloaked in an aura of credibility in the past attributed to dying declarations. In this context we repeat the language of the United States Supreme Court: \u201cAs long ago as <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Holohan, </em>294 U.S. 103, 112 (1935), this Court made clear that deliberate deception of a court and jurors by the presentation of known false evidence is incompatible with \u2018rudimentary demands of justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 153 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Where such a choice to mislead the jury appears to have been deliberate, and given the extreme significance of Hunt\u2019s credibility to the Commonwealth\u2019s case, we think that this attempt by the prosecutor to bolster it artificially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>warrants a new trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>375 Mass. 284, 297 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_8\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b18-8\"> Another attorney, Mr. Hurley, was in the courtroom during questioning.

Other witnesses provided corroboration of Hunt\u2019s testimony that he and the defendant were together after the crime, but Hunt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>provided the only evidence of the defendant\u2019s presence at the service station. Without Hunt\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth could not have convicted the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Germain, </em>381 Mass. 256, 257 n.3 (1980). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>385 Mass. 165,174 (1982) (witness extremely valuable, though not indispensable).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b24-6\"> The Commonwealth presented virtually no other evidence, apart from Hunt\u2019s testimony, that the defendant and he were together prior to July 10, the day <em>after </em>the crime. The Vermont State trooper testified that on July 12 the defendant had told him that he had picked Hunt up \u201chitchhiking down south.\u201d See note 4, <em>supra. </em>This is some evidence from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the jury could infer that the two were together on July 9, but it is hardly sufficient to create an inference of complicity in the crime. Thus, there is no other evidence to support a conviction of the defendant for participation in the robbery, since a felony-murder conviction could also only flow from Hunt\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b25-7\"> The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-8\">The judge: \u201cDo you understand that the consequences of involving yourself in a murder case are life imprisonment, Walpole State Prison?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-9\">The witness: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-10\">The judge: \u201cThere are no other consequences that can flow from that involvement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-11\">The witness: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-12\">The judge: \u201cYou understand that if the armed robbery \u2014 if you involve yourself in an armed robbery which results in a death that you\u2019re guilty both of the murder and the armed robbery?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-13\">The witness: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-14\">The judge: \u201cAnd that the Judge has no discretion but to sentence you to life imprisonment either for first or second-degree murder?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-15\">The witness: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-16\">The judge: \u201cHas anyone promised you they won\u2019t bring the cases forward?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-17\">The witness: \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-18\">The judge: \u201cHas anyone made any promises to you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-19\">The witness: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-20\">Later the judge asked several other questions in the same vein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-21\">The judge: \u201c[Y]ou are aware that both your counsel are present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-22\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-23\">The judge: \u201cThat neither have offered to have you plead guilty at this moment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-24\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b26-6\"> We note, though, that this is a distinction which might easily be lost on a jury.

I dissent. I agree with the majority that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct here must be examined in light of principles which require the disclosure of material, exculpatory evidence, as well as the principle which requires the prosecutor to speak remedially when he knows that a witness is giving false and misleading testimony as to plea bargaining. Nor should the prosecutor, in argument or otherwise, himself knowingly deceive or mislead the jury. Nevertheless, I think the trial judge was correct in concluding that nothing occurred here to warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">At the time of the trial the prosecutor\u2019s offer to Hunt to recommend a sentence for murder in the second degree had been outstanding and unaccepted by Hunt for more than eight months. More importantly, that offer was made to Hunt <em>before </em>the prosecutor knew of a second person\u2019s involvement. While it may not always be controlling in cases like this that the prosecutor\u2019s offer was not in the nature of a quid pro quo, that fact is certainly highly significant. In this case Hunt was, first and last, offered a second degree recommendation, and it was not a quid pro quo offer. If the jury had known all the circumstances, it is not logical to assume that they would have been significantly influenced in their appraisal of Hunt\u2019s credibility. I have in mind here that the defendant of course had the aid of the jury\u2019s common sense and their knowledge from Hunt\u2019s testimony that he hoped to improve his own situation by his testimony in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>culpating the defendant. The aggressive argument of defense counsel on this issue would not have been stronger or more convincing if all the plea bargaining facts, <em>up to the time of the closing arguments, </em>had been disclosed to the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">It would have been wiser for the prosecutor to have omitted the controversial comment in his closing argument, but our inquiry here should focus on the cause and effect relationship between the prosecutor\u2019s conduct and the conviction of the defendant. Doing that, I conclude, with the trial judge, that what occurred here was \u201cnot so material as to warrant a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-6\"> Defense counsel argued to the jury as follows: \u201c[Hunt] is lying because he wants a short sentence. He is lying because he hopes he will get something out of it. He told you from the witness stand, I hope I will get something out of this. That is why he is testifying here today; that is why he testified the day before yesterday, I beg your pardon, and that is why and for no other reason. Because if he had a conscience, he would have turned Vincent Collins in the very first chance he got and he did not do it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
