It fails to include specifications as required by Rule 27, of the Rules of District Courts (1952), and <em>Okin v. Sullivan, </em>307 Mass. 227, 228; <em>Sokoloski v. Splann, </em>311 Mass. 203, 205, 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">2. The trial judge was not obliged to accept the defendant\u2019s testimony as the true facts. He could disbelieve it as he apparently did in accepting the plaintiff\u2019s evidence as shown by his finding in its favor. It could not be ruled as a matter of law that the plaintiff had failed to prove a <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">3. See opinion of Northrup, J., in the case of <em>Muzi Motors, Inc. v. Caruso, </em>No. 5500 of this Division, and reported in Legalite, Vol. XII, No. 25, August 11, 1961, p. 7, for citations which are applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">The report is to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
