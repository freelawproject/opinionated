After' denying the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings that as matter of law there was no evidence of negligence or other breach of duty by the defendant, the trial judge found for the plaintiff. The defendant now claims to have been aggrieved by the denial of the requested rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">From the reported evidence, the following facts could have been found: The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>entered into a contract with the plaintiff\u2019s landlord, under which the defendant agreed to install and to .connect up existing steam lines in the building with an Edison main in the street. In connection with this work, the defendant installed in the plaintiff\u2019s stockroom, which was located in the basement, a new water return with a hand valve, commonly known as a petcock valve, thereon to \u201cbleed\u201d air out of the system if necessary, since air in this heating system would prevent proper heating. The job was started on <em>November </em>2, 1959 and was supposedly completed on <em>November </em>13, of that year, but tho defendant\u2019s men were back on the premises several times between <em>November </em>13 <em>and November </em>24, 1959 for repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">On <em>November </em>23, 1959 the heating system had gone cold and defendant\u2019s men were there working on the system. It was designed to work automatically, and the occupants of the building had no control over the thermostat and no reason to touch any part of the heating system. When the plaintiff\u2019s store was .closed on <em>November </em>23 the basement was dry. On <em>November </em>24, when an employee of the plaintiff opened the store and went down to the basement, she observed water coming down the wall of the stockroom, one-half inch of water on the floor, water coming out of the petcock on the end of the return pipe in the stockroom, and considerable merchandise wet and damaged. The defendant was notified and when its representative (Matthews) reached the premises, he found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>that the petcock valve on the end of the water return was open and that there was a drip from it. He closed the valve and shortly thereafter he replaced it with a plug which could be turned only with a wrench.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">It was agreed by all counsel at the arguments before us that the escape of steam and water, and the consequent damage to the property of the plaintiff resulted from the fact that the petcock had been opened and 'left open. The only real issue in dispute was whether the trial court was warranted, on all the evidence, in concluding that the valve had been opened and left open by an employee of the defendant .</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">There was no direct, eyewitness testimony as to who had opened the valve. Several employees of the plaintiff testified in substance that neither they, nor to their knowledge any other employee of the plaintiff, had' .ever touched the p\u00e9tcock valve, or had anything to do with the operation of the heating system, which operated automatically. There was no reported evidence indicating that any employee of the plaintiff, or ariy other person .except the employees of the defendant had \"ever touched any part of the heating system from the.time.the defendant had started work on it on <em>November 2, 1959- </em>On the other hand there was uncontroverted evidence that \"the defendant\u2019s men had been back several times after <em>November 13 </em>for repairs and that they were there, working on the heating system, .on <em>November 23, 1959 </em>in response to notice that the system had \u201cgone cold\u201d on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that latter date. While the report contains a summary of pertinent testimony of the defendant\u2019s employee, Matthews, who was working on the heating system in this building on <em>November 23, </em>there is no report of any denial by him that he or some other employee of the defendant then working in the building had had any contact with the petcock on that date.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b162-8\">Morris Karll of Boston, <em>for </em>the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b162-9\">Leo M. Lazo of Boston, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">In the light of all the circumstances we hold that the trial judge could properly infer that on <em>November 23, 1959, </em>while employees of the defendant were working on the heating system, one of them had opened the petcock and had left it open.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">It was not a pre-requisite to such a finding that the evidence positively precluded the possibility that some other person had opened the valve on that date. The plaintiff was required only to show that there was a greater likelihood that negligence on the part of an employee of the defendant caused the damage to the merchandise. <em>Rocray v.
