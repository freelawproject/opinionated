There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>evidence that the right to maintain this drainage pipe was recorded anywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The plaintiffs inspected' the premises before the agreement was signed and saw the drainage pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The defendants did nothing from the time they signed the agreement until the time of trial to remove or have removed the drainage pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The plaintiffs filed requests for rulings, some of which were denied. In acting on two of the requests, the judge filed the following memorandum of findings of facts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">\u201cThe Court rules that the drain pipe located in part on the defendants\u2019 land did not render the defendants\u2019 title unmarketable. The Court finds, if material, that the plaintiffs saw this pipe in its existing location on the defendants\u2019 land when they examined the premises before the agreement to purchase was executed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Claiming to be aggrieved by the denial of their requests and to the quoted ruling of the judge, the plaintiffs claim a report to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 requests for rulings have no standing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">The duty of the Court is to enter proper judgment since the facts and the law are separated. <em>Howland v. Stow, </em>290 Mass. 142, 146; <em>Antoun v. C., </em>303 Mass. 80; <em>Redden v. Ramsey, </em>309 Mass. 225, 227; <em>Associates Discount Corp. v. Gillineau, </em>332 Mass. 490, 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">The only question presented is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>whether the defendants\u2019 title to the land was a marketable title. In the late case of <em>Mishara v. </em>Albion, \u2014\u2014 Mass. \u2014\u2014 wherein the plaintiff sought recovery of a deposit for the sale of land, the Court stated on page 84,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">\"The test of marketability is whether the title is .good beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cleval v. Sullivan, </em>258 Mass. 348, 351; <em>Conley v. Finn, </em>171 Mass. 70, 72; <em>Chauncey v. Leominster, </em>172 Mass. 340, 346; <em>Sullivan v. F. E. Atteaux &amp; Co. Inc., </em>284 Mass. 515, 520; <em>Oliver v. Poulos, </em>312 Mass. 188, 191. The doubt is \"such as would cause a prudent man to pause and hesitate before investing his money.\u201d <em>First African Methodist Episcopal Soc. v. Brown, </em>147 Mass. 296, 298. The title must be \"free from obvious defects, and' subst\u00e1ntial doubts.\u201d <em>O\u2019Meara v. Gleason, 246 </em>Mass. 136, 138. But a mere possibility of a defect in title will not ' relieve the purchaser from liability under his contract. <em>Ryder v. Garden Estates, Inc., </em>329 Mass. 10, 12, and cases cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">As was also stated in the case of <em>Jeffries v. Jeffries, 117 </em>Mass. 184, 187 and restated in <em>Guleserian v. Pilgrim Tr. Co., </em>331 Mass. 431:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">\"It is not necessary that the buyer should satisfy the court that the title is defective so that he ought to prevail at law; it is enough if it appears to be subject to adverse claims which are of such a nature as may reasonably be expected to expose the purchaser to controversy to maintain his title, or rights incident to it. He ought not to be subjected, against his agreement or consent, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>necessity of litigation to remove even that which is only a cloud' upon his title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">A <em>marketabl</em>e <em>title </em>is not one which guarantees no possibility of litigation attacking the title. The registry of deeds records do not reveal any easement in this case. This case is unlike <em>Siegal v. Shaw, </em>337 Mass. 170 wherein the premises were subject to a public sewer easement. In the case in issue, there is no recorded evidence of any drainage easement and although the plaintiffs knew of the drainage line at the time the agreement was executed, this is irrelevant under the parole evidence rule. <em>Harlow v. Thomas, </em>15 Pick. 66, 69; <em>Spurr v. Andrew, </em>6 Allen 420, 422; <em>Queenin v. Blank, </em>268 Mass. 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The question whether the defendants\u2019 title was clear was one of fact with the burden on the plaintiff to prove that the defendants\u2019 title was not good beyond a reasonable doubt, and the defendants did not have a marketable title. <em>Cleval v. Sullivan, </em>258 Mass. 348, 351. It is to be proved by the preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">On the evidence the judge could have concluded that the likelihood of anyone having an easement of drainage by an unrecorded instrument was remote; that any prescriptive right or easement was also remote where there was no evidence of the existence of the drainage pipe prior to seven years ago; that there were no doubts existing which would render the title unmarketable merely because of the existence of the drainage pipes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>over the land of the defendants or which would create a reasonable probability that the plaintiffs would be subjected to litigation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b188-6\">Max L. Rubin of Boston, for the Plaintiffs cited <em>Rubenstein v. Hershon, </em>259 Mass. 288, 294; <em>Conley v. Finn, </em>171 Mass. 70; <em>Arovan v. Fairbanks, </em>216 Mass. 215.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b188-7\">John A.
