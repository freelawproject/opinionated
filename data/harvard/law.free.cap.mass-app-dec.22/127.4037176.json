The only issue presented for determination is the correctness of the allowance of a motion permitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>plaintiff to amend a declaration by adding a count for personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The facts found and reported are based on statements and affidavits of .counsel. It appears there was a collision on January 28, 1959, \u00b0f motor vehicles owned and operated by the parties. A writ in the name of the plaintiff, dated July 20, 1959, returnable August 22, 1959, issued from the office of a Boston attorney on behalf of the assignee of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for property damage. The ad damnum was in the amount of $1,000 and the summons served on the defendant recited the action was for \u201cproperty damage to motor vehicle\u201d. The declaration, in one count, alleged a claim for property damage. Interrogatories of the parties to each other were filed and answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The action was marked for trial on November 2, 1959, but was continued generally at the request of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney of record for the purpose of permitting the plaintiff to protect his rights with respect to his claim for damages for bodily injuries. In March of 1959, the plaintiff retained a Worcester attorney for this purpose. Negotiations for settlement were fruitless, terminating in May of 1959. On March 5, 1960, (after the expiration of the one year statute of limitations) the plaintiff, by his Worcester attorney, filed a motion to amend the declaration by adding a count alleging personal injuries. Over the objection of the defendant the motion was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The power to allow amendments is now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>governed by statutes. G. L. (Ter. E.) c. 231, \u00a751 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">\u201cThe court may, at any time before final judgment, except as otherwise provided, allow amendments introducing a necessary party, discontinuing as to a party or changing the form of the action, and may allow any other amendment in matter of form or substance in any process, pleading or proceeding, <em>which may enable the plaintiff to sustain the action for the cause for which it was intended to be brought, (emphasis supplied) </em>or enable the defendant to make a legal defence\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7138 provides, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\u201cThe cause of action shall be considered to be the same for which the action was brought, if the court finds it to be the cause of action relied on by the plaintiff when the action was. commenced, however the same may be misdescribed; and the allowance by the court of an amendment shall be conclusive evidence of the identity of the cause of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\u201cThe power of court\u201d to allow amendments \u201cis very broad\u201d, <em>Strout v. United Shoe Mach. Co., </em>215 Mass. 116, 119; but \u201cis not unlimited\u201d, <em>Bowen v. Fairfield, </em>260 Mass. 38, 41, <em>Silver v. Jordon, </em>139 Mass. 280. It \u201crests in sound judicial discretion, and .cannot be set aside unless as a matter of law unwarranted on the face of the record or on the facts found\u201d. <em>Gallagher v. Wheeler, </em>292 Mass. 547, 550 and cc. That the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>limitations has run at the time the motion to amend is presented does \u201cnot as matter of law prevent the allowance (of such an) amendment\u201d, Page 552, <em>Gallagher </em>case, and might be \u201cfound to afford additional reason for allowing\u201d it. <em>Johnson v. </em>Carroll, 272 Mass. 134, 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In <em>Church, adm. v. </em>Boylston, 218 Mass. 231, it was held to be error to allow an amendment permitting an administrator to add a count alleging death in an action commenced by the intestate during his lifetime. \u201cIt follows as a matter of law that [the intestate] could not have intended to bring the action originally for his own death\u201d. On similar facts, it is said in <em>Sharpe, exec. v. MTA, </em>327 Mass. 171, 173: \u201cThe plaintiff is not helped by the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7138 that \u2018the allowance by the court of an amendment shall be conclusive evidence of the identity of the cause of action\u2019 as being the same for which the cause of action was brought. This section does not apply where as here, it is plain as a matter of law that the cause of action proposed to be introduced by amendment could not possibly have been the same as that for which the action was originally brought\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">There must be a showing (1) that the .cause of action arose out of the same situation, present here, and (2) that it was originally intended to be included in the pending action, not present here. The attorney who initiated the action was not retained by the plaintiff to prosecute the claim for property damage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>an assignable claim, much less the claim for personal injuries, a non-assignable claim. See <em>Dearden v. Hey, </em>304 Mass. 659, 662. The real party in interest was the plaintiff\u2019s assignee who merely exercised its right to use the plaintiff\u2019s name in the action. A finding of the essential fact that the plaintiff originally intended to bring an action for personal injuries was not warranted on the facts reported. <em>Johnson </em>case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b137-7\">Richard D. Agajanian of Worcester, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b137-8\">Francis C. Reynolds of Boston, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">This case is distinguishable from the <em>Strout </em>and <em>Gallagher </em>.cases where findings of fact were not reported, thereby making the allowance of an amendment conclusive as to identity, and <em>Melanson v. Smith, </em>282 Mass. 85, where, by inadvertance, \u201ca count for injuries to person of the plaintiff\u201d was omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The order allowing the motion to amend is revoked and the action remanded to the district court for further proceedings .consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
