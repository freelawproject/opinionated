J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9C\">As in the recent case of <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 986 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 470, 128 P.3d 675] <em>(Costa), </em>we granted review in this case after a lower court, in an expedited preelection decision, directed that a proposed initiative measure\u2014in this case, Proposition 80\u2014be withheld from the November 8, 2005, election ballot. Unlike the situation presented to this court in <em>Costa, </em>however, in the present case the lower court\u2019s action was not based upon a determination that the initiative failed to comply with a procedural requirement relating to the circulation of the initiative petition. Here, the lower court\u2019s decision rested upon its conclusion that in light of the subject matter of the initiative measure at issue\u2014which concerned energy regulation and contained several provisions conferring additional regulatory authority upon the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC)\u2014the proposed measure was not one that, under the California Constitution, lawfully could be adopted by a vote of the people through the initiative process but rather was one that could be enacted only by the Legislature. Specifically, the Court of Appeal interpreted article XII, section 5 of the California Constitution\u2014which provides in part that \u201c[t]he Legislature has plenary power, unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution but consistent with this article, to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the [PUC]\u201d\u2014to mean that only the Legislature, and not the electorate through the initiative process, has the authority to enact statutory provisions that confer additional authority upon the PUC. In light of its understanding of this constitutional language, the Court of Appeal held that the provisions embodied in Proposition 80 could not be enacted through the initiative process and ordered the Secretary of State to withhold the measure from the November 2005 election ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">At the time the Court of Appeal issued its expedited preelection decision, the period for public inspection of the material to be included in the ballot pamphlet was about to commence. Therefore, the proponents of Proposition 80\u2014real parties in interest in this proceeding\u2014immediately filed an emergency petition for writ of mandate with this court (which we treated as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>petition for review of the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision), challenging the conclusion reached by that court and seeking to have the measure restored to the November 2005 ballot. After considering the emergency petition at conference, we unanimously voted to grant review, issuing an order that stated in part: \u201cAs the Court of Appeal recognized, California authorities establish that \u2018it is usually more appropriate to review constitutional and other challenges to ballot propositions or initiative measures after an election rather than to disrupt the electoral process by preventing the exercise of the people\u2019s franchise, in the absence of some clear showing of invalidity.\u2019 <em>(Brosnahan v. Eu </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 1, 4 [181 Cal.Rptr. 100, 641 P.2d 200].) Because, unlike the Court of Appeal, at this point we cannot say that it is clear that article XII, section 5, of the California Constitution precludes the enactment of Proposition 80 as an initiative matter, we conclude that the validity of Proposition 80 need not and should not be determined prior to the November 8, 2005, election. Accordingly, the Secretary of State and other public officials are directed to proceed with all the required steps to place Proposition 80 in the ballot pamphlet and on the ballot of the special election to be held on November 8, 2005. After that election, we shall determine whether to retain jurisdiction in this matter and resolve the issues raised in the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">Pursuant to our order, Proposition 80 was included in the ballot pamphlet and on the election ballot for the November 8, 2005, election. At that election, the voters rejected Proposition 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">In light of the defeat of Proposition 80 at the November 2005 election, the underlying challenge to that measure itself is moot. Nonetheless, as in <em>Costa, </em>we have concluded that it is appropriate for this court to retain the matter and issue an opinion in order to provide guidance for the future on two general issues presented by the case: (1) the circumstances under which preelection review is warranted for the type of challenge to an initiative measure that is presented in this case\u2014a type of challenge that, as we shall explain, is distinguishable in a significant respect from the type of challenge at issue in Costa\u2014and (2) the important legal issue whether article XII, section 5, of the California Constitution (hereafter, article XII, section 5) precludes the use of the initiative process to enact statutes conferring additional authority upon the PUC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we have reached the following conclusions with respect to these two issues. On the first issue, we explain initially that the general rule set forth in <em>Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 1 <em>(Brosnahan I) </em>\u2014recognizing a strong presumption against preelection resolution of a challenge to an initiative measure\u2014is inapplicable to the challenge raised here, because the challenge is not based on the alleged unconstitutionality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>the substance of the initiative measure but rather on the contention that the measure in question is not the <em>type of measure </em>that may be adopted through the initiative process. Nonetheless, as we further explain, although preelection resolution of this type of a challenge is not presumptively improper, the challenge here at issue\u2014unlike the type of challenge at issue in Costa\u2014 generally will not become moot after an election if the measure is adopted, and thus such a claim reasonably is susceptible to judicial resolution either before or after an election. As a consequence, when such a challenge is brought prior to an election, a court should recognize that the need for an expedited preelection resolution of the claim is less compelling than with regard to the type of claim at issue in <em>Costa. </em>Accordingly, in such a case a court should take into consideration the availability of postelection relief in deciding whether it is preferable to resolve the issue in the often charged and rushed atmosphere of an expedited preelection review, or instead to leave the challenge for resolution with the benefit of the full, unhurried briefing, oral argument, and deliberation that generally will be available after the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">On the second issue, we conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in interpreting article XII, section 5 as precluding the people, through the initiative process, from adopting a statutory provision that grants additional authority to the PUC. Past California decisions establish that language in the California Constitution recognizing the authority of the Legislature to take specified action generally is interpreted to encompass the exercise of such legislative power either by the Legislature or by the people through the initiative process. Although the Court of Appeal was of the view that the specific wording of article XII, section 5 required an exception to this general proposition, as we shall explain the language of that constitutional provision is at most ambiguous. Particularly when this language is read in light of the origin and purpose of the provision, it is clear that the constitutional provision cannot reasonably be interpreted to bar the people, through the initiative process, from enacting a statute or statutes conferring additional authority upon the PUC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the judgment of the Court of Appeal must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">For the past decade and a half, the subject of energy regulation and deregulation has been a significant issue for California government. As explained in the analysis of Proposition 80 prepared by the Legislative Analyst (Voter Information Guide, Special Elec. (Nov. 8, 2005) analysis of Prop. 80 by Legis. Analyst, pp. 50-53 Voter Information Guide)), in the early 1990\u2019s California began a process of restructuring electricity service by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>introducing competition in the generation of electricity, with the ultimate objective of achieving lower rates for consumers. In 1996, the Legislature adopted a deregulation plan that among other things (1) required the large investor-owned utilities (IOU\u2019s) that generated and supplied the bulk of electricity within California\u2014including Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric\u2014to sell their fossil fuel power plants to independent generators, and (2) instituted a transition plan under which the PUC would continue to regulate the rates charged by IOU\u2019s to electricity customers for an interim period, but that was intended ultimately to result in rates determined in a competitive market in which customers alternatively could choose to have an IOU purchase and deliver electricity on their behalf or instead to purchase electric power directly from so-called independent electric service providers (ESP\u2019s). (In addition to IOU\u2019s and ESP\u2019s, electricity also is provided to customers in some areas of California by publicly owned electric utilities, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.) By the late 1990\u2019s, a number of ESP\u2019s had begun operation in California, generally serving large industrial and commercial businesses and some state and local governmental entities. The ESP\u2019s were required to register with the PUC for licensing purposes, but their rates and terms of service explicitly were <em>not </em>subject to PUC regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">In 2000 and early 2001, an energy crisis arose in California in part as a result of sharply increasing electricity demand, lagging investment in new power plants, and other factors that led to electricity shortages and steeply rising electricity prices. In response to the energy crisis, the state began to purchase electricity on behalf of the IOU\u2019s by entering into long-term electricity contracts, and suspended several aspects of the energy deregulation plan pending the expiration of such contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">The initiative measure that ultimately was designated Proposition 80 was drafted to address a number of perceived problems created by the state\u2019s existing energy deregulation plan. The initiative measure included numerous provisions dealing with a range of subjects. For purposes of the issues that we address in this proceeding, the most significant feature is the measure\u2019s proposal to confer upon the PUC additional \u201cjurisdiction, control, and regulation\u201d over the ESP\u2019s, specifying that the scope of such PUC regulation would include the enforcement of requirements relating to energy procurement, contracting standards, and energy efficiency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The proponents submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>a copy of the measure to the Attorney General for preparation of a title and summary, and thereafter circulated for signature a petition setting forth the initiative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">On June 20, 2005, the Secretary of State certified that the measure had obtained the requisite number of signatures to qualify for the ballot, and designated the matter as Proposition 80 to be submitted to the voters at the November 8, 2005, special election. Shortly thereafter, on June 29, 2005, petitioners Independent Energy Producers Association, California Retailers Association, and Steven Kelly (hereafter petitioners) filed an original petition for writ of mandate in the Court of Appeal, seeking preelection review of the measure and contending that in light of the provisions of article XII, section 5, \u201c[a] constitutional amendment would be required to confer on the people the right to use the statutory initiative to implement [the] changes\u201d proposed by Proposition 80. The petition requested that the Court of Appeal issue a writ directing the Secretary of State to refrain from submitting the initiative measure to the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">On July 5, 2005, the Court of Appeal, after an initial review of the petition, issued an alternative writ of mandate. Because the deadline for submitting the ballot pamphlet to the state printer for the November 8, 2005, election was August 15, 2005, the court ordered expedited briefing and oral argument, directing real parties in interest to file a return by July 11 and petitioners to file a replication by July 15, and setting oral argument for July 20. The Court of Appeal heard oral argument as scheduled, issuing its opinion two days later on July 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>Initially, with regard to the procedural question of preelection review, the Court of Appeal noted that although as a general rule court review of an initiative measure is more appropriate after an election, \u201cthis general rule applies only to a claim that a substantive provision of the initiative is unconstitutional; it does not apply where the electorate lacks the power to adopt the proposal in the first instance.\u201d Because, in the court\u2019s view, \u201cProposition 80 is unquestionably invalid on its face because ... it runs afoul of a plain and unambiguous provision of our state Constitution . . . that effectively precludes use of the initiative process to accomplish what Proposition 80 proposes to do,\u201d the Court of Appeal concluded that \u201cpreelection review is proper, indeed essential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">In reaching its determination on the merits of the constitutional claim, the appellate court concluded that the language of article XII, section 5 \u201cplainly and unambiguously\u201d grants only the Legislature, and not the people through the initiative process, the power to grant additional authority upon the PUC. Because that court viewed the language of article XII, section 5 as unambiguous, it dismissed the contention of real parties in interest that the background and origin of this constitutional language must properly be considered in interpreting the provision and that such history demonstrates that the language in question cannot reasonably be interpreted as a limitation on the scope of the initiative power. Finally, having determined that the provisions of Proposition 80 purporting to confer additional authority upon the PUC could not be adopted by initiative, the Court of Appeal went on to conclude that those provisions were not severable from the remainder of the initiative measure. Accordingly, the court ruled that a writ of mandate should issue directing the Secretary of State to refrain from taking any steps to place Proposition 80 in the ballot pamphlet or on the November 8, 2005, election ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">As noted above, after the Court of Appeal issued its opinion, real parties in interest filed an emergency petition for writ of mandate in this court, challenging the Court of Appeal\u2019s removal of Proposition 80 from the ballot. Treating the document as a petition for review, we granted review. Observing that \u201cunlike the Court of Appeal, at this point we cannot say that it is clear that article XII, section 5, of the California Constitution precludes the enactment of Proposition 80 as an initiative measure,\u201d we concluded that the validity of Proposition 80 \u201cneed not and should not be determined prior to the November 8, 2005, election.\u201d We directed the Secretary of State and other public officials to proceed with all the steps required to place Proposition 80 in the ballot pamphlet and on the special election ballot, and stated that after the election we would determine whether to retain jurisdiction in this matter and resolve the issues raised in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>Pursuant to our order, the materials related to Proposition 80 were included in the ballot pamphlet and the voters were given the opportunity to vote on the measure at the November 8, 2005, special election. At that election, Proposition 80 was defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">Because Proposition 80 was not adopted by the voters, the legal challenge to the measure is now moot. Nonetheless, as in our recent decision in <em>Costa, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th 986, 1005, we conclude that it is appropriate to retain jurisdiction and issue an opinion in this matter to provide future guidance on two issues: (1) the circumstances under which preelection review is appropriate for the type of constitutional challenge here at issue, and (2) the question whether article XII, section 5 precludes the use of the initiative power to confer additional authority upon the PUC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">As noted above, our order granting review cited and relied upon the general statement in <em>Brosnahan I, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 1, 4, that \u201cit is usually more appropriate to review constitutional and other challenges to ballot propositions or initiative measures after an election rather than to disrupt the electoral process by preventing the exercise of the people\u2019s franchise, in the absence of some clear showing of invalidity.\u201d As we pointed out in our recent decision in <em>Costa, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th, 986, 1005, however, \u201cin <em>Senate of the State of Cal. v. Jones </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1142 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 810, 988 P.2d 1089] <em>(Senate v. Jones), </em>we noted that decisions after <em>Brosnahan I </em>\u2018have explained that this general rule applies primarily when a challenge rests upon the alleged unconstitutionality of the substance of the proposed initiative, and that the rule does not preclude preelection review when the challenge is based upon a claim, for example, that the proposed measure may not properly be submitted to the voters because the measure is not legislative in character or because it amounts to a constitutional revision rather than an amendment. [Citations.]\u2019 (21 Cal.4th at p. 1153.)\u201d Under the authorities cited in <em>Senate v. Jones, </em>preelection review of an initiative measure may be appropriate when the challenge is not based on a claim that the substantive provisions of the measure are unconstitutional, but rests instead on a contention that the measure is not one that properly may be enacted <em>by initiative. </em>(See, e.g., <em>American Federation of Labor v. Eu </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 687 [206 Cal.Rptr. 89, 686 P.2d 609] [initiative may not be used to apply for the convening of a federal constitutional convention]; <em>McFadden v. Jordan </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 330 [196 P.2d 787] [initiative may not be used to revise, rather than to amend, California Constitution].) Because the claim raised here is that the California Constitution permits only the Legislature, and not the people through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>initiative process, to confer additional authority upon the PUC, the decisions noted in <em>Senate </em>v. <em>Jones </em>establish that preelection review of such a claim is not necessarily or presumptively improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Nonetheless, although the strong presumption against preelection review does not apply to such a claim, we believe it is appropriate for a court presented with this type of preelection challenge to keep in mind that unlike the type of procedural challenge relating to the petition-circulation process at issue in our recent decision in <em>Costa, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th 986\u2014a type of claim that, as explained in <em>Costa, </em>generally can be remedied only prior to an election and that usually will become moot after an election (see <em>id. </em>at pp. 1006-1007)\u2014a contention that an initiative measure is invalid because the measure cannot lawfully be enacted through the initiative process is a type of claim that generally will <em>not </em>become moot if the initiative is approved by the voters at the election. (See, e.g., <em>Bramberg v. Jones </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1045 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 319, 978 P.2d 1240] [postelection decision invalidating initiative that instructed, and indirectly attempted to coerce, federal and state legislators to propose a specific federal constitutional amendment]; <em>Raven </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 336, 349-356 [276 Cal.Rptr. 326, 801 P.2d 1077] [postelection decision invaliding one section of Proposition 115 as a constitutional \u201crevision\u201d that could not be adopted by initiative].) Because this type of claim is potentially susceptible to resolution either before or after an election, there is good reason for a court to be even more cautious than when it is presented with the type of procedural claim at issue in <em>Costa </em>before deciding that it is appropriate to resolve such a claim prior to an election rather than wait until after the election. Of course, as this court noted in <em>Senate v. Jones, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 1142, 1154, potential costs are incurred in postponing the judicial resolution of a challenge to an initiative measure until after the measure has been submitted to and approved by the voters,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and such costs appropriately can be considered by a court in determining the propriety of preelection intervention. Nonetheless, because this type of challenge is one that can be raised and resolved after an election, deferring judicial resolution until after the election\u2014when there will be more time for full briefing and deliberation\u2014often will be the wiser course.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">As explained above, in the present case the Court of Appeal intervened prior to the election and directed that the initiative measure be removed from the ballot only after concluding that the measure was \u201cunquestionably invalid on its face.\u201d In light of that court\u2019s view on the merits, its decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>intervene prior to the election is understandable. Because, unlike the Court of Appeal, from our initial review prior to the election we were not convinced that article XII, section 5 properly should be interpreted to preclude the enactment of Proposition 80 through the initiative process, we granted review and directed that the proposition be placed on the November 8, 2005, election ballot, deferring a definitive judicial resolution of the issue until after the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">In light of the defeat of Proposition 80 at the November 8, 2005, election, the legal challenge to that initiative measure is moot. Nonetheless, because the Court of Appeal decision\u2014although no longer published or citable in light of our grant of review (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 976(d))\u2014potentially may cast doubt on the constitutional viability of any future initiative measure that purports to confer additional authority upon the PUC (an issue likely to recur), and because it appears preferable to have the question of the proper interpretation of article XII, section 5 resolved in a setting that affords the opportunity for full briefing, oral argument, and unrushed deliberation, we have concluded it is appropriate to retain the case to resolve the issue by opinion in this proceeding. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that article XII, section 5 does not preclude the use of the initiative power to confer additional authority upon the PUC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">Although the question before us ultimately involves the proper interpretation of article XII, section 5, the resolution of this issue implicates the meaning and scope of additional provisions of the California Constitution\u2014article IV, section 1, and article II, section 8, relating to the people\u2019s initiative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">California Constitution article IV, section 1 (hereafter, article IV, section 1) provides in full: \u201cThe legislative power of this State is vested in the California Legislature which consists of the Senate and Assembly, <em>but the people reserve to themselves the powers of initiative and </em>referendum.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">California Constitution article II, section 8, subdivision (a) (hereafter, article II, section 8) provides in full: \u201cThe initiative is the power of the electors to propose statutes and amendments to the Constitution and to adopt or reject them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>In describing the initiative power in <em>Associated Home Builders etc. Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 582 [135 Cal.Rptr. 41, 557 P.2d 473] this court explained: \u201cThe amendment of the California Constitution in 1911 to provide for the initiative and referendum signifies one of the outstanding achievements of the progressive movement of the early 1900\u2019s. Drafted in light of the theory that all power of government ultimately resides in the people, the amendment speaks of the initiative and referendum, not as a right granted the people, but as a power reserved by them. Declaring it \u2018the duty of the courts to jealously guard this right of the people\u2019 [citation], the courts have described the initiative and referendum as articulating \u2018one of the most precious rights of our democratic process\u2019 [citation]. \u2018[I]t has long been our judicial policy to apply a liberal construction to this power whenever it is challenged in order that the right be not improperly annulled. If doubts can reasonably be resolved in favor of the use of this reserve power, courts will preserve it.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (18 Cal.3d at p. 591, fns. omitted; see also <em>Carlson v.

State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 245 [279 Cal.Rptr. 325, 806 P.2d 1360] <em>(Kennedy </em>Wholesale) is a representative and instructive case in point. In <em>Kennedy Wholesale, </em>this court addressed a multi-pronged constitutional challenge to Proposition 99, an initiative measure passed by the voters that increased the tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products and allocated the revenue of the increased tax to meet various tobacco-related problems. The plaintiff\u2019s initial claim in <em>Kennedy Wholesale </em>was that Proposition 99 violated the provisions of article XIII A, section 3 of the California Constitution (hereafter, article XIH A, section 3), which, in 1991, specified in relevant part: \u201cany change in State taxes enacted for the purpose of increasing revenues . . . must be imposed by an Act passed by no less than two-thirds of all members elected to each of the two houses of the Legislature . . . .\u201d The plaintiff in <em>Kennedy Wholesale </em>asserted that these words in article XIII A, section 3 signify \u201cthat only the Legislature can raise taxes.\u201d (53 Cal.3d at p. 249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Although the court in <em>Kennedy Wholesale </em>recognized that the literal language of article XIII A, section 3 was susceptible to the plaintiff\u2019s proposed interpretation, it rejected the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that it was appropriate to enforce this provision \u201caccording to its \u2018plain meaning\u2019 without considering the section\u2019s history or other indications of the voters\u2019 intent\u201d <em>(Kennedy Wholesale, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 249). The court concluded instead that the provision \u201cis ambiguous when read in the context of the whole Constitution.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Pointing to the language of article IV, section 1, reserving to the people the powers of initiative and referendum, the court noted that \u201c[t]o interpret [article XIII A, section 3] as giving the Legislature <em>exclusive </em>power to raise taxes would implicitly repeal article IV, section 1, pro tanto. [Article XIII A, sjection 3, however, does not even mention the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>initiative power, let alone purport to restrict it.\u201d (53 Cal.3d at p. 249.) The court further reasoned: \u201c[T]o avoid repeals by implication \u2018we are bound to harmonize . . . constitutional provisions\u2019 that are claimed to stand in conflict. [Citation.] In addition, because plaintiff is arguing for a limitation on the initiative power, we must also bear in mind that the initiative power is \u2018 \u201c \u2018one of the most precious rights of our democratic process\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [citations] and that we must <em>\u2018resolve any reasonable doubts in favor of the exercise of this precious right.\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d (53 Cal.3d at pp. 249-250.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Having concluded that article XIII A, section 3 was ambiguous when read in the context of the entire Constitution, the court in <em>Kennedy Wholesale, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 245, went on to consider the voters\u2019 intent in adopting article XIII A, section 3 as part of Proposition 13 and observed: \u201cNothing in the official ballot pamphlet supports the inference that the voters intended to limit their own power to raise taxes in the future by statutory initiative. To the contrary, the arguments in favor of Proposition 13 adopt a populist theme that cannot easily be reconciled with plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the measure.\u201d (53 Cal.3d at p. 250.) Accordingly, the court in <em>Kennedy Wholesale </em>ultimately concluded that article XIII A, section 3 could not reasonably be interpreted to preclude the voters from utilizing the initiative power to raise taxes. (53 Cal.3d at pp. 250-251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Other California cases have reached a similar conclusion when faced with analogous claims. In <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1295 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 526] <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund), </em>for example, an insurance company challenged a provision of Proposition 103, a statutory initiative measure authorizing an increase in the rate of the insurance premium tax imposed on insurers pursuant to article XIII, section 28 of the California Constitution. When Proposition 103 was adopted in 1989, article XIII, section 28 provided in pertinent part: \u201c(b) An annual tax is hereby imposed on each insurer doing business in this state ... at the rates . . . hereinafter specified. ... HO ... H] (d) The rate of the tax to be applied to the basis of the annual tax in respect to each year is 2.35 percent. . . . [f] (h) The taxes provided for by this section shall be assessed by the State Board of Equalization. [][] (i) <em>The Legislature, a majority of all the members elected to each of the two houses voting in favor thereof, may by law change the rate or rates of taxes herein imposed upon </em>insurers.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">In <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 1295, the plaintiff insurer contended in part that although article XIII, section 28, subdivision (i), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>authorized <em>the Legislature </em>to change the rate of taxes otherwise specified by the Constitution itself, the provision did not authorize <em>the people through the initiative process </em>to modify such rates. Observing that \u201c \u2018[t]he reserved power to enact statutes by initiative is a legislative power, one that would otherwise reside in the Legislature,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c[a]part from procedural differences, the electorate\u2019s lawmaking powers are identical to the Legislature\u2019s\u201d (14 Cal.App.4th at p. 1300), the appellate court in <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>rejected the insurer\u2019s contention. That court concluded that \u201cthe constitutional grant of power to the Legislature in article XIII, section 28, subdivision (i), entails a similar grant of power to the electorate to legislate through the initiative process.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1299.) In reaching this conclusion, the court pointedly noted that \u201c[t]he language \u2018the Legislature may\u2019 is found throughout article XIII <em>and in many other places in the California Constitution. It would be absurd to attribute to the framers of the Constitution an intention to limit the initiative power in the many and varied contexts in which the phrase appears.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 1300, fns. omitted, italics added.) (See also <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Cory, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d 724, 728-729.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">The Court of Appeal below found <em>Kennedy Wholesale </em>and the other cases we have cited distinguishable from the present case, because the constitutional provisions at issue in those cases did not contain the language\u2014\u201cThe Legislature has plenary power, unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution . . .\u201d\u2014that appears in article XII, section 5. The Court of Appeal concluded that the quoted language plainly and unambiguously precludes the use of the initiative power to confer additional authority upon the PUC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeal initially relied upon a number of dictionaries that define \u201cplenary\u201d to mean \u201ccomplete,\u201d \u201cabsolute,\u201d or \u201cunqualified,\u201d declaring that \u201cthe usual and ordinary meaning of the phrase \u2018plenary power\u2019 connotes total power, <em>to the exclusion of all others.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Real parties in interest take issue with the Court of Appeal\u2019s understanding of the term \u201cplenary,\u201d pointing out that the word \u201cexclusive\u201d does not appear in the dictionary definitions cited by the Court of Appeal, and that in other contexts courts explicitly have rejected the contention that the term \u201cplenary power\u201d means exclusive power. (See, e.g., <em>Natural Resources v. Upper Val. Landfill </em>(1997) 167 Vt. 228 [705 A.2d 1001, 1008] [\u201cDefendants argue that by granting the superior court \u2018plenary powers\u2019 . . . , the Legislature intended to grant the superior court exclusive jurisdiction. Defendants\u2019 construction is contrary to the plain meaning of \u2018plenary,\u2019 which means \u2018complete\u2019 and \u2018unqualified,\u2019 not exclusive. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1038 (5th ed. 1979)\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>In further support of its reading of the constitutional provision in question, the Court of Appeal maintained that the additional language in article XII, section 5 stating that the Legislature\u2019s plenary power is \u201cunlimited by the other provisions of this constitution\u201d can be interpreted <em>only </em>to include and preempt the provisions of the California Constitution relating to the initiative power. Real parties in interest argue, however, that it is by no means clear that this language properly must or should be interpreted to refer to or trump the constitutional provision reserving the people\u2019s right to enact legislation through the initiative power, pointing out that the Court of Appeal\u2019s expansive reading of this language logically would signify that a statute passed by the Legislature pursuant to article XII, section 5 would not be subject to <em>any </em>provision of the California Constitution, including, for example, the provision authorizing the Governor to veto a bill approved by the Legislature. (Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 10.) Real parties in interest maintain that the language in article XII, section 5 has not been, and reasonably cannot be, interpreted so expansively to exclude the application of provisions like those relating to the initiative power or the gubernatorial veto. (Cf. <em>S. H. Chase Lumber Co. v. Railroad Com. </em>(1931) 212 Cal. 691, 702-706 (lead opn. of Richards, J.), 707 (conc. opn. of Seawell, <em>J.) </em>[300 P. 12] [interpreting language of constitutional predecessor of art. XII, \u00a7 5 as preserving private property owners\u2019 constitutional rights in eminent domain actions as guaranteed by art. I, former \u00a7 14 (now art. I, \u00a7 19) of the California Constitution].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Particularly in light of the numerous past California authorities holding that constitutional references to the Legislature\u2019s authority to take specified action generally are not interpreted to limit the initiative power, we agree with real parties in interest that the language relied upon by the Court of Appeal is not unambiguous and cannot reasonably be interpreted <em>only </em>as having the effect of precluding the people\u2019s exercise of their reserved initiative power. Rather, we conclude that the wording of the provision at most creates an ambiguity, and that it is appropriate and necessary to consider the origin and background of this constitutional language to determine whether, in light of the purpose and objective of the constitutional provision, it is reasonable to interpret it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>the manner proposed by the Court of Appeal. As we shall explain, our examination of the background and purpose of this constitutional provision leads us to conclude that the view adopted by the Court of Appeal is not the most reasonable interpretation of this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">The crucial language of article XII, section 5\u2014\u201c[t]he Legislature has plenary power, unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution but consistent with this article, to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the commission\u201d\u2014derives from a constitutional provision relating to the administrative predecessor of the PUC, the Railroad Commission, that was enacted through a constitutional amendment approved by the voters at a special statewide election held on October 10, 1911. The measure in question\u2014Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 6 (ACA No. 6)\u2014 substantially amended former section 22 of article XII, a provision included in the 1879 Constitution that created and granted specified authority to a state railroad commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">ACA No. 6 proposed a significant revision of the composition, selection, and power of the then existing Railroad Commission. The measure expanded the number of railroad commissioners from three to five, provided for the appointment of all commissioners by the Governor rather than by election from districts, and spelled out the broad power of the commission to establish rates and to examine the books, records, and papers of all railroad and other transportation companies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The measure also included the following paragraph: \u201cNo provision of this constitution shall be construed as a limitation upon the authority of the legislature to confer upon the railroad commission additional powers of the same kind or different from those conferred herein which are not inconsistent with the powers conferred upon the railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>commission in this constitution, and the authority of the legislature to confer such additional powers is expressly declared to be plenary and unlimited by any provision of this constitution.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">As noted, the voters approved ACA No. 6 at the October 1911 election, and the amended version of article XII, section 22 became part of the Constitution. The constitutional language in question was carried over when article XII, section 22 was amended in 1946 to change the name of the Railroad Commission to the Public Utilities Commission. In 1974, as part of a comprehensive revision of article XII that reorganized and greatly reduced the length and complexity of the prior constitutional provisions related to public utilities, the language initially adopted in 1911 was revised and moved to article XII, section 5, with no change in meaning intended. (See Cal. Const., art. XII, \u00a7 9 [\u201cThe provisions of this article restate all related provisions of the Constitution in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this amendment and make no substantive change\u201d].) Accordingly, it is appropriate to consider the purpose and intent of this language, as initially incorporated into the California Constitution in 1911, in arriving at the most reasonable interpretation of the present constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">In 1911, the election statutes provided for the preparation and mailing to the voters, prior to an election, of a document similar to the current ballot pamphlet, containing the text of each proposed constitutional amendment that would appear on the ballot along with legislatively prepared statements setting forth reasons for and against the adoption of each proposed amendment. (See former Pol. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1195, 1195a, enacted by Stats. 1909, ch. 154, \u00a7 1, p. 254, Stats. 1909, ch. 142, \u00a7 1, p. 245.) With regard to the constitutional amendment proposed by ACA No. 6, the argument in favor of the measure\u2014after detailing all of the specific changes in the Railroad Commission\u2019s composition and powers proposed by the measure\u2014explained the reasons underlying the pertinent language of ACA No. 6 as follows: \u201cFinally, it is proposed to amend the section so as to remove all doubt of the right of the legislature to confer additional powers upon the commission. Under the amendment as presented for adoption, the legislature may give to the railroad commission such powers as it sees fit without any restriction whatever, provided only that the powers thus given are not inconsistent with the powers specifically conferred in the constitution.\u201d (Sect. of State, Proposed Amends. to Const. with Legislative Reasons, Special Elec. (Oct. 10, 1911), Reasons Why ACA No. 6 Should Be Adopted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">The constitutional amendment embodied in ACA No. 6 was part of the reform program of the progressive movement that had gained control of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>California Legislature and the governorship in the preceding election (see Key &amp; Crouch, The Initiative and Referendum in Cal. (1938) pp. 433-436), and additional insight into the background and purpose of the constitutional language in question is provided by a passage contained in the first inaugural address of Governor Hiram Johnson, the leader of the progressive movement, that was delivered on January 3, 1911. In a portion of the address discussing the so-called railroad question, Governor Johnson stated in part: \u201cFor many years in the past shippers, and those generally dealing with the Southern Pacific Company, have been demanding protection against the rates fixed by that corporation. The demand has been answered by the corporation by the simple expedient of taking over the government of the State; and instead of regulation of the railroads, as the framers of the new Constitution [that is, the Constitution of 1879] fondly hoped, the railroad has regulated the State. [][] To Californians it is quite unnecessary to recall the motive that actuated the framers of the new Constitution when Article XII was adopted. It was thought that the Railroad Commission thereby created would be the bulwark between the people and the exactions and extortions and discriminations of the transportation companies. That the scheme then adopted has not proved effective has become only too plain. That this arose because of the individuals constituting the Railroad Commission is in the main true, but it is also apparent there has been a settled purpose on the part of the Southern Pacific Company not only to elect its own Railroad Commission, but also whenever those Commissioners made any attempt, however feeble, to act, to arrest the powers of the Commission, and to have those powers circumscribed within the narrowest limits. All of us who recall the adoption of the new Constitution will remember that we then supposed the most plenary powers were conferred upon the Commission. It has been gravely asserted of late, however, by those representing the Railroad Company, and they insist that in the decisions of our courts there is foundation for the assertion, that the Constitution does not give the Commission power to fix absolute rates. ... [][].. . [][] It is asserted that some ambiguity exists in the portion of the language of Section 22 of Article XII of the Constitution, which fixes the penalty when any railroad company shall fail or refuse to conform to rates established by the Commission or shall charge rates in excess thereof, and it is claimed that the use of the last phrase \u2018or shall charge rates in excess thereof\u2019 excludes the power to punish discrimination [in rates] by the railroad companies. The rational construction of the language used can lead to no such conclusion; <em>but if you believe there is any ambiguity in the constitutional provision as it now exists, or any doubt of the power conferred by it upon the Railroad Commission, I would suggest that this matter be remedied by a constitutional </em>amendment.\u201d (Gov. Hiram Johnson, Inaugural Address (Jan. 3, 1911) Assem. J. (1911 Sess.) pp. 48-49, italics added.) The amendment of former section 22 of article XII, embodied in ACA No. 6, apparently was a direct response to Governor Johnson\u2019s suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>In light of the ballot argument in favor of ACA No. 6, and the portion of Governor Johnson\u2019s inaugural address quoted above, it seems evident that the intent of the constitutional language in question was simply to make clear the existence of broad legislative power to grant the Railroad Commission <em>any </em>additional authority that was deemed necessary for the commission\u2019s proper regulation of the conduct of railroad companies, and to eliminate any potential legal argument that other provisions of the Constitution\u2014such as the provision barring railroads from imposing rates in \u201cexcess of\u2019 the approved rates\u2014should be interpreted to limit the type of authority that could be conferred upon the Railroad Commission. Nothing in this material suggests that this provision was intended to grant such authority to the Legislature alone, to the exclusion of any other entity that might then or thereafter possess legislative power to confer authority upon the Railroad Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Indeed, under the broader view provided by the historical background of the entire October 1911 election, it is even clearer that it would be unreasonable for us to interpret the constitutional language in question in the manner suggested by the Court of Appeal. The constitutional amendment containing the language at issue was only one part of a much broader reform program championed by the progressive movement. The October 1911 special election contained a quite extraordinary array of more than 20 proposed constitutional amendments, and perhaps the most prominent of all the measures placed before the voters at that special election were the proposed constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>amendments creating and incorporating into the California Constitution the electorate\u2019s rights of initiative, referendum, and recall.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\">Governor Hiram Johnson, in a separate part of his first inaugural address that preceded the passage quoted above relating to the Railroad Commission, emphasized the central importance of the initiative, the referendum, and the recall to the fundamental objectives of the progressive movement, declaring: \u201cHow best can we arm the people to protect themselves . . . ? If we can give to the people the means by which they may accomplish such other reforms as they desire, the means as well by which they may prevent the misuse of the power temporarily centralized in the Legislature, and an admonitory and precautionary measure which will ever be present before weak officials, and the existence of which will prevent the necessity for its use, then all that lies in our power will have been done in the direction of safeguarding the future and for the perpetuation of the theory upon which we ourselves shall conduct this government. This means for accomplishing other reforms has been designated the \u2018Initiative and the Referendum,\u2019 and the precautionary measure by which a recalcitrant official can be removed is designated the \u2018Recall.\u2019 And while I do not by any means believe the initiative, the referendum, and the recall are the panacea for our political ills, yet they do give to the electorate the power of action when desired, and they do place in the hands of the people the means by which they may protect themselves. I recommend to you, therefore, and I most strongly urge, that the first step in our design to preserve and perpetuate popular government shall be the adoption of the initiative, the referendum, and the recall. I recognize that this must be accomplished, so far as the State is concerned, by constitutional amendment. But I hope that at the earliest possible date the amendments may be submitted to the people, and that you take the steps necessary for that purpose.\u201d (Gov. Hiram Johnson, Inaugural Address (Jan. 3, 1911) Assem. J. (1911 Sess.) pp. 47-48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">The Legislature responded by submitting (among many other measures) two proposed constitutional amendments to the voters at the October 10, 1911, special election, one relating to the initiative and referendum (Sen. Const. Amend. No. 22, amending Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 1 (SCA No. 22)) and the other relating to the recall (Sen. Const. Amend. No. 23, adding Cal. Const., art. XXIII). The argument in favor of the adoption of the measure relating to the initiative and referendum stated in part: \u201cObjection has been made that these powers would deprive the legislature of its functions. ... [f] It is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>intended and will not be a substitute for legislation, but will constitute that safeguard which the people should retain for themselves, to supplement the work of the legislature by initiating those measures which the legislature either viciously or negligently fails or refuses to enact; and to hold the legislature in check, and veto or negative such measures as it may viciously or negligently enact. All objections finally and ultimately center in a distrust of democracy; in a challenge of the people to govern themselves. The voters are to decide by the adoption, or rejection, of this amendment to the constitution, as to whether self-government is a success or failure; as to whether the people believe in themselves. . . . [][] Are the people capable of self-government? If they are, this amendment should be adopted. If they are not, this amendment should be defeated.\u201d (Sect. of State, Proposed Amends. to Const. with Legislative Reasons, Special Elec. (Oct. 10, 1911), Reasons Why SCA No. 22 Should Be Adopted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Both the measure relating to the initiative and referendum and the measure relating to the recall passed overwhelmingly, each by more than a three-to-one favorable vote. (See Sect, of State, Statement of the Vote of California, Special Elec. (Oct. 10, 1911), p. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">When the October 10, 1911, election is viewed as a whole, it appears most improbable that\u2014at the same election in which the voters overwhelmingly approved a far-reaching measure incorporating a broad initiative power as part of the California Constitution\u2014they intended, without any direct or explicit statement to this effect, to <em>limit </em>the use of the initiative power by virtue of the language set forth in ACA No. 6. Indeed, the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of the language of article XII, section 5 is all the more problematic when considered in light of the progressive movement\u2019s historic distrust of the Southern Pacific Railroad and of that entity\u2019s perceived ability to elect and control the members of the California Legislature. Because, as indicated by the quoted passage from Governor Johnson\u2019s inaugural address (see, <em>ante, </em>pp. 1038-1039), the proponents of these constitutional amendments strongly believed that the Southern Pacific\u2019s earlier control over the Legislature and the Railroad Commission had stymied effective regulation of the Southern Pacific in the past, it defies reason to suggest that those who drafted and those who voted to adopt the constitutional language in question intended to single out the jurisdiction and authority of the Railroad Commission as the one subject area in which the people\u2019s reserved right to initiate legislation could <em>not </em>be exercised, even if the need should arise. Viewing the constitutional language in context, we conclude it is much more reasonable to harmonize with each other the initiative and Railroad Commission constitutional amendments adopted at the October 1911 special election, and to interpret them as authorizing the people, through the initiative process, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>adopt statutory provisions granting additional authority or jurisdiction to the Railroad Commission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Accordingly, in view of the long-standing California decisions establishing that references in the California Constitution to the authority of the Legislature to enact specified legislation generally are interpreted to include the people\u2019s reserved right to legislate through the initiative power, and in light of the background and purpose of the relevant language of article XII, section 5, we conclude that this constitutional provision does not preclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>people, through their exercise of the initiative process, from conferring additional powers or authority upon the PUC.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the judgment of the Court of Appeal must be reversed. Because Proposition 80 was defeated at the November 8, 2005, election, the challenge to that proposition in this proceeding is moot. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the matter is remanded to that court with directions to dismiss the proceeding as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., Moreno, J., and Corrigan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-6\"> Among other changes, the initiative proposed (1) to add to section 218.3 of the Public Utilities Code\u2014the existing section defining \u201celectric service provider\"\u2014the following sentence: \u201cAn electric service provider is subject to the jurisdiction, control, and regulation of the commission, and the provisions of this part, pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 394,\u201d and (2) to add a new subdivision (f) to Public Utilities Code section 394, providing: \u201cRegistration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>with the commission is an exercise of the licensing function of the commission, and registration by an electric service provider constitutes agreement of the electric service provider to the jurisdiction, control, and regulation of its rates and terms and conditions of service by the commission.

Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 47 (SCA No. 47) proposed amending article XU, former section 23 to grant the Legislature the authority to significantly expand the power of the Railroad Commission by affording the commission the authority to supervise and regulate <em>all </em>\u201cpublic utilities\u201d-\u2014not only railroad and other transportation companies\u2014and by defining \u201cpublic utility\u201d very broadly. After setting forth its broad definition of public utility, the measure went on to provide: \u201cThe railroad commission shall have and exercise such power and jurisdiction to supervise and regulate public utilities in the State of California, and to fix the rates to be charged for commodities furnished, or services rendered by public utilities as shall be conferred upon it by the legislature, <em>and the right of the legislature to confer powers upon the railroad commission respecting public utilities is hereby declared to be plenary and to be unlimited by any provision of this </em>constitution.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XII, former \u00a7 23, as amended by voters, Oct. 10, 1911, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">Unlike the argument relating to ACA No. 6, the argument in favor of SCA No. 47 did not specifically discuss the italicized language of the proposed amendment, but, as with ACA No. 6, nothing in the materials related to SCA No. 47 suggests that this language was intended to exclude the potential use of the initiative power in this area. SCA No. 47 was approved by the people at the October 1911 election, and the language in question remained a part of article XII, former section 23 until the comprehensive revision of article XU in 1974, when this language, along with the similar language in article XII, former section 22, was revised and moved to article XU, section 5. (See <em>County of Sonoma v. State Energy Resources Conservation etc. Com. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 361, 366-368 [220 Cal.Rptr. 114, 708 P.2d 693].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1079-6\"> In addition to the provisions relating to the initiative, referendum, and recall and those revising and expanding the authority of the Railroad Commission, the October 10, 1911, ballot contained significant measures relating, among other subjects, to women\u2019s suffrage, civil service, workers\u2019 compensation, biennial legislative sessions, harmless error in criminal cases, and local home rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1081-6\"> Although we agree with the ultimate conclusion advanced by real parties in interest, we find one portion of their argument unpersuasive. In addition to including the language quoted above, from which the current language of article XII, section 5 is derived, ACA No. 6 specified: \u201cThe provisions of this section shall not be construed to repeal in whole or in part any existing law not inconsistent herewith, and the \u2018Railroad Commission Act\u2019 of this state approved February 10, 1911, shall be construed with reference to this constitutional provision <em>and any other constitutional provision becoming operative concurrently herewith. </em>And the said act shall have the same force and effect as if the same had been passed after the adoption of this provision of the constitution <em>and of all other provisions adopted concurrently herewith, </em>except that the three commissioners referred to in said act shall be held and construed to be the five commissioners provided for herein.\u201d (Italics added.) Real parties in interest suggest that this passage\u2019s reference to other constitutional provisions that might be adopted concurrently with ACA No. 6 likely was to the initiative constitutional amendment that also was on the October 10, 1911, ballot, and they maintain that \u201c[t]he clear implication of this language is that, if the initiative provisions in SCA [No.] 22 should pass, they would apply to allow amendments by initiative to the Railroad Commission Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">In our view, it is much more likely that this passage in ACA No. 6 was intended to refer to a number of other constitutional amendments on the October 10, 1911, ballot that dealt specifically with the powers of the Railroad Commission, rather than to the initiative amendment. As noted above (see, <em>ante, </em>p. 1040, fn. 6), SCA No. 47 on the October 1911 ballot contained a proposed amendment to article XU, former section 23 authorizing the Legislature to expand the Railroad Commission\u2019s jurisdiction to include a wide range of public utilities. In addition, Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 50 (ACA No. 50) on the same ballot contained a proposed amendment to article XU, former sections 20 and 21 that, among other matters, required a railroad company to obtain permission from the Railroad Commission before raising rates and explicitly authorized the Railroad Commission to grant exemptions from a separate constitutional provision that generally prohibited a railroad from charging a lower rate for a long haul than for a short haul. We believe it is much more reasonable to interpret the language of ACA No. 6 as directing that the Railroad Commission Act \u201cshall be construed with reference\u201d to these other measures related to the Railroad Commission, rather than as requiring that the Railroad Commission Act be construed with reference to the initiative measure. (See Sect. of State, Proposed Amends, to Const. with Legislative Reasons, Special Elec. (Oct. 10, 1911), Reasons Why ACA No. 50 Should Be Adopted [\u201cThe amendment is one of the series composed of Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 47 and Assembly Constitutional Amendments Nos. 6 and 50, and as an amendment in the direction of efficient railroad rate regulation should unquestionably be ratified by the people\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">Accordingly, contrary to the argument of real parties in interest, we conclude that the reference in ACA No. 6 to other constitutional provisions considered at the same election provides no additional support for their position. Nonetheless, for the other, more persuasive reasons discussed above, we conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in its interpretation of article XII, section 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1082-8\"> To avoid any potential misunderstanding, we emphasize that our holding is limited to a determination that the provisions of article XII, section 5 do not preclude the use of the initiative process to enact statutes conferring additional authority upon the PUC. We have no occasion in this case to consider whether an initiative measure relating to the PUC may be challenged on the ground that it improperly <em>limits </em>the PUC\u2019s authority or improperly conflicts with the Legislature\u2019s exercise of <em>its </em>authority to expand the PUC\u2019s jurisdiction or authority. Should these or other issues arise in the future, they may be resolved through application of the relevant constitutional provision or provisions to the terms of the specific legislation at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
