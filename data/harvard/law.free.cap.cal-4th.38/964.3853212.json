We granted review in this case to consider whether the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1340 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Knox-Keene Act) creates an exemption to these prohibitions when a licensed specialized health care service plan sublets space within the retail stores of a registered dispensing optician and employs optometrists to provide professional optometric services to plan subscribers at those locations. The Court of Appeal held that although the provisions of the Knox-Keene Act establish an exemption to the rule against the corporate practice of optometry, they do not affect the statutory prohibitions on the relationships between registered dispensing opticians and licensed optometrists. On the facts of this case, we agree with the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion. We therefore affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">California law authorizes optometrists licensed by the California Board of Optometry and physicians licensed by the Medical Board of California (Medical Board) to perform eye examinations and write prescriptions for contacts and eyeglasses. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2003, 2050, 3010.1, 3041, 3041.2, 3042, 3055.) After receiving a prescription, a consumer may get the prescription filled not only by optometrists and physicians who sell eyewear as part of their practice, but also by registered dispensing opticians <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>(RDO\u2019s), i.e., dispensing opticians registered with the Division of Licensing of the Medical Board. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2543, 2550, 2553, 3041, 3042.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">California law contains restrictions on the relationships that licensed optometrists and physicians may have with others involved in providing optical services, including RDO\u2019s. At issue here are the restrictions contained in Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556. The former prohibits: (1) licensed optometrists from having \u201cany membership, proprietary interest, coownership, landlord-tenant relationship, or any profit sharing arrangement in any form, directly or indirectly,\u201d with an RDO or \u201cwith any person who is engaged in the manufacture, sale, or distribution to physicians and surgeons, optometrists, or dispensing opticians of lenses, frames, optical supplies, optometric appliances or devices or kindred products\u201d; and (2) RDO\u2019s from having any such arrangement with a licensed optometrist. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 655, subds. (a), (b), (c).) \u201cAny violation of this section constitutes a misdemeanor as to\u201d the licensed optometrist involved in the violation \u201cand as to any and all persons . . . who participate with\u201d the optometrist \u201cin [the] violation.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 655.) Business and Professions Code section 2556, as here relevant, makes it \u201cunlawful\u201d for RDO\u2019s \u201cto advertise the furnishing of, or to furnish, the services of ... an optometrist,\u201d or \u201cto directly or indirectly employ or maintain on or near the premises used for optical dispensing, ... an optometrist.\u201d \u201cAny person who violates\u201d this section \u201cis guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2558.) Courts have described the \u201cbasic aim\u201d of these statutes as being \u201cthe elimination of the chance of dominion of the professional decisions of the practitioner by commercial interest.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Drucker v. State Bd. of Med. Examiners </em>(1956) 143 Cal.App.2d 702, 712 [300 P.2d 197].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">California law also restricts the relationships that optometrists may have with corporations. In general, under California\u2019s long-standing \u201cpolicy . . . against [the] corporate practice of the learned professions,\u201d for-profit corporations \u201cmay not engage in the practice of . . . medicine.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pacific Health Corp. </em>(1938) 12 Cal.2d 156, 158-159 [82 P.2d 429 <em>(Pacific Health).) </em>The ban on the corporate practice of medicine generally precludes for-profit corporations\u2014other than licensed medical corporations\u2014 from providing medical care through either salaried employees or independent contractors. <em>(Ibid.; Conrad v. Medical Bd. of California </em>(1996) 48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>Cal.App.4th 1038, 1047-1048 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d. 901] [discussing exceptions].) It has been held applicable with respect to optometrists. <em>(California Assn. of Dispensing Opticians v. Pearle Vision Center, Inc. </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 419, 427 [191 Cal.Rptr. 762] <em>(CADO).) </em>Courts have said that the ban on the corporate practice of medicine \u201cis intended to ameliorate \u2018the evils of divided loyalty and impaired confidence\u2019 which are thought to be created when a corporation solicits medical business from the general public and turns it over to a special group of doctors, who are thus under lay control.\u201d <em>(Conrad </em>v. <em>Medical Bd. of California, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1042-1043.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Defendant Pearle Vision, Inc., operates optical stores across the country where, in a single location, consumers may obtain not only frames and contact lenses, but also eye examinations and other treatment from licensed optometrists. In the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s, Pearle Vision Centers, Inc., which was the operating subsidiary of Pearle, Inc.\u2019s corporate predecessor, attempted to bring this business model to California, by selling franchises to optometrists licensed in California. The California Association of Dispensing Opticians sued Pearle Vision Centers, Inc., arguing that its franchise program violated California law. The superior court issued both a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction prohibiting Pearle Vision Centers, Inc., from offering franchises to optometrists in California. <em>(CADO, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at pp. 422-423.) In 1983, a Court of Appeal upheld the superior court\u2019s order, finding in part that by virtue of the control Pearle Vision Centers, Inc., retained under the franchise agreement, it was engaging in the illegal corporate practice of optometry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(CADO, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at pp. 426-128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">In 1986, with the case against Pearle Vision Centers, Inc., still pending, the Pearle entities adopted a new strategy for bringing their operations to California; as defendants here explained in the Court of Appeal, \u201c[i]nstead of franchising its stores to [licensed] optometrists,\u201d the Pearle entities \u201cdivided [their] operations in California in two, with\u201d defendant Pearle Vision, Inc., \u201cproviding the services of opticians and a separate corporation,\u201d defendant Pearle VisionCare, \u201cemploying optometrists and providing their services under the Knox-Keene Act.\u201d Pearle Vision, Inc. (Pearle RDO), is an RDO; as such, it provides eyeglasses, contacts, and related fitting services using prescriptions written by licensed optometrists and ophthalmologists. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2550.) Pearle VisionCare (VisionCare) is a licensed \u201cspecialized health care service plan\u201d under the Knox-Keene Act, which means that it \u201cundertakes to arrange for the provision of health care services [in a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>specialized area] to subscribers or enrollees, or to pay for or to reimburse any part of the cost for those services, in return for a prepaid or periodic charge paid by or on behalf of the subscribers or enrollees.\u201d (\u00a7 1345, subd. (f)(1).) Operating under a license issued by the director of the Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) (see \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1349), VisionCare provides, through licensed optometrists it employs or contracts with, eye examinations to individuals who pay a set enrollment fee. VisionCare\u2019s optometrists provide these examinations inside Pearle RDO\u2019s retail stores, in distinct areas set off from the rest of the store, at some locations by separate doors or internal walls. VisionCare sublets these areas from Pearle RDO. To perform examinations, VisionCare\u2019s optometrists use optometric equipment provided by Pearle RDO. Thus, as defendants explained in the Court of Appeal, \u201csince 1986,\u201d Pearle RDO and VisionCare \u201chave been operating in California in parallel within the same storefronts,\u201d i.e., \u201cthe \u2018Pearle Vision Stores.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Pearle RDO and VisionCare are sister corporations; they are both wholly owned subsidiaries of Pearle, Inc. Pearle, Inc.\u2019s sole assets are shares of VisionCare and Pearle RDO. Thus, Pearle, Inc., through its subsidiaries, operates retail outlets where customers can get both eye examinations from optometrists\u2014who are employed by VisionCare\u2014and glasses from an optician\u2014Pearle RDO. Pearle RDO advertises the availability of eye examinations at its retail optical stores; some of these advertisements state that eye examinations are performed by independent doctors of optometry, or that doctors in California are employed by VisionCare. According to defendants, Pearle RDO and VisionCare adopted this business \u201cmodel\u201d in order \u201cto provide consumers with integrated optical services\u201d by offering \u201coptometrists\u2019 services in close proximity to affiliated eyewear stores operated by\u201d RDO\u2019s.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">In February 2002, the People filed this action against Pearle, Inc., Pearle RDO, VisionCare, other related entities, and individuals who allegedly had served as officers and/or directors of these entities. In their first amended complaint, the People alleged in relevant part: (1) that Pearle RDO had violated Business and Professions Code section 17500 by disseminating advertisements that were untrue or misleading in that they implied that Pearle RDO can and does provide optometric services (including eye examinations) and the services of optometrists, when in fact Pearle RDO is prohibited by law from providing such services and maintaining an optometrist on or near its premises; (2) that Pearle RDO had violated Business and Professions Code section 2556\u2014and, in turn, Business and Professions Code section 17200, which prohibits unfair competition in the form of an unlawful business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>practice\u2014by advertising the furnishing of optometrists and maintaining optometrists for the purpose of examining and treating eyes on or near premises used for optical dispensing; and (3) that Pearle RDO\u2019s relationship with VisionCare \u201cand [VisionCare\u2019s] optometrists\u201d violates Business and Professions Code section 655 and, in turn, Business and Professions Code section 17200. For relief, the People requested that the court impose civil penalties for the alleged violations and permanently enjoin Pearle RDO and VisionCare from disseminating false or misleading advertising and from violating Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">In April 2002, the People moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Pearle RDO from violating Business and Professions Code section 2556 by advertising the furnishing of optometric services, including eye examinations. In opposition, defendants argued that the challenged advertisements were not untrue, misleading or unlawful, because they specified that all eye examinations are performed, not by Pearle RDO, but by optometrists employed by VisionCare. In July 2002, the superior court granted the motion and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Pearle RDO from disseminating advertisements in California that have \u201cthe tendency or capacity to mislead the unwary or trusting consumer that [Pearle RDO] . . . employs optometrists within the State of California.\u201d Regarding the latter prohibition, the court added the following proviso: \u201c[A]ny [Pearle RDO] advertisement. . . which references \u2018eye examination^],\u2019 \u2018exam[s],\u2019 \u2018examination^],\u2019 \u2018doctor[s],\u2019 \u2018optometrists],\u2019 or uses the image of a doctor is not enjoined if it prominently and, in close proximity to such word or image, states or displays: \u2018[Pearle RDO] does not employ Doctors of Optometry and does not provide eye exams in California. [VisionCare] . . . , a licensed vision health care service plan, provides eye exams in California.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Defendants appealed from the order granting the preliminary injunction, arguing in part that the Knox-Keene Act \u201crelieves\u201d specialized health care service plans \u201cof restrictions on employing doctors, optometrists, and other health care professionals by providing\u201d in section 1395, subdivision (b) (section 1395(b)) \u201cthat [plans] licensed under the Knox-Keene Act \u2018shall not be deemed to be engaged in the practice of a profession, and may employ, or contract with, any professional ... to deliver services.\u2019 \u201d The People cross-appealed, arguing that the preliminary injunction did not go far enough and, under Business and Professions Code section 2556, should have prohibited <em>all </em>advertising by Pearle RDO that mentions eye examinations, regardless of the inclusion of a disclaimer stating that VisionCare, rather than Pearle RDO, provides eye examinations. Regarding section 1395(b), the People argued that this provision merely establishes an \u201cexception regarding the corporate practice of optometry\u201d and \u201cdoes not change the laws that separate the practice of optometry from dispensing opticians/eyeglass retailers\u201d or \u201cpermit opticians to practice or advertise the practice of optometry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>After the parties completed their briefing, the Second District Court of Appeal, in a published opinion, addressed related questions in <em>Consumer Cause, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Vision, Inc. </em>(Cal. App.), which we ordered depublished March 3, 2004, S119959 <em>(Consumer Cause). </em>That case involved an RDO that had set up optician centers in retail stores and, through a subsidiary licensed as a specialized health care service plan, had provided the services of licensed optometrists and ophthalmologists in separate but nearby offices within the retail stores. The Court of Appeal held that Health and Safety Code section 1395 expressly exempted both the licensed specialized health care service plan and its parent company, the RDO, from the restrictions of Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The parties in this case, at the Court of Appeal\u2019s request, submitted additional briefs addressing the relevance of <em>Consumer Cause. </em>After receiving those briefs and hearing oral argument, the Court of Appeal held that the trial court had properly enjoined Pearle RDO\u2019s advertising, but had erred in allowing Pearle RDO to advertise eye examinations with a disclaimer. It thus ordered the superior court to expand the injunction to prohibit <em>all </em>advertising by Pearle RDO of optometric services. In so holding, the court expressly disagreed with <em>Consumer Cause </em>and concluded, based on \u201cthe plain language of\u2019 the statute, that section 1395(b) \u201conly . . . provide[s] an exception for Knox-Keene-approved corporations from the requirement that optometrists may only be employed by professional corporations.\u201d It \u201cdoes <em>not,\u201d </em>the court stated, either \u201cexpressly or impliedly . . . create an exemption from the restrictions on relationships between optometrists/ophthalmologists and opticians/optical retailers provided in Business and Professions Code sections 655 or 2556.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">We granted the petition for review filed by Pearle RDO and VisionCare, limiting the issue to whether the Knox-Keene Act \u201cexempt[s] approved providers under the Act from the limitations that Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 otherwise impose on business and financial relationships between dispensing opticians and optometrists or ophthalmologists.\u201d We simultaneously ordered that the decision in <em>Consumer Cause </em>not be published.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">This case requires us to determine the meaning and interrelationship of several statutes. \u201cAs in any case involving statutory interpretation, our fundamental task is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent so as to effectuate the law\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 136, 142 [105 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 387, 19 P.3d 1129].) The rules for performing this task are well established. We begin by examining the statutory language, giving it a plain and commonsense meaning. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We do not, however, consider the statutory language in isolation; rather, we look to the entire substance of the statutes in order to determine their scope and purposes. <em>(Ibid.) </em>That is, we construe the words in question in context, keeping in mind the statutes\u2019 nature and obvious purposes. <em>(Ibid) </em>We must harmonize the various parts of the enactments by considering them in the context of the statutory frame work as a whole. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If the statutory language is unambiguous, then its plain meaning controls. If, however, the language supports more than one reasonable construction, then we may look to extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history. <em>(In re Young </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 900, 906 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 48, 87 P.3d 797].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">1. <em>The Statutory Language Supports the People\u2019s Interpretation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">As often happens in cases involving statutory interpretation, both sides in this case argue that the plain meaning of the statutory language supports their position. The statute the parties focus on is section 1395(b), which provides: \u201cPlans licensed under this chapter shall not be deemed to be engaged in the practice of a profession, and may employ, or contract with, any professional licensed pursuant to Division 2 (commencing with Section 500) of the Business and Professions Code to deliver professional services. Employment by or a contract with a plan as a provider of professional services shall not constitute a ground for disciplinary action against a health professional licensed pursuant to Division 2 (commencing with Section 500) of the Business and Professions Code by a licensing agency regulating a particular health care profession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Defendants assert that the \u201cplain language\u201d of this provision \u201cmakes it clear that Knox-Keene plans are exempted from the restrictions found in\u201d Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They reason as follows: As here relevant, Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 apply only to relationships of or with licensed professional optometrists. The first clause of section 1395(b), by providing that Knox-Keene plans are not \u201cengaged in the practice of a profession,\u201d establishes that Knox-Keene plans are not licensed professional optometrists. Because, under the first clause, \u201ca Knox-Keene plan <em>itself </em>is not a professional,\u201d it is \u201cnot subject to . . . statutory restrictions that apply to individual professionals,\u201d including Business and Professions Code sections 655 or 2556. The second clause of section 1395(b) \u201creinforces\u201d this conclusion by \u201cgranting] Knox-Keene plans the authority to employ or contract with \u2018any professional licensed pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>to Division 2 [of the Business and Professions Code],\u2019 i.e., both optometrists and RDO\u2019s.\u201d This clause \u201cunconditionally] authorizes]\u201d Knox-Keene plans \u201cto employ or contract with \u2018any\u2019 health care professional\u201d and \u201cspecifically permit[s]\u201d them \u201cto establish various employment and contractual relationships with both optometrists <em>and </em>RDO\u2019s,\u201d notwithstanding Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556. Finally, the second sentence of section 1395(b), in providing that \u201c[e]mployment by or a contract with a plan as a provider of professional services shall not constitute a ground for disciplinary action against a [licensed] health professional,\u201d establishes that \u201cprofessionals may contract with plans\u201d and that \u201cneither an optometrist nor an RDO who is employed by or contracts with a Knox-Keene plan is in violation of Business and Professions Code [section] 655 or [section] 2556.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">According to defendants, \u201c[t]he net effect of these plainly written provisions\u201d is to \u201cexempt[] the relationships challenged\u201d in this case \u201cfrom the limitations on business and financial relationships between RDO\u2019s and optometrists contained in [Business and Professions Code] sections 655 and 2556.\u201d Taken together, they \u201cspecifically negate[] anything in [Business and Professions Code] sections 655 and 2556 that would make it illegal for an optometrist to be employed by a plan that contracts with an RDO or optical company, or for an RDO to contract with a plan that employs optometrists.\u201d As here relevant, they establish that (1) \u201ca Knox-Keene plan employing an optometrist may lease space from an optical company because the status of Knox-Keene plans as non-professionals, reinforced by the right of Knox-Keene plans to \u2018contract with\u2019 professionals to provide professional services, renders [Business and Professions Code section] 655 inapplicable to a lease of space to a Knox-Keene plan\u201d; and (2) \u201coptometrists and RDO\u2019s who enter into these arrangements with VisionCare cannot be disciplined under [Business and Professions Code] sections 655 or 2556 for doing so.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>Defendants also make the broader claim that through section 1395(b), \u201cthe Legislature specifically designed the Knox-Keene Act\u201d to make \u201ctraditional corporate practice restrictions <em>inapplicable </em>to Knox-Keene plans.\u201d In place of these restrictions, defendants assert, the Legislature made Knox-Keene plans subject to a \u201ccomprehensive . . . regulatory scheme . . . designed in substantial part to address <em>precisely </em>[the same] concern\u201d\u2014\u201ccommercial interference with optometrists\u2019 professional judgment.\u201d According to defendants, Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 \u201care precisely the type of \u2018corporate practice restrictions that the Legislature intended to override for health care service plans.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Consistent with the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding, the People argue that the \u201cplain language\u201d of section 1395(b) \u201ccreate[s] only a narrow employment exemption and not [the] broad based commercial practice exemption\u201d defendants assert. According to the People, the first sentence of this provision \u201cis aimed at [Knox-Keene] plans\u201d and \u201cclarifie[s]\u201d that such plans are \u201cnot subject to prosecution for the unauthorized practice of the healing arts merely because [they] employ or contract with healing-arts professionals for the delivery of services to members. Prior to Knox-Keene, this arrangement was unlawful.\u201d The provision\u2019s second sentence, the People argue, is aimed at \u201clicensed professional providers,\u201d and simply establishes a complementary exemption for qualifying \u201c \u2018professional person[s]\u2019 \u201d from the \u201chistorical prohibition\u201d against \u201cworking for non-professionals.\u201d Thus, although the People agree that section 1395(b) both authorizes Knox-Keene plans to \u201cemploy or contract with RDO\u2019s and optometrists,\u201d and establishes that Knox-Keene plans are not professionals, they disagree that it \u201crelieve[s]\u201d Knox-Keene plans or their \u201cproviders\u201d\u2014here, VisionCare\u2019s optometrists\u2014 \u201cfrom any other obligations imposed upon them by the Business and Professions Code.\u201d Nor do the People agree that section 1395(b) \u201crelieve[s]\u201d Pearle RDO, \u201cby virtue of [its] association with\u201d VisionCare, \u201cof the limitations\u201d in Business and Professions Code section 655 \u201con financial relationships with optometrists\u201d or \u201cthe prohibition\u201d in Business and Professions Code section 2556 \u201cagainst advertising the furnishing of optometric examinations.\u201d In short, the People argue, VisionCare\u2019s \u201cstatus as a Knox-Keene plan does not shield [its] <em>providers </em>from <em>their </em>obligations under the Business and Professions Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">In evaluating these conflicting interpretations, it is useful to begin by examining defendants\u2019 alternative characterizations of Business and Professions Code section 655 and 2556 as \u201crelationship restrictions,\u201d \u201ccommercial-relationship restrictions,\u201d \u201ccommercial-practice restrictions,\u201d or \u201ccorporate practice restrictions.\u201d In a 1982 report to the Legislature, the California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) identified four different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>types of \u201c[Commercial practice restrictions\u201d relating to optometry: (1) \u201c[prohibitions against the employment of optometrists by commercial corporations\u201d; (2) \u201c[prohibitions against landlord-tenant relationships between optometrists and opticians\u201d; (3) \u201c[Restrictions on the number of branch offices an optometrist can operate\u201d; and (4) \u201c[Restrictions on the use of trade names.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (DCA, Commercial Practice Restrictions in Optometry (Dec. 1982) Introduction (DCA Report).) In a 1989 rulemaking proceeding, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) identified these same \u201ctypes\u201d of \u201c[s]tate restrictions on commercial practice,\u201d although it characterized the first two as different \u201cforms\u201d of a broader \u201ctype\u201d of restriction on \u201clay affiliations\u201d with optometrists. (54 Fed.Reg. 10286 (Mar. 13, 1989).) Thus, it appears that California\u2019s ban on the corporate practice of optometry\u2014i.e., employment of optometrists by for-profit corporations\u2014and its restrictions in Business and Professions Code section 655 and 2556 on the relationships optometrists may have with RDO\u2019s and manufacturers, are properly characterized as different types of commercial practice restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">With this understanding in mind, we agree with the People\u2019s reading of the statutes in question. Defendants\u2019 broad claim that the Legislature enacted Health and Safety Code section 1395(b) specifically to make restrictions like Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 inapplicable to Knox-Keene plans finds little support in the statutory language. As the People observe, the \u201clanguage of section 1395(b) mentions only employment and contracting relationships between [Knox-Keene] plans and providers,\u201d and contains \u201cno mention ... of other, broader-based commercial relationship exemptions\u201d and no \u201creference to [Business and Professions Code] sections 655 and 2556.\u201d As the People also observe, the language of Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 \u201cextends well beyond employment and contracting relationships and forbids a variety of acts, such as profit sharing, proprietary interests and stock ownership.\u201d Thus, as the People argue, adopting defendants\u2019 broad claim would require us to find that the Legislature \u201cintend[ed] to create an unstated exemption by implication to allow plans or their providers to do business outside the parameters of\u2019 other commercial practice restrictions, including Business and Professions Code section 655 and 2556. Had the Legislature intended section 1395(b) to apply to all forms of lay affiliations with optometrists, as defendants contend, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>would not have used language limited to \u201cemploy[ing], or contract[ing] with\u201d licensed professionals \u201cto deliver professional services.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1395(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">In this regard, section 1395(b) stands in marked contrast to the immediately preceding subdivision, section 1395, subdivision (a), which provides that Knox-Keene plans may advertise \u201c [n] otwithstanding Article 6 (commencing with Section 650) of Chapter 1 of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code.\u201d Had the Legislature intended to create the broad exemption defendants posit, it no doubt would have included similar language in section 1395(b). That the Legislature did not include such language suggests it did not intend to establish a broad exemption rendering inapplicable any provision of the Business and Professions Code that could be classified as a \u201ccorporate practice\u201d or \u201crelationship\u201d restriction. It is unlikely the Legislature would have established such a far-reaching exemption without being more specific about the particular restrictions being overridden, especially given the specificity of the language it used in subdivision (a) of section 1395.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Defendants\u2019 broad claim is also inconsistent with other provisions of the Knox-Keene Act. As noted above, among the types of commercial practice restrictions are restrictions on using trade names and having branch offices. In separate provisions of the Knox-Keene Act, the Legislature has specified that California\u2019s statutory restrictions on using trade names remain applicable to \u201cspecialized health care service plans\u201d like VisionCare (\u00a7 1366, subd. (b)), and that the restrictions in \u201cthe Business and Professions Code\u201d on the number of branch offices remain applicable to licensed \u201cprofessional^] . . . who [are] employed by, or under contract to, a plan.\u201d (\u00a7 1395, subd. (d).) In still another provision, the Legislature has specified that \u201c[e]xcept as <em>specifically </em>provided in [the Knox-Keene Act], nothing in [the Knox-Keene Act] shall be construed to limit the effect of the laws governing professional corporations, as they appear in applicable provisions of the Business and Professions Code, upon specialized health care service plans.\u201d (\u00a7 1395, subd. (f), italics added.) These provisions belie defendants\u2019 claim that the Legislature \u201cdesigned the Knox-Keene Act to render [all] corporate practice prohibitions inapplicable\u201d either to Knox-Keene plans\u2014especially specialized Knox-Keene plans like VisionCare\u2014or to licensed professionals performing professional services for those plans.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>Finally, defendants\u2019 broad claim is inconsistent with the provisions of the Business and Professions Code. The article of that code containing Business and Professions Code section 655 also contains provisions that prohibit specified licensed health care professionals from: (1) making referrals for certain services if they have \u201ca financial interest with the person or in the entity that receives the referral\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 650.01, subd. (a)); (2) billing for \u201cclinical laboratory service[s] not actually rendered by\u201d them \u201cor under\u201d their \u201cdirect supervision,\u201d without identifying the laboratory actually performing the service <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 655.5, subd. (a)); (3) \u201cemploy[ing]\u201d licensed hearing aid dispensers \u201cfor the purpose of fitting or selling hearing aids\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 655.2); and (4) billing for certain \u201ccytologic services . . . not actually rendered by\u201d them \u201cor under\u201d their \u201cdirect supervision.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 655.6, subd. (a).) As to each of these prohibitions, the Legislature has enacted an <em>express, </em>but limited, exception that applies under certain circumstances where a Knox-Keene plan is involved.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">These express exceptions are significant for several reasons. First, as amicus curiae CMA notes, they show that \u201cwhere the Legislature want[s] to exempt health plans from\u201d commercial restrictions in the Business and Professions Code, \u201cit clearly knows how to do so.\u201d The absence of similar provisions establishing express exceptions to Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 makes defendants\u2019 broad interpretation less plausible. Second, the existence of these express exceptions is inconsistent with defendants\u2019 view that section 1395(b) renders, or was intended to render, all commercial practice restrictions in the Business and Professions Code inapplicable where Knox-Keene plans are involved.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Were defendants correct, these express exemptions would be superfluous. The rules of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>construction direct us to avoid, if possible, interpretations that render a part of a statute surplusage. (See <em>Fontana Unified School Dist. v. Burman </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 208, 221 [246 Cal.Rptr. 733, 753 P.2d 689]; <em>Stafford v. Realty Bond Service Corp. </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 797, 805 [249 P.2d 241].) Finally, it is significant that the Legislature, in expressly establishing Knox-Keene exceptions to commercial practice restrictions appearing in the same article of the code as Business and Professions Code section 655, made those exceptions limited. These express exceptions apply only to licensed professionals affiliated with \u201ca comprehensive group practice\u201d Knox-Keene plan (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 655.2), or only to health care services \u201cprovided to an enrollee of a\u201d Knox-Keene plan <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 650.02, subd. (i)) or to a \u201cmember[] of [a] plan on a prepaid basis\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 655.5, subd. (e), 655.6, subd. (d)(1)). That the Legislature carefully limited the Knox-Keene exemptions it expressly established casts substantial doubt on defendants\u2019 broad claim that, through section 1395(b), the Legislature <em>implicitly </em>established (or intended to establish) an <em>unlimited </em>exception that renders the commercial relationship restrictions in Business and Professions Code section 655 (or Business and Professions Code section 2556) <em>wholly </em>inapplicable when Knox-Keene plans are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Indeed, the express exemptions discussed above highlight a practical problem with defendants\u2019 position: defining the scope of the exemption they assert. As the People rightly ask, under defendants\u2019 interpretation, \u201cwhat happens to practitioners who provide services for both Knox-Keene plan members as well as the general public?\u201d Does the exemption defendants assert apply to services such practitioners provide to those who are not members of the Knox-Keene plan, or is it limited to services provided to plan \u201cenrollee[s]\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 650.02, subd. (i)) or \u201cmembers\u201d? <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 655.5, subd. (e), 655.6, subd. (d)(1).) Does it apply to optometrists and RDO\u2019s affiliated with any Knox-Keene plan, or only to those affiliated with \u201ca comprehensive group practice\u201d Knox-Keene plan? <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 655.2.) May an optometrist and RDO employed by a Knox-Keene plan, neither of whom is regulated under the Knox-Keene Act, enter into a separate and otherwise prohibited profit-sharing agreement just between the two of them? As demonstrated by the limitations in the express statutory exemptions discussed above, these are the kinds of questions the Legislature would address in establishing a Knox-Keene exception to Business and Professions Code sections 655 or 2556. Defendants appear to argue that Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 are <em>wholly </em>inapplicable to Knox-Keene plans and professionals who contract with or are employed by Knox-Keene plans. However, given the limitations on the <em>express </em>exceptions the Legislature has enacted, we have no basis to accept defendants\u2019 view that the Legislature <em>implicitly </em>established, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>or intended to establish, an <em>unlimited </em>exception. Nor have we any basis for determining which of the possible limitations the Legislature would have chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Defendants argue that insofar as these express exceptions relate to statutory restrictions that were \u201cfirst enacted . . . <em>after </em>passage of the Knox-Keene Act\u201d (see fn. 12, <em>ante) </em>they have \u201cno bearing\u201d on the issue here. \u201cUnder such circumstances,\u201d they contend, \u201cit is not at all surprising that the statute would specifically address the new statute\u2019s relationship with the Knox-Keene Act.\u201d By contrast, defendants assert, because Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 were enacted before the Knox-Keene Act, there is \u201cno reason to expect\u201d they would include language \u201caddressing the effect of the Knox-Keene Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Defendants\u2019 argument is suspect in light of several legislative actions in 1979. In 1975, when the Knox-Keene Act was passed, Business and Professions Code former section 3103 (renumbered as Business and Professions Code section 3109 as of January 1, 2005), declared it to be \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d for a licensed optometrist to \u201caccept[] employment to practice optometry from . . . any company or corporation.\u201d (Stats. 1974, ch. 874, .\u00a72, p. 1867.) In 1979, the Legislature amended this statute to include a Knox-Keene exception, by providing that \u201c[Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or the provisions of any other law, a licensed optometrist may be employed to practice optometry ... by a health care service plan pursuant to\u201d the Knox-Keene Act. (Stats. 1979, ch. 788, \u00a7 6, p. 2687.) According to one legislative analysis, the purpose of this amendment was to \u201cconform[]\u201d Business and Professions Code former section 3103 \u201cto language currently existing in\u201d the Knox-Keene Act, and \u201cto remove inconsistencies between certain statutory . . . provisions regarding . . . employment of optometrists.\u201d (Assem. Subcom. on Health Personnel, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 461 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.), as amended June 20, 1979.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">The same year, the Legislature also amended <em>both </em>Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556, but those amendments did <em>not </em>include language referencing the Knox-Keene Act. (Stats. 1979, ch. 975, \u00a7 1, p. 3339; Stats. 1979, ch. 653, \u00a7 9, pp. 2012-2013.) The 1979 amendment to Business and Professions Code section 655 significantly strengthened that section\u2019s prohibitions by (1) deleting an exception for optometrists and RDO\u2019s who do not refer patients and customers to each other, and (2) adding subdivision (b) to make explicit that the statute not only prohibits optometrists from having proprietary relationships with RDO\u2019s, it likewise prohibits RDO\u2019s from having proprietary relationships with optometrists. (Stats. 1979, ch. 975, \u00a7 1, p. 3339.) Notably, the legislative history of the amendment contains no mention of the Knox-Keene Act, and no suggestion that Business and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>Professions Code section 655 is inapplicable where optometrists and RDO\u2019s are employed by or contract with Knox-Keene plans. On the contrary, several legislative analyses explained that the revised statute would prohibit any and all proprietary relationships between optometrists and RDO\u2019s. (Legis. Analyst, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1125 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 8, 1979; Sen. Democratic Caucus, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1125 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 5, 1979; Sen. Republican Caucus, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1125 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 5, 1979; Dept. of Finance, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 1125 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 18, 1979.) Similarly, an opposition letter submitted on behalf of Cole National Corporation argued that the revised statute \u201cwould prohibit any form of landlord-tenant relationship\u201d between RDO\u2019s and optometrists \u201cunder any circumstances whatsoever.\u201d (Donald Brown, Advocation, Inc., letter to Assemblymember Daniel Boatwright re Assem. Bill No. 1125 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) June 11, 1979, p. 1.) And, in a letter asking the Governor to veto the passed bill, Stanley Pearle, as Chairman of Searle Optical Inc., argued that the revised statute would \u201coutlaw[] any landlord-tenant relationship between an optician and optometrist\u201d and \u201cexclude[]\u201d opticians \u201cfrom making available to their customers one-stop shopping for both optometric services and optical goods.\u201d (Stanley Pearle, letter to Governor Jerry Brown re Assem. Bill No. 1125 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 19, 1979, pp. 1-2.) These events undermine defendants\u2019 assertion that there is \u201cno reason to expect language in [Business and Professions Code] sections 655 addressing the effect of the Knox-Keene Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Defendants also err in asserting that the People\u2019s interpretation, by making part of section 1395(b) surplusage, violates our rules for construing statutes. According to defendants, because the second clause of section 1395(b)\u2019s first sentence expressly authorizes plans to \u201cemploy, or contract with, any\u201d licensed professional, reading the entire sentence as \u201conly\u201d an authorization to hire licensed professionals gives no effect to the sentence\u2019s first clause, which provides that \u201c[p]lans licensed under this chapter shall not be deemed to be engaged in the practice of a profession ...\u201d (\u00a7 1395(b).) However, as noted above, the People\u2019s interpretation gives meaning to the first sentence\u2019s first clause by acknowledging that it establishes that in providing health care services through licensed professionals, Knox-Keene plans are not \u201cengaged in the practice of a profession.\u201d (\u00a7 1395(b).) Under California law, \u201c[t]he practice of optometry is the performing or the controlling of any of the acts set forth in [Business and Professions Code] [s]ection 3041.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 3070.) Thus, without the first clause of section 1395(b), a Knox-Keene plan\u2019s provision of optometric services through hired optometrists, though expressly authorized, would likely constitute the practice of optometry. Under the People\u2019s interpretation, the provision\u2019s first clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>definitively establishes otherwise.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the People\u2019s interpretation gives meaning to that clause, just not the expansive meaning defendants proffer: a broad exemption from all the otherwise applicable commercial-relationship restrictions in the Business and Professions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Like their broad claim regarding section 1395(b), defendants\u2019 discussion of the statute\u2019s specific application in this case suffers from several problems. Defendants are correct, and the People agree, that in light of the first clause of the statute\u2014Knox-Keene plans \u201cshall not be deemed to be engaged in the practice of a profession\u201d (ibid.)\u2014VisionCare itself is not a \u201cperson licensed\u201d as an optometrist within the meaning of Business and Professions Code section 655. However, as here relevant, Business and Professions Code section 655, subdivisions (a) and (b), prohibit licensed optometrists from having a \u201clandlord-tenant relationship\u201d with RDO\u2019s either \u201cdirectly or indirectly.\u201d Although section 1395(b) would appear to preclude a finding that Pearle RDO and VisionCare\u2019s optometrists \u201cdirectly\u201d have a prohibited \u201clandlord-tenant relationship\u201d within the meaning of Business and Professions Code section 655, it does not preclude a finding that they \u201cindirectly\u201d have such a prohibited relationship.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Nothing in section 1395(b) supports defendants\u2019 contrary position. As defendants acknowledge, that section authorizes Knox-Keene plans \u201cto \u2018contract with\u2019 professionals <em>to provide professional </em>services.\u201d (Italics added; see \u00a7 1395(b) [plans may contract with licensed professionals \u201cto deliver professional services\u201d].) Similarly, section 1395(b) provides that a licensed professional may not be disciplined for contracting \u201cas a provider of professional services\u201d with a plan. Pearle RDO\u2019s rental agreement with VisionCare does not constitute a contract \u201cto deliver professional services,\u201d and Pearle RDO, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>as VisionCare\u2019s landlord, is not acting \u201cas a provider of professional services.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1395(b).) Although section 1395(b) expressly authorizes Knox-Keene plans to employ licensed optometrists to provide professional services, it does <em>not </em>provide that optometrists so employed may operate without regard to other professional restrictions. Moreover, the Knox-Keene Act elsewhere provides that Knox-Keene plans \u201cshall employ and utilize allied health manpower for the furnishing of services <em>to the extent permitted by law.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 1367, subd. (f), italics added.) In short, with respect to Knox-Keene plans, section 1395(b) removes only one preexisting restriction on licensed health care professionals: the ban on employment by a corporation other than a medical corporation. Nothing in its language establishes or suggests that it removes other restrictions on the relationships such professionals may have, such as the prohibition against \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d having a landlord-tenant relationship with an RDO. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 655.) A licensed professional working for a Knox-Keene plan who is disciplined for having such a prohibited relationship is not being disciplined for that employment, but for additionally having a prohibited relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Defendants\u2019 discussion of Business and Professions Code section 2556 fares no better. Again, defendants are correct that, in light of Health and Safety Code section 1395(b), VisionCare itself is not an \u201coptometrist\u201d within the meaning of Business and Professions Code section 2556. However, contrary to defendants\u2019 claim, this fact does not establish that Pearle RDO does not \u201cdirectly or indirectly employ or maintain on or near the premises for optical dispensing ... an optometrist\u201d within the meaning of Business and Professions Code section 2556.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>Defendants\u2019 contrary analysis of the statutory language is unpersuasive. Defendants argue that \u201cthe second clause of [section] 1395(b) plainly authorizes relationships like VisionCare\u2019s,\u201d and that whatever the phrase \u201cindirectly employ or maintain on or near the premises\u201d means (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2556), it \u201ccannot apply to optometric services provided by a Knox-Keene plan, pursuant to express statutory language allowing the plan to provide such services and exempting it from restrictions applicable to professionals.\u201d Defendants are incorrect; as explained above, section 1395(b) authorizes Knox-Keene plans to contract with licensed professionals \u201cto deliver professional services,\u201d not, as defendants contend, \u201cto lease space in\u201d RDO\u2019s retail optical stores. As a landlord, Pearle RDO simply is not acting \u201cas a provider of professional services.\u201d (\u00a7 1395(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Finally, we reject defendants\u2019 assertion that because Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 \u201ccarry[] misdemeanor penalties,\u201d we should apply the rule that directs courts to resolve ambiguities in penal statutes in the defendant\u2019s favor. That rule \u201c \u2018applies only if the court can do no more than guess what the legislative body intended.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Avery </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 49, 58 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 403, 38 P.3d 1].)

Because, for the reasons stated above, defendants\u2019 interpretation is not equally plausible, the rule is inapplicable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">2. <em>Extrinsic Sources Do Not Support Defendants\u2019 Interpretation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">Although asserting that the plain language of section 1395(b) is dispositive, defendants also rely heavily on various extrinsic sources. As explained below, defendants\u2019 discussion of these sources is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>a. <em>Prior Administrative Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Defendants assert that \u201c[t]he agencies charged with administering the Knox-Keene Act have applied [defendants\u2019] understanding of the Act for almost two decades.\u201d In support of their argument, defendants rely principally on a petition the Attorney General filed, as counsel for the California Board of Optometry, with the FTC in 1989, and on internal memoranda of the Medical Board\u2019s Division of Licensing and the Department of Corporations (DOC), which was originally charged with administering the Knox-Keene Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on these documents is unavailing. How much, if any, \u201cdeference\u201d we give the type of administrative interpretation defendants cite depends on \u201ca complex of factors material to the substantive legal issue before [us], the particular agency offering the interpretation, and the comparative weight the factors ought in reason to command.\u201d <em>(Yamaha Corp. of America </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 12 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031].) Several of the relevant factors indicate that deference is unwarranted here. First, the FTC petition and the internal agency memoranda were not \u201ccontemporaneous with\u201d enactment of the relevant statutes <em>(id. </em>at p. 13); they were all prepared years later. Second, none of these documents discusses the relevant statutory language or reflects \u201ccareful consideration\u201d of the precise issue before us. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Third, the internal memoranda, which are essentially advice letters prepared by individual staff members, are not entitled to the deference we afford \u201c \u2018a regulation adopted after public notice and comment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> Finally, the issue here is the construction of statutes, and we generally \u201care less inclined to defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute than to its interpretation of a self-promulgated regulation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bonnell v. Medical Board </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1255, 1265 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 532, 82 P.3d 740].) Here, we have no reason to believe the agencies in question have a \u201c \u2018comparative interpretive advantage over the courts\u2019 \u201d in interpreting the relevant statutes. <em>(Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 12.) For these reasons, the documents defendants cite do not persuade us to adopt defendants\u2019 interpretation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">Nor are we persuaded by defendants\u2019 more general assertion that since 1986, \u201cCalifornia regulators\u201d have either expressly approved, or failed to object to, the operation of specialized Knox-Keene vision care plans affiliated with optical companies that are RDO\u2019s. As the People point out, \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>state agency has ever promulgated a regulation or issued a formal opinion interpreting the [Knox-Keene] Act to create an exemption to Business and Professions Code sections 655 or 2556.\u201d And, as we stated over 70 years ago in rejecting a similar argument by a dentist who sought to overturn his suspension for aiding the unlawful corporate practice of dentistry, \u201c[djelayed action on the part of those who are charged with the execution of laws will not be permitted to annul the law.

Sess.). They cite statements in an Assembly third reading analysis that the Knox-Keene Act \u201copens licensure to for-profit organizations which were prohibited under earlier registration procedure,\u201d and that \u201cregulating performance regardless of the corporate status is seen as a more logical way to control abuses.\u201d (Assem. Off. of Research, 3d reading analysis, Assem. Bill No. 138 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 17, 1975.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">Contrary to defendants\u2019 assertion, these statements provide little, if any, support for defendants\u2019 broad interpretation. To the extent they explain that the Knox-Keene Act permits for-profit corporations to deliver health care services, these statements are fully consistent with the People\u2019s view that section 1395(b) simply exempts Knox-Keene plans from the rule that otherwise prohibits for-profit corporations from employing licensed health care professionals to provide health care services. The same is true regarding the comment about the benefits of regulation, viewed in context. The Assembly third reading analysis explained that, although existing law \u201cprohibited\u201d licensing of \u201cfor-profit organizations,\u201d such entities were \u201cfinding] their way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>into the system via subsidiary for-profit management and supply companies to a nonprofit corporate shell.\u201d (Assem. Off. of Research, 3d reading analysis, Assem. Bill No. 138 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 17, 1975.) \u201cConsequently\u201d\u2014i.e., because for-profit entities were finding ways to avoid existing prohibitions\u2014\u201cregulating performance regardless of the corporate status [was] seen as a more logical way to control abuses\u201d than prohibiting for-profit entities from providing health care services. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Again, this discussion is fully consistent with the People\u2019s view that section 1395(b) simply exempts Knox-Keene plans from the rule against for-profit corporations employing licensed health care professionals. It does not indicate a more expansive intent to eliminate all other restrictions on the relationships that licensed health care professionals may have.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Indeed, a complete review of the Knox-Keene Act\u2019s voluminous legislative history does not support defendants\u2019 broad interpretation of section 1395(b) and generally supports the People\u2019s more limited reading of that section. The legislative analyses consistently stressed two key aspects of the Knox-Keene Act: \u201ca new licensing and [expanded] regulatory structure governing health care service plans\u201d and a \u201ctransfer\u201d of regulatory authority \u201cfrom the Attorney General to the Department of Corporations.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Health, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 138 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 17, 1975, p. 1.) Some, but not all, of the analyses also briefly noted, with little or no discussion, that the Knox-Keene Act would change existing law by allowing for-profit corporations to operate as licensed health care services plans. <em>(Id., </em>Assem. Com. on Health, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 138 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 17, 1975, pp. 7-8; Assem. Off. of Research, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 138 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 2, 1975, pp. 1-2; Assem. Com. on Ways &amp; Means, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 138 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 17, 1975, p. 2; Sen. Com. on Health &amp; Welfare, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 138 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 27, 1975, p. 2.) However, nowhere in the limited discussion of this change is there any mention of an intent to sweep away all other restrictions on commercial relationships in the Business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>and Professions Code. Nor is there any discussion of the pros and cons of maintaining or creating an exemption from any other relationship restriction. Instead, consistent with the People\u2019s interpretation, the relevant discussion indicates no more than an intent to establish an exception to only one such restriction: the prohibition against for-profit corporations employing licensed health care professionals to provide health care services. Had the Legislature intended to enact the broad and sweeping exemption defendants assert, the legislative history would, no doubt, contain some mention of that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">c. <em>Statutory Purpose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">Defendants argue that their interpretation is strongly supported by the purposes of the Knox-Keene Act, specifically, to \u201cpreserv[e] the quality of care,\u201d to \u201censur[e] easy access to care,\u201d and to \u201creduc[e] health care costs through competition.\u201d Defendants assert that adopting the People\u2019s view \u201cwould cause serious harm to consumers, without any offsetting benefit.\u201d In making their argument, defendants rely principally on a 1986 finding by the FTC, based largely on earlier studies, that because \u201ccommercial practice\u201d restrictions \u201cincrease prices\u201d and thus \u201creduc[e] the frequency with which consumers obtain vision care,\u201d they \u201cdecrease the overall quality of care\u201d without \u201cproviding] offsetting quality-related benefits.\u201d (54 Fed.Reg. 10286 (Mar. 13, 1989).) Defendants also rely on a 1982 finding by the DCA, based on FTC data, that California\u2019s \u201ccommercial practice restrictions [would] cost California consumers $102 million in 1983.\u201d (DCA Rep., supra, Executive Summary, p. i.) Defendants argue that, in light of these findings, their interpretation would promote the Knox-Keene Act\u2019s purposes, whereas the People\u2019s interpretation would defeat those purposes by \u201cinflict[ing] sharply higher costs, reduced services, and lower-quality care on California consumers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">The premise of defendants\u2019 argument\u2014that commercial practice restrictions increase prices and reduce the overall quality of care by decreasing the frequency of visits\u2014appears to be open to question. The People, citing several analyses and scholarly criticisms, challenge not only the findings of the FTC and the DCA, but also the methodology and objectivity of the earlier studies on which those findings were based. The People also argue that even were these underlying studies correct when done, \u201cthe almost 30-year old . . . data\u201d from those studies and the FTC\u2019s finding based on that data \u201chave little relevance to California\u2019s current vision care market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">This policy debate was before our Legislature in 1979 when it strengthened Business and Professions Code section 655 (see pp. 982-983, <em>ante), </em>and again in 1983 and 1985 when it rejected proposals to repeal some or all of the prohibitions in that section and in Business and Professions Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>2556. The relevant legislative history demonstrates that defendants\u2019 corporate predecessors participated in those proceedings, opposing the 1979 legislation and supporting the unsuccessful repeal proposals based on the same arguments and studies defendants offer here.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, defendants are now inviting us to resolve in their favor an old <em>policy </em>debate based on arguments and studies that have, thus far, failed to move the Legislature. We decline the invitation. In light of the legislative history and the contrary studies the People cite\u2014one of which was published in 1995\u2014we have no basis for concluding that the Legislature agrees with defendants\u2019 view or that the findings on which defendants rely were accurate when made more than 20 years ago, are accurate now, or are now or ever were applicable to California\u2019s vision care market.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Instead, we leave this policy debate with the body to which it rightly belongs: the Legislature, which has \u201cthe ability to gather empirical evidence, solicit the advice of experts, and hold hearings at which all interested parties may present evidence and express their views.\u201d <em>(Foley v. Interactive Data Corp. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 654, 694, fn. 31 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Defendants also assert that their interpretation is consistent with another purpose of the Knox-Keene Act: to \u201cpreventQ commercial influence\u201d on professional judgment through \u201ccomprehensive regulatory oversight rather than by structural prohibitions on with whom [a Knox-Keene] plan may affiliate.\u201d In making this argument, defendants first assert that the \u201ccorporate practice restrictions barring for-profit corporations from the health care field [are] expressly based on concern\u201d that professional judgment may be influenced by \u201c \u2018die profit motive of the corporation employer,\u2019 \u201d and that the Legislature \u201cexpressly abolished this bar for Knox-Keene companies, based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>on the judgment that in the Knox-Keene context it [is] \u2018more logical ... to control abuses\u2019 by \u2018regulating performance\u2019 pursuant to a comprehensive regulatory scheme.\u201d Defendants then assert that because the \u201cconcerns cited as the basis for [Business and Professions Code sections] 655 and 2556 are almost identical to those which underlie corporate practice prohibitions,\u201d we should construe Health and Safety Code section 1395(b) also to abolish the prohibitions in Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 where Knox-Keene plans are involved. According to defendants, \u201c[i]n view of [the Knox-Keene Act\u2019s] express focus on protecting professional independence, no purpose (other than protecting the business interests of optometrists and reducing the availability of vision care to California consumers) would be served by applying [Business and Professions Code sections] 655 and 2556 in the Knox-Keene context.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">We believe that we should leave to the Legislature the decision whether the justification for exempting Knox-Keene plans from the prohibition against employing optometrists also warrants an exemption from the prohibitions of Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556. To paraphrase one of our prior decisions, \u201c[t]he question before us is, of course, one of statutory construction and we do not decide whether the Legislature in [1975] should have [established this exemption] or whether it should do so now. That is a public policy issue properly left to the Legislature. . . . \u2018Our holding [must be] based on the [Knox-Keene] Act as it is written, not on a different, perhaps broader, version that could have been, or still may be, enacted.\u2019 [Citation.] Public policy, however, is a relevant, albeit secondary, consideration for our decision in the present case. We are asked in this case to decide whether the Legislature intended to abolish a well-established legal doctrine that raises significant public policy considerations. We are not persuaded the Legislature would have silently, or at best obscurely, decided so important and controversial a public policy matter and created a significant departure from the existing law.\u201d <em>(In re Christian </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 768, 782 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 872 P.2d 574].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">For similar reasons, we reject defendants\u2019 policy arguments for deferring to what they claim has been the \u201caccepted [administrative] practice\u201d for \u201cnearly two decades.\u201d According to defendants, \u201c[i]t is extremely important for [Knox-Keene] plans to be able to develop their products and plans knowing that there is but a single set of state law standards they must satisfy, and with the understanding that actions approved by their designated state regulator\u2014 the DMHC\u2014are permissible and may be undertaken with confidence.\u201d Defendants assert that by now adopting the People\u2019s interpretation, we would frustrate this need for certainty\u2014and thus \u201cdefeat the purposes of the Knox-Keene Act\u201d\u2014by \u201craising] the specter of later intervention by the Attorney General to declare unlawful (and seek penalties for) activity and structures long approved by the DOC and DMHC.\u201d Defendants also more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>broadly assert that adopting the People\u2019s interpretation will \u201cdeter investment in California, by undermining confidence in the stability of the legal structures under which businesses operate, and contributing to a perception that California\u2019s legal climate is unfriendly to business and makes this State a risky place to invest or operate.\u201d These arguments, which are unrelated to the language of the governing statutes, should be directed to the Legislature. As stated earlier, we must take the law as it is written, and \u201c[d]elayed action on the part of those who are charged with [its] execution . . . will not be permitted to annul [it].\u201d <em>(Painless Parker, supra, </em>216 Cal. at p. 299.)

It appears, however, that the Legislature added this exemption in 1979 simply to bring the relevant provision of the Business and Professions Code in line with the authorization in Health and Safety Code section 1395(b). In describing this change, one legislative analysis stated: \u201c[Business and Professions Code former] [s]ection 3103 is [being] amended to include language currently existing in the Health and Safety Code, sections 1340 through 1395 No change in law is taking place.\u201d (Sen.

Business and Professions Code section 655.5 was enacted in 1970, before passage of the Knox-Keene Act. It originally referred to the Knox-Mills Health Plan Act (Gov. Code, former \u00a7 12530 et seq.), which formerly regulated health plans. (Stats. 1970, ch. 658, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>\u00a7 1, p. 1282.) In 1978, this reference was replaced with a reference to the Knox-Keene Act.

Nor has the trial court decided whether Pearle RDO has violated Business and Professions Code section 2556\u2019s prohibitions against \u201cfurnishfing] the services of ... an optometrist\u201d and \u201cdirectly or indirectly employing] or maintaining]\u201d an optometrist \u201con or near the premises for optical dispensing.\u201d We express no view on these questions, which are beyond the scope of the issue on which we granted review. Because we do not answer these questions, we also cannot, and do not, address defendants\u2019 argument that because Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 do not prohibit the arrangements at issue here, the latter\u2019s prohibition against RDO\u2019s advertising \u201cthe furnishing of\u2019 an optometrist\u2019s services \u201cmust be read\u201d to allow Pearle RDO to advertise those arrangements, and that Pearle RDO therefore has not violated that prohibition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1023-6\"> Our discussion assumes that RDO\u2019s, which are \u201cregistered\u201d with the Division of Licensing of the Medical Board (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2550), otherwise qualify under Health and Safety Code section 1395(b) as \u201cprofessional[s] <em>licensed </em>pursuant to Division 2 (commencing with Section 500) of the Business and Professions Code.\u201d (Italics added.) As already noted, the People concede that section 1395(b) authorizes Knox-Keene plans to \u201cemploy or contract with RDO\u2019s.\u201d We also note that the statutory chapter on RDO\u2019s appears in the division of the Business and Professions Code mentioned in Health and Safety Code section 1395(b); that Business and Professions Code section 655 refers to persons \u201clicensed\u201d under the provisions relating to RDO\u2019s; and that Business and Professions Code section 23.7 states that \u201c[ujnless otherwise expressly provided, \u2018license\u2019 means license, certificate, registration, or other means to engage in a business or profession regulated by this code . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Our discussion also assumes that, as the People assert, VisionCare does not provide VisionCare\u2019s subscribers with \u201ceyewear benefits under the plan,\u201d and that Pearle RDO\u2019s only contractual arrangement with VisionCare is the lease agreement. Defendants do not contest this assertion. Nor did they oppose the People\u2019s request for judicial notice of a sample membership contract VisionCare filed with the DMHC, which indicates that VisionCare\u2019s plan does not cover the costs of frames, lenses or contacts. Given the facts, we have no occasion to discuss the application of these statutes where a Knox-Keene plan employs or contracts with both optometrists and RDO\u2019s to provide professional services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1024-10\"> In supporting defendants\u2019 interpretation, amicus curiae California Association of Health Plans (CAHP) relies in part on a provision defendants do not mention: section 1395, subdivision (c), which provides that a licensed \u201chealth care service plan . . . may directly own, and may directly operate through its professional employees or contracted licensed professionals, offices and subsidiary corporations ... as are necessary to provide health care services to the plan\u2019s subscribers and enrollees.\u201d By its terms, that provision does not apply here because VisionCare, the specialized Knox-Keene plan, does not \u201cdirectly own\u201d and \u201cdirectly operate\u201d Pearle RDO\u2019s retail stores. (\u00a7 1395, subd. (c).) Given this fact, we express no opinion on the People\u2019s view that the provision is inapplicable for another reason: because it mentions only \u201chealth care service plants]\u201d (\u00a7 1395, subd. (c)), and therefore does not apply to <em>specialized </em>health care service plans like VisionCare.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1025-8\"> We also note that, contrary to defendants\u2019 claim, none of the cited documents states that either the Knox-Keene Act in general or section 1395(b) in particular makes commercial practice restrictions inapplicable to specialized Knox-Keene plans. However, in light of the factors discussed above, we need not detail the reasons why our reading of these documents differs from defendants\u2019.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1026-8\"> Regarding punishment\u2014imposition of fines and penalties\u2014defendants state that they have asserted \u201cestoppe[l]\u201d in the trial court, and that the issue \u201cis not implicated here.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1026-9\"> We also note that, according to documents submitted by amici curiae Melvin Snow and Sabrina Hughes, as early as February 2002, the same month the Attorney General filed this action, the Medical Board rejected several RDO applications based on its view that Business and Professions Code sections 655 and 2556 preclude an RDO from subleasing space within its retail store to a specialized Knox-Keene plan so that optometrists employed by the Knox-Keene plan may provide optometric services to plan members at those locations. Thus, there is reason to question defendants\u2019 assertion that \u201c[t]he present lawsuit is the first manifestation ... of any official objection to the legality of th[e] arrangements\u201d at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1027-6\"> Defendants also cite the statement at an April 1974 press conference of former Assembly-member John Knox, who cosponsored the Knox-Keene Act. The statement, which did not identify the proposed legislation by bill number, apparently related not to Assembly Bill No. 138, which was introduced in December 1974, but to Assembly Bill No. 3385 (1973-1974 Reg. Sess.), which dealt with the same subject and which former Assemblymember Knox introduced the day before the press conference. There were many similarities between Assembly Bill No. 3885, as introduced, and Assembly Bill No. 138, but there were also many differences, including one of particular note here. Section 1395(b), as proposed in Assembly Bill No. 3885, apparently would have applied only to licensed plans providing a broad range of \u201cbasic health care services,\u201d and not to \u201c \u2018specialized\u2019 \u201d plans providing services in \u201ca single specialized area of health care such as optometry . . . .\u201d (Assem. Bill No.. 3885 (1973-1974 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Apr. 18, 1974, pp. 6-7, 24.)
