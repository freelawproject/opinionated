Concluding they are not, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">In 1999, the Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Cruz (County) adopted several ordinances that would have affected timber harvesting operations in the County. As pertinent here, County\u2019s ordinances restricted timber harvesting to specified zone districts within the County (Santa Cruz County Res. No. 493-99 &amp; Santa Cruz County Ord. No. 4577 (1999); hereafter the zone district ordinance), barred timber harvesting operations in certain areas adjacent to streams and residences (Santa Cruz County Ord. No. 4571 (1999); hereafter the stream ordinance), and limited the parcels on which helicopter operations associated with such harvesting could occur (Santa Cruz County Ord. No. 4572 (1999); hereafter the helicopter ordinance). County also requested and obtained from the California Coastal Commission a ruling certifying the zone district ordinance as an amendment to County\u2019s local coastal program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-10\">Plaintiffs Big Creek Lumber Co. and Homer T. McCrary (jointly Big Creek) and the Central Coast Forest Association, a nonprofit association of landowners and forestry professionals in the County, filed a petition for writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>of mandate against County and the California Coastal Commission, challenging County\u2019s timber-related ordinances and the Commission\u2019s certification of the zone district ordinance as a local coastal program amendment. Plaintiffs\u2019 petition alleged that County\u2019s and the California Coastal Commission\u2019s actions violated the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.) and County\u2019s ordinances violated the doctrine of preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">The preemption claim was bifurcated and heard separately. The trial court found in favor of plaintiffs except as to the zone district ordinance. On appeal, the Court of Appeal invalidated County\u2019s ordinances in their entirety. We granted County\u2019s petition for review of the Court of Appeal\u2019s invalidation of the helicopter and zone district ordinances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">The zone district ordinance amends County\u2019s zoning laws to restrict timber harvesting operations to areas zoned for timber production, mineral extraction industrial, or parks, recreation and open space. The helicopter ordinance requires that helicopter staging, loading, and servicing facilities associated with timber operations be located either on a parcel of land zoned for timber harvesting or on a parcel adjacent to such, and within the boundaries of a timber harvesting plan that has been approved by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">Plaintiffs argue that the ordinances are preempted by the Z\u2019berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973 (FPA) (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 4511 et seq.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the California Timberland Productivity Act of 1982 (TPA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51100 et seq.). For the following reasons, we conclude that County\u2019s ordinances are not preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">A. <em>Overview: State Forestry Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIE\">1. <em>The Forest Practice Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">\u201cTimber harvesting operations in this state must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Forest Practice Act. The Act was intended to create and maintain a comprehensive system for regulating timber harvesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>in order to achieve two goals\u201d <em>(Sierra Club v. State Bd. of Forestry </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1226 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 876 P.2d 505]): to restore, enhance, and maintain the productivity of timberlands where feasible; and to achieve the maximum sustained production of high quality timber products, while giving consideration to values relating to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage, fisheries, regional economic vitality, employment, and aesthetic enjoyment (ibid.; see \u00a7 4513).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-4\">As originally enacted in 1973, the FPA permitted individual counties to adopt stricter rules and regulations governing timber operations than those provided under the FPA. (Stats. 1973, ch. 880, \u00a7 4, pp. 1615-1616 [adding former \u00a7 4516].) In 1982, the Legislature amended the FPA (Stats. 1982, ch. 1561, \u00a7 3, pp. 6164-6166) to provide instead that counties may recommend to the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection (Board) additional forest practice rules and regulations (\u00a7 4516.5, subds. (a), (b)) but, except with respect to performance bonds or other surety for road protection, counties are forbidden to \u201cregulate the conduct of timber operations\u201d (\u00a7 4516.5, subd. (d); hereafter section 4516.5(d)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">Pursuant to the FPA, \u201ctimber operations are controlled by means of a site-specific timber harvesting plan that must be submitted to the [state forestry] department before timber operations may commence.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] (\u00a7\u00a7 4581 and 4582.5.) The Legislature has specified that the plan include the name and address of the timber owner and the timber operator, a description of the land upon which the work is proposed to be done, a description of the silviculture methods to be applied, an outline of the methods to mitigate erosion caused by operations performed in the vicinity of a stream, the provisions, if any, to protect any \u2018unique area\u2019 within the area of operations, and the anticipated dates for commencement and completion of operations. (\u00a7 4582, subds. (a)-(g).)\u201d <em>(Sierra Club v. State Bd. of Forestry, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1226.) The director of the state forestry department, and the Board on appeal, review timber harvesting plans for compliance with the FPA and applicable regulations. (\u00a7 4582.7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>2. <em>The Timberland Productivity Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">The TPA, as amended in 1982 (Stats. 1982, ch. 1489, \u00a7\u00a7 1-39, pp. 5748-5766), reflects state policy, inter alia, \u201cthat timber operations conducted in a manner consistent with forest practice rules adopted by the [Board] shall not be or become restricted or prohibited due to any land use in or around the locality of those operations.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51102, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The TPA seeks to implement that policy \u201cby including all qualifying timberland in timberland production zones.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 51103.) \u201cTimberland,\u201d the Legislature has stated, \u201cmeans privately owned land, or land acquired for state forest purposes, which is devoted to and used for growing and harvesting timber, or for growing and harvesting timber and compatible uses, and which is capable of growing an average annual volume of wood fiber of at least 15 cubic feet per acre.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 51104, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">In order to accomplish its purposes, the TPA relies on tax incentives and zoning mandates. The TPA restricts land in certain timberland production zones (TPZ\u2019s) to the growing and harvesting of timber and compatible uses. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a751115, 51118.) In exchange, owners of land in a TPZ benefit by lower property tax valuations that reflect the enforceable statutory restrictions. (See Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 8 [Legislature may tax certain land consistently with use restrictions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">The TPA\u2019s predecessor statute (Stats. 1976, ch. 176, \u00a7 4.5, p. 305) dictated \u201ctimberland preserve\u201d zoning for certain \u201clist A\u201d parcels that were assessed for growing and harvesting timber as the highest and best use. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51110.) Exceptions to mandatory zoning of list A properties were permitted where a parcel in fact was not used for timber growing and harvesting, or where the owner contested the zoning and local officials found exclusion to be in the public interest. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51112, subds. (a), (b).) Timberland preserve zoning also was dictated for certain other timberlands, called \u201clist B\u201d parcels, that were not at that time assessed for growing and harvesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>timber as the highest and best use. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51110.1.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Exceptions to mandatory zoning of list B properties were permitted only where local officials found exclusion to be in the public interest. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51112, subd. (c).) Initial determinations as to parcels\u2019 placement on list A and list B were to have been completed by 1978. <em>(Id., </em>subds. (a), (b), (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-4\">Since 1978, additional timberland production zoning has been initiated by petition of the property owner. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51113.) The TPA also provides for rezoning and for removal of parcels from timberland production zoning. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 51120-51146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">B. <em>Preemption Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">The party claiming that general state law preempts a local ordinance has the burden of demonstrating preemption. (See, e.g., <em>Kucera v. Lizza </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1153 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 582].) We have been particularly \u201creluctant to infer legislative intent to preempt a field covered by municipal regulation when there is a significant local interest to be served that may differ from one locality to another.\u201d <em>(Fisher v. City of Berkeley </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 644, 707 [209 Cal.Rptr. 682, 693 P.2d 261]; see also <em>Great Western Shows, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 853, 866-867 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 746, 44 P.3d 120].) \u201cThe common thread of the cases is that if there is a significant local interest to be served which may differ from one locality to another then the presumption favors the validity of the local ordinance against an attack of state preemption.\u201d <em>(Gluck v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 121, 133 [155 Cal.Rptr. 435], citing, inter alia, <em>Galvan v. Superior Court </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 851, 862-864 [76 Cal.Rptr. 642, 452 P.2d 930].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">Thus, when local government regulates in an area over which it traditionally has exercised control, such as the location of particular land uses, California courts will presume, absent a clear indication of preemptive intent from the Legislature, that such regulation is <em>not </em>preempted by state statute. (See <em>IT Corp. v. Solano County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 81, 93 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 513, 820 P.2d 1023].) The presumption against preemption accords with our more general understanding that \u201cit is not to be presumed that the legislature in the enactment of statutes intends to overthrow long-established principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>either by express declaration or by necessary implication.\u201d <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Frisbie </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 634, 644 [122 P.2d 526]; accord, <em>People v. Davenport </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 266 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861]; <em>Theodor v. Superior Court </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 77, 92 [104 Cal.Rptr. 226, 501 P.2d 234].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">Moreover, the \u201cgeneral principles governing state statutory preemption of local land use regulation are well settled. \u2018The Legislature has specified certain minimum standards for local zoning regulations (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65850 et seq.)\u2019 even though it also \u2018has carefully expressed its intent to retain the maximum degree of local control (see, e.g., <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 65800, 65802).\u2019 <em>(IT Corp. </em>v. <em>Solano County Bd. of Supervisors[, supra,] </em>1 Cal.4th [at p.] 89.)  \u2018A county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations <em>not in conflict with general laws.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 7, italics added.) \u2018 \u201cLocal legislation in conflict with general law is void. Conflicts exist if the ordinance duplicates [citations], contradicts [citation], or enters an area fully occupied by general law, either expressly or by legislative implication [citations].\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 725, 747 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 804, 872 P.2d 143].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">Local legislation is \u201cduplicative\u201d of general law when it is coextensive therewith and \u201ccontradictory\u201d to general law when it is inimical thereto. Local legislation enters an area \u201cfully occupied\u201d by general law when the Legislature has expressly manifested its intent to folly occupy the area or when it has impliedly done so in light of recognized indicia of intent. <em>(Great Western Shows, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at pp. 860-861.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">C. <em>The Zone District Ordinance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">Plaintiffs contend the zone district ordinance is preempted by section 4516.5(d) of the FPA. With exceptions not relevant here, section 4516.5(d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>provides that individual counties shall not \u201cregulate the conduct of timber operations ... or require the issuance of any permit or license for those operations.\u201d As neither ordinance at issue requires the issuance of any permit or license, this case concerns the import of the statutory phrase \u201cconduct of timber operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-4\">In <em>Big Creek Lumber Co. v. County of San Mateo </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 418, 428 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 159] <em>(Big Creek </em>v. <em>San Mateo), </em>the Court of Appeal held that section 4516.5(d) does not deprive California counties of authority to zone timberland outside TPZ\u2019s for uses other than timber production. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that section 4516.5(d) mandates that the \u201cconduct\u201d of timber harvesting operations be governed exclusively by state law, but held that San Mateo County\u2019s ordinance, which restricted the location of non-TPZ commercial timber harvesting, did not offend the statute because it spoke \u201cnot to <em>how </em>timber operations may be conducted, but rather [to] <em>where </em>they may take place.\u201d <em>(Big Creek v. San Mateo, </em>at pp. 424-425.) The court also noted that numerous provisions of California forestry law reveal the Legislature\u2019s intention to preserve local zoning authority. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 425-426, citing statutes.) Harmonizing the FPA and the TPA, the court concluded that \u201cthe Legislature did not intend to preclude counties from using their zoning authority to prohibit timber cutting on lands outside the TPZ\u2019s.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 426.) For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">1. <em>Traditional local zoning power</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">Land use regulation in California historically has been a function of local government under the grant of police power contained in article XI, section 7 of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cWe have recognized that a city\u2019s or county\u2019s power to control its own land use decisions derives from this inherent police power, not from the delegation of authority by the state.\u201d <em>(Devita v. County of Napa </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 782 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 699, 889 P.2d 1019].) And the Legislature, when enacting state zoning laws, has declared its \u201c \u2018intention to provide only a minimum of limitation in order that counties and cities may exercise the maximum degree of control over local zoning matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting Gov. Code, \u00a7 65800.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>Thus, \u201c[t]he power of cities and counties to zone land use in accordance with local conditions is well entrenched.\u201d <em>(IT Corp. v. Solano County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 89.)  \u201cIn enacting zoning ordinances, the municipality performs a legislative function, and every intendment is in favor of the validity of such ordinances.\u201d <em>(Lockard v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 453, 460 [202 P.2d 38].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">2. <em>Express preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">In the FPA, the Legislature directed the Board to divide the state into districts (\u00a7 4531) and adopt \u201cforest practice rules and regulations\u201d for each district (\u00a7 4551).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No timber operations may be conducted without submission of a timber harvesting plan and approval by the Director of Forestry and Fire Protection or by the Board on appeal. (\u00a7\u00a7 4581-4582, 4582.7; see generally <em>Big Creek </em>v. <em>San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 424.) And, as noted, while individual counties may recommend regulations to the Board (\u00a7 4516.5, subd. (a)), they may not regulate the conduct of timber operations (\u00a7 4516.5(d)). The question of express preemption turns on whether the field the Legislature has occupied in so providing encompasses the County\u2019s zone district ordinance. (See <em>Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 748.) Our primary task when interpreting a statute is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Kelly Broadcasting Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724 [257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406].) We turn first to the statutory language, since the words the Legislature chose are the best indicators of its intent. <em>(Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 816, 826 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P2d 1216].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">Section 4516.5(d) contains no express reference to \u201czoning,\u201d nor does it bar localities in terms from regulating the location of timber operations. Rather, counties are forbidden to \u201cregulate the conduct\u201d of timber operations. As the court in <em>Big Creek </em>v. <em>San Mateo </em>pointed out, in common parlance an ordinance that avoids speaking to <em>how </em>timber operations may be conducted and addresses only <em>where </em>they may take place falls short of being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>\u201ca clear attempt to regulate the conduct\" thereof. <em>(Big Creek </em>v. <em>San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 424; cf. <em>Desert Turf Club </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1956) 141 Cal.App.2d 446, 452 [296 P.2d 882] [that state has occupied field of horse racing regulation does not deprive county of right to adopt zoning restrictions on placement of racetracks].) Nevertheless, as the Court of Appeal below recognized, to the extent zoning by definition may have the consequence of excluding logging from some locations, it may in that sense be said to \u201cregulate\u201d that activity, at least in the excluded locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\">When as here a statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, \u201cwe look to \u2018extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hoechst Celanese Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 508, 519 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 22 P.3d 324]; see also <em>IT Corp. </em>v. <em>Solano County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 98.) In this case, such indicia support the construction of section 4516.5(d) adopted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Big Creek v. San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">First, in many places where it addresses timberland zoning, general state forestry law expressly preserves and plainly contemplates the exercise of local authority. The actual designation of TPZ\u2019s, for example, is left to local action. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51104, subds. (a), (c), (g); see, e.g., <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 51112 [on or before March 1, 1977 (list A); on or before March 1, 1978 (list B)] and 51113 [current].) Owners of parcels desiring TPZ zoning must petition local authorities. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 51113, subd. (a)(1).) If the parcel does not meet state timber stocking standards and forest practice rules, the owner must agree to do so within five years <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)(3)(A)), and, if the owner fails to do so, local authorities are empowered to rezone the parcel <em>(ibid.) </em>and to \u201cspecify a new zone for the parcel, which is in conformance with the county general plan and whose primary use is other than timberland\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)(3)(B)). Additionally, local bodies are authorized in certain circumstances to rezone TPZ parcels (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51120, subd. (c)) or convert them to another use <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 51133, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">\u201cThus, it is clear that the Legislature has deferred a number of important zoning decisions to local authority, even in the case of TPZ\u2019s.\u201d <em>(Big Creek </em>v. <em>San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 425.) Certainly neither the TPA nor the FPA suggests localities are restricted in what uses they may prohibit outside TPZ zones. <em>(Big Creek v. San Mateo, </em>at p. 428.) \u201cNowhere in the statutory scheme,\u201d in fact, \u201chas the Legislature expressly prohibited the use of zoning ordinances\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 425).</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>Second, section 4516.5(d)\u2019s terminology is not \u201cso overshadowing that it obliterates all vestiges of local power as to a subject where municipalities have traditionally enjoyed a broad measure of autonomy.\u201d <em>(Waste Resource Technologies v. Department of Public Health </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 299, 306 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 422] [discussing authority to grant refuse disposal permits].) That the Legislature intended the phrase \u201cregulate the conduct\u201d in section 4516.5(d) to preclude only local regulations that affect <em>how </em>timber operations are conducted is borne out by the kinds of issues the Board, under the rubric of \u201cthe conduct of timber operations,\u201d is in its rules and regulations statutorily required to address. (See \u00a7 4551.5.) Fire prevention and control, soil erosion control, site preparation, water quality and watershed control, flood control, disease prevention and control (ibid.)\u2014these clearly are matters relating to the process of carrying out timber operations. (See <em>Big Creek v. San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">Third, the legislative history of the FPA does not support plaintiffs\u2019 expansive reading of section 4516.5(d). Although plaintiff Big Creek suggests the Legislature\u2019s purpose was to substitute for local regulation procedures whereby the Board would adopt rules addressing local concerns, the available legislative history contains \u201cno discussion of county zoning authority or its relation to regulation of the \u2018conduct\u2019 of logging operations.\u201d <em>(Big Creek </em>v. <em>San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at pp. 426-427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">Of greater import is that section 4516.5(d) was added to the FPA during the same legislative session in which the TPA was amended. (See Stats. 1982, ch. 1561, \u00a7 3, p. 6164 [adding \u00a7 4516.5] and <em>id., </em>ch. 1489, \u00a7\u00a7 1-39, pp. 5748-5766.) That the Legislature would, in the same legislative session, include in one general forestry statute numerous provisions that rely upon local zoning authority (see, e.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51113, 51133, 51120) and when amending another general forestry statute forbid localities\u2019 exercise of such authority seems unlikely. (See <em>Garvey v. Byram </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 279, 282 [115 P.2d 501] [concerning reenactment of former Pol. Code, \u00a7 3817 with minor amendments during the same legislative session in which former Pol. Code, \u00a7 3834.25 was enacted]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Black </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 1, 7-8 [184 Cal.Rptr. 454, 648 P.2d 104] [provisions relating to same subject enacted at same legislative session should be consistently construed].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">The history of the legislation that added section 4516.5(d) to the FPA confirms that one of its purposes was to influence local zoning agencies in the exercise of their authority. A TPZ designation puts county residents on notice that timber operations are expected to occur on the parcel (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51115.1, subd. (b)), inter alia to discourage expansion of urban services into timberland <em>(id., </em>\u00a751102, subd. (a)(3)). By restricting timber harvesting to timberland production, mineral extraction industrial, and park, recreation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>open space zone districts, County\u2019s zone district ordinance encourages non-TPZ timberland owners who desire to harvest their timber to rezone their property to one of these permitted zone districts. This in turn advances the Legislature\u2019s objective of \u201cincluding all qualifying timberland in timberland production zones\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 51103).</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\">Fourth, construing section 4516.5(d) so as to encompass every local regulation of timber operations without regard to whether the regulation purports to control the process or manner of carrying out such operations would not account for the Legislature\u2019s having included the phrase \u201cthe conduct of\u2019 in the FPA\u2019s express preemption provision. As the United States Supreme Court has reminded us, \u201c <em>\u2018each phrase </em>within [an express preemption provision] limits the universe of [local action] pre-empted by the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly </em>(2001) 533 U.S. 525, 550-551 [150 L.Ed.2d 532, 121 S.Ct. 2404], italics added.) Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed reading of section 4516.5(d) would give the phrase \u201cthe conduct of\u2019 no limiting effect on the universe of local action preempted by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reading of section 4516.5(d) also would violate the fundamental rule that \u201c[c]ourts should give meaning to every word of a statute if possible, and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage\u201d <em>(Arnett v. Dal Cielo </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 4, 22 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 706, 923 P.2d 1]). One effect of plaintiffs\u2019 reading would be to render the FPA\u2019s definition of \u201ctimberland\u201d (see \u00a7 4526) partly surplusage. As previously noted, for the purposes of the FPA (with exceptions not pertinent), \u201ctimberland\u201d means \u201cland . . . which is available for, and capable of, growing a crop of trees of any commercial species used to produce lumber and other forest products\u201d <em>(ibid.). </em>The phrase \u201cavailable for\u201d would be superfluous if the definition were read to include <em>any </em>land that is capable of growing qualified trees, but that is what plaintiffs implicitly urge by suggesting that section 4516.5(d) displaces counties\u2019 traditional power to declare which parcels among all those capable of growing trees are available for timbering.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">When the Legislature wishes expressly to preempt all regulation of an activity, it knows how to do so. For example, the Legislature has provided in the TPA that \u201c[p]arcels zoned as timberland production [i.e., located in TPZ\u2019s] shall be zoned so as to restrict their use to growing . . . timber and to compatible uses. <em>The growing and harvesting of timber on those parcels shall be regulated solely pursuant to state statutes and regulations.\u201d </em>(Gov. Code, \u00a7 51115, italics added.) One implication of this provision, of course, is that the growing and harvesting of timber on non-TPZ parcels need not be regulated solely pursu\u00e1nt to state statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>Moreover, to read section 4516.5(d) as precluding all local zoning control over timber operations could lead to absurd results. Such a reading, for example, apparently would require cities and counties to allow commercial logging even in residential districts. Neither the language of the statute nor its legislative history supports such a reading. (See <em>Big Creek v. San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">The Legislature has had ample opportunity over the past decade to amend section 4516.5(d) to abrogate or modify the Court of Appeal\u2019s construction of the statutory phrase \u201cregulate the conduct of timber operations\u201d in <em>Big Creek v. San Mateo. </em>Yet, notwithstanding it has amended the FPA in numerous other particulars every year since that decision was filed, it has not done so. Several California judicial decisions, moreover, have relied on <em>Big Creek v. San Mateo </em>in the intervening years.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Where a statute has been construed by judicial decision, and that construction is not altered by subsequent legislation, it must be presumed that the Legislature is aware of the judicial construction and approves of it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wilkoff v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 345, 353 [211 Cal.Rptr. 742, 696 P.2d 134].) The Legislature\u2019s failure to amend section 4516.5(d), while not conclusive, \u201cmay be presumed to signify legislative acquiescence\u201d in the <em>Big Creek </em>v. <em>San Mateo </em>decision. <em>(People v. Leahy </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 587, 604 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 663, 882 P.2d 321], citing numerous authorities.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the Court of Appeal in <em>Big Creek v. San Mateo </em>that \u201cthe \u2018conduct\u2019 of timber harvesting operations is exclusively governed by state law. \u2018Conduct\u2019 [however] is not given a specialized definition in the FPA. Its ordinary meaning is \u2018the act, manner, or process of carrying out (as a task) or carrying forward (as a business, government, or war).\u2019 \u201d <em>(Big Creek v. San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 426.) Accordingly, local zoning ordinances, like the County\u2019s zone district ordinance, that speak to the location of timber operations but not to the manner in which they are carried out, are not expressly preempted by section 4516.5(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-4\">3. <em>Implied preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">The Legislature\u2019s \u201cpreemptive action in specific and expressly limited areas weighs against an inference that preemption by implication was intended elsewhere.\u201d <em>(IT Corp. v. Solano County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 95; see also <em>Cippolone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 504, 517 [120 L.Ed.2d 407, 112 S.Ct. 2608] [\u201cCongress\u2019 enactment of a provision defining the pre-emptive reach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are not pre-empted\u201d].) In addition, and specifically pertinent here, \u201c[preemption by implication of legislative intent may not be found when the Legislature has expressed its intent to permit local regulations. Similarly, it should not be found when the statutory scheme recognizes local regulations.\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Deukmejian v. County of Mendocino </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 476, 485 [204 Cal.Rptr. 897, 683 P.2d 1150].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">Both these bars to implied preemption are present. By expressly preempting local regulations targeting the conduct of timber operations, section 4516.5(d) implicitly permits local regulations addressed to other aspects of timber operations. And, as has been explained, general forestry law\u2014in particular, the TPA\u2014expressly recognizes local zoning authority. Notwithstanding we might, therefore, forgo applying the test for implied preemption applicable when state statutes do not recognize local regulations, applying that test buttresses our conclusion that County\u2019s ordinances are not preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">\u201cIn determining whether the Legislature has preempted by implication to the exclusion of local regulation we must look to the whole purpose and scope of the legislative scheme.\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Deukmejian v. County of Mendocino, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 485.) Implied preemption occurs when: (1) general law so completely covers the subject as to clearly indicate the matter is exclusively one of state concern; (2) general law partially covers the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>subject in terms clearly indicating a paramount state concern that will not tolerate further local action; or (3) general law partially covers the subject and the adverse effect of a local ordinance on transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible municipal benefit. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">(a) <em>Complete coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">Plaintiffs contend the Legislature has demonstrated its intent to preempt all local restrictions on timber harvesting by fully occupying the field of timber harvesting regulation. Plaintiffs first note the Legislature\u2019s statement of intent, when enacting the FPA, \u201cto create and maintain an effective and comprehensive system of regulation and use of all timberlands.\u201d (\u00a7 4513.) Invoking the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>they argue that certain provisions of the FPA recognizing limited local authority to regulate timber operations indicate that local authority is otherwise preempted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But as County points out, the Legislature adopted section 4513 at the same time it adopted a provision authorizing counties to adopt timber harvest rules and regulations stricter than the state\u2019s rules (Stats. 1973, ch. 880, \u00a7 4, pp. 1615-1616 [adding former \u00a7 4516]), so the general statement of intent in section 4513 cannot have been intended to preempt local restrictions by occupying the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 <em>\u201cexpressio unius\u201d </em>argument implicitly assumes the statutory preemption of local rules that regulate the conduct of timber operations encompasses geographic zoning restrictions on the location of such operations. But because, as demonstrated, section 4516.5(d) does not have that broad meaning, the Legislature had no need to exempt traditional county zoning power from the section\u2019s preemptive scope; hence, the presence of statutory exceptions to FPA preemption demonstrates nothing about the Legislature\u2019s intent respecting counties\u2019 exercise of that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">To summarize, general forestry law preempts local regulation of the conduct of timber operations but otherwise expressly contemplates retention of local zoning authority. \u201c[LJocalities must designate certain lands as TPZ\u2019s. These zones are dedicated to timber growing and harvesting, and localities may not prohibit logging on them. As to other lands that may contain timber, the TPA expressly reaffirms local authority to choose appropriate zoning. Local legislative bodies retain authority to exclude from the TPZ\u2019s certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>parcels when they believe exclusion is in the public interest. [Citation.] Localities also retain the authority to choose the non-TPZ zones into which excluded or removed parcels are placed.\u201d <em>(Big Creek v. San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-4\">We observe, further, that California\u2019s Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65000 et seq.) contemplates the continuation of local government\u2019s traditional zoning authority in connection with timber resources. In adopting that law, the Legislature specified that localities should \u201cexercise the maximum degree of control over local zoning matters\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 65800), inter alia by designating the \u201clocation and extent of the uses of the land\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 65302, subd. (a)) and including the \u201cconservation, development, and utilization of. . . forests\u201d in their general plans <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)). The Planning and Zoning Law also requires counties to adopt in their general plans land use elements that \u201c[designate, <em>in a land use category that provides for timber production </em>those parcels of real property zoned for timberland production pursuant to the [TPA]\u201d (\u00a7 65302, subd. (a)(1), italics added), thus implicitly acknowledging the potential for locally designated land use categories that do <em>not </em>provide for timber production.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">In sum, this is not a case in which \u201cthe subject matter [of where logging can occur] has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern.\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Deukmejian v. County of Mendocino, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 485.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">(b) <em>Partial coverage/paramount state concern</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">Plaintiffs argue that even if the state has not fully occupied the field of timber operations regulation, it has a paramount interest in determining the location of such operations. They point to the FPA\u2019s requirements that the Board adopt rules and regulations governing the conduct of timber operations (\u00a7 4551.5), that any person seeking to conduct timber operations submit and have approved a timber harvesting plan (\u00a7 4581), and that such plans contain a \u201cdescription of the land on which the work is proposed to be done\u201d (\u00a7 4582, subd. (c)). They point also to the Board\u2019s enactment of several rules that restrict the harvesting activities that may be conducted in particular types of terrain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">We disagree with plaintiffs that either the Legislature\u2019s having directed the Board to adopt rules governing the conduct of timber operations or the Board\u2019s having adopted such rules, impliedly displaces (any more than it expressly does so) traditional local authority to zone permissible (non-TPZ) locations for timber operations. Surely, \u201c[l]ogging, even when conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>according to state regulations, may have <em>some </em>impacts properly addressed by the [local] zoning authority. That the state has sought to reduce and control these same occurrences through general regulation does not preempt local zoning control, any more than the state and federal regulation of industrial air pollution would preclude a local zoning authority from relying on air pollution as a reason for excluding industrial plants from residential districts.\u201d <em>(Big Creek v. San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">The Attorney General reached a similar conclusion over 30 years ago, when addressing analogous circumstances. (See <em>County Zoning Ordinances, </em>52 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 138 (1969).) Asked whether a Marin County zoning ordinance purporting to bar \u201ccommercial logging, mining, quarrying, and drilling, together with all associated uses, activities and structures, in certain areas of the county\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 139) was preempted by general state laws (including forestry laws) governing the zoned activities, the Attorney General concluded it was not. \u201cIt is true,\u201d the Attorney General reasoned, \u201cthat California has numerous laws regulating each of the activities prohibited by the proposed ordinance. However, these laws do nothing to preclude an otherwise valid zoning ordinance which prohibits extraction of the resource in question.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 139-140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">Specifically with respect to \u201cthe field of commercial logging\u201d <em>(County Zoning Ordinances, supra, </em>52 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at p. 140), the Attorney General in evaluating Marin County\u2019s ordinance stated: \u201cThe Forest Practice Act [then \u00a7\u00a7 4521-4618], together with the forest practice rules . . . comprehensively regulate forest practices [so as to] occupy the entire field [of forest practices] and local ordinances with respect to such general practices, are invalid due to such preemption. ... In our opinion, however, this pre-empted area is not so broad as to invalidate a zoning ordinance which <em>prohibits </em>logging where such prohibition is otherwise reasonable.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">For similar reasons we conclude that today\u2019s general forestry statutes and regulations fall short of \u201cindicat[ing] clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Deukmejian v. County of Mendocino, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 485), respecting the location of timber operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">(c) <em>Partial coverage/adverse effect on transient citizens</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 overriding concern appears to be that localities may by locational zoning prohibit timber harvesting altogether. The ordinance before us does not have that effect, nor does it appear that any county has attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>such a result.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The zone district ordinance permits timber harvesting on parcels zoned timberland production, mineral extraction industrial, and parks, recreation and open space. To require that commercial timber harvesting occur on land in a \u201ctimberland production\u201d or other specified zone is no more a ban on timber harvesting than a regulation requiring that industrial land uses occur on land zoned \u201cindustrial\u201d is a ban on factories. County concedes that landowners wishing to harvest timber may apply to County for approval to rezone parcels to TPZ and that County may not deny TPZ rezoning to any qualifying parcel (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51113, subd. (a)(1)), nor may County prohibit timber harvesting in TPZ\u2019s.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\">We previously have explained that a local ordinance is not impliedly preempted by conflict with state law unless it \u201cmandate[s] what state law expressly forbids, [or] forbid[s] what state law expressly mandates.\u201d <em>(Great Western Shows, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 21 </em>Cal.4th at p. 866.) That is because, when a local ordinance \u201cdoes not prohibit what the statute commands or command what it prohibits,\u201d the ordinance is not \u201cinimical to\u201d the statute. <em>(Sherwin-Williams Co. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 893, 902 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 215, 844 P.2d 534].) Here, County\u2019s ordinances are not impliedly preempted by conflict with state forestry law because it is reasonably possible for a timber operator to comply with both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">The zone district ordinance does not mandate what general forestry law forbids or forbids what general forestry law mandates. While the forestry laws generally encourage \u201cmaximum sustained production of high-quality timber products . . . while giving consideration to\u201d competing values (\u00a7 4513), they do not require that every harvestable tree be cut. Accordingly, County\u2019s zoning ordinance does not conflict with state law simply because it may have the effect of placing some trees, at least temporarily, off limits to logging.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nor does it appear the Board has adopted for Santa Cruz, or any other county, rules that comprehensively address appropriate geographical locations within the county for timber harvesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">In sum, plaintiffs have not identified a clear statement by the Legislature of an intent, when enacting the FPA, to preempt traditional local zoning authority over the location of timber operations. Accordingly, and for all the foregoing reasons, we conclude, as did the Court of Appeal in <em>Big </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number><em>Creek v. San Mateo, </em>that \u201cthe Legislature did not intend to preclude counties from using their zoning authority to prohibit timber cutting on lands outside the TPZ\u2019s\u201d <em>(Big Creek v. San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 426).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">D. <em>The Helicopter Ordinance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">Like the zone district ordinance\u2019s specification of permissible zone districts for timber harvesting, County\u2019s helicopter ordinance is a locational zoning provision that regulates not how timber operations may be conducted, but rather where they may take place. (See <em>Big Creek v. San Mateo, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at pp. 424-425.) The helicopter ordinance does not attempt to locally regulate the removal of timber, as it speaks neither to whether nor how helicopters may be used to remove timber. County concedes it lacks authority to prohibit timber removal by helicopters or to regulate the manner in which any such removal is conducted. The helicopter ordinance requires simply that any helicopter staging, loading, and servicing facilities associated with timber operations be <em>located </em>either on a parcel of land zoned for timber harvesting or on a parcel adjacent to such, and within the borders of an approved timber harvesting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">Accordingly\u2014and for the reasons reviewed in detail above\u2014the helicopter ordinance is preempted neither expressly by section 4516.5(d) nor impliedly by general state forestry law. In the case of the helicopter ordinance, which County apparently enacted to address citizens\u2019 fears created by helicopters transporting multi-ton logs by air over or near their neighborhoods, and citizen concerns with throbbing and unbearable noise, the conclusion is buttressed by the fact that both the FPA and the TPA expressly contemplate the survival of localities\u2019 power to abate nuisances endangering public health or safety. (See especially Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 4514; Gov. Code, \u00a7 51115.5, subds. (a), (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Specifically, the FPA provides that \u201c[n]o provision of [the FPA] or any ruling, requirement, or policy of the [B]oard is a limitation on ... the power of any city or county or city and county to declare, prohibit, and abate nuisances.\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 4514, subd. (a).) And the TPA provides that, while timber operations conducted within a TPZ pursuant to the FPA \u201cshall not constitute a nuisance\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51115.5, subd. (a)), that limitation is inapplicable to any timber operation that \u201cendangers public health or public safety or . . . prohibits the free passage or use of any navigable lake, river, bay, stream, canal, or basin, or any public park, street, or highway\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd.

The majority pulls an interpretive rabbit out of a statutory hat by construing Public Resources Code section 4516.5, subdivision (d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> part of the Z\u2019berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973 (\u00a74511 et seq.) (FPA), as preempting only county-imposed limitations on <em>how </em>timber operations occur, and not local restrictions on <em>where </em>these activities take place. This interpretation cannot be reconciled with the language and purpose of section 4516.5, subdivision (d); with the FPA generally; or with common sense. The distinction that the majority draws between county resolutions, rules, and ordinances regulating how logging transpires, and measures controlling where it takes place, breaks down upon passing scrutiny and provides a roadmap for those who would use technical artifices to evade the letter and spirit of the FPA. The Court of Appeal below properly rejected this delusive distinction and concluded that state law preempts the resolutions and ordinances that are at issue here. I agree with the Court of Appeal, and would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">The disputed resolutions and ordinances were adopted by Santa Cruz County (County) in 1999. Of the measures presently before us, two combine to limit timber harvesting to particular zone districts (Santa Cruz County Res. No. 493-99; Santa Cruz County Ord. No. 4577) and the other forbids helicopter staging, service, and loading areas except within certain areas (Santa Cruz County Ord. No. 4572). The question presented here concerns whether these enactments are preempted by the FPA and, in particular, by section 4516.5, subdivision (d). This subdivision states that, except for exercising authority delegated to them by the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection (Board of Forestry) to require bonds or other surety for the protection of roads, \u201cindividual counties shall not otherwise regulate the conduct of timber operations, as defined by this chapter, or require the issuance of any permit or license for those operations.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">To ascertain the meaning of this language, \u201cwe look to the intent of the Legislature in enacting the law, \u2018being careful to give the statute\u2019s words their plain, commonsense meaning. [Citation.] If the language of the statute is not ambiguous, the plain meaning controls and resort to extrinsic sources to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>determine the Legislature\u2019s intent is unnecessary.\u2019 [Citation.] Additionally, we must interpret [section 4516.5, subdivision (d)] in context with the entire statute and the statutory scheme. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Jennings </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 254, 263 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 645, 95 P.3d 906].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">Following these principles, it is important to note at the outset that the preemption provision replaced a statutory scheme that allowed for county regulation of timber operations above and beyond that undertaken by the state. The FPA is designed to \u201ccreate and maintain an effective and comprehensive system of regulation and use of all timberlands.\u201d (\u00a7 4513.) Toward this purpose, the FPA creates an architecture for state control over timber operations. As originally enacted, the FPA also allowed counties to, \u201cwithin the reasonable exercise of their police power . . . adopt rules and regulations by ordinance or resolution which are stricter than those provided under this chapter and its regulations.\u201d (Former \u00a7 4516, added by Stats. 1973, ch. 880, \u00a7 4, pp. 1614, 1615.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">By the early 1980\u2019s, however, some observers regarded county ordinances as having \u201cessentially prevented the harvest of timber, contrary to the intent of the FPA.\u201d (Dept. of Forestry, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 856 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 15, 1982, p. 2.) This concern prompted a revision of the FPA in 1982 that replaced county regulation of timber operations with a system in which counties could recommend rules and regulations to the Board of Forestry. As signed into law, the amendments deleted the provisions of the FPA that had allowed for stricter local control over timber operations. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1561, \u00a7 2, p. 6164.) At the same time, the measure added section 4516.5 to the law. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1561, \u00a7 3, pp. 6164\u20146165.) Whereas the deleted provisions had endorsed direct local regulation of timber harvesting, section 4516.5 instead allows counties to recommend proposed forestry rules to the Board of Forestry, thereby channeling local concerns through the state agency with principal responsibility for interpreting the FPA. (\u00a7 4516.5, subd. (a).) The Board of Forestry must adopt these proposed rules as regulations if they comport with state law and are necessary to protect the \u201cneeds and conditions\u201d of the proposing county. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) Except for this procedure for proposing regulations to the Board of Forestry, and limited, delegated authority to require surety for the protection of roads <em>(id., </em>subd. (e)), the FPA prohibits counties from regulating timber operations. As stated above, \u201cindividual counties shall not otherwise regulate the conduct of timber operations, as defined by this chapter, or require the issuance of any permit or license for those operations.\u201d (\u00a7 4516.5, subd. (d).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>The plain language of this preemption provision offers no support for the interpretation advanced by <em>Big Creek Lumber Co. v. County of San Mateo </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 418, 424-426 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 159] <em>(Big Creek I) </em>and adopted by the majority (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1157), to the effect that the statute preempts only county rules, regulations, and ordinances affecting how timber operations occur, while leaving untouched measures addressing where these operations take place. Instead, the preemption provision speaks in terms that are expansive enough to leave no doubt that the Legislature intended to displace all local rules, ordinances, and resolutions specifically regulating timber operations. Section 4516.5, subdivision (d) prohibits county regulation of \u201cthe conduct of timber operations.\u201d As <em>Big Creek I </em>and the decision by the Court of Appeal below recognized, \u201cconduct\u201d means \u201c \u2018the act, manner, or process of carrying out (as a task) or carrying forward (as a business, government, or war).\u2019 (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1970) p. 473.)\u201d <em>(Big Creek I, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 426; see also Black\u2019s Law Dict. (6th ed. 1991) p. 295 [defining \u201cconduct\u201d as \u201c[p]ersonal behavior; deportment; mode of action; any positive or negative act\u201d].) If we substitute this definition of \u201cconduct\u201d into the statute, section 4516.5, subdivision (d) would provide in relevant part: \u201cIndividual counties shall not otherwise regulate the [act, manner, or process] of timber operations, as defined by this chapter, or require the issuance of any permit or license for those operations.\u201d The Court of Appeal below, therefore, accurately discerned that \u201cconduct,\u201d as used in the statute, \u201cnecessarily includes the \u2018act\u2019 of doing the task at all. Local measures that forbid logging in certain locations \u2018regulate the conduct of timber operations\u2019 in those places in the most fundamental way imaginable\u2014by prohibiting it outright.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\">The Legislature did not draw a line between permissible \u201cwhere\u201d and impermissible \u201chow\u201d ordinances both because such a distinction would have no relationship to the impetus for the amendments and because, in practical fact, no such line can ever be drawn. Does an ordinance precluding the clear-cutting method of logging within riparian corridors concern <em>where </em>clear-cutting may take place, or <em>how </em>logging occurs within specified areas? Clearly it does both. What about an ordinance that precludes the use of heavy machinery within county limits? Does that ordinance limit <em>how </em>a business may conduct its affairs (i.e., by using heavy machinery, or not), or <em>where </em>it may operate (i.e., in the county, or not), if it chooses to use that machinery? And does an ordinance barring the yarding of felled trees by helicopter become any more permissible if the county achieves the same goal by drafting the measure so that it forbids the placement of helicopter landing pads anywhere in the county?</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>True, a regulation may superficially purport to address only how or where timber operations take place. But given the aims of the Legislature in adding section 4516.5 to the FPA, I find it difficult to believe that section 4516.5, subdivision (d) concerns only the form, and not the substance, of county ordinances. To paraphrase the point made by the Court of Appeal below, the Legislature could not have intended to allow counties a continued ability to \u201cessentially prohibit[] the harvest of timber\u201d (Dept. of Forestry, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 856 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 2), through the simple expedient of disallowing said harvesting virtually anywhere in the county. And whatever the Legislature had in mind in enacting section 4516.5, subdivision (d), I doubt that it intended to create a cottage industry in the drafting of local ordinances that appear to regulate only where timber operations may occur, while in actual practice directing how these operations may take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">From the above, I conclude that section 4516.5, subdivision (d), on its own, directs affirmance of the Court of Appeal, for both the zoning ordinance and the helicopter ordinance regulate the \u201cconduct of timber operations\u201d by directly constraining the \u201cact, manner, or process\u201d of these operations. Yet while the plain language of section 4516.5, subdivision (d) suffices to resolve this case, other provisions of the FPA further establish that the how/where distinction espied by the majority was never contemplated by the Legislature, and that lawmakers sought to abrogate ordinances similar to those involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">As enacted, section 4516.5 included a sunset provision that nullified existing county regulations and ordinances regulating timber operations. The sunset provision provided as follows: \u201cNotwithstanding this section or any other provision of state law, any county which regulated the growing or harvesting of timber or the conduct of timber harvesting operations pursuant to an ordinance, rule, or regulation in effect on January 1, 1982, may continue fully to enforce the ordinance, rule or regulation until July 1, 1983. On and after that date, all such local ordinances, rules and regulations, unless adopted pursuant to this section, shall be null, void, and have no force or effect.\u201d (Former \u00a7 4516.5, subd. (e), added by Stats. 1982, ch. 1561, \u00a7 3, pp. 6164, 6165.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This provision on its face renders null and void any and all local ordinances, rules, and regulations \u201cwhich regulate[] the growing or harvesting of timber or the conduct of timber harvesting operations.\u201d The majority regards comparable language as unambiguously manifesting an intent to outlaw all local regulation of timber operations. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1156.) The reasoning embraced by the majority thus begs the following question: Why would the Legislature declare <em>all </em>county ordinances, rules, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>regulations regarding timber operations null and void in former section 4516.5, subdivision (e), if in the preceding subdivision it only sought to limit local authority over <em>how </em>timber harvesting could take place?</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\">The FPA\u2019s savings clause, meanwhile, reserves to counties their traditional prerogative of declaring nuisances. (See \u00a74514, subd. (a).) Yet neither the savings clause nor any other provision of the FPA mentions zoning or other locational ordinances, except to provide that in situations where timber harvesting undertaken to minimize fire hazards is <em>exempt </em>from the FPA (thus averting any possibility of conflicts between the FPA and local ordinances), said harvesting must comply with generic zoning ordinances. (\u00a7 4584, subd. (j)(4).) That the Legislature has expressly preserved within the FPA one aspect of local police power (nuisance regulation) but not another (zoning) indicates that the omission of the latter was intentional, not accidental, and that zoning designed to limit timber operations does not escape the preemptive scope of section 4516.5, subdivision (d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">The analyses and reports prepared for Senate Bill No. 856\u2014the legislation that abrogated local regulatory authority over timber operations and added section 4516.5 to the FPA\u2014shed additional light on the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the measure. The Legislature and its staff framed the preemptive effect of the legislation in broad terms. The conference committee report on this measure provided, in pertinent part, \u201cCertain counties (Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Sonoma, Marin) have adopted forest practice rules and regulations which are stricter than those provided under the Z\u2019berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act. This bill would take away that power by preempting counties from exercising local control.\u201d (Conf. Com., Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 856 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 24, 1982, p. 2.) Similarly, the Legislative Analyst\u2019s analysis of the bill provided, \u201cThis bill . . . [r]epeals provisions of existing law which authorize counties to regulate timber harvesting more restrictively than provided under the Z\u2019berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act,\u201d while noting that the legislation \u201c[establishes an alternate process whereby individual counties may recommend to the Board of Forestry for adoption new rules and regulations governing timber operations.\u201d (Legis. Analyst, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 856 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) May 24, 1982, p. 1.) Likewise, the enrolled bill report prepared by the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Department of Forestry) observed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>legislation <em>\u201celiminates the authority of individual counties to regulate timber harvesting operations, </em>and establishes instead a procedure for the Board of Forestry to adopt rules to cover local concerns.\u201d (Dept. of Forestry, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 856 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 1, italics added.) Noticeably absent from these and other expressions of intent is any indication that the Legislature intended to allow counties continued control over <em>where </em>timber harvesting could occur, and eliminate only local authority over <em>how </em>logging operations are performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">In sum, the Legislature enacted section 4516.5 in response to local ordinances that had \u201cessentially prevented the harvest of timber, contrary to the intent of the FPA.\u201d (Dept. of Forestry, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 856 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 2.) Consistent with the Legislature\u2019s objective, section 4516.5, subdivision (d) prohibits local regulation of \u201cthe conduct of timber operations.\u201d The word \u201cconduct,\u201d as used in section 4516.5, subdivision (d), includes <em>both </em>the act of doing something <em>and </em>how it is done. And at the same time that the Legislature enacted section 4516.5, it \u201csunset-ted\u201d all local rules, regulations and ordinances relating to \u201cthe growing or harvesting of timber or the conduct of timber harvesting operations\u201d (former \u00a7 4516.5, subd. (e)), using language so sweeping that the majority does not even attempt to address it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In my view, these facts establish that section 4516.5, subdivision (d) constrains counties\u2019 ability to directly regulate timber harvesting, regardless of whether said regulations are better described as affecting how logging operations occur or where they take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">Nonetheless, the majority regards the Legislature as having limited only counties\u2019 authority to regulate how logging transpires. In other words, the majority considers it perfectly acceptable for a county to \u201cessentially prevent[] the harvest of timber\u201d (Dept. of Forestry, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 856 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 2), provided a county does so by regulating <em>where </em>timber harvesting occurs, not <em>how </em>it happens. The majority advances several arguments in support of this interpretation of section 4516.5, subdivision (d). None of these contentions withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>The majority begins by invoking a presumption against state preemption of \u201ca field covered by municipal regulation when there is a significant local interest to be served that may differ from one locality to another.\u201d <em>(Fisher </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 644, 707 [209 Cal.Rptr. 682, 693 P.2d 261].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority restyles this presumption into a \u201cclear indication\u201d rule, announcing that \u201cwhen local government regulates in an area over which it traditionally has exercised control, such as the location of particular land uses, California courts will presume, absent a clear indication of preemptive intent from the Legislature, that such regulation is <em>not </em>preempted by state statute.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1149.) Neither <em>IT Corp. </em>v. <em>Solano County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 81, 93 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 513, 820 P.2d 1023], which the majority cites for this principle, nor any other decision by this court has ever so augmented the <em>Fisher </em>presumption against state abrogation of local regulations. Instead, the approach adopted by the majority appears to draw from the rule applied in cases involving federal preemption of state law. <em>(See Bronco Wine Co. </em>v. <em>Jolly </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 943, 956-958 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 180, 95 P.3d 422].) The majority transplants this clear indication rule into the context of state preemption of local regulations, but without considering whether the factors that have led courts to recognize the precept in federal preemption cases apply with equal force here. Nor does the majority attempt to devise a coherent approach toward distinguishing those areas in which localities have \u201ctraditionally\u201d exercised control from those in which they have not, except to say that \u201cthe location of particular land uses\u201d generally qualifies as a traditional subject of local regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-4\">Putting these deficits aside, and leaving for another day the question of whether it is appropriate to employ a clear indication rule in disputes involving state preemption of local regulations, there are several'problems with the majority\u2019s application of this approach here. The majority concludes that the Legislature did not clearly indicate its preemptive intent with regard to zoning because section 4516.5, subdivision (d) does not refer to zoning or other locational restrictions expressly or \u201cin terms.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1152.) But the majority cites no authority that has endorsed or even intimated this \u201cmagic words\u201d approach to statutory interpretation. Up until now, it has sufficed for the Legislature to make its intentions known in the manner it sees fit, without being required to employ particular terms. The Legislature that enacted section 4516.5, subdivision (d) could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>foreseen that it had to refer to county zoning or other locational ordinances \u201cin terms\u201d for a court to later determine that lawmakers meant to preclude these measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">Perhaps more important, the \u201cterms\u201d approach subtly invades the province and prerogatives of the Legislature by requiring lawmakers to embrace particular verbal formulations as a prerequisite to judicial recognition of their avowed intent. Our job as jurists is not to make the Legislature jump through linguistic hoops of our own capricious design. \u201c[T]he [majority] does not explain by what authority courts can dictate to legislative drafters the forms in which laws must be written to express the legislative intent. Rather, what <em>is </em>required is that the Legislature demonstrate its intention with sufficient clarity that a reviewing court can discern and effectuate it.\u201d <em>(In re Pedro T., supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 1048-1049, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">This latter criticism has particular force here, given how the majority has rather arbitrarily chosen the \u201cterms\u201d it requires. Section 4516.5, subdivision (d) expressly discusses the <em>substantive </em>terms of the preempted local regulations\u2014 i.e., they must concern \u201cthe conduct of timber operations.\u201d But the majority rejects this wording as insufficient and unclear. Instead, the majority concludes that the Legislature should have known that it had to expressly address zoning and locational ordinances \u201cin terms\u201d for us to discern a preemptive intent. In other words, the required \u201cterms\u201d involve the manner of regulation, not the substance of these rules. Again, how the Legislature should have foreseen this nuance is anyone\u2019s guess. Undoubtedly, the Legislature will respond to this approach with more detailed and complex statutes that try to anticipate the particular \u201cterms\u201d courts will require in the future. I do not grasp how this will clarify or otherwise improve the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">Next, the majority claims that the Legislature must have intended that the words \u201cthe conduct of,\u201d as used within section 4516.5, subdivision (d), would limit the scope of the preemption provision to <em>how </em>logging occurs; otherwise, the majority asserts, this phrasing would constitute mere surplusage. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1155.) The majority reads too much into these three words. This error leads it to adopt a construction of section 4516.5, subdivision (d) so susceptible to abuse and evasion through clever drafting that it violates another principle of statutory interpretation, \u201c[superfluity does not vitiate\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3537), a maxim that directs that the presence of arguably unnecessary terms in a statute should not, by itself, produce an interpretation that will defeat the Legislature\u2019s central aims in enacting the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">In prohibiting local regulation of \u201cthe conduct of timber operations,\u201d the Legislature simply echoed phrasing used elsewhere in the FPA. Specifically, section 4551.5 states, in pertinent part, that rules and regulations adopted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>the Board of Forestry \u201cshall apply to the conduct of timber operations.\u201d Pursuant to its authority to regulate \u201cthe conduct of timber operations,\u201d the Board of Forestry controls both <em>how </em>timber harvesting occurs and <em>where </em>it takes place. To take two examples of regulations that affect where logging may occur, the Board of Forestry has limited timber harvesting in \u201cchannel zones\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 916.9, subd. (e)), and near bird nesting sites <em>(id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 919.2-919.3). The use of the phrase \u201cthe conduct of\u2019 in section 4551.5, therefore, does not cabin the Board of Forestry\u2019s regulatory authority only to <em>how </em>timber harvesting occurs. And when the Legislature uses the same phrasing in different parts of a statute, all else being equal, we assume that it intends to imbue the terms with the same meaning in each context. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 979, 986 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 699, 911 P.2d 1374].) This principle means that the identical \u201cthe conduct of\u2019 phrasing in section 4516.5, subdivision (d) does not limit the preemption provision only to county regulations concerning <em>how </em>logging takes place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-4\">The majority also purports to find support for its interpretation in the California Timberland Productivity Act of 1982 (TPA), another statute relating to timber harvesting. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1489, \u00a7\u00a7 1-39, pp. 5748-5766.) The TPA seeks to, inter alia, \u201c[d]iscourage premature or unnecessary conversion of timberland to urban and other uses\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51102, subd. (a)(2)) and \u201c[ejncourage investment in timberlands based on reasonable expectation of harvest\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (a)(4)). Because conventional taxation methods were regarded as deterring efficient timber operations, the TPA amends but essentially reaffirms a system adopted by a predecessor statute through which timberlands may be placed in \u201cTimberland Preserve Zones\u201d (now referred to as \u201cTimberland Production Zones\u201d or TPZ\u2019s). (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 51112, subd. (c); Unkel &amp; Cromwell, <em>California\u2019s Timber Yield Tax </em>(1978) 6 Ecology L.Q. 831, 845.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Parcels designated TPZ are assessed for tax purposes based on their value for timber production and compatible uses. (See Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7431, 434.5, 435.) This scheme thus affords a measure of tax relief to those who grow and harvest timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">The majority stresses that various provisions of the TPA that relate to TPZ designations mention and rely upon local zoning authority. (Maj. opn, <em>ante, </em>at p. 1154.) While this is an accurate observation, it does little to prove that the Legislature countenanced the use of this authority to directly regulate timber operations. Neither TPZ designations themselves, nor any other reference to zoning within the TPA, suggests that the lawmakers who enacted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>statute and the pertinent amendments to the FPA considered it acceptable for counties to use their zoning powers in this specific manner. Only section 4516.5, subdivision (d) speaks to this subject, and its plain language establishes that the Legislature has taken this authority away from counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">Another part of the TPA relied upon by the majority, Government Code section 51115, provides that \u201c[pjarcels zoned as timberland production shall be zoned so as to restrict their use to growing and harvesting timber and to compatible uses. The growing and harvesting of timber on those parcels shall be regulated solely pursuant to state statutes and regulations.\u201d This language, the majority states, expresses an unambiguous legislative intent to preclude local regulation of timber operations. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1155.) I agree, and observe that the sunset provision enacted in 1982 as Public Resources Code section 4516.5, subdivision (e), contained similar language, suggesting that the Legislature intended with section 4516.5 as well to prevent counties from regulating how or where timber operations may occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">According to the majority, \u201c[o]ne implication of [the language within section 51115], of course, is that the growing and harvesting of timber on non-TPZ parcels need not be regulated solely pursuant to state statutes and regulations.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1155.) This carefully couched phrasing implies, correctly, that alternative implications also exist. The Legislature added the second sentence to Government Code section 51115 in the same stroke as it enacted section 4516.5. (See Stats. 1982, ch. 1561, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, pp. 6164-6165.) In so doing, the Legislature may have intended to reaffirm, within the TPA, the principles endorsed by section 4516.5, subdivision (d). While this may have been unnecessary, the majority\u2019s reading of section 4516.5 creates surplusage of its own. If, as the majority concludes, section 4516.5 does not disturb local zoning authority, there would have been no need for the Legislature to specify, as it has, that timber harvesting conducted for fire-prevention purposes still must comply with local zoning ordinances. (\u00a7 4584, subd. (j)(4).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>The majority also claims that it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d to allow timber harvesting near residential areas, and that the Court of Appeal\u2019s analysis would compel such a result. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1156.) This invocation of the absurdity doctrine is ill considered. Regardless of whether section 4516.5, subdivision (d) prohibits other forms of local control over timber operations, counties still may declare certain timber operations to be nuisances (\u00a7 4514, subd. (a)); propose to the Board of Forestry regulations concerning timber operations, with the Board of Forestry being required to adopt these proposals if they comport with the FPA (\u00a74516.5, subds. (a), (b));<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and regulate harvesting on plots of less than three acres that are not given a TPZ zoning designation (\u00a7 4516.5, subd. (f)). Also, the Department of Forestry regulates timber harvesting through its review and approval of the timber harvesting plans required for virtually all commercial logging. (See \u00a7\u00a7 4581-4583.) The FPA allows Santa Cruz County to recommend that the Board of Forestry adopt additional rules and regulations regarding the content of these plans. (\u00a7 4516.8.) So the real question is much more narrow than the majority suggests: whether it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d to deny localities the right to forbid or limit timber operations, other than those constituting a nuisance, on parcels of more than three acres that are located near residential areas, where the Board of Forestry has declined to enact sufficient prophylactic rules and the pertinent timber harvesting plan has not addressed residents\u2019 concerns. The Legislature already has answered this question in the negative, for as all parties agree, it already has precluded local regulation of timber harvesting on all parcels zoned TPZ, regardless of their location. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 51115.) Apparently the Legislature is of the view that the Board of Forestry and the approval process for timber harvesting plans will provide sufficient safeguards in such cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-4\">Finally, the majority claims to find support for its interpretation of section 4516.5, subdivision (d) in the Legislature\u2019s perceived acquiescence in the holding in <em>Big Creek I, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th 418. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1156-1157.) Some perspective is in order here. We granted review to settle a dispute between two\u2014and only two\u2014published decisions by the Courts of Appeal. <em>Big Creek I </em>was the earlier decided case, but under the circumstances I am aware of no authority\u2014and the majority cites to none\u2014 holding that we must defer to the initial panel\u2019s conclusions simply because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>they were the first to publish their views. Were legislative acquiescence so easily discerned and so potent a consideration, we would never disapprove of the earlier of two conflicting decisions. Such a rule would make our jobs inestimably easier but, easily, less estimable. Yet we do uphold the more recent decision in such situations, time and again. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Leal </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 999, 1003, 1010 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 869, 94 P.3d 1071]; <em>Hassan </em>v. <em>Mercy American River Hospital </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 709, 715, 724, fn. 4 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 623, 74 P.3d 726]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Adair </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 895, 902, 908, fn. 6 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 799, 62 P.3d 45].) Whatever the merits of legislative acquiescence as an interpretive tool, it has virtually no bearing on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">The majority also adopts a mistaken understanding of the doctrine of legislative acquiescence. The majority surmises legislative acquiescence in <em>Big Creek I, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th 418, because the Legislature has amended the FPA numerous times since that decision, without revisiting section 4516.5. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1156.) But the acquiescence doctrine requires more than merely that the Legislature amended a statute at some point after a particular provision has been judicially construed. For the doctrine to apply in full measure, the general subject that had been interpreted by the courts must come before the Legislature in connection with a subsequent amendment. <em>(Ventura County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 483, 506 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 304, 940 P.2d 891] <em>(Ventura County).) </em>Here, the parties have not brought to our attention any indication that the subject of state preemption of local authority over timber operations has come before the Legislature in connection with any amendment to the FPA over the past decade. Section 4516.5 itself was last amended in 1984, more than 10 years before <em>Big Creek I </em>was decided. (Stats. 1984, ch. 1446, \u00a7 1, pp. 5059-5060.) The amendments to various <em>other </em>sections of the FPA that the majority relies upon fail to establish that the Legislature acquiesced in the interpretation of section 4516.5, subdivision (d) advanced in <em>Big Creek I. </em>(See <em>Ventura County, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 506.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\"><em>Ventura County, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 483, squarely addresses the acquiescence issue before us. There we were concerned with the proper interpretation of the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (Gov. Code., \u00a7 31450 et seq.). A Court of Appeal decision more than 10 years before <em>Ventura County </em>had interpreted portions of the law pertaining to the computation of pensions. (See <em>Ventura County, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 490-492.) In the intervening years, the Legislature amended various provisions of the law numerous times, without disturbing the interpretation advanced by the Court of Appeal. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 505.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>The foregoing facts, it was contended, generated an inference of legislative acquiescence in the interpretation advanced by the earlier court. <em>(Ventura County, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 505-506.) We disagreed, observing that \u201c[i]t is not clear, however, that the general subject of county employee pensions was before the Legislature when any of the amendments to which the county refers was enacted. Instead the amendments appear to address discrete aspects of the law or to have a general but nonsubstantive effect, such as gender-neutral wording. The county identifies none which suggests that the subject of pension computation generally was before the Legislature when one or more of the amendments was enacted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 506.) Similarly here, while the Legislature has amended distinct provisions of the FPA many times in the decade since <em>Big Creek I </em>was decided, no indication appears that the Legislature considered the preemption of local regulation of timber operations in connection with any of these amendments. The majority\u2019s reliance on legislative acquiescence under these circumstances is impossible to reconcile with our reasoning in <em>Ventura County.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1213-4\">Furthermore, even assuming that the Legislature has accepted the result reached by <em>Big Creek I, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th 418, the question remains whether the Legislature has endorsed a broad application of the reasoning in <em>Big Creek I </em>similar to that embraced by the majority here. <em>Big Creek I </em>dealt with a county ordinance that prohibited logging within 1,000 feet of a legal dwelling. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 422.) The <em>Big Creek I </em>court found the ordinance valid because it regulated where logging was conducted rather than how it was performed. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 424-425.) I am unconvinced that the Legislature\u2019s failure to revisit section 4516.5, subdivision (d) in the decade since implies that it would approve of <em>every </em>ordinance cast as a \u201cwhere\u201d rather than a \u201chow\u201d regulation, even if in substance the ordinance seems to control the \u201cwhere\u201d only as a means of getting to the \u201chow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">Santa Cruz\u2019s helicopter ordinance seems a case in point. The County enacted the ordinance only after the Board of Forestry declined to enact a proposed regulation that would have limited the use of helicopters in timber harvesting. The ordinance regulates where timber companies may locate their helicopter staging, loading, and service areas. By controlling where helicopters may be used for timber operations, the ordinance effectively regulates how logging will be performed within county limits. By upholding this helicopter ordinance, in particular, the majority effectively concedes that the purported distinction between ordinances that regulate how timber operations are conducted and those that regulate where they occur is wholly illusory, and that with a drafting sleight-of-hand virtually any local limitation upon timber operations will evade the proscription of county regulation set forth in section 4516.5, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>It might be the case that the County can defend its helicopter ordinance under a nuisance theory. The parties have not briefed this issue, and I would not decide it. But otherwise, I believe that the County\u2019s zoning and helicopter resolutions and ordinances violate the letter and spirit of section 4516.5, subdivision (d). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">Kennard, J. and Baxter, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">The petition of plaintiffs and appellants for a rehearing was denied August 30, 2006, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.

But \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that in assessing the import of a statute, we must concern ourselves with the Legislature\u2019s purpose at the time of the enactment.\u201d <em>(In re Pedro I </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1041, 1048 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 74, 884 P.2d 1022], italics added.)
