The city, deeming the policy statement the group provided ambiguous and therefore insufficient, discontinued its subsidy. Members of the group sued, claiming, among other things, that the city\u2019s action violated their freedoms of speech and association. The trial court sustained the city\u2019s demurrer, and the Court of Appeal affirmed. We conclude the Court of Appeal correctly determined that the complaint does not establish a violation of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights and affirm the lower court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Because this case comes to us on a demurrer for failure to state a cause of action, we accept as true the well-pleaded allegations in plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint. \u201c \u2018We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.\u2019 <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241, 41 A.L.R.3d 1187].) Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. <em>(Speegle </em>v. <em>Board of Fire Underwriters </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 34, 42 [172 P.2d 867].)\u201d <em>(Blank v. Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].) \u201c \u2018[A] complaint otherwise good on its face is subject to demurrer when facts judicially noticed render it defective.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374 [228 Cal.Rptr. 878]; see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.30, subd. (a).) The following facts appear from the allegations of the complaint and from judicially noticeable sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Plaintiffs are 14 individual adult and youth participants in the Berkeley Sea Scouts, suing for themselves and other program participants. The Berkeley Sea Scouts (Sea Scouts) are volunteers joining together in a nonprofit association with no formal administrative structure, no budget, and no employees. Adults, including some of the named plaintiffs, use Sea Scout vessels to teach sailing, seamanship, marine engine repair, electrical repair, woodworking, and other skills for a maritime career, as well as teamwork, to teenagers who pay no more than $7 a year to participate. Ethnic diversity is a hallmark of the Sea Scouts, and many youth participants are economically disadvantaged. Girls as well as boys participate, and the Sea Scouts have never actually discriminated against anyone on the basis of sexual orientation or religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">According to the operative complaint, the Sea Scouts are \u201ca subdivision of,\u201d or \u201cassociated/affiliated with,\u201d the national Boy Scouts of America (BSA). The Sea Scouts operate under what the complaint describes as BSA\u2019s \u201cregional office,\u201d the Mount Diablo Council. Each Sea Scout \u201cship\u201d functions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>as the equivalent of a Boy Scout troop. BSA provides the group with a low-cost maritime liability insurance policy but gives it no direct funding. BSA, according to the complaint, follows a \u201cpolicy of discriminating against homosexuals\u2019 and atheists\u2019 participation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In the late 1930\u2019s, Berkeley began giving BSA one or more free berths at its marina for use by the Sea Scouts, after the Mount Diablo Council permitted Berkeley to quarry rock from BSA property to build the marina and breakwater. The arrangement was formalized by city resolutions in 1945 and 1969 that required compliance with marina rules and regulations and allowed revocation on 30 days\u2019 written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In March 1997, in response to requests from other nonprofit organizations for free berths, the city manager recommended and the Berkeley City Council adopted through resolution No. 58,859-N.S. (Resolution 58,859) a uniform policy for awarding free berths to nonprofit community service organizations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the resolution, an organization seeking free berth space must \u201csupply a beneficial public service,\u201d the benefit of which \u201cgreatly exceeds the value of the berth.\u201d The organization also must \u201cdemonstrate,\u201d through \u201c[m]embership policy and practices,\u201d among other criteria, that it \u201cpromote[s] cultural and ethnic diversity.\u201d Resolution 58,859 goes on to specify that access to marina facilities may \u201cnot be predicated on a person\u2019s race, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, political affiliation, disability or medical condition.\u201d The resolution provides for the Berkeley Waterfront Commission (Waterfront Commission) to review applications and make recommendations to the city council. Organizations receiving berthing subsidies are to have those subsidies reviewed annually by the city council after a review and recommendation by the Waterfront Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>- The continued provision of free marina berths to the Sea Scouts came up for review in the Waterfront Commission in early 1998. The commission expressed concern that BSA\u2019s policy of discrimination against homosexuals and atheists was in conflict with Resolution 58,859 and asked the Sea Scouts to provide a \u201clocal policy statement\u201d ensuring nondiscrimination. The Sea Scouts, in negotiation with the Mount Diablo Council, approved a policy statement intended to satisfy Berkeley\u2019s requirements. In a letter to the waterfront manager, dated April 8, 1998, the Sea Scouts stated: \u201cWe will continue to comply with the Constitution of the United States of America, the laws of the State of California and the Berkeley Municipal Code\u2014including Section 13.28.060 and City Council Resolution No. 58,85[9], N.S. [ft] ... We actively recruit adult leaders and adolescents meeting the minimum age requirements without regard to sex, race, color, national origin, political affiliation, religious preference, marital status, physical handicap or medical condition. We believe that sexual orientation is a private matter, and we do not ask either adults or youths to divulge this information at any time.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The Waterfront Commission recommended the city council continue the Sea Scouts\u2019 free berths. The city manager, however, recommended the council discontinue the free berths, based on an opinion by the city attorney concluding that continuation of the free berth subsidy to the Sea Scouts would violate both Resolution 58,859 and section 13.28.060 of the Berkeley Municipal Code, which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in the use of city owned or supported facilities and services.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In her opinion, which was provided to the council with the city manager\u2019s recommendation, the city attorney concluded the Sea Scouts\u2019 April 8, 1998, letter did not constitute compliance with Resolution 58,859 or Berkeley Municipal Code section 13.28.060. In the city attorney\u2019s view, the Sea Scouts\u2019 assertion in the April 8 letter that they considered sexual orientation to be \u201ca private matter\u201d did not state a policy that the group would not, in the future, discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. According to the city attorney, the Sea Scouts said they were unwilling to state such an express policy \u201cdue to fear of losing their charter from the Boy Scouts.\u201d From her examination of this court\u2019s then recent opinion in <em>Curran </em>v. <em>Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 670, and her discussion with BSA\u2019s attorney in that case, the city attorney concluded that BSA requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>local groups to adhere to its policy of excluding avowedly gay or atheistic members or adult leaders, even where a local nondiscrimination law requires otherwise. In light of BSA\u2019s policy, the city attorney concluded, the qualified language of the April 8 letter was insufficient to show compliance with Berkeley\u2019s ordinance and resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The Berkeley City Council took up the matter on May 5, 1998. According to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, at the May 5 meeting the city council was \u201cmade aware\u201d that the Sea Scouts had never discriminated against gays or atheists and that the Sea Scout program served an ethnically and economically diverse group of young people. The city council nevertheless voted to end the berth subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">According to the minutes of the May 5 council meeting, the free berths were discontinued \u201cdue to [BSA\u2019s] discriminatory policies against gays and atheists.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a letter giving the Sea Scouts notice their free berths were cancelled, the Berkeley Waterfront Manager indicated the city council had denied free berths to the Sea Scouts because, in the complaint\u2019s words, the Sea Scouts \u201cwere associated with the national Boy Scouts of America organization which has a national policy of discriminating based on sexual orientation and atheism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Because of its hostility to BSA, plaintiffs allege, Berkeley \u201cdecided to punish and intentionally discriminated against the completely innocent children and community volunteer^]\u201d of the Sea Scouts. Berkeley allegedly knew plaintiffs had, in the April 8, 1998, letter, \u201cagreed not to discriminate against gays or atheists.\u201d The city used \u201c[g]uilt by association,\u201d excluding plaintiffs from the free berth program solely because of BSA\u2019s policies, without ever determining that the Sea Scouts themselves \u201cpose[d] the threat feared by the government\u201d\u2014discrimination in the use of publicly owned facilities. \u201cHere, there is no evidence that Plaintiffs or any participant in the Berkeley Sea Scouts program was going to unlawfully discriminate against anyone, yet they have been penalized by the deprivation of the continued free use of the public facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Plaintiffs allege the exclusion of the Sea Scouts from the free berth program violated their rights of free speech and association and constituted a denial of due process and equal protection of the laws. These deprivations of constitutional rights are claimed to be violations of state and federal civil rights laws, including Civil Code sections 51, 52, and 52.1, and title 42 United States Code section 1983. Plaintiffs seek damages reflecting the value of berths they were unable to afford to continue using, the rental they have paid and will pay for the berth they still use, emotional distress, and consequential losses. The complaint does not pray for injunctive or declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The trial court sustained Berkeley\u2019s demurrer to the amended complaint without leave to amend. The Court of Appeal affirmed, reasoning that plaintiffs had merely been denied a city subsidy \u201cbecause they declined to adhere to Berkeley\u2019s nondiscrimination policy.\u201d Berkeley had not \u201cattempted to muzzle anyone\u2019s speech\u201d or force the Sea Scouts to sever their association with BSA, but had only \u201cconditioned a city subsidy on compliance with nondiscrimination principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We granted plaintiffs\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Plaintiffs contend Berkeley violated their rights of free association, speech, and equal treatment under the law by punishing them for being part of BSA despite their having never violated Berkeley\u2019s antidiscrimination laws and having \u201csolemnly promised\u201d not to do so in the future. The Court of Appeal, plaintiffs argue, erred in holding Berkeley had properly conditioned the subsidy on compliance with nondiscrimination laws because plaintiffs \u201chave <em>agreed to </em>comply.\u201d The lower court and Berkeley, plaintiffs maintain, <em>\u201care refusing to take . . . yes for an answer.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Berkeley, in contrast, argues that it may place nondiscrimination conditions on government funding without violating rights of speech and association, and insists it properly denied continued free berthing solely because the Sea Scouts were unable to provide adequate assurances of future nondiscrimination, assurances Berkeley reasonably demanded in light of the known policies of BSA, of which the Sea Scouts are a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">We agree with Berkeley and the Court of Appeal that a government entity may constitutionally require a recipient of funding or subsidy to provide written, unambiguous assurances of compliance with a generally applicable nondiscrimination policy. We further agree Berkeley reasonably concluded the Sea Scouts did not and could not provide satisfactory assurances because of their required adherence to BSA\u2019s discriminatory policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>I. <em>Berkeley Could Constitutionally Demand Sufficient Guarantees of Nondiscrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Berkeley\u2019s requirement that an individual or group receiving a city subsidy in the form of free berths in the Berkeley Marina agree in advance to administer its program without invidious discrimination did not infringe on plaintiffs\u2019 speech or associational rights. In order to meet the city\u2019s mandate of nondiscriminatory participation policies, the Sea Scouts were required neither to espouse nor to denounce any particular viewpoint nor to form or break any association or affiliation, but only to assure Berkeley of their adherence to the city\u2019s policies in connection with subsidized use of Berkeley\u2019s facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Under the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, that Berkeley\u2019s nondiscrimination requirement applied only to programs assisted by a city subsidy, in the form of free berths at the marina, is virtually dispositive. The high court has generally approved, against First Amendment challenges, programs of governmental financial assistance that limit the expressive activities for which the funds may be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In the leading case of <em>Rust v. Sullivan </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 173 [114 L.Ed.2d 233, 111 S.Ct. 1759], the court rejected a First Amendment challenge to regulations prohibiting abortion counseling in programs supported by federal family planning funds. \u201cThe Government can, without violating the Constitution, selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest, without at the same time funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem in another way. In so doing, the Government has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other. \u2018[A] legislature\u2019s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In restricting the range of counseling and advocacy in which programs receiving federal funding could engage, the government had not denied the grantees the right to engage in abortion-related activities. \u201cCongress has merely refused to fund such activities out of the public fisc . . . .\u201d <em>(Rust v. Sullivan, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 198; accord, <em>United States v. American Library Assn., Inc. </em>(2003) 539 U.S. 194, 212 [156 L.Ed.2d 221, 123 S.Ct. 2297] (plur. opn. of Rehnquist, C. J.) [statutory requirement that libraries receiving aid for Internet access use filtering software \u201cdoes not \u2018penalize\u2019 libraries that choose not to install such software, or deny them the right to provide their patrons with unfiltered Internet access. [The statute] simply reflects Congress\u2019 decision not to subsidize their doing so. To the extent that libraries wish to offer unfiltered access, they are free to do so without federal assistance\u201d]; <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Taxation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>With Representation of Wash. </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 540, 549 [76 L.Ed.2d 129, 103 S.Ct. 1997] [denial of full tax-exempt status to an organization that engages in substantial lobbying activities does not infringe on freedom of speech: \u201ca legislature\u2019s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right, and thus is not subject to strict scrutiny\u201d]; cf. <em>Locke v. Davey </em>(2004) 540 U.S. 712, 721 [158 L.Ed.2d 1, 124 S.Ct. 1307] [scholarship program\u2019s exclusion of theology students does not violate First Amendment\u2019s free exercise clause; provision of assistance to those pursuing secular education does not constitute a \u201c \u2018baseline\u2019 \u201d against which denial of assistance to theology students must be deemed a burden on religion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The Supreme Court has applied these principles, in particular, to uphold, against First Amendment challenges, government rules limiting financial assistance to those organizations that agree in advance not to practice invidious discrimination in government-assisted programs. <em>Grove City College v. Bell </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 555 [79 L.Ed.2d 516, 104 S.Ct. 1211] <em>(Grove </em>City) is the closest case on point. A federal statute required recipients of federal education funds to agree not to discriminate on the basis of sex in any program so funded. When the plaintiff college declined to provide an \u201cAssurance of Compliance\u201d with the statute, the federal Department- of Education terminated a program of tuition assistance to the college and its students. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 557-561.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The <em>Grove City </em>plaintiffs attacked the statutory condition as, inter alia, a violation of their First Amendment rights, but the high court found the constitutional claim \u201cwarrants only brief consideration. Congress is free to attach reasonable and unambiguous conditions to federal financial assistance that educational institutions are not obligated to accept. <em>E.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>451 U.S. 1, 17 [67 L.Ed.2d 694, 101 S.Ct. 1531] (1981). Grove City may terminate its participation in the [tuition aid] program and thus avoid the requirements of [the nondiscrimination provision]. Students affected by the Department\u2019s action may either take their [tuition aid] elsewhere or attend Grove City without federal financial assistance. <em>Requiring Grove City to comply with Title IX\u2019s prohibition of discrimination as a condition for its continued eligibility to participate in the [tuition aid] program infringes no First Amendment rights of the College or its students.\u201d (Grove City, supra, </em>465 U.S. at pp. 575-576, italics added; see also <em>Bob Jones University v. United States </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 574, 602-604 [76 L.Ed.2d 157, 103 S.Ct. 2017] <em>(Bob Jones) </em>[restrictive condition on charitable tax status, requiring lack of racial discrimination, did not infringe university\u2019s First Amendment right to freedom of religion because the compelling interest in preventing racial discrimination in education justified the policy\u2019s limited impact on exercise of religion: \u201cDenial of tax benefits will inevitably have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>substantial impact on the operation of private religious schools, but will not prevent those schools from observing their religious tenets\u201d].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Similarly, Berkeley, in conditioning free berths on a group\u2019s adoption of a nondiscriminatory membership policy, has not prohibited or penalized plaintiffs\u2019 exercise of speech or associational rights. In adopting Resolution 58,859 and applying it to end free berths for the Sea Scouts, the city did not purport to prohibit the scouts from operating in a discriminatory manner; it simply \u201crefused to fund such activities out of the public fisc . . . .\u201d <em>(Rust v. Sullivan, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 198.) To the extent the Sea Scouts objected to compliance with Resolution 58,859, the organization (to paraphrase <em>Grove City, supra, </em>465 U.S. at p. 575) was free to terminate its participation in the free berth program and thus avoid the requirements of the nondiscrimination provision; \u201ca legislature\u2019s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right\u201d <em>(Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., supra, </em>461 U.S. at p. 549).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The Supreme Court has recognized two exceptions to its broad rule that the government\u2019s refusal to subsidize exercise of a First Amendment right does not infringe that right. Neither is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">First, a funding restriction that has as its purpose the suppression of a disfavored viewpoint\u2014especially, but not only, where the government program at issue exists to create or foster a public forum\u2014is subject to strict scrutiny. Invalidating a rule precluding federally funded legal services affiliates from challenging welfare laws, the Supreme Court explained: \u201cWhere private speech is involved, even Congress\u2019 antecedent funding decision cannot be aimed at the suppression of ideas thought inimical to the Government\u2019s own interest.\u201d <em>(Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez </em>(2001) 531 U.S. 533, 548-549 [149 L.Ed.2d 63, 121 S.Ct. 1043]; see also <em>Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 819, 832-834 [132 L.Ed.2d 700, 115 S.Ct. 2510] [exclusion of journals promoting a particular set of religious viewpoints from program of financial assistance to student newspapers infringed student group\u2019s freedom of speech]; <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Taxation With Representation of Wash., supra, </em>461 U.S. at p. 548 [refusal to subsidize lobbying would not come within the rule of permissibility \u201cif Congress were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>to discriminate invidiously in its subsidies in such a way as to \u2018 \u201cai[m] at the suppression of dangerous ideas\u201d \u2019 \u201d]; <em>Perry v. Sindermann </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 593, 595, 598 [33 L.Ed.2d 570, 92 S.Ct. 2694] [college teacher\u2019s allegation that the administration\u2019s decision not to rehire him was based on his public criticism of its policies presented \u201ca bona fide constitutional claim\u201d]; <em>Speiser v. Randall </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 513, 518 [2 L.Ed.2d 1460, 78 S.Ct. 1332] [\u201cdenial of a tax exemption for engaging in certain speech\u201d infringes freedom of speech because it is \u201c \u2018frankly aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas\u2019 \u201d].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The exception for attempted suppression of a disfavored viewpoint is inapposite to the condition imposed here. In terminating the Sea Scouts\u2019 free berths because of the group\u2019s failure fully and unambiguously to promise future nondiscrimination, Berkeley did not demand adherence to or renunciation of any idea or viewpoint. A government that requires aid recipients to conform their actions to its laws does not thereby enforce adherence to the philosophy or values behind those laws. More specifically, to state, in applying for government funding, that one will not use the funding for a discriminatory program is not necessarily to state that one agrees with the government\u2019s nondiscrimination objective. Thus Berkeley, in requiring assurances that its subsidy and property will be used without discrimination on the basis of religion or sexual orientation, does not demand adherence to the <em>viewpoint </em>that motivated the nondiscrimination provision. (See <em>Boy Scouts of America v. Wyman </em>(2d Cir. 2003) 335 F.3d 80, 94 [exclusion of BSA from state\u2019s workplace charitable contribution campaign because of its discriminatory policies was viewpoint neutral in that nondiscrimination rule\u2019s purpose was \u201cto protect persons from the . . . economic and social harms of discrimination\u201d rather than \u201cto impose a price on the expression of [BSA\u2019s] point of view\u201d]; but see <em>Boy Scouts of America, South Florida </em>v. <em>Till </em>(S.D.Fla. 2001) 136 F.Supp.2d 1295, 1308 [exclusion of local council from off-hours use of public schools because of its adherence to BSA\u2019s discriminatory policy characterized as punishment of council for its \u201cmessage\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Second, a restriction is suspect to the extent it goes beyond limiting the government funded expressive activity of the recipient and attempts further to limit expressive activities that are <em>not </em>government funded. In <em>Rust v. Sullivan, supra, </em>500 U.S. at pages 196-197, the high court explained that funding restrictions previously held to constitute unconstitutional conditions had involved \u201ca condition on the <em>recipient </em>of the subsidy rather than on a particular program or service, thus effectively prohibiting the recipient from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program,\u201d but that a recipient of family planning funds could, despite the restrictions at issue, \u201ccontinue to . . . engage in abortion advocacy . . . through programs that are separate and independent from\u201d the federally assisted project. (See also <em>FCC </em>v. <em>League of Women Voters of California </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 364, 400 [82 L.Ed.2d 278, 104 S.Ct. 3106] [invalidating rule precluding public broadcasting stations from editorializing, in part because under the rule a station that received only a small amount of its income from federal grants was \u201cbarred absolutely from all editorializing. . . . The station has no way of limiting the use of its federal funds to all noneditorializing activities, and, more importantly, it is barred from using even wholly private funds to finance its editorial activity\u201d]; Sullivan, <em>Unconstitutional Conditions </em>(1989) 102 Harv. L.Rev. 1413, 1463-1467 [discussing \u201cgermaneness\u201d as a limitation on government funding conditions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">This exception, too, is inapplicable. Berkeley, in conditioning its free berths on the Sea Scouts\u2019 agreement not to engage in invidious discrimination, did not purport to control the exercise of speech or associational rights by the Sea Scouts or individual plaintiffs <em>outside </em>the Berkeley Marina program. Even were the nondiscrimination assurance demanded by Berkeley regarded as a conditional burden on speech or association, its scope would be limited to the very program subsidized by the city. As in <em>Rust v. Sullivan, supra, </em>500 U.S. 173, and <em>Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., supra, </em>461 U.S. 540, plaintiffs here would be free to exercise their expressive or associational rights fully in any program not funded by public money. Federal high court precedent thus fails to support plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Plaintiffs also contend that by conditioning free berths on adequate assurance of nondiscrimination, Berkeley has established an unconstitutional condition under the decisions of this court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">In <em>Danskin v. San Diego Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 536 [171 P.2d 885], this court held invalid on First Amendment grounds a statutory and regulatory scheme that permitted the use of school facilities for the meetings of private groups but excluded \u201csubversive elements.\u201d We explained that while \u201c[t]he state is under no duty to make school buildings available for public meetings\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 545), having done so it could not constitutionally \u201cdemand tickets of admission in the form of convictions and affiliations that it deems acceptable\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 547). We reiterated this principle in <em>Bagley v. Washington Township Hospital Dist. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 499, 504 [55 Cal.Rptr. 401, 421 P.2d 409], explaining that \u201cthe power of government, federal or state, to withhold benefits from its citizens does not encompass a supposed \u2018lesser\u2019 power to grant such benefits upon an arbitrary deprivation of constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>right.\u201d At the same time, we emphasized that some such conditions on public benefits were justifiable; we articulated a test of justification focusing on how germane and well-tailored the condition is to the purpose of the legislation establishing the benefit and whether the utility of imposing the condition outweighs the impairment of constitutional rights. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 505-507; see also <em>Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights v. Myers </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 252, 265-266 [172 Cal.Rptr. 866, 625 P.2d 779].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">To apply these principles governing conditions on public benefits here, we need not decide whether Berkeley had adequate justification for its condition, as the condition\u2014the giving of adequate assurances of nondiscrimination\u2014 did not demand or preclude the exercise of any speech or associational right by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs repeatedly disavow, both in their complaint and in their briefs in this court, any desire to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or religion. They therefore cannot, and do not, claim that Berkeley, by requiring them to refrain from such discrimination as a condition of the free berths, is restricting their freedom to limit their membership for purposes of expressive association. (Cf. <em>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, supra, </em>530 U.S. 640; <em>Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc. </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 557 [132 L.Ed.2d 487, 115 S.Ct. 2338].) Indeed, plaintiffs, in their briefing, explain why this is a misconstruction of their claims: \u201cBerkeley suggests that Petitioners challenge the condition as \u2018forcing] inclusion\u2019 of homosexuals and atheists in their ranks. Obviously this is not so, because Petitioners do not discriminate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Berkeley\u2019s requirement that the Sea Scouts document a nondiscriminatory membership policy in order to qualify for the free berth program also did not condition receipt of a public benefit on the Sea Scouts\u2019 giving up their right to be a part of BSA. In requiring assurances of nondiscrimination, Berkeley did not in any way demand, even as a condition of the free berths, that the Sea Scouts quit BSA. To the extent compliance with the city\u2019s requirement would have that effect, it would be by the choice of a third party, BSA. Were BSA, that is, to cut its ties with a local scouting program because the program made assurances of nondiscrimination to a local government, the decision to sever the association would be BSA\u2019s, not the government\u2019s. We are aware of no authority for the extraordinary proposition that government infringes on associational rights by offering one group a financial benefit that, if accepted, could lead another group to sever its association with the recipient.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Nor, as already discussed, did Berkeley\u2019s requirement that free berth recipients have nondiscriminatory membership policies require the Sea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Scouts, as a condition of the subsidy, to adopt an antidiscrimination viewpoint or repudiate BSA\u2019s discriminatory philosophy (a philosophy the Sea Scouts, in any event, expressly state they do not share). We therefore do not agree with plaintiffs that by conditioning free berths on the Sea Scouts\u2019 statement of a local nondiscrimination policy, the city compelled them to \u201crenounce\u201d BSA\u2019s positions and to \u201cadvocate and disseminate\u201d Berkeley\u2019s own philosophy. As already explained, to condition a public benefit on assurances of nondiscrimination is not to compel advocacy of a viewpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The complaint alleges Berkeley attempted to compel the Sea Scouts to subscribe to a \u201cpledge of fealty\u201d or \u201cloyalty oath\u201d according with Berkeley\u2019s antidiscrimination values. On analysis, however, these general claims provide no valid grounds for a claim of unconstitutionality. The only <em>facts </em>alleged regarding such a coerced statement of viewpoint concern the Waterfront Commission\u2019s request for a local policy statement of nondiscrimination. The Sea Scouts, according to the complaint, provided such a statement in their letter of April 8, 1998. This satisfied the Waterfront Commission, which recommended continuation of the free berths, albeit on conditions that the letter be distributed to program participants and that the Sea Scouts initiate a dialogue with the Mount Diablo Council on obtaining a change in the national BSA policy. Had the Berkeley City Council accepted the Waterfront Commission\u2019s recommendation and imposed these conditions on continuation of the free berths, plaintiffs might with greater plausibility contend the conditions infringed their freedom of speech. But the city council <em>rejected </em>the Waterfront Commission\u2019s recommendation, instead accepting the city manager\u2019s and city attorney\u2019s recommendation that the subsidy be discontinued because the April 8 letter was an insufficient assurance of nondiscrimination. The city council\u2019s action mooted any claim that the conditions proposed by the Waterfront Commission were unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">II. <em>Plaintiffs Have Not Been Punished for Associating with BSA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Relying on <em>Healy v. James </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 169 [33 L.Ed.2d 266, 92 S.Ct. 2338], plaintiffs contend they have been subjected to a judgment of \u201c \u2018guilt by association\u2019 \u201d in that Berkeley had no reason to believe the Sea Scouts themselves \u201c \u2018pose[d] the threat [of discrimination] feared by the Government,\u2019 \u201d but rather assumed they discriminated simply because of their affiliation with BSA. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 186.) Berkeley\u2019s denial of free berths was arbitrary and unjustified by its nondiscrimination purpose because, plaintiffs contend, it \u201cpunishes innocent children, and their adult leaders, who are not engaged in the discrimination that Berkeley claims to be battling.\u201d In a related claim, they argue they were denied equal protection of the laws in that they were treated differently from other nonprofit community service organizations using the marina, solely because of their association with BSA. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The Sea Scouts are a part of BSA, an organization whose official policy excludes homosexuals and atheists from participation. That Berkeley officials were unaware of any past discrimination by the Sea Scouts does not mean none would occur in the future. To require of a group operating as part of an organization with an official policy of discrimination that it agree in advance not to discriminate in the use of the city\u2019s free marina berths is a reasonable and narrowly tailored step to implement the diversity and nondiscrimination provisions of Resolution 58,859. That other groups, which were not part of BSA, were not required to give local policy statements assuring nondiscrimination does not show unequal treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">When the city asked the Sea Scouts to document that their local policy differed from BSA\u2019s, the Sea Scouts negotiated with BSA over such a policy, but, as their attorney explained to the trial court, \u201cThey couldn\u2019t say the words \u2018We do not discriminate on the basis of sexual discrimination <em>[sic: </em>orientation],\u2019 because the Boy Scouts objected.\u201d According to the attorney, BSA told plaintiffs, \u201cYou can\u2019t say you don\u2019t discriminate based on sexual orientation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">At oral argument in this court, plaintiffs, through their attorney, expanded on these concessions. When asked by the court what plaintiffs\u2019 course of action would be if an \u201copenly and avowedly gay\u201d person sought to participate in the Sea Scouts program, counsel responded, \u201cIf the Boy Scouts forbid it, it wouldn\u2019t happen. . . . [I]f the Boy Scouts came down on us, we would have to exclude that person.\u201d Asked whether plaintiffs and BSA were \u201cone and the same\u201d with regard to potential discrimination, counsel replied, \u201cEssentially,\u201d and explained that while BSA and the Sea Scouts were \u201cdifferent organizations, ... we are bound by what the Boy Scouts tell us we have to do.\u201d We accept these concessions by plaintiffs as establishing, even as against any contrary allegation or implication of the complaint, that the Sea Scouts could not, consistent with the limitations imposed on them by BSA, truthfully state they would not in the future discriminate against openly gay or atheistic participants. (See <em>DeRose </em>v. <em>Carswell </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1018-1019 [242 Cal.Rptr. 368] [concessions of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney before trial court negate contrary allegations for purposes of demurrer]; cf. <em>Browne v. Superior Court </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 593, 599 [107 P.2d 1] [the petitioner\u2019s concessions at oral argument negate contrary allegations in the habeas corpus petition]; <em>Sacramento County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn. v. County of Sacramento </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1468, 1474, fn. 6 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 834] [admissions in the plaintiffs\u2019 appellate brief negate statements in declarations for summary judgment purposes].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Because of the restrictions enforced by BSA, the April 8, 1998, letter was ambiguous as to how the Sea Scouts would treat an avowedly gay or atheistic participant. The Sea Scouts\u2019 statement that they would obey city law implied they would not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or religion, as city law forbade such discrimination. But the subsequent statement that the Sea Scouts recruit without regard to a list of factors including race, sex, and \u201creligious preference,\u201d but <em>not </em>including sexual orientation or religion as such, implied, to the contrary, that the group would disfavor potential participants who were known to be gay or who \u201cprefer[red]\u201d <em>no </em>religion. Finally, the Sea Scouts\u2019 statement that they viewed sexual orientation as a \u201cprivate matter\u201d they do not ask participants to \u201cdivulge\u201d strongly implied that they viewed openly or avowedly gay people differently from those who kept their orientation private, and reserved the right to treat them differently, contrary to the nondiscrimination requirement of Resolution 58,859. In the April 8 letter, the Sea Scouts, in effect, reserved the right to discriminate against avowedly gay or atheistic participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><em>Healy v. James, supra, </em>408 U.S. 169, upon which plaintiffs rely, actually supports Berkeley\u2019s decision. While the high court there condemned government actions \u201cdenying rights and privileges solely because of a citizen\u2019s association with an unpopular organization\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 186), the court went on to explain that the government could legitimately demand assurances that an individual or group would not engage in the same prohibited activities as the larger organization with which the individual or group was associated <em>(id. </em>at pp. 191-194). Specifically, the high court held that a local Students for a Democratic Society chapter\u2019s \u201cequivocation\u201d regarding the use of violent and disruptive tactics could warrant denying the group official recognition. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 191.) Though there was no evidence the local group actually posed a significant threat of disruption to the college <em>(id. </em>at pp. 189-190), the court explained, \u201cthe benefits of participation in the internal life of the college community may be denied to any group that reserves the right to violate any valid campus rules with which it disagrees\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 193-194). The requirement that a student group seeking official recognition \u201caffirm in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>advance its willingness to adhere to reasonable campus law . . . does not impose an impermissible condition on the students\u2019 associational rights.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 193; see also <em>Grove City, supra, </em>465 U.S. at p. 575 [requiring \u201cAssurance of Compliance\u201d from college was a \u201creasonable and unambiguous\u201d condition of federal assistance].)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Similarly, Berkeley did not engage in overbroad or arbitrary regulation in denying a subsidy to a BSA program that refused to state an unambiguous local policy of nondiscrimination, instead pointedly reserving the right to discriminate against openly gay and atheistic participants. Denial of free berths to a program operating under a national organization with an enforced policy of discrimination, a program that was asked to and would not give an unqualified assurance of fiiture nondiscrimination, was not overbroad or unjustified as a means of enforcing Berkeley\u2019s policy limiting free berths to nonprofit community service organizations that serve the public diversely and without invidious discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">As explained earlier, a demurrer assumes the truth of the complaint\u2019s properly pleaded allegations, but not of mere contentions or assertions contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. <em>(Blank v. Kirwan, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 318; <em>Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.3d at p. 374.) Here, the noticeable and conceded facts contradict the complaint\u2019s assertions that Berkeley \u201cdecided to punish . . . [the] completely innocent\u201d plaintiffs for their association with BSA despite knowing that plaintiffs had, in the April 8, 1998, letter, \u201cagreed not to discriminate against gays or atheists.\u201d The facts, including those in the complaint, those subject to judicial notice, and those conceded by plaintiffs, show the Sea Scouts could not and did not unambiguously promise not to discriminate in the use of the marina facilities. The city council, in receipt of the city attorney\u2019s opinion discussing the April 8 letter\u2019s ambiguity and the city manager\u2019s consequent denial recommendation, denied the continued subsidy because BSA\u2019s \u201cdiscriminatory policies against gays and atheists\u201d made impossible a full and unambiguous assurance the Sea Scouts would not discriminate in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Similarly, plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the city excluded plaintiffs from the free berth program without ever determining that the Sea Scouts themselves \u201cpose[d] the threat\u201d of discrimination and without \u201cevidence that Plaintiffs or any participant in the Berkeley Sea Scouts program was going to unlawfully discriminate against anyone,\u201d is contradicted by their own concessions and the noticeable facts. The city asked for full assurances that the program posed no threat of future discrimination, but it did not receive them. In light of BSA\u2019s policies, which, as counsel conceded in this court, plaintiffs would have to follow, Berkeley reasonably concluded that the Sea Scouts\u2019 representations were inadequate to assure future compliance with the city\u2019s nondiscrimination rules. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Berkeley simply \u201crefuses to take ... yes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>for an answer\u201d is belied by the record, which establishes that the Sea Scouts, because of BSA\u2019s enforced policies, could not and did not respond to the city with a simple \u201cyes,\u201d but rather with an evasive \u201cmaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Plaintiffs rely in part on allegations that individual members of the Berkeley City Council and other city officials expressed the intent to punish BSA or the Sea Scouts for BSA\u2019s policies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under some circumstances, where the decision maker\u2019s reason or object is itself a contested element of a claim of unconstitutionality, \u201cstatements made by members of the decision-making body\u201d are properly considered, together with other types of evidence, in determining the object of the official action. <em>(Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hialeah </em>(1993) 508 U.S. 520, 540 [124 L.Ed.2d 472, 113 S.Ct. 2217]; see also <em>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp. </em>(1977) 429 U.S. 252, 267-268 [50 L.Ed.2d 450. 97 S.Ct. 555].) But here there is no dispute the basis for the city council\u2019s action was, as the council minutes stated, BSA\u2019s \u201cdiscriminatory policies against gays and atheists,\u201d which\u2014as the record shows and plaintiffs\u2019 attorney conceded in this court\u2014made it impossible for the Sea Scouts to give a complete and unambiguous guarantee against future discrimination. In light of that undisputed legislative object, allegations suggesting merely that individual council members voted for the action because of their personal hostility to BSA\u2019s views do not state a claim for a constitutional violation, for such individual motives do not alter the undisputed grounds upon which the council, as a body, acted. (See <em>Graham v.

Denial of a continued subsidy on this ground did not infringe plaintiffs\u2019 associational, speech, or equal protection rights.
