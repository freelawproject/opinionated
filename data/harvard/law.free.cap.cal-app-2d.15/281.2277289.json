(2d) 541 [51 Pac. (2d) 81].)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">Therefore, since the trial court had jurisdiction to make and enter its order, the writ of prohibition must be denied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The rule is well settled that the sole province of a writ of prohibition is to arrest proceedings of a tribunal or persons exercising judicial functions, when without or in excess of jurisdiction. <em>(County of Sutter </em>v. <em>Superior Court of California, </em>188 Cal. 292, 295 [204 Pac. 849].)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The application for a writ of prohibition is denied and the alternative writ is vacated and quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">An application by petitioner to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on August 27, 1936.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
