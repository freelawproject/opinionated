The trial court, by sustaining a demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend, concluded that the section should- be given a retroactive application. This is contrary to the decision in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ferdon, </em>5 Cal. (2d) 226 [54 Pac. (2d) 712], in which it was held that the section could not be retroactively applied without doing violence to the \u201ccontract clause\u201d of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Upon the authority of the decision in the cited ease, the judgment herein is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">York, Acting P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
