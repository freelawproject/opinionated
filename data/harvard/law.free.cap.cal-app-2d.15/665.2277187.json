The well-recognized procedure, where a right to recover salary is asserted and denied by respondents, is by ordinary suit at law for the salary. <em>(Butler </em>v. <em>City of Plainfield, </em>5 N. J. Misc. 170 [135 Atl. 669]; <em>Police Commissioner for the City of Boston </em>v. <em>City of Boston, </em>279 Mass. 577 [181 N. E. 790].) It is well settled that <em>mandamus </em>may not be invoked where there is a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. (Sec. 1086, Code Civ. Proc.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">Therefore, since petitioners could have filed suit in the municipal court to recover the amount of salary alleged to be due them, they had a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law. This is equally convenient, beneficial and effective as a proceeding by <em>mandamus, </em>which therefore is not available to them. <em>(Black </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica, </em>13 Cal. App. (2d) 4 [56 Pac. (2d) 256]; <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>63 Cal. App. 745, 746 [219 Pac. 1047].)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">Por the foregoing reasons the judgment is reversed, with directions to \u25a0 the trial court to enter judgment denying the petition for a writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">Grail, P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">A petition by respondents to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on September 21, 1936.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
