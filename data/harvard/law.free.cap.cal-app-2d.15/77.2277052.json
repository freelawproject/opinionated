I have been having a hard time to get along and needed the money which they promised me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\u201cI never employed Mr. Pollard to act as my attorney in this suit; I never paid him anything or promised to pay him anything, and he told me the Citizens\u2019 Betterment League was going to pay for it; I was taken up to Mr. Pollard\u2019s office by Mr. Malloy and signed some papers in the suit which had already been prepared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">\u201cI realize now that I made a mistake in allowing the Funeral Directors who were interested in the bringing of this suit to use my name; I am not going to appear in Court or testify in the suit and I intend to pay them back the money which they paid me; I do not want to go on with this suit and want it dismissed; and I have signed instructions for the suit to be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u201cI am signing this affidavit voluntarily in order to correct an injustice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-3\">\u201cElla Summers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Subscribed and sworn to before me this 2nd day of \u2022 October, 1934.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\u201c(Seal) L. Thurston Harshman</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\n<em>\u201cNotary Public in and for the County of Los Angeles, State of California</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">\u201cMy Commission expires May 27, 1938\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">In addition the advertisement included the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">\u201cIn Explanation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">\u201cThis affidavit made by Mrs. Ella Summers was filed November 1 in the Superior Court in connection with the suit brought in her name which sought to enjoin the operation of an undertaking establishment in Forest Lawn Memorial Park. As Stated in her affidavit, Mrs. Summers has signed instructions that the suit be dismissed. This document, we believe, fully explains certain mysterious attacks against Forest Lawn Memorial Park.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">\u201cThe Citizens\u2019 Betterment League referred to in the affidavit is an organization made up of funeral directors, casket manufacturers and allied commercial interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-12\">\u201cThis affidavit is printed here in full so that you\u2014the lot owners and friends of Forest Lawn\u2014may know the facts of the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-13\">\u201cForest Lawn Memorial Park Association, Inc.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-14\">1 <em>\u2018 </em>Glendale\u2014California. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">By way of innuendo it was alleged that the defendants intended to convey the meaning that plaintiff, an attorney at law, had been guilty of the following acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-16\">1. Filed a complaint for a client although he had not been requested so to do;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-17\">2. Misrepresented to Ella Summers the nature and kind of action which was brought on her <em>behalf;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-18\">3. Took advantage of Ella Summers in an unscrupulous manner, knowing that she did not realize what she was doing when she filed the complaint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-19\">4. Promised Ella Summers that appellants would pay all expenses of the suit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-20\">5. Entered into a conspiracy with certain individuals to attack Forest Lawn by some unfair and underhanded means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The two questions presented for our determination are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">\n<em>First: Considering the publication as a whole, was it fairly susceptible of the interpretation placed thereon by the innuendoes alleged by plaintiff ?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\n<em>Second: Was it error to sustain the demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">As to the first question it is the duty of the trial court to determine whether the language used in the alleged libelous publication is capable of the defamatory meaning claimed for it by the plaintiff (16 Cal. Jur. 121; <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Fairweather, </em>63 Cal. App. 194, 196 [218 Pac. 477] <em>; Mellen </em>v. <em>Times-Mirror Co., </em>167 Cal. 587, 593 [140 Pac. 277, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 766]) and the innuendo cannot ascribe a meaning to the defamatory matter other or broader than the words themselves naturally bear. It cannot add to nor enlarge nor change the sense of the published words. <em>(Grand </em>v. <em>Dreyfus, </em>122 Cal. 58, 61 [54 Pac. 389]; <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>213 Cal. 438, 442 [2 Pac. (2d) 383] ; <em>Pyper </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>47 Cal. App. 623, 635 [191 Pac. 565].)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Reading the published advertisement as a whole, the only interpretation of which it is fairly susceptible is \u201cthat Mr. Malloy, a funeral director and friend of Mrs. Summers, asked her to permit a suit to be brought in her name on behalf of some funeral directors to prevent the operation of a mortuary in Forest Lawn. She was paid money by Mr. Malloy and Mr. Wood, and was recently promised additional money by Mr. Wood, and she permitted her name to be used because of these payments and the promise of additional payments by Mr. Wood, who was to get it back from the Citizens Betterment League. Mr. Malloy, Mr. Wood, Mr. Pollard and Mr. Kurland told her that the funeral directors wanted to put the mortuary out of business, and promised her that she would probably not have to testify in court, and that the Citizens\u2019 Betterment League would pay for the suit. She was taken to Mr. Pollard\u2019s office by Mr. Malloy and signed papers in the suit which had already been prepared. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">In view of the only reasonable interpretation which can be placed upon the publication, it is readily seen that it does not support the libelous innuendoes alleged by plaintiff, and the trial court properly sustained the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>As to the second question, plaintiff cannot complain of the trial court\u2019s failure to grant leave to amend at the time the demurrer was sustained, for the reason that the record discloses that plaintiff did not request leave to amend at that time. <em>(Duvall </em>v. <em>White, </em>46 Cal. App. 305, 307 [189 Pac. 324].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">At a subsequent period plaintiff did request leave of the court to file an amended complaint, which request was denied. This ruling was correct, as the allegations in the proposed amended complaint were substantially the same as those in the original complaint and it was vulnerable to a general demurrer on the ground that it did not state a cause of action for the reason set forth above. <em>(Stewart </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>148 Cal. 511, 512 [83 Pac. 699].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Crail, P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">A petition by appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on August 24, 1936.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
