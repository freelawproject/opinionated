In response, the government filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that we lack jurisdiction to review Del Pilar\u2019s petition, because (1) there is no final order of removal; and (2) Del Pilar falls within the class of criminal aliens for which 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) explicitly prohibits judicial review of removal orders. As we agree that we do not have jurisdiction, we dismiss Del Pilar\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">Del Pilar, a native and citizen of the Philippines, was admitted to the United States as an immigrant in January of 1977. On April 24, 1992, he pled guilty to three counts of taking indecent liberties with children in violation of section 14-202.1 of the North Carolina Statutes and was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. Based upon Del Pilar\u2019s criminal convictions, on February 15, 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) commenced removal proceedings against him, charging him with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Although the IJ found Del Pilar removable as charged, he granted Del Pilar\u2019s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The INS appealed, however, and the BIA reversed the IJ\u2019s grant of the waiver and remanded the case for the sole purpose of allowing Del Pilar to designate a country of removal. Thereafter, Del Pilar filed a petition with this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s decision. In response, the government filed a motion to dismiss Del Pilar\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">As the removal proceedings against Del Pilar were commenced after April 1, 1997, the date the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) became effective, we apply \u201cthe permanent provisions of [the] INA as amended by IIRIRA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\u201d to this case. <em>Oguejiofor v. Attorney Gen., </em>277 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). \u201c[Section] 1252(a)(1) ... vest[s] the courts of appeals with the authority to consider petitions challenging final orders commanding the removal of aliens from the United States.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002); see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Yet, \u201c[our] review of all questions of law and fact ... arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter\u201d is limited to \u201cjudicial review of <em>a final order.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>1252(b)(9) (emphasis added). An order of deportation becomes \u201cfinal\u201d upon a determination by the BIA or the expiration of the time within which an alien may seek review from the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(47)(B)(i)-(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-10\">Here, the BIA\u2019s order reversing the IJ\u2019s decision to grant Del Pilar section 212(c) relief amounted to an order that Del Pilar be removed. Although this Court has no binding authority addressing whether the BIA\u2019s remand for the limited purpose of permitting Del Pilar to designate a country of removal rendered the removal order nonfinal, two of our sister circuits provide some guidance. <em>See Castrejon-Garcia v. INS, </em>60 F.3d 1359, 1361-62 (9th Cir.1995) (finding that a BIA order reversing an IJ\u2019s grant of suspension of deportation and remanding the case \u201cfor a determination of voluntary departure in lieu of deportation\u201d was a final order of deportation under former INA section 106a(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) as nothing was pending before the BIA and \u201cthe petitioner had no reason or basis for appealing the [IJ\u2019s] decision in his favor\u201d); <em>Perkovic v. INS, </em>33 F.3d 615, 618-19 (6th Cir.1994) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>(finding that a BIA order reversing an IJ\u2019s grant of asylum and remanding the case was a final order of deportation under \u00a7 1105a(a) and noting that it was not \u201caware of [any] authority for the proposition that a [BIA] order rejecting an asylum application is not a final order unless a formal order of deportation has already been issued\u201d). As all of the issues presented to us were subject to a final order by the BIA and there is nothing remaining for Del Pilar to appeal as the only thing left for the IJ to determine is the country to which Del Pilar will be removed, we find that the BIA\u2019s order constitutes a final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">Although the BIA\u2019s order is a final order of removal under \u00a7 1252(a)(1), our review of Del Pilar\u2019s petition is severely limited under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). <em>Brooks, </em>283 F.3d at 1272. Indeed, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) precludes us from exercising \u201cjurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed\u201d certain enumerated criminal offenses, including those covered in \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Therefore, our review of Del Pilar\u2019s petition is limited to \u201cwhether [he] is (1) an alien (2) who is removable (3) based on a conviction for an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Bahar v. Ashcroft, </em>264 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">Here, it is uncontested that Del Pilar is an alien. Moreover, he is removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) as an \u201calien who [wa]s convicted of an aggravated felony.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) (defining the phrase \u201caggravated felony\u201d as including the \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, we are precluded from reviewing the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-11\">Accordingly, we do not have jurisdiction to review Del Pilar\u2019s petition. Thus, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss is hereby GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">. In <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), the Supreme Court held that, although it was repealed in 1996, section 212(c) discretionary relief is available to aliens \"whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d As Del Pilar pled guilty in February of 1992, he was eligible to apply for section 212(c) relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1191-8\">.
