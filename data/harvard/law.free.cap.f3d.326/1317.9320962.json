After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-25\">Fair pled guilty to one count of possessing a firearm while being a convicted felon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e). After filing an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion, Fair sought to correct alleged deficiencies in his sentence via 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied Fair\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and Fair appealed. The merits of Fair\u2019s underlying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion are the subject of a separate appeal, number 03-11211, which remains pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">After filing his notice of appeal as to his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Fair filed another motion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) that merely reiterated his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) claims. The district court denied the Rule 60(b)(4) motion and Fair again appealed. The only issue in this appeal is the denial of Fair\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">Although there are considerable deficiencies in Fair\u2019s arguments on the merits, we need not discuss them because Rule 60(b)(4) is a civil motion that is not available to an individual challenging his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">Unlike forms of post-conviction relief which have been deemed civil in nature, <em>see, e.g., Fisher v. Baker, </em>203 U.S. 174, 181, 27 S.Ct. 135, 51 L.Ed. 142 (1906) (habeas corpus proceedings), every circuit court which has addressed \u00a7 3582(c)(2) has determined that it is criminal in nature and therefore covered by rules applying to criminal cases, not civil cases. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Espinosa-Talamantes, </em>319 F.3d 1245, 1246-47 (10th Cir.2003) (concluding civil Rule 4(a)(1)(B) for time to appeal does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2)); <em>United States v. Arrango, </em>291 F.3d 170, 171-72 (2d Cir.2002) (same); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (same); <em>United States v. Petty, </em>82 F.3d 809, 810 (8th Cir.1996) (same); <em>United States v. Ono, </em>72 F.3d 101, 102-03 (9th Cir.1995) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">These circuit courts have all held that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a civil post-conviction action, but rather a continuation of a criminal case. The courts based their decisions on the fact that \u00a7 3582 \u201cgoverns the imposition and subsequent modification of a sentence of imprisonment, and it refers to the statutes and rules governing the imposition of sentences.\u201d <em>Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d at 310 (internal quotations and citation omitted). We agree with our sister circuits\u2019 reasoning and adopt it as our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-9\">In <em>United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365 (11th Cir.1998), we addressed the applicability of Rule 60(b) in the context of a criminal case. In <em>Mosavi, </em>the appellant sought to set aside a criminal forfeiture imposed as part of his criminal sentence via a Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1365. This Court stated, however, that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cunambiguously\u201d limited their application to <em>civil </em>cases. <em>Id. </em>at 1366. Consequently, we held that the appropriate vehicle for challenging the forfeiture was Mosavi\u2019s direct criminal appeal of his conviction and sentence and that \u201cRule 60(b) simply does not provide for relief from judgment in a criminal case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">Because \u00a7 3582 is likewise criminal in nature, Fair cannot use Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) to attack any alleged deficiencies in the district court\u2019s underlying order denying Fair\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Consequently, the district court correctly denied Fair\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">. Section 3582(c)(2) allows for the modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence based on subsequent changes in the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
