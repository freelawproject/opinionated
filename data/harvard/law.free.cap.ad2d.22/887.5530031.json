Appeal from order of June 24, 1964 dismissed; that order was superseded by the order of October 13, 1964, granting reargument. Order of October 13, 1964, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. We are of the opinion that, in view of the changed circumstances and in the interests of justice, the Justice at the Pretrial Term of the court was warranted in granting the preference in trial. He was not precluded from doing so because of the prior order, since that order was not predicated on the same state of facts. Moreover that order, while it denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preference on the facts then presented, was expressly made \u201c without prejudice to renewal of the motion \u201d (see 20 A D 2d 806).
