The presiding judge at the trial refused to rule, as requested by the defendant, that, as it did not appear that the grantor of the plaintiff\u2019s wife had any right in or to such way at the time he gave the deed to her, the evidence was not sufficient to justify a finding that the plaintiff had any right of way in such way. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant showed no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b282-10\">Field, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFR\">This \u2022 is an action of tort for changing the grade of a way opposite the land occupied by the plaintiff, and thus making the way less convenient for his use. The defendant, who showed no right to do this, after a verdict was returned for the plaintiff, alleged exceptions to the refusal of the court to rule as requested by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">The plaintiff acquired title under the will of his wife, Mary Shapine, and she acquired title from Andrew W. Hammond,. by a warranty deed dated March 6, 1877. The lot conveyed to her was bounded on the north by \u201ca street called Broadway,\u201d and on the west \u201c by a private way,\u201d \u201c and by said deed Mary Shapine was given a right of way in said way,\u201d etc. Mary Shapine entered into possession under the deed, immediately after it was executed, and she and her husband have occupied the land conveyed, and have used the way, in common with others, ever since. We assume that the grant to Mary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Shapine of the land and of the right of way was to her and her heirs and assigns. The defendant owned the lot next south of the plaintiff\u2019s lot in the rear, and has lived on it for thirty-three years, and a deed to him from Edward A. Hammond, a son of Andrew W. Hammond, dated April 23, 1858, was put in evidence, \u201c bounding the defendant on his westerly side by said private way.\u201d The defendant having no other way \u201cto get out from his premises excepting by said private way, though his deed gave him no specific right therein,\u201d has \u201c used the same in connection with others who had a right to use it uninterruptedly for said thirty-three years.\u201d \u201c The defendant never enjoyed or claimed the exclusive use of said private way, but always used it in common with others who had a right to use it.\u201d A deed was also put in evidence from one Brickett to one Tremblay, dated July 29, 1886, of the lot of land on the westerly side of this private way, \u201c directly opposite the house of the defendant,\u201d in which the premises were described as \u201c beginning at the northeasterly corner thereof by a private way, . . . and thence by said private way,\u201d etc. All these deeds, apparently, were admitted in evidence without objection. Copies of the deeds put in evidence are not annexed to the exceptions, which contain only a general statement of the lots of land conveyed by the deeds, as above set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The defendant asked the court \u201cto rule that the evidence was not sufficient to justify a finding that the plaintiff had any right of way in said way, as it did not appear that the grantor of Mrs. Shapine, viz. Andrew W. Hammond, had any right in or to said way, at the time he deeded to Mrs. Shapine.\u201d The court refused to give this ruling; and the defendant excepted; and this is the only exception in the case. The contents of the deed accepted by the defendant, and his use of the way, were some evidence against him that there was in fact a private way to Broadway, such as the plaintiff described in his declaration, which persons other than himself had a right to use in common with him. The actual use of this way by the plaintiff\u2019s wife and by the plaintiff in connection with their occupation of their land, in accordance with the grant contained in the warranty deed of Andrew W. Hammond, was some evidence that the plaintiff had the right of way which he claimed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b284-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>B. F.
