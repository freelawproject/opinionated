Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 9, cl. 4, by referring the jury to the Pub. Sts. C. 207, \u00a7 25, providing for the punishment of persons \u201c found in a state of intoxication,\u201d but instructed them that to convict the defendant they must find that such persons were \u201c intoxicated,\u201d the degree of intoxication being immaterial. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-11\">Complaint for keeping and maintaining a common nuisance, to wit, a certain tenement in New Bedford, used for the illegal keeping and illegal sale of intoxicating liquors, from July 1, 1888, to April 12, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-12\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Brigham, C. J., it appeared that the defendant had a license as a common victualler, and that he also had a license of the first class to sell intoxicating liquors in the tenement in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-13\">There was evidence that persons had been frequently seen in the tenement, and also on the street near it, who were habitual drunkards, drunk, or more or less intoxicated, and under the influence of intoxicating liquor; and that the defendant had been seen to sell to persons in the tenement who were drunk, or under the influence of liquor, and in different stages of intoxication. The defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that he had never made any sale to any person drunk, or to an intoxicated person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-14\">The defendant requested the judge to rule and instruct the jury, \u201cthat the Words <em>\u2018to </em>an intoxicated person\u2019 in clause 4, section 9, chapter 100, Public Statutes, means a person who is so far intoxicated as to be in that condition which constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the crime of drunkenness punishable under the laws; that a sale to a person under the influence of intoxicating liquor would not be illegal, unless the person to whom it was sold is shown to have been so far under the influence thereof at the time of the sale as to constitute the crime of drunkenness.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">The judge refused to give these instructions, or so to rule, but instructed the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">\u201c There would have been a violation of the defendant\u2019s license, if, during the period and on the premises to which his license applied, and during the time alleged in the complaint, it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant sold intoxicating liquors to a person known by the defendant to be an habitual drunkard, or to a person who was intoxicated in any degree, or to a person who was known to the defendant to have been intoxicated within the six months next preceding such sale ; and the proof of sales to a person or persons of either of these classes would cause defendant\u2019s license to be void, and would support this complaint and warrant a conviction upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">\u201c In determining whether there were such violations of his license by defendant, the frequent presence, during the time alleged in the complaint, of drunken persons in or about or near the defendant\u2019s licensed premises would be evidence of circumstances which the jury would have a right to consider in connection with all the other proved circumstances of the case, giving to each of them such reasonable explanations as they admit of, upon the question whether such drunken persons obtained the liquors which caused their drunkenness from the defendant, whereby they were made more or less intoxicated, or when they were known by defendant to be habitual drunkards, or when defendant knew that they were persons who had been intoxicated within the six months next preceding the time of their obtaining intoxicating liquors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-8\">\u201c Defendant\u2019s license would not be violated by one or more sales of intoxicating liquor to a person to whom intoxicating liquor could be lawfully sold under a license, who was in no degree intoxicated at the times of such sales, notwithstanding such sales caused the intoxication of the person to whom they were made; but after that intoxication of that person had in any degree taken effect, the defendant could not continue to sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>intoxicating liquor to that person without a violation of the conditions of defendant\u2019s license.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-6\"><em>J. </em>Brown, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-7\"><em>H. 0. Bliss, </em>First Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-8\">Knowlton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azl\">The only exceptions argued by the defendant relate to the instructions and the refusals to instruct in regard to the meaning of the words \u201c an intoxicated person,\u201d in the Pub. Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 9, cl. 4. The presiding justice was asked to define the words by referring the jury to similar language in the Pub. Sts. c. 207, \u00a7 25, which provide for the punishment of persons \u201c found in a state of intoxication.\u201d Assuming that both these statutes relate to persons in identically the same condition, the jury could not properly have been aided in interpreting the former by a reference to the latter, which equally needed interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">It is objected that the instructions given were erroneous, because they recognized the possibility of different degrees of intoxication. But there was testimony that the defendant was seen to sell to persons \u201cin different stages of intoxication\u201d; and we suppose it can hardly be doubted that a person, after having become intoxicated, may, by continuing drinking, pass through different stages, and be in different degrees of intoxication. If the jury had been permitted to find the defendant guilty for. selling to those who were partially intoxicated, or were under the influence of liquor to any degree less than intoxication, the instructions would have been erroneous. But, in order to convict, they were required to find that the persons referred to were \u201cintoxicated,\u201d and they were told in substance that it was immaterial what was the degree of their intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The presiding justice apparently deemed \u201cintoxicated\u201d a familiar word, the meaning of which was well understood by the jury. In the absence of a request for a proper definition of it, there was no error in the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">\n<em>jExceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
