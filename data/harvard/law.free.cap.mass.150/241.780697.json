Allen, an hydraulic engineer and the city engineer of the defendant city, who was admitted to have had a large experience in the construction of sewers and waterworks, was asked the following question: \u201c Suppose a cellar is dug where the shop of the plaintiff is, and of the depth described; suppose the premises to be constructed as plaintiff testifies to, is it proper construction to leave an open sewer pipe at the cellar end, as was done in this case ? \u201d The witness was permitted to answer the question, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, and replied, \u201cNo, sir, I do not consider it proper \u201d; and the plaintiff excepted. The judge thereupon directed the jury to answer specially whether the plaintiff was negligent in leaving open the end of the drain pipe in the cellar at grade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">The jury answered the question in the affirmative, and returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-7\"><em>W. B. Harding, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-8\"><em>F. P.

The witness was admitted to be an expert of large experience in the construction of sewers and water<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>works, and he must be presumed to' have known whether gates, flaps, or other appliances could be used to prevent the influx of water from a drain into a cellar, and if they could, whether they would work satisfactorily, and whether it would be easy or difficult to put them in. His study and experience may be presumed to have also taught him the probability or improbability that, from sewers constructed as those in that neighborhood were, water would set back into house drains during a flood.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">We are of opinion that these are not matters of common knowledge, and that the opinion of an intelligent expert may have been valuable at the trial upon the question what precautions were reasonably necessary on the part of the plaintiff to prevent a flow of water from the drain into his cellar. <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>McOwen, </em>103 Mass. 587. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Choate, </em>105 Mass. 451. <em>Kershaw </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>115 Mass. 361. <em>Hand </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>126 Mass. 324. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
