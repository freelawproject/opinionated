In 1877 the town voted to accept the works for fire purposes, upon the report of a committee that a satisfactory trial of the hydrants as located by them had been had, and that, upon certain changes being made, it would have a very good fire service. The company proceeded to furnish a supply of water, increasing by various changes the efficiency of its works, and the town used it until 1887, paying full rentals, except as otherwise adjusted between them in one or two instances, until 1885, after which it refused to make further payments. At no time could the hydrants simultaneously throw eight streams of water over the highest building in either village, and whether a \u201c full and ample supply <em>\u201d </em>had been furnished was in dispute. <em>Held, </em>in an action by the company against the town to recover for the arrears of rentals, that, while the guaranty was in the nature of a continuing condition precedent, the performance of which was necessary to enable the plaintiff to recover, it must be treated as having become in effect an independent agreement, for the breach of which the town might recoup damages suffered by it in its corporate capacity, and the measure of which would be the difference between the value of the supply actually furnished' and that called for by the contract, estimated with reference to the uses for which it was furnished.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b446-10\">At the trial there was evidence that the company, while furnishing water to the town, sought new sources of supply, but soon abandoned them, and the defendant contended that these acts were an admission by the company and by its then president, who was the nominal plaintiff, of the insufficiency of the supply, both as to quantity and quality, then being furnished to the town under the contract ; whereupon the plaintiff offered in evidence the records of votes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>company reciting that the object of its acts was only to improve the quality of the water. <em>Held, </em>that it could not be said that the records were not properly admitted to show the purpose for which the acts were done.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">Contract brought by the surviving partner of a firm composed of Robert Wiley and Solon L. Wiley, doing business under the name of the Athol Aqueduct Company, to recover the rental of certain hydrants furnished by the firm to the defendant town. Writ dated December 21, 1887. Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Staples, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">On June 5, 1876, the Wileys, then copartners in business under the name of the Athol Aqueduct Company, and the defendant town, by its board of selectmen, executed an agreement in writing, which, after reciting that the firm was formed for the purpose of supplying the town with pure water for domestic and other purposes, and that the town was desirous of making a contract according to law for such a supply, contained, among other things, the following provisions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">\u201c Now the said Robert Wiley and S. L. Wiley, copartners aforesaid under the name of said Athol Aqueduct Company, covenant and agree to and with the inhabitants of said town to furnish and supply pure water to its inhabitants for the purpose of extinguishing fires; and they covenant and agree to and with said inhabitants, that they will furnish suitable hydrants, not' less than fifty in number, twelve of which are to be double and thirty-eight single, all of which are to be located in accordance with a plan . . . upon which the location of the several hydrants are designated, and the several points thereon designated are to be points at which said hydrants are to be located, unless some other places are mutually agreed upon between said company and the committee of said town intrusted with their said location.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\">\u201c And the said aqueduct company covenant and agree to and with said inhabitants, that they will furnish said town at all times with a full and ample supply of water from said hydrants, and from each and all of them, for the purpose of extinguishing fires, and will furnish the same at the rate of fifty dollars ($50) per hydrant, for each and every year, for the term of twenty-five years, and said company guarantee a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>supply of water to run eight hydrants at the same time, and throw full streams of water over the highest building in either village in said town, during said term. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\">\u201c And the said aqueduct company . . . are to be relieved and free from any expense in the care or repairs of said hydrants after the same are put in suitable working condition, and transferred to said town. . . .

On July 7, 1877, another meeting was held, at which a report of a committee, chosen on March 6, 1876, to investigate the subject of a water supply for the town and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>act for it with reference to contracting for the same, was presented, which report, after referring to the above contract with the Wileys, recited that \u201c the committee have located for use of the town fifty hydrants, twelve of which are double and thirty-eight single, nearly all of the same being located at points designated on a plan exhibited at the town meeting at above mentioned date, . . . also that they have recently witnessed a trial of said hydrants, with hose attached, nearly all of them proving satisfactory,\u201d that, upon a single change agreed to by the Wileys being made, \u201c together with some other changes which the committee may deem desirable, they think the town will have a very good fire service\u201d over certain territory described, and that \u201ctherefore your committee would recommend that the town by vote accept the said hydrants, under the terms of the before mentioned contract.\u201d It was thereupon voted \u201c that the town accept the waterworks, so far as relates to their use by the town for fire purposes, in accordance with report of the water committee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">The Athol Water Company was incorporated by the St. of 1877, c. 121, and was duly organized in that year, being authorized to take and hold among other streams the waters of Wellington Brook and Cut-Throat Brook. The plaintiff was the president of this corporation, and owned a controlling interest in its capital stock. This corporation purchased all the property of the above firm, and succeeded to all the rights and obligations of the firm under the contract with the town. This action is brought in the name of the surviving partner of the firm, for the benefit of the corporation. It was agreed that it was correctly brought as to parties. There was evidence tending to show that various changes had taken place in the waterworks since they were accepted by the town, improving the efficiency of the works over and above what they originally were; and that the rental for the hydrants had been paid until January 1,1885, at which time the town refused to make further payments, the semiannual payment made by it on January 1,1884, being reduced to one thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">The action was brought to recover for the semiannual instalments' accruing after that date, but it was agreed at the trial that the instalment of July 1, 1885, had been adjusted, and the claim was to recover for the service from July 1,1885, to July 1,1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The plaintiff offered evidence tending to show that during the time alleged he furnished the defendant town at all times with a full and ample supply of pure water from the hydrants referred to in the contract, and from each and all of them, for the extinguishing fires, in accordance with the interpretation of the contract adopted by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-5\">The defendant offered evidence tending to show that the supply of water so furnished was not, during some or all the time covered by the claim, full and ample in quantity, nor pure in quality, for the purpose aforesaid, and according to the construction of the contract adopted at the trial. There was also evidence tending to show that the hydrants could not, at any time during the period covered by the claim, comply with the provision as to throwing eight streams of water at the same time over the highest building in either village.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\">There was evidence that, in 1882 or 1883, the corporation laid about one and a half miles of main pipe towards Cut-Throat Brook, but afterwards abandoned the project and took up the pipe, and in 1884 \u2014 having obtained authority by the St. of 1884, c. 189, to take water from Silver Lake for an additional supply \u2014 erected a pumping station near the lake and connected it with its aqueduct, but afterwards abandoned it. The plaintiff offered in evidence, against the defendant\u2019s objection, the records of the stockholders\u2019 meetings, to show by the votes there passed that the object of laying the pipe towards Cut-Throat Brook and of taking the water of Silver Lake was to improve the quality, and not to increase the quantity, of water. The judge inquired of the defendant\u2019s counsel whether the defendant would contend that the acts of the corporation in laying the pipe, and obtaining such legislation, and taking water from Silver Lake, were evidence of an admission and a recognition by the corporation of the insufficiency of the supply as to quantity then being furnished to Athol, under the contract. The counsel replied, that reliance would be had on those acts as evidence that the plaintiff Wiley, the president, and the corporation recognized that the supply was deficient both in quality and quantity; and the judge thereupon admitted the votes in evidence to meet such argument, which recited in substance that the object of said acts was to improve the quality of the water; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The judge refused to instruct the jury, as requested by the defendant, that, \u201c In order to recover, the plaintiff must prove that the water he has furnished during the time covered by the suit has been at all times of a degree of purity suitable for domestic and other uses,\u201d but gave other instructions to the jury on that subject, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\">The defendant also requested the judge to instruct the jury as follows: \u201c In order to recover, the plaintiff must prove, as a condition precedent, that during all the said time he has furnished such a force and quantity of water at each and every hydrant, that, with the length of hose which it might ordinarily be necessary to use to extinguish fires, and with the size of nozzle ordinarily used with such systems, any eight of said hydrants would supply eight full streams of water at the same time, and throw such full streams of water with as much force as would be required to throw over the highest building in either village, unless the plaintiff was temporarily prevented from so doing by accident, and supplied the defect caused by such accident with reasonable promptitude and diligence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\">The judge declined to give this instruction, but instructed the jury,- in substance, that the contract contemplated a full and ample supply at all times from each and every hydrant, the water being used in a proper manner and with proper appliances, for the extinguishment of such fires as might reasonably be expected to occur in the town; that the so called \u201c guaranty \u201d as to what any eight hydrants should be able to do, on a proper construction of the contract itself, and on the evidence as to the practical construction put upon it by the parties themselves, was an independent stipulation, the performance of which it was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove as a condition precedent to recovery; that evidence as to what eight hydrants run together at the same time could or could not accomplish, was admitted only as bearing on the question of what was \u201c a full and ample supply \u201d under the contract; and that, if it was shown that the contract in that particular had not been complied with, the defendant would have a right to recoup any damages suffered by it as a corporation, by such failure by the plaintiff , to perform that stipulation; but that damage to individual property by reason of such failure was not to be taken into account: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>also that the town must avail itself of the breach of the so called guaranty, and of other independent stipulations in the contract to be performed by the plaintiff, in reduction of the damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUn\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-6\"><em>P.

The most important exception is to the refusal of the court to rule that the plaintiff, in order to recover, must prove, as a condition precedent, that during all the time covered by the declaration a sufficient supply of water had been furnished \u201c to run eight hydrants at the same time, and throw full streams of water over the highest building in either village in said town,\u201d and to the instructions given upon this part of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The presiding justice, apparently, was of opinion that the covenant to \u201cfurnish said town at all times with a full and ample supply of water from said hydrants, and from each and all of them, for the purpose of extinguishing fires,\u201d was the principal covenant, and that the guaranty of a sufficient supply \u201c to run eight hydrants at the same time, and to throw full streams of water over the highest building in either village in said town,\u201d was an independent collateral stipulation, and that if the principal covenant or the guaranty had not been fully performed, this would not defeat the action, but the defendant could recoup any damages which it had suffered as a corporation by reason of the defective performance. The ruling that the guaranty was an independent stipulation was made \u201c on a proper construction of the contract itself, and on the evidence as to the practical construction put upon it by the parties themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">The evidence was that the contract was executed on June 5, 1876, the selectmen executing it in behalf of the town, and was ratified by the town at a town meeting held on June 13, 1876. Subsequently, at a town meeting held on July 7, 1877, the committee of the town on water supply made a report, and the town then voted to \u201c accept the waterworks, so far as relates to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>use by the town for fire .purposes, in accordance with report of water committee,\u201d etc. This report stated that \u201c the committee have located for use of the town fifty hydrants, twelve of which are double and thirty-eight single; . . . that they have recently witnessed a trial of said hydrants, with hose attached, nearly all of them proving satisfactory,\u201d and think that, by making certain changes which had been agreed upon, and \u201c some other changes which the committee may deem desirable, . . . the town will have a very good fire service \u201d over that part of its territory which is described in the report. The committee recommend \u201cthat the town by vote accept the said hydrants, under the terms of the before mentioned contract.\u201d There was evidence that certain changes had taken place in the works since the vote of July 7, 1877, which to an extent greater or less improved \u201c the efficiency of the works over and above what they originally were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The Athol Water Company was incorporated under the St. of 1877, c. 121, and it had purchased all the property of the partnership called the Athol Aqueduct Company, and \u201csucceeded to all the rights and obligations of said firm under said contract.\u201d This action was brought, for the benefit of the corporation, by the surviving partner of the firm of the Athol Aqueduct Company, and \u201c it was agreed that it was correctly brought as to parties.\u201d The defendant apparently had enjoyed the use of the water down to the date of the writ, at least, which is December 21, 1887, and it had paid for the use of it down to January 1, 1885, a deduction from the agreed price having been made for the half-year ending January 1,1884. The amount claimed to have become due on July 1,1885, has been adjusted in some manner by the parties; and the action is prosecuted to recover for the use of the hydrants from July 1,1885, to July 1, 1887.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The plaintiff offered evidence \u201c that during the time alleged he furnished, the defendant town at all times with a full and ample supply of pure water from the hydrants referred to in the contract, from each and all of them, for the extinguishing fires, and in accordance with the interpretation of the contract adopted by the court.\u201d The defendant offered evidence \u201c that the supply of water so furnished was not, during some or all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>time covered by the claim, full and ample in quantity, nor pure in quality, for the purpose aforesaid, and according to the construction of the contract adopted at the trial.\u201d There was also evidence \u201c that the hydrants could not, at any time during the period covered by the claim, comply with the provision as to throwing eight streams of water at the same time over the highest building in either village.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">If the word \u201c guaranty \u201d in the contract was used in any technical sense, it must have been used for \u201c warranty \u201d or \u201c warrant,\u201d because there is no contract of a third person which is guaranteed. If it be taken to mean the same as \u201c warrant,\u201d then the agreement is to warrant that the specified quantity and head of water shall be furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">It is said that the English courts make a distinction between a warranty in a contract of sale of a specific chattel when the title passes unconditionally by the contract and the warranty is collateral to the sale, and a warranty in an executory contract of sale, when the title does not pass by the contract. In the latter case, it is said that, by the English law, the buy\u00e9r may refuse to receive and accept the chattel if it does not conform to the warranty; but that in the former case he cannot, although he may recover or recoup his damages for breach of the warranty. By our law, the buyer can rescind a contract for breach of warranty if the title has passed, and can return the chattel, or refuse to accept it; and if the title has not passed by the contract, he can refuse to accept the chattel, if it does not conform to the contract. See <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Isburgh, </em>13 Gray, 607; <em>Morse </em>v. Brackett, 98 Mass. 205. In an executory contract to sell and deliver in the future certain things described in the contract, the things to be delivered must be such as they are described, and a warranty of kind, quantity, or quality in such a contract is only an agreement that the things delivered shall be of the specified kind, quantity, or quality; and if they are not, the buyer can refuse to accept them, because they are not what he has agreed to buy. This is not the rescission of an executed contract by the buyer, but the non-performance of an executory contract by the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In the case at bar, the guaranty may be considered either as defining what should constitute \u201c a full and ample supply of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>water,\u201d or as fixing a minimum below which the supply should not be permitted to fall; but upon either construction the plaintiff must furnish the amount guaranteed, in order to perform his part of the contract. It is true, that by the contract the aqueduct company was to furnish hydrants and lay down water pipes, and keep the pipes and works connected with them in repair; but as these things were necessary in order to enable the company to furnish the water, it cannot be held that the defendant would be liable to pay anything for these if the water was not furnished. The furnishing of the water was the principal thing, to which everything else was subordinate. See <em>Bacon </em>v. Parker, 137 Mass. 309. We agree, therefore, with the defendant\u2019s counsel in his contention that the guaranty was in its nature a continuing condition precedent, the performance of which was necessary to enable the plaintiff to recover, semiannually, the price agreed to be paid for the use of the hydrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">But although conditions precedent must be performed, .and a partial performance is not sufficient, yet when a contract has been performed in a substantial part, and the other party has voluntarily accepted and received the benefit of the part performance, knowing that the contract was not being fully performed, the latter may thereby be precluded from relying upon the performance of the residue as a condition precedent to his liability to pay for what he has received, and may be compelled to rely upon his claim for damages in respect of the defective performance. <em>White </em>v. <em>Beeton, </em>7 H. &amp; N. 42. <em>Behn </em>v. <em>Burness, </em>3 B. &amp; S. 751. <em>Jonassohn </em>v. <em>Young, </em>4 B. &amp; S. 296. <em>Pust </em>v. <em>Dowie, </em>5 B. &amp; S. 20. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Scargill, </em>L. R. 10 Q. B. 564. <em>Mill Dam Foundery </em>v. <em>Hovey, </em>21 Pick. 417, 448. <em>Norrington </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>115 U. S. 188. <em>Heilbutt </em>v. <em>Hickson, </em>L. R. 7 C. P. 438. See <em>Maryland Fertilizing Co. </em>v. <em>Lorentz, </em>44 Md. 218; <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Somerset Iron Works Co. </em>6 Gray, 120; <em>Kenworthy </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>132 Mass. 123; Benjamin on Sale, (4th ed.) 547; Leake, Con. 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The foundation of this rule undoubtedly is, that it would be unfair that a party should receive and keep a part of what he has bargained for, and pay nothing for it because he has not received the whole. The technical reason given is, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>covenantee or promisee must be held to.have dispensed with the performance of a condition precedent, as such, if, with knowledge that the condition was not being fully performed, he treats the contract as continuing, and. takes the benefit of a part performance. There are difficulties in the application of the rule, particularly in determining what constitutes such a part performance as will change the condition precedent into an independent agreement. It seems that the performance must be of a substantial part of the contract, and that the acceptance must be under such circumstances as to show that the party accepting knew, or ought to have known, that the contract was not being fully performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">There is a further difficulty suggested in the present case, namely, that the contract is of such a nature that there is no satisfactory measure of damages, if the full and ample supply of water guaranteed was not furnished. If a full and ample supply was furnished, which yet did not come up to the guaranty, the damages could not be large. If the supply was not full and ample, and not up to the guaranty, the town, unless it had precluded itself by an acceptance of the works, could at any time have given notice to the aqueduct company, and have refused thereafter to receive the water and to accept a part performance of the contract. If the supply, such as it was, was a substantial benefit to the town, and the town continued to receive and use it, knowing that it was less than the company had agreed to furnish, the town ought to pay something for what it has received.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">There is a provision in the contract that after the expiration - of fifteen years, and within the- term of twenty-five years, the company will sell and transfer its right, title, and interest in the reservoir, and in the pipes and other property connected therewith, to the town, at a valuation to be determined by three competent and disinterested men. The works are property, and have been treated by the parties as property, the value of which can be estimated. We have no doubt that the value of the use of the hydrants by the town could be estimated by a jury, if the contract, instead of defining the price, had provided that a reasonable price should be paid. If the town has received a supply of water which was found to be useful for the purpose of extin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>guishing fires, but which was less than the supply which the company agreed to furnish, we have no doubt that it would be competent for a jury to determine the difference in value between the supply actually furnished and that agreed to be furnished. If the town had paid the company the stipulated price, and then had brought suit to recover damages because the supply of water had not been what the company had agreed to furnish, it cannot be said that it would be impossible to estimate the damages. This case, we think, cannot be taken out of the rule we have stated, on the ground that the damages for a breach of the contract could not be estimated, if the guaranty is regarded as an independent agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Although the exceptions do not show that the company furnished, during all the time alleged, a full and ample supply of water for extinguishing fires, yet we think it appears that the supply was such as to be substantially useful for that purpose, and was received and used by the town with knowledge of the deficiency in the supply, if there was a deficiency, and without any intimation to the aqueduct company or to the water company that it refused to receive and accept the water in part performance of the contract. On the facts which appear, we think that the court was right in holding that the guaranty, during the time covered by the declaration, must be treated as having become in effect an independent agreement, for the breach of which damages might be recouped in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The measure of damages was the difference between the value of the supply of water actually furnished, and of that which by the contract should have been furnished, estimated with reference to the uses for which it was furnished. Upon the question of these damages, the exceptions do not state that the defendant offered any evidence, except that the supply furnished was not full and ample, and was not equivalent to the amount guaranteed. The ruling that the damages suffered by individuals in their property, by reason of the failure to furnish the stipulated supply, could not be taken into account, was undoubtedly correct. The court also ruled that the town might \u201c recoup any damages \u201d it had suffered as a corporation by reason of the failure to furnish a full and ample supply, and also that it might \u201c avail itself of the breach of the so called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>guaranty, and of other independent stipulations in the contract to be performed by the plaintiff, in reduction of the damages.\u201d This ruling is correct, so far as it goes. If the defendant town desired a more specific statement of the nature of the damages which might be recouped, or of the evidence which would be competent to prove such damages, we think that it should have offered evidence, and requested suitable rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">It appeared in evidence that in 1882 or 1883 the Athol Water Company laid water pipes towards Cut-Throat Brook, and in 1884 procured the passage of the St. of 1884, c. 189, and after-wards erected a pumping station at Silver Lake, and \u201c connected it with its aqueduct, but soon abandoned it.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel, in reply to an inquiry by the court, stated that he should contend that these acts were an admission by the corporation, and by the plaintiff Wiley, who was then its president, of the insufficiency of the supply as to quantity and quality then being furnished to the town under the contract. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered in evidence the records of the meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, \u201cto show, by the votes ther\u00e9 passed, that the object of laying the pipe towards Cut-Throat Brook, and of taking the water of Silver Lake, was to improve the quality, and not to increase the quantity, of water.\u201d The court admitted the record of the votes, \u201c which recited, in substance, that the object of said acts was to improve the quality of the water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The acts of the corporation were not the acts of its president, and we are not clear that evidence of these acts was competent for the purpose contended for by the defendant; but if it was, we cannot say that the records were not properly admitted to show the purpose for which the acts were done. The votes contained a declaration of the purpose of the corporation in ordering the acts done. The declaration of the purpose is a part of the doings of the corporation, by the authority of which, the acts were done. It does not appear that at the time these votes were passed the present controversy had arisen. Apparently it is the common case of declarations accompanying acts which tend to explain or qualify the meaning of the acts, and which are considered as a part of the <em>res gestee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
