The case was heard by Knowlton, J., and was as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s title to the land in question was derived from his deceased wife, whose will, admitted to probate on July 18, 1887, contained the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-13\">\u201c After the payment of my just debts and funeral charges, I bequeath and devise as follows: To my husband, Richardson Moffat, everything of whatever nature that has any value which I now or may hereafter possess, with this understanding, that he shall pay the following sums [here followed a list of sums named to be paid to various persons and organizations]. All the above named sums to be paid within two years from my decease, the balance for his own use and disposal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u201c Second. In the event of my husband\u2019s death I give and bequeath to my husband\u2019s relations [here followed pecuniary legacies to persons named, followed in succeeding clauses by other bequests to various organizations]. Any party dissatisfied and making trouble about this will forfeit their claim. In the event of a deficiency to pay the several sums specified, or of a surplus, deduct or add proportionally.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">The defendant contended that the plaintiff took only a life estate in the land, and was unable to convey a good title to it in fee simple.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">The judge made a decree for the plaintiff; and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-7\"><em>B.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">The devise to the husband, taken by itself</p>\n<p id=\"Asg\">alone, would clearly convey a fee to him, perhaps subject, however, to a charge for the payment of the sums which he is to pay. The next series of bequests, \u201cIn the event of my husband\u2019s death,\u201d means that those bequests are to take effect in the event of his death before hers. There is nothing to show that she meant to cut down to a life estate the previous devise to him for his own use and disposal. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>9 Allen, 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">No question is presented to us as to whether the land is charged with the payment of the sums which he is to pay, and we do not consider it. Nor does the defendant contend that he ought not to be compelled to accept a title which may be exposed to litigation from those who are not parties to the present suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
