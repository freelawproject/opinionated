Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Sherman, </em>J., who reported the case for the determination of this court, the report, so far as material to the point decided, being as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-4\">There was evidence tending to show the following facts. The plaintiff at the time of the accident was engaged in unloading coal from a barge belonging to the defendant, and lying at a wharf in Manchester, owned, together with an adjoining coal-shed, by one Knight, by whom the plaintiff was employed. Knight was a coal dealer, and had purchased coal from the defendant for ten or twelve years, and for eight years or more coal so purchased by him bad been sent to his wharf by the defendant in a barge, which was there made fast and turned over to him to be discharged. This barge was fitted with masts supported by guys, and with a boom for hoisting, the lower end of which was secured to one of the masts at a point near the deck. The only tackle ever supplied by Knight were the buckets and falls of rope used in hoisting coal out of the barge upon a platform which rested upon the wharf, and which was about eighteen or twenty feet above it and extended out over the end of the wharf and above a hatch in the deck of the barge, being supported at the outer end by tackle running from the masts of the barge and forming a part of its rigging. This tackle on the masts was peculiarly adapted and constructed to support^ this and similar platforms that might be put out from the coal wharves of customers for the reception of coal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>On July 9, 1888, Knight gave an order to the defendant\u2019s agent for six hundred tons of coal, which the agent at once acknowledged by a letter to him, reciting that \u201c we have entered your order for \u201d that amount of coal \u201c alongside your wharf.\u201d Subsequently, on July 15, the coal was delivered in the barge alongside Knight\u2019s wharf, and there left by the defendant\u2019s servants. The defendant\u2019s agent, by whom the coal was despatched to Knight, and whose duty it was in part to oversee the loading and unloading of coal from its barges, \u201c did not in this or in any case contract to discharge his coal; never undertook to furnish Mr. Knight any appliances on the barge for discharging the cargo,\u201d but supposed that these appliances on the barge \u201c were used; knew that they were there for that purpose, and that they were put there by the company to be used if the consignee chose to use them; cannot say that I knew that Knight used these appliances in unloading his <em>coal; </em>supposed that he did.\u201d Knight testified that \u201c there was no arrangement whatever between myself and the company, and no understanding by which I should supply any tackle to the <em>barge; </em>I always implied that I had the right to make use of the rigging on the barge for my purposes, but never had any talk with the proprietors, owners of the barge, or the agents, with regard to the barge; I said I \u2018 implied \u2019 I had a right to support my staging from those masts; it was never granted me; no objection was ever made to my using the rigging of the barge for that purpose, and I continued to use it during all the time I was buying coal from the company during the past eight years.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-3\">On the morning of July 16, the plaintiff and a fellow workman were standing on the outer edge of the platform, dumping the coal as it was hoisted out of the barge into a wheelbarrow on the platform, which, when thus loaded, was wheeled away by still another workman into the coal-shed. While they were so engaged, the mast to which the boom was attached broke, by reason of an insecurely fastened stay, the platform fell, and the plaintiff was thrown into the hold of the barge, receiving the injuries in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-4\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the defendant requested the judge to rule that the action could not be maintained, and to direct a verdict for the defendant. This request was made solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>upon the ground that there was no evidence to authorize the jury to find an implied agreement between the defendant and Samuel Knight that the defendant would furnish the tackle and appliances which were upon the barge for use in unloading the coal. The judge declined to rule as requested, and submitted the case to the jury under other instructions not objected to, and the defendant excepted; and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-3\">If the ruling was properly refused, judgment was to be entered upon the verdict; otherwise, a new trial was to be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-4\"><em>I\u00ed. M. Morse, Jr. O. S. Hamlin, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-5\"><em>H. F. Hurlburt, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b480-6\">Field, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD_4\">The defendant excepted to the refusal of the court to rule that the plaintiff on the evidence could not maintain the action. The report states that the defendant requested this ruling \u201c solely upon the ground that there was no evidence to authorize the jury to find an implied agreement between the defendant and Samuel Knight that the defendant would furnish the tackle and appliances which were upon the barge for use in unloading the coal.\u201d See <em>Pingree </em>v. <em>Leyland, </em>135 Mass. 398. The .court, having refused so to rule, \u201c submitted the case to the jury under instructions not objected to.\u201d The case has been argued in this court upon the theory that it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove a contract between the defendant and Knight that the defendant should deliver the coal at Knight\u2019s wharf in a barge or vessel provided with masts, stays, and tackle, which Knight should have the right to use for the purpose of unloading the coal. But it. was enough, we think, if the plaintiff proved that the tackle and appliances on the barge were actually intended by the defendant to be used by its customers in delivering coal, and were furnished by the defendant for this purpose, and if Knight as a customer and purchaser of coal was invited by the defendant to use them in unloading his coal. Of this there was abundant evidence. See <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>15 Q. B. D. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Indeed, we think that, from the long course of dealing between Knight and the defendant, as shown by the evidence, and from the admitted purpose for which the tackle and appliances were put into the barge, and from the use which Knight had been accustomed to make of the tackle and appliances in unloading cargoes of coal, it was competent for the jury to find that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>a part of the contract that the coal should be delivered alongside Knight\u2019s wharf in the usual manner, and with the usual appliances for unloading it, and that he might use these appliances in unloading it. It is not contended that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant, if the defendant was under any duty to Knight to furnish him with masts, stays, and tackle for unloading coal in the manner in which this coal was unloaded. <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
