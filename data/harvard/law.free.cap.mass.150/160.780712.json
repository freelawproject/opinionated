The declaration in various counts alleged, in substance, that Peter Borlin was insured against loss by fire, under a policy issued by an insurance company doing business in this Commonwealth, upon a barn as well as upon a portion of its contents owned by him; that the barn and such contents, as well as three valuable cows belonging to the plaintiff and in the barn at the time, were burned; that after the loss Borlin prepared and rendered to the company a statement in writing, which he signed and made oath to, setting forth the value of the property insured and his interest therein, with other facts required by the company in the policy, in order that he might recover from the company the damage he had sustained; and that the defendant publicly, falsely, and maliciously accused the plaintiff of the crime of attempting or endeavoring to incite and induce Borlin to commit the crime of perjury, by words spoken of the plaintiff substantially as follows: He [meaning the plaintiff] tried to make or get Peter Borlin to swear that the cows owned by the plaintiff which Borlin was keeping for him were his [Borlin\u2019s] cows, so that the plaintiff might get the pay for his cows from the insurance company through Borlin and by means of his [Berlin\u2019s] perjury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Dewey, </em>J., it also appeared in evidence that the insurance policy referred to in the declaration was in the form known as the Massachusetts Standard Policy, prescribed by the Pub. Sts. c. 119, \u00a7 139; and that the defendant spoke the words of and concerning the plaintiff, substantially as alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-7\">The defendant requested the judge to rule, that, upon all the evidence, the action could not be maintained, inasmuch as the oath to be made, in order to make a \u201c statement on oath \u201d as required on proof of loss by the insurance policy, was not an oath which, if falsely taken could subject the person so taking it to punishment for the crime of perjury. The judge declined so to rule, and ruled that, if there was a loss sustained by fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>under the policy by Borlin, and the provisions of the policy relating to the manner of proving the loss by a statement on oath had not been waived by and were required by the insurance company, such an oath as would be required for the proof of loss under the policy was an oath required by law, within the meaning of section 2 of chapter 205 of the Public Statutes, and, if falsely taken, would subject the person so taking such false oath to punishment for the crime of perjury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\">The jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-6\"><em>O.

Sts. c. 205, \u00a7 2. This section is as follows: \u201c Whoever, being required by law to take an oath or affirmation, wilfully swears or affirms falsely in regard to any matter or thing respecting which such oath or affirmation is required, shall be deemed guilty of perjury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">The St. of 1887, c. 214, \u00a7 60, which follows closely the Pub. Sts. c. 119, \u00a7 139, prescribes the form of policy to be used by all fire insurance companies doing business in this Commonwealth, and requires a provision in the policy that in case of loss \u201c a statement in writing, signed and sworn to by the insured, shall be forthwith rendered to the company, setting forth the value of the property insured,\u201d etc. In the absence of any modification of this provision by the parties, or waiver of it by the company, a policy holder whose property has been, burned is \u201c required by law \u201d to make such a statement under oath before he can maintain a suit to recover for his loss. The policy referred to in the present case contained this provision, and, under the instructions of the judge, the jury must have found that there was no waiver of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">What interpretation should be given to the words \u201c required by law,\u201d in the statute first quoted, is a question by no means free from difficulty. It has been said that the provision \u201c might seem from its very general language to embrace all cases'where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>an oath had been lawfully administered in the execution of official duty.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. Daniels, 15 Gray, 438. But in the same case it is suggested that the language of the original statute from which it is derived (St. 1829, c. 56) seems to have had reference to oaths required by special provisions of statute. Both of these remarks were entirely outside of the question involved in the case then decided, and we are not aware that the statute has ever been before the court for construction. The fact that in so general a revision of our laws as that of 1835 the language was considerably changed, and the further fact that the law has been twice re-enacted in substantially the form in which it was put in that revision, make the original statute of less importance than might otherwise be attached to it. Rev. Sts. c. 128, \u00a7 2.' Gen. Sts. c. 163, \u00a7 2. Pub. Sts. c. 205, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The oath referred to in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration was essential to the preservation of the legal rights of the assured. Although not taken \u201c in any proceeding in a course of justice,\u201d so that if false it would have subjected the affiant to punishment for perjury at the common law, or under section 1 of chapter 205 of the Public Statutes, it was within the reason of the rule of the common law, for it was taken in a preliminary proceeding which lay at the foundation of proceedings in court, and which would be subject to review in those proceedings. It was required under a contract which embodied the requirement in conformity to an express provision of the law. We think the spirit and purpose of the statute will best be conserved by so construing it that the requirement in the present case shall be deemed to have been a requirement \u201cby law,\u201d such that it would have subjected the assured to punishment for perjury if he had wilfully sworn falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The words alleged to have been spoken of the plaintiff were sufficient to impute to him the crime of attempting to induce and incite Borlin to commit the crime of perjury. Such a crime could be committed by the use of words alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
