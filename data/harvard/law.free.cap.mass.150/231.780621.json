Writ dated October 15, 1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-14\">At the trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before <em>Hammond, </em>J., the defendant Edwin J. Jones alone defended. Evidence was introduced tending to prove the following facts. As between the makers of the note George W. was the principal, whose duty it was to pay the note in full, and Edwin J. was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>surety, and this fact was known to the plaintiff. A composition agreement under seal, dated March 16,1887, was presented by George W. to his creditors, which, after reciting his inability to pay his debts in full, and an agreement on the part of such of his creditors as should sign it to accept a certain percentage of their claims in full satisfaction thereof if paid to them \u201c on or before the tenth day of June next,\u201d contained the following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-5\">\u201c This agreement is not to be binding upon us, or any of us, unless all of the known creditors of said George W. Jones whose individual debt exceeds the sum of twenty dollars shall sign this agreement. It is understood and agreed that all the property of said Jones is to be conveyed to Albert M. Gleason, in trust, without bonds, and he is to receive all the proceeds of any and all sales, and hold the same to pay the several amounts to carry out the true intent and purpose of this compromise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-6\">This agreement was signed by the plaintiff during March, and by other creditors. George W., for the purpose of carrying out the agreement, executed and delivered to Gleason, the trustee, a quitclaim deed of his real estate and a bill of sale of his personal property not exempt from attachment, and Gleason executed and delivered a declaration of trust that he held the property for the purposes named in said agreement, but the property was never delivered to Gleason. George W. tried to carry out the agreement, but did not succeed in securing the signatures of all his known creditors whose individual debts exceeded the sum of twenty dollars, and the agreement was in no respect carried out, except that the deed and bill of sale were made and delivered. Edwin J. knew that the plaintiff had signed the agreement of compromise; he neither said anything to the plaintiff about it nor did anything about it, and he never consented to the signing of the agreement by the plaintiff, in any other way or to any other extent than is necessarily implied by law from such knowledge and such failure to speak and act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-7\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that the plaintiff\u2019s signing the agreement operated as an agreement to give George W. time, and not to sue him within such time; but the judge declined so to rule, and ruled that, upon the above facts, Edwin J. was not discharged from liability, and found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>J. A. </em>Aiken, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-5\"><em>S. T. </em>Field, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b253-6\">Field, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahp\">The composition agreement under seal which was signed by the plaintiff never took effect, because by its terms it was \u201c not to b\u00e9 binding \u201d upon those who signed it \u201c unless all of the known creditors of said George W. Jones whose individual debt exceeds the sum of twenty dollars shall sign this agreement.\u201d The exceptions state that Jones did not \u201csecure the signatures of all his known creditors whose individual debt exceeded the sum of twenty dollars,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">It is contended that it should be implied from the facts, however, that the plaintiff and George W. Jones agreed with each other that the plaintiff should not sue Jones on the note before the \u201c tenth day of June next \u201d after the date of the agreement, or for a reasonable time after the plaintiff signed the agreement, because it must have been contemplated that Jones should have some time to solicit the signatures of those of his creditors whose signatures were necessary to make the agreement binding. See <em>Agricultural Bank </em>v. Bishop, 6 Gray, 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">There is no evidence of any express oral agreement to this effect, and, whatever may have been the expectation of the parties, we think that no contract of this kind can be inferred. The reasonable inference is, that it was understood by the parties that if the written agreement never became binding it was to be treated as if it had never been signed by the plaintiff, and that if it became binding the rights of the parties should be determined by it. Whether evidence of an express oral contract of the kind set up by the defendant, made contemporaneously with the signing of the written agreement, could be received, or whether such evidence must be regarded as tending to add to or vary the terms of the written agreement, need not be determined. There is no evidence that the parties did not incorporate into the written agreement everything agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
