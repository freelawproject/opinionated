Trial in the Superior Court, before Brigham, C. J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-12\">The defendant had a license of the first class, under the Pub. Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 10, to sell intoxicating liquors in the front room of the first floor of the building numbered 634 Acushnet Avenue, New Bedford, and lived up stairs with his family. The government offered evidence tending to prove the following facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-13\">On Sunday, April 28, 1889, a police officer stationed near the house saw numerous men and women at intervals going up stairs on the outside of the rear of the building and into the second story, some of the men who went in sober coming out drunk. Later on the same day, another police officer went up those stairs, and as he arrived near the top he heard loud talking, and some one said, \u201c Take it up stairs.\u201d He looked through a window into the kitchen, and saw a number of men standing around a table, who seemed to be catching up some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>thing. Thereupon, finding the door locked, he knocked and the defendant opened it. He said to the defendant, \u201c What is all this ? \u201d and upon the defendant making no reply, he went into the kitchen, and as he entered he heard the noise made by a number of persons going down the front stairs. He then said to the defendant, \u201cWhat is all this? Have not you been warned about this Sunday racket? Why do you not heed it?\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cI did for a time, \u2014 I wish you would not report this thing to the chief of police.\u201d The officer found in the kitchen, upon entering it, bottles containing intoxicating liquors, and bottles and glasses in which there had been such liquors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-5\">Other officers testified that on several occasions during the time covered by the complaint they had seen persons in the front room of the first floor of the building drinking at the bar, some of whom were drunk and some under the influence of liquor; and that they were drinking what was apparently beer, and were being waited upon by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-6\">The defendant asked the judge to require the government to elect in which part of the building the tenement was ; and to rule that the evidence disclosed two separate tenements in the building, one a shop and the other a tenement to live in. The judge refused these requests.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-8\"><em>JE. L. </em>Barney, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-9\"><em>A. J. </em>Waterman, Attorney General, <em>$ H. C. Bliss, </em>First Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b92-10\">Devbns, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHp\">The word \u201c tenement \u201d in its modern use often signifies such part of a house as is separately occupied by a single person or family, in contradistinction to the whole house. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>144 Mass. 297. It may consist of a single room or of contiguous rooms, or of rooms upon different stories, if such rooms are controlled by a single person and are used in connection with each other. The fact (if it were so) that one of the rooms was occupied and used as a shop, and another for a living room or kitchen, by the same person, would not make these rooms distinct tenements. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>147 Mass. 581. The Commonwealth could not prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>erly have been required to elect in which one of the rooms occupied by the defendant his tenement was. There was sufficient evidence that the defendant controlled and occupied the kitchen up stairs by the fact that he unlocked it, by the language used by him to the officer, and by the other circumstances testified to. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
