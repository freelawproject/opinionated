The widow was entitled to dower in the land, but her dower was never assigned to her, and she conveyed the land in 1849 by warranty deed to one Floyd, from whom by mesne conveyances it has come to the tenant. The widow died in 1879; the tenant and those under whom she claims have been in adverse possession of the land since 1849. The demandant asked the court to rule \u201c that the statute of limitations did not run against the demandant until the death of the mother.\u201d The court refused to give this ruling, and ruled \u201c that, as there was no evidence that the dower had ever been set off to the mother, the statute of limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ran against the demandant before the death of the mother\u201d; and the demandant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\">A widow, before her dower has been assigned to her, has no estate in the lands of her deceased husband. <em>Windham </em>v. <em>Portland, </em>4 Mass. 384, 388. <em>Sheafe </em>v. <em>O'Neil, </em>9 Mass. 13. <em>Gooch </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>14 Mass. 378. <em>Hildreth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>16 Mass. 191. <em>Croade </em>v. <em>Ingraham, </em>13 Pick. 33. <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Gray, ante, </em>289.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">There was, therefore, after the death of David Gloyd and before the demandant as his heir was entitled to possession, never any intervening estate within the meaning of the Pub.
