The allegations as to the place where and the time when the offence was committed are entirely specific, and no allegation of an unlawful or criminal intent was necessary. The statute expressly forbids the act which the defendant was charged with committing, and the complaint follows its language. Whether the defendant intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>to violate the statute or not, if she committed the act charged she was liable to the penalty which was imposed thereby.
