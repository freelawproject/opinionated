Certain liquors and implements of sale and articles of furniture were seized on the warrant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-11\">In the Superior Court, on appeal, Jeremiah Lucy, Jr., who appeared as claimant of the implements of sale and furniture, before the jury was impanelled moved to dismiss the complaint and quash the warrant \u201c because the place to be searched was not described with legal accuracy.\u201d Dunbar, J., overruled the motion, and the claimant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>At the trial, there was evidence tending to prove that Lucy owned the implements of sale and furniture found on the premises described, of which Libbey was in possession and occupation, and that among them were two pool tables, with cues and balls, which the claimant contended he had put there for storage; and there was no proof that any person was licensed to keep such tables for use for hire or purpose of gain, or that the tables had been actually used, beyond the fact that they were on the premises, and that the cues and balls were in the racks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-3\">The judge declined to rule, as requested by the claimant, that \u201c Libbey could not legally use or keep for use the pool tables seized, without a license from the mayor and aldermen of the city of Lawrence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-4\">The jury returned a verdict that all the implements of sale and furniture were used as alleged; and the claimant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-5\"><em>J.

The place to be searched would be sufficiently described in the warrant by the words as stated in the body of the exceptions, \u201c a certain tenement situate on Essex Street, and numbered 136 on said street, in Lawrence, in said county, and occupied by said Libbey as a place of common resort kept therein.\u201d It is not necessary to refer to the copy of the warrant itself, sent up with the exceptions, in which the description is \u201ca certain tenement, to wit, a certain dwelling-house, situate,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">2. The prayer for a ruling that Libbey, the alleged keeper of the place, could not legally use or keep for use the pool tables seized and found by the jury to be implements of sale used or kept and provided to be used in the illegal sale of intoxicating liquors, without a license, was properly refused. The fact that he could not lawfully keep them for gain had no tendency to show that he did not unlawfully keep them as implements of sale. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
