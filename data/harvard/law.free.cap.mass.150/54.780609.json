There was evidence tending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>show that a short time afterwards a flock of sheep was found in the possession of the defendants, which, by its number and marking, resembled the Coleman and Parsons sheep. It was competent to show that some of this flock, identified by peculiar marks, were the sheep of Parsons. It tended to identify the whole flock as the flock which was stolen, and thus to show that some of the flock were the property of Coleman. The fact that it might prove another crime committed by the defendants is immaterial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Riggs, 14 Gray, 376. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
