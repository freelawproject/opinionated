Sts. c. 119, \u00a7 139, (St. 1887, c. 214, \u00a7 60,) against loss by fire for five years. At the trial in the Superior Court, before Mason, J., the following facts were admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-4\">For a long time before the date of the policy, and from that time until April 27, 1888, inclusive, when the buildings were wholly destroyed by accidental fire, these buildings had been vacant and unoccupied, and the agent of the defendant, by whom the policy was issued to the plaintiff, knew that they were vacant and unoccupied at the time he issued the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-5\">After the description of the buildings in the policy and in the body thereof were stamped in print the words \u201c occupied for dwelling purposes only,\u201d followed by the words in writing \u201c permission to remain vacant thirty days without prejudice.\u201d The policy also contained the following: \u201c This policy shall be void ... if the premises hereby insured shall become vacant by the removal of the owner or occupant, and so remain vacant for more than thirty days, without the assent in writing or in print of the company\u201d; and the only defence was, that at the time of the fire the policy was void under this last clause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-6\">The judge ruled that, upon the above facts, the avoiding clause of the policy did not apply; and ordered a verdict for the plaintiff for $2150, a sum agreed by the parties, and reported the case for the determination of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-7\">If the ruling was correct, judgment was to be entered on the verdict; otherwise, a new trial\u2019was to be ordered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-8\"><em>O. A. Be </em>Courcy, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-9\"><em>JE. T. </em>Burley, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b395-10\">Knowlton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjPq\">The only question reserved for our consideration in this case is whether the policy became void because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>insured premises were left vacant from the time the policy was issued until the buildings were destroyed by fire, nearly seven months afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\">In the body of the policy, after the description of the buildings, the words \u201c occupied for dwelling purposes only \u201d were stamped in print. Among the printed conditions of the policy was this clause: \u201c This policy shall be void ... if the premises hereby insured shall become vacant by the removal of the owner or occupant, and so remain vacant for more than thirty days, without the assent in writing or in print of the company.\u201d These provisions, taken by themselves, would imply that the buildings were represented as occupied for dwelling purposes at the time of the insurance. If they had been so represented and so insured, but had in fact been vacant and had been allowed to remain so for more than thirty days, the policy would have become void under the provision which we have quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">It is, however, conceded that the house was known by the defendant\u2019s agent to be vacant when he issued the policy, and, if nothing more appeared, it might be held that his knowledge controlled the representation and implication contained in the policy so far as to make the clause as to the premises becoming vacant inapplicable. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Agricultural Ins. Co. </em>106 N. Y. 243. <em>Aurora Ins. Co. </em>v. Kranich, 36 Mich. 289. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Niagara Ins. Co. </em>50 Iowa, 561. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>North British &amp; Mercantile Ins. Co. 81 N. </em>Y. 273. <em>Haight </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co. </em>92 N. Y. 51. But the parties went further, and made a special provision as to the condition then existing. They wrote into the body of the policy the words \u201cpermission to remain vacant thirty days without prejudice.\u201d That was equivalent to saying: \u201cThis is our contract in reference to the present vacant condition of the buildings. Except as modified by this contract, the policy is to be deemed what in its other parts it purports to be, namely, a policy of insurance upon buildings now occupied for dwelling purposes. By our language we have chosen to make a contract relating to property so occupied, except for the short period of thirty days, during which it may remain insured under this special agreement as unoccupied property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The effect of this arrangement, taken as a whole, was to leave the rights of the parties after the expiration of the thirty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>precisely the same as if the buildings had been occupied when the insurance was effected. By the original provisions of the policy they were insured as occupied buildings. The usual provision was inserted as to their becoming vacant and remaining vacant more than thirty days. Then an exception was written in which took them out of the general provisions of the contract, and insured them as unoccupied buildings for thirty days and no longer. We are of opinion that the ruling of the court was erroneous, and that upon the facts stated in the report the verdict should have been for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\n<em>New trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
