No further inquiry was made of him, and there was nothing in the hill of exceptions alleged at the trial to show that his answer was treated as evidence of an admission of guilt, or, under the Pub. Sts. c. 169, \u00a7 22, to discredit the witness. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant showed no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-10\">Indictment on the St. of 1886, c. 329, \u00a7 3, for seduction.

Brown, admitted in a conversation that he was the first man who ever had sexual intercourse with her, which admission the defendant denied. George H., also called as a witness by the government, testified that he was present at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>conversation between the father and the defendant, but did not remember that the defendant made the above statement to the father. He was then asked by the government, whether or not he said to the trial justice, after the father had made his statement to him. that all that the father had said was true, and that there was nothing he could add. The defendant objected to this question, but the judge, deeming the witness an unwilling one, allowed the question to be put, and the defendant excepted. The witness replied in the affirmative. There was no evidence introduced as to what statement was made by the father to the trial justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-6\"><em>H.

For the purpose of refreshing the recollection of a witness who is forgetful, or apparently unwilling, and of bringing to his mind the transaction respecting which he hesitates to testify, the court may properly allow a question to be put to him whether he has not on another occasion made a statement in reference to it. If he says yes, one step is gained towards obtaining his direct testimony upon the matter which is material, and further questions are usually put in order to get if possible some positive testimony as to the particulars. His bare declaration that on a former occasion he made a statement upon the subject is of itself of no significance, and, unless followed up by further inquiry, should be disregarded. The witness Brown, having testified that he did not remember the supposed admission of guilt by the defendant, might properly be asked, as preliminary to further inquiries, if he did not make a statement in respect to it to the trial justice. <em>Melhuish </em>v. Collier, 15 Q. B. 878. <em>Bullard </em>v. Pearsall, 53 N. Y. 230. But when no further inquiry was made, the defendant might well have asked that the jury be instructed to disregard the answer already given, if such request were necessary. That answer, though properly received when given, became simply immaterial, and there is nothing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>show that it was afterwards treated as evidence of an admission of guilt by the defendant, or even as evidence under the Pub. Sts. c. 169, \u00a7 22, to discredit the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\n<em>jExceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
