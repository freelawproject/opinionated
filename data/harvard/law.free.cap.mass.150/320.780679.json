Evidence was offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>tending to show that some of the panes of glass in the window in the rear of the licensed premises were painted; and that there had been no change since May 1, 1888, or during all the period covered by the license, except that one pane of glass, which was painted long before the license was granted, had been broken and replaced by a pane of clear glass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">There was evidence, which was not contradicted, that at the trial before the trial justice there was no issue or evidence as to any violation of the license by placing any obstruction to the view of the interior of the premises, or in the carrying on of the business therein. The defendant asked the judge to rule that the evidence offered was therefore not admissible; but the judge refused so to rule, and admitted the evidence, and further ruled that any obstruction, such as painted glass, which would in any material manner obstruct the view of the interior of the licensed premises, or of the business carried on there, kept or maintained by the defendant during any portion of the time covered by the license, whether placed there before or after the granting of the license, would render the license void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-7\"><em>J.

The license must be granted before it takes effect, and it is upon condition that, after it takes effect, the licensee shall not place or maintain the prohibited obstruction upon the premises. The evidence in the appellate court tended to prove the same offence of which the defendant was convicted in the court below. It need not be proved by the same evidence. The\" rulings of the court were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
