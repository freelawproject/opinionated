The Superior Court made a decree <em>nisi </em>of divorce and alimony for the libellant, and the libellee alleged exceptions, which were duly allowed, but neglected to enter them in this court.

Sts. c. 150, \u00a7 16, by providing that, when a party who has appealed, or whose exceptions have been allowed, neglects to enter such appeal or exceptions in this court, the court in which the exceptions were allowed, or from which the appeal was taken, \u201c may upon the application of the adverse party, upon due notice to all parties interested, order the judgment, opinion, ruling, or order affirmed.\u201d This statute was intended to obviate the necessity of applying by complaint to the Supreme Judicial Court for the affirmation of the original judgment, opinion, ruling, or order, and to substitute as the appropriate tribunal for affirming such order, etc., when the appeal or exceptions had not been entered, the court where such order, etc., had originally been made. While the word \u201c may \u201d is used in the statute of 1888, it was not intended by this use to leave the right to apply to this court for affirmation as it had before existed, and thus to make the remedy provided merely cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The Pub. Sts. c. 146, \u00a7 33, which provide that this court may hear and determine cases of divorce, etc., \u201c according to the course of proceeding in ecclesiastical courts and in courts of equity,\u201d (certainly since the statute of 1887 transferring exclusive original jurisdiction in divorce cases to the Superior Court,) do not by force of the Pub. Sts. c. 151, \u00a7 13, cause an appeal or exceptions in such a case to \u201c thereupon be pending before the full court,\u201d and are not therefore applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The libellee having waived her exceptions, the application of the libellant should therefore be made to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">\n<em>Application refused.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
