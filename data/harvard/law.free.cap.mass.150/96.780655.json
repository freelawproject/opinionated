I order that all my estate, including the notes or loans named in the third section but excluding those items of personal property mentioned in the first and second sections, be divided into' five equal shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">\u201c 5. One such share shall be distributed to Ellen R. Douglass and her children as follows: to her daughter, Harriet R. Douglass, two thousand dollars; to her son, Willard R. Douglass, two thousand dollars; and the rest of said share to the said Ellen R. Douglass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-7\">\u201c 6.

Mackreth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-11\">\u201c 10. The foregoing division of my estate I make with equal love and affection towards all my children, and in view of all circumstances, believing that it will operate with substantial justice to all of them, and be the best for each and all.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-12\">The property of the testatrix, both at the date of the will and at her decease, amounted to about two hundred thousand dollars. This sum, which included the notes and loans referred to in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>will, was in the plaintiff\u2019s hands, ready for distribution. Jarvis W. Eobinson at various times until August 16,1886, when he died insolvent, received -loans of money from his father, and, after his father\u2019s death, from his mother, the testatrix, for the support of himself and his four children. These loans, which at the date of the will amounted to ten or twelve thousand dollars, at the time of the testatrix\u2019s death had increased to over twenty-three thousand dollars, and were represented in part by notes given by him to his father and mother. After the death of his father, Jarvis was dependent for the most part on the assistance which he received from the testatrix for the support of himself and family. After the death of Jarvis the testatrix continued to furnish funds for the support of his children so long as they formed one family. Mrs. Ellen E. Douglass in like manner owed about five thousand dollars to the estate of the testatrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">The children of Jarvis contended that the indebtedness from him to the estate should be set off against his proportion of the share devised to him and his children; the other legatees contended that such indebtedness should be deducted from the entire share given to him and his children.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-6\"><em>H. J. Fuller, </em>for the plaintiff, read the papers in the case.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-7\"><em>J. M.

Douglass and Jarvis W. Eobinson should be set off against the respective shares of the estate to be distributed to them and their children, or against the respective portions of those shares which would come to them alone. There is no single clause in the will which determines the question, and we must gather her intention from a consideration of all the provisions of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Her household furniture, silver ware, books, and pictures she divided equally among all her children. She gave her wearing apparel, jewelry, and China ware to be divided equally among her three daughters. In the third clause she says that two of her children had obtained loans in anticipation of what they might afterwards receive in the distribution of her estate, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>had given notes therefor, and intimates that further loans may be made and additional notes given, and directs that all such loans and notes be taken as a part of her estate to be divided, and closes by an order in these words: \u201cThat, in the division thereof, as hereinafter directed, such notes or loans be paid by a set-off betwixt the debt so due to my estate and the legacy given from my estate.\u201d Then follows the provision for the division referred to, which, after excluding the articles of personal property first mentioned, orders all her estate, expressly including these notes and loans, to be divided into five equal shares. She then takes each share by itself, and, in a separate clause of the will for each, directs the manner in which it \u201c shall be distributed \u201d to some one of her five children and his or her children. Having thus treated each branch of her family with absolute equality, and having modified the shares of her children only by subtracting from each a greater or less sum to be given directly to their respective children, she states her manifest purpose in the tenth clause, by saying that she makes the division with equal love and affection towards all her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">It is plain from the language of the fourth clause, that she intended that all the loans and notes should be reckoned as part of her estate, and that the shares should be ascertained on that basis. The third clause also shows the same intention. It is agreed that her son Jarvis owed her ten or twelve thousand dollars for such loans when the will was made, and, from her reference to the subject in the third clause, it is evident that she expected a material increase of the loans. Indeed, it is found as a fact, that he had been since the death of his father, and then was, dependent for the most part on assistance from her for the support of himself and his family. He died insolvent in the lifetime of the testatrix, and the amount of the loans advanced to him was then more than twenty-three thousand dollars. The words \u201clegacy given from my estate,\u201d in the third clause, could not have referred merely to the portion which. he would receive in the distribution, under the sixth clause, of the share set apart for his family; for her whole estate, including the loans, was only two hundred thousand dollars, and that portion could in no event exceed eight thousand dollars, while the amount to be collected from him by set-off was ten or twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>thousand dollars when the will was made, and was likely to he, as it afterwards was, largely increased. The language of the third clause requires the set-off \u201c betwixt the debt . . . and the legacy \u201d to be made \u201c in the division \u201d of the estate which was directed. The legacy referred to was the legacy to him and his family to be obtained by that division; and the division into five equal shares required by the fourth clause was the only one named as such in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The language used in providing for the distribution of the shares among the members of each family strengthens this conclusion. Except to the children of her son Jarvis, she set apart specific sums to her grandchildren in each family, and gave the rest of the share to their parent. In those cases there was no doubt that the share would be sufficient for the payment of these sums, with a substantial residue for the parent. But knowing that the share for the family of Jarvis would be much smaller, and of uncertain amount, and adopting a method which would be equitable, whether the amount should be large or small, she did not name specific sums for his children, but divided the whole among him and them equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In view of all the provisions of the will, we are of opinion that the indebtedness of Jarvis W. Robinson should be set off against the share of the estate devised to him and his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
