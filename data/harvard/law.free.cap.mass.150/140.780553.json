The answer to this question depends upon whether it fairly appears that John Roach, in signing it, acted as the agent of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">The case is peculiar in the use of the corporate seal. If the words which appear on the face of the seal had been written in their place on the note and had been followed by the words \u201c John Roach, Treasurer,\u201d there would have been no doubt that they were so written as the signature of the corporation appended by its treasurer. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Steam </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>Heating Co. </em>5 Allen, 338. That mode of signing is common among corporations. And if the words had been affixed in print by a stamp designed to be used in signing the corporate name, and a blank space had been left in which the treasurer\u2019s name was afterwards inserted by him in his own handwriting, the result would have been the same. We think it makes no difference that the name of the corporation impressed upon the paper was so impressed by the corporate seal, which is ordinarily used only in connection with a corporate act of signing. We are of opinion that the paper should be treated as a promissory note signed with the signature of the corporation affixed by its treasurer, who for convenience in affixing it used a stamp, except in that part which contained for verification his own name and official designation.
