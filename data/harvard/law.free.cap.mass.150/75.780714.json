At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Bishop, </em>J., it appeared that the defendant, a deputy sheriff, attached the horse and harness in an action of contract brought against the husband of the plaintiff by a judgment creditor of the husband, but not of the plaintiff; that at the time of such attachment the plaintiff was carrying on the business of farming and of selling milk, on her sole and separate account, in the town of Somerset; and that the horse and harness were used in that business, and were owned by her. The plaintiff offered in evidence a certificate signed by her, stating that she was engaged in that business. This certificate she sent for record to the town clerk\u2019s office in Somerset, and afterwards received it back from that office bearing this indorsement, signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>by the clerk: \u201cTown Clerk\u2019s Office, Somerset, July 1st, 1886. Received and recorded in 4th Book of Records of Mortgages, etc., page 486, at seven o\u2019clock p. M.\u201d The defendant objected to the admission of this certificate, on the ground, among others, that it did not appear by the indorsement that the certificate had been recorded in the town clerk\u2019s office at Somerset in a book kept for that purpose, as required by the Pub. Sts. c. 147, \u00a7 12. The judge overruled the objection, and admitted the certificate and the indorsement thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-6\"><em>J.

Sts. c. 147, \u00a7 12. The town clerk\u2019s certificate shows that it was \u201creceived and recorded in 4th Book of Records of Mortgages, etc., page 486, at seven o\u2019clock P. M.\u201d The contention is, that the words \u201c of records of mortgages, etc.,\u201d show that the record was made in a book kept for other and distinct purposes, as well as for that of recording similar certificates. Admitting this inference to be correct, we are not of opinion that the statute, in requiring certificates like that of the plaintiff to be recorded \u201c in books kept for the purpose,\u201d is to be construed as if the words \u201c solely, exclusively,\u201d or similar words had been added thereto. The publicity sought was attained by requiring such certificates to be recorded in the books of the town, and a book could properly be said to be kept for this purpose even if it was also used for the recording of other instruments of the .existence of which it was essential that public notice should be given. The presiding judge, therefore, properly admitted in evidence the certificate, with the town clerk\u2019s indorsement thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
