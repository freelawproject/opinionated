On June 15, 1989, appellant Carl R. Catron, an employee of appellee Roanoke County acting within the scope of his employment, was injured when a Roanoke County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>vehicle that he was operating collided with a vehicle operated by Brian D. Layman.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">At the time of the accident, Layman was insured under a policy issued by Rockingham Casualty Company that provided liability coverage limits of $100,000 for each person injured. At the same time, Catron was the named insured under a policy issued by appellee State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company that provided uninsured motorist coverage limits of $100,000 for each person.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">At the time, Roanoke County was self-insured for automobile Lability and uninsured motorist coverage purposes, and also for workers\u2019 compensation purposes. The County\u2019s limit of liability for uninsured motorist coverage was $25,000 for each person.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The County has paid in excess of $222,325 in benefits to Catron pursuant to its obligations under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for injuries he sustained in the accident. The County continues to be liable for benefits under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Rockingham tendered a check to Catron in the amount of $100,000, its policy limits. The County claims entitlement to those proceeds as a result of its payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">In July 1994, Catron filed the present motion for declaratory judgment naming State Farm, Layman, the County, and Rockingham as defendants. Asserting he has incurred medical expenses and lost wages in excess of $125,000, plaintiff asked the court to declare that State Farm has the obligation to pay him $25,000 based on the applicable priority of underinsured coverage in the case. State Farm denied that it owed the plaintiff any insurance benefits under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The pleadings and stipulation presented a pure question of law and, upon consideration of argument of counsel, the trial court ruled against the plaintiff. The court held that State Farm\u2019s uninsured/ underinsured motorist coverage was primary coverage and that it owed no payment to the plaintiff. The court also held that the self-insured uninsured/underinsured motorist benefit provided by the County was secondary coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">The plaintiff appeals. The County, although nominally an appellee, supports the plaintiff\u2019s position on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">We shall summarize the statutes pertinent to this controversy. The uninsured motorist statute requires a motor vehicle liability policy to provide at least $25,000 for each person in uninsured motorist coverage through provisions that \u201calso obligate the insurer to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>payment for bodily injury . . . caused by the operation or use of an underinsured motor vehicle to the extent the vehicle is underinsured, as defined in subsection B of this section.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Subsection B states that a motor vehicle is \u201cunderinsured\u201d if \u201cthe total amount of bodily injury . . . coverage applicable to the operation or use of the motor vehicle and available for payment for such bodily injury ... is less than the total amount of uninsured motorist coverage afforded any person injured as a result of the operation or use of the vehicle.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The same subsection provides that \u201cavailable for payment\u201d means \u201cthe amount of liability insurance coverage applicable to the claim of the injured person for bodily injury . . . reduced by the payment of any other claims arising out of the same occurrence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">A focus of this appeal is upon the following provisions of subsection (B).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cIf an injured person is entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under more than one policy, the following order of priority of policies applies and any amount available for payment shall be credited against such policies in the following order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">1. The policy covering a motor vehicle occupied by the injured person at the time of the accident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">2. The policy covering a motor vehicle not involved in the accident under which the injured person is a named insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">3. The policy covering a motor vehicle not involved in the accident under which the injured person is an insured other than a named insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">Where there is more than one insurer providing coverage under one of the payment priorities set forth, their liability shall be proportioned as to their respective underinsured motorist coverages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">The appeal also focuses on Code \u00a7 46.2-368 (formerly \u00a7 46.1-395), codified among the motor vehicle laws. This statute deals with the discretionary power of the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue certificates of self-insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>It specifies the certificate must provide protection against an uninsured or underinsured motorist \u201cto the extent required by \u00a7 38.2-2206.\u201d It also provides that \u201cprotection against the uninsured or underinsured motorist required under this section . . . shall be secondary coverage to any other valid and collectible insurance providing the same- protection which is available to any person otherwise entitled to assert a claim to such protection by virtue of this section.\u201d \u00a7 46.2-368(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">On appeal, the plaintiff contends the trial court erred in ruling that the credit priorities of \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) were reversed by the \u201csecondary\u201d language of \u00a7 46.2-368(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The plaintiff argues he met the definition of \u201cunderinsured\u201d in 2206(B). He says the amount of coverage \u201cavailable for payment\u201d is $100,000, the full amount of the bodily injury liability coverage of Layman\u2019s Rockingham policy. This sum is less than the total amount of uninsured motorist coverage afforded him, which is $125,000 (the County\u2019s $25,000 uninsured coverage plus the plaintiff\u2019s $100,000 State Farm policy in which he was the named insured). Consequently, he argues, he was underinsured in the amount of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Continuing, the plaintiff argues that the \u201corder of priorities for crediting an amount available for payment against the underinsured coverage is controlled by \u00a7 38.2-2206(B)(l).\u201d He contends that the statutory language establishes the following order of credits: (1) $25,000 uninsured coverage from the County (the policy covering the vehicle occupied by the injured person at the time of the accident); and (2) $100,000 uninsured coverage from plaintiff\u2019s State Farm policy (the policy covering a vehicle not involved in the accident but under which the injured person is a named insured).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Therefore, the plaintiff contends, \u201c[t]he entire $25,000 of Roanoke County\u2019s coverage is covered by the $100,000 credit. The remaining $75,000 of that $100,000 credit covers $75,000 of State Farm\u2019s $100,000.\u201d Thus, plaintiff concludes, $25,000 remains and State Farm will owe that amount if his personal injury claim is tried or settled for an amount equal to or more than $125,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">State Farm, on the other hand, argues the trial court correctly ruled that its coverage was primary and the County\u2019s coverage was secondary. Because the municipal self-insurance is secondary, State Farm argues, State Farm\u2019s coverage assumes the \u201cposition of primary coverage in the UIM calculation,\u201d meaning that \u201cState Farm\u2019s policy is first in line for payment and also for the credit generated by the available liability coverage.\u201d Thus, it contends, \u201cthat credit cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ers all of State Farm\u2019s potential coverage, and State Farm owes nothing in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\">State Farm argues \u201cthe legislature meant what it said\u201d in Code \u00a7 46.2-368(B) \u201cwhen it made a self-insurer \u2018secondary\u2019 for purposes of coverage analysis under the Virginia UM/UIM statute, Code \u00a7 38.2-2206.\u201d Embarking on what it calls a \u201cchronological review of the relevant statutory and decisional history\u201d of the subject, State Farm urges there is \u201cno doubt\u201d that the County, \u201cas a UM/UIM self-insurer, is subject to the requirements of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 in all respects except that its coverage is \u2018secondary\u2019 for all purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">State Farm argues that, since 1972, \u201cformer Code \u00a7 46.1-395 and current Code \u00a7 46.2-368 have required self-insurers to provide UM coverage, but have placed self-insurers categorically in the \u2018secondary\u2019 position for purposes of UM coverage priority.\u201d State Farm contends that, in 1988, \u201csixteen years after self-insurers first became obligated to provide \u2018secondary\u2019 UM coverage, Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 was amended to create a single, statutory priority rule for multiple applicable UIM coverages \u2014 a priority that governs the order in which the coverages line up both for payment and for allocation of the \u2018credit\u2019 for available liability coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Continuing, State Farm urges that, regarding \u201ccoverage on the vehicle involved in the accident, self-insured coverage ordinarily would be first priority UIM coverage for purposes of payment and allocation of the credit under Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. The categorical command of Code \u00a7 46.2-368, however, makes the self-insured coverage \u2018secondary\u2019 to all other coverages, meaning that it comes last for purposes of payment and allocation of the credit. This is the conclusion that the trial court correctly reached in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Finally, State Farm contends the plaintiff\u2019s argument rests on a \u201cmisreading\u201d of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. It claims the General Assembly did not intend \u201cto make self-insurers secondary for some purposes but primary for other purposes under Code \u00a7 38.2-2206.\u201d It argues \u201cCode \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) establishes a single order of priority among applicable UIM coverages and endows that order of priority with two consequences: it governs both the order in which UIM coverage pay[s] and the order in which available liability insurance is credited. Code \u00a7 46.2-368 make[s] self-insured UM/UIM coverages \u2018secondary\u2019 to all other coverages for all purposes, without distinction.\u201d We do not agree with State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">We have already determined \u201cthe language of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) to be clear and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Dairyland Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sylva, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>242 Va. 191, 195, 409 S.E.2d 127, 129 (1991). And, when statutory language is clear and unambiguous, \u201cthere is no need for construction by the court; the plain meaning and intent of the enactment will be given it.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). Unless a literal interpretation of statutory language will amount to a manifest absurdity, courts should not adopt a construction that, in effect, holds the legislature did not mean what it actually has expressed. <em>Sylva, </em>242 Va. at 194, 409 S.E.2d at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">We shall read \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) literally, for the moment without regard to \u00a7 46.2-368. The applicable \u201corder of priority of policies\u201d dictates that the sum available for \u201cpayment\u201d shall be \u201ccredited\u201d against the several policies in \u201cthe following order of priority:\u201d first, the County\u2019s $25,000, from the policy covering the County motor vehicle occupied by the plaintiff at the time of the accident (there is no dispute that a self-insurer\u2019s certificate of insurance is equivalent to an insurance \u201cpolicy\u201d for purposes of this controversy); second, State Farm\u2019s $100,000, from the policy covering a motor vehicle not involved in the accident under which the plaintiff was the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-368(B), however, provides that the \u201cprotection against the uninsured or underinsured motorist required under this section . . . shall be secondary coverage to any other valid and collectible insurance providing the same protection which is available to any person otherwise entitled to assert a claim to such protection by virtue of this section.\u201d We hold that this language does not alter or reverse the credit priorities, as opposed to the payment priorities, set forth in \u00a7 38.2-2206(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The General Assembly, in what is now \u00a7 46.2-368, has recognized \u201ca distinction in the financial implications of recovery from self-insurers and recovery from commercial insurers.\u201d <em>William </em>v. <em>City of Newport News, </em>240 Va. 425, 432, 397 S.E.2d 813, 817 (1990). The legislature has placed self-insurers in a favored status. For example, the proviso in Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(1) requires a self-insurer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation payments to be set off against any judgment for damages awarded pursuant to the statute for personal injuries resulting from the industrial accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Consistent with the foregoing legislative policy, the General Assembly has not specified that the \u201csecondary\u201d language in 368 modifies the credit priority design of 2206. Nowhere in 368 are the words \u201ccredit\u201d or \u201cpriority\u201d used. Surely, if the General Assembly had intended 368 to modify the credit priorities of 2206, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>have included language to effect that purpose, so that a self-insurer always would be prohibited from assuming a first priority credit position. This has not been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">As the plaintiff points out, State Farm seeks a reading of the statutes \u201cthat will push its $100,000 credit ahead of Roanoke County\u2019s $25,000 credit, so that its underinsurance coverage will be totally set off by the credit, and the County will therefore bear the entire burden of the underinsurance coverage .... [T]his would totally defeat the legislative intent behind \u00a7 46.2-368(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Finally, State Farm relies heavily on <em>Hackett </em>v. <em>Arlington County, </em>247 Va. 41, 439 S.E.2d 348 (1994), a case decided before the 1995 amendment to \u00a7 46.2-368(B) that obligated self-insurers to provide underinsured motorist coverage. <em>See </em>Acts 1995, ch. 85. There, we stated: \u201cThe sole question presented in this appeal is whether Arlington County, a self-insured entity, is required to provide underinsurance coverage to an employee.\u201d 247 Va. at 42, 439 S.E.2d at 348. Interpreting \u00a7 46.2-368(B) with \u00a7 38.2-2206, we answered the query in the affirmative. <em>Hackett </em>is not controlling here. The issues in the two cases are entirely different.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Consequently, we hold that the trial court erred in ruling \u00a7 46.2-368(B) modified the credit priorities of \u00a7 38.2-2206. We will reverse the judgment below and enter final judgment here in favor of the plaintiff. We will declare that Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) controls the coverage credit priorities in this case and that State Farm is liable to the plaintiff for $25,000 if there is a settlement or judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s personal injury claim equal to or in excess of $125,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
