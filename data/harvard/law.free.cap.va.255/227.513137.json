Lynch, Jr., in Fairfax County for the improvement of Interstate Route 95. The 75 acres was subject to a deed of trust then held by Dominion National Bank of Virginia, later by First Union Bank of Virginia, Dominion Bank\u2019s successor in title. Both banks are referred to herein as the lienholder. The deed of trust secured the payment of Lynch\u2019s $3,500,000 obligation to the bank and in pertinent part provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">Borrower or Grantor shall appear in and prosecute any such [condemnation] action or proceeding unless otherwise directed by Lender in writing. . . . The proceeds of any award, payment or claim for damages ... in connection with any condemnation or other taking, whether direct or indirect ... are hereby assigned to and shall be paid to Lender[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">. . . Unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing, any application of proceeds to principal shall not extend or postpone the due date of the [monthly installment payments of principal and interest] or change the amount of such installments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Because the Commissioner desired immediate possession of the 9.270 acres and his evaluation of the land taken was $1,016,755, he deposited that sum with the clerk of the circuit court under the provisions of Code \u00a7 33.1-120.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commissioner also executed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>recorded a certificate of take naming Lynch as the owner of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Lynch then took advantage of Code \u00a7 33.1-124, which authorized him to petition the court to order the withdrawal of these funds. His petition alleged that he and Dominion Bank were the only parties entitled to receive the funds and that the bank had agreed to release its lien on the property taken \u201cthrough a Deed of Partial Release.\u201d In a withdrawal order requested by Lynch, the court ordered the deposited funds to be paid to Lynch in care of his attorney, who was directed to \u201cuse such funds as are necessary ... to satisfy the Deeds of Trust . . . currently owing on the property.\u201d The order also provided that if the award was less than the deposited funds, judgment for the excess amount of the deposit shall be entered for the Commissioner against \u201cany person [who] has been paid any greater sum than that to which he is entitled as determined by the award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Upon demand by the lienholder, Lynch endorsed the clerk\u2019s November 26, 1990, check of $1,016,755, \u201c[p]ay to order of Dominion Bank for credit to account of Edwin W. Lynch, Jr.\u201d The proceeds of the check were applied by the lienholder in partial discharge of the obligation secured by its deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In December 1991, the Commissioner filed a condemnation petition naming Lynch as the only defendant. Lynch filed an answer and grounds of defense in which he asserted that the offer to purchase \u201cwas grossly inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Following a trial before a condemnation commission, the commission fixed the value of the land taken at $740,000 with no damages to the residue. Over Lynch\u2019s objection, the court confirmed the commission\u2019s report and entered judgment against Lynch for $276,755, the difference between the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award. We awarded Lynch an appeal, reversed the judgment, and remanded the case for a new trial because of errors in the exclusion of certain evidence. <em>Lynch v. Commonwealth Transp. Comm\u2019r, </em>247 Va. 388, 394, 442 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">At the new trial, a different condemnation commission fixed the value of the land taken at $451,000 with no damages to the residue. The court confirmed the commissioners\u2019 report but retained jurisdiction to resolve a dispute concerning the identity of the \u201cperson, firm or corporation (if any) which must refund the excess [of $565,755 representing the amount by which the deposit exceeded the commissioners\u2019 award] and against which judgment should be entered pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 33.1-128.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>At the same time, the court ordered the lienholder to be joined as a party to the action \u201cfor the purpose of determining [the lien-holder\u2019s] liability to return excess condemnation proceeds pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 33.1-128.\u201d Following argument and submission of memoranda, in a written opinion, Judge Richard J. Jamborsky ruled that since Lynch had withdrawn the amount of the deposit, he, not the lienholder, became liable to the Commissioner for the repayment of the excess under the provisions of Code \u00a7 33.1-128. Later, Judge F. Bruce Bach entered an order in conformity with Judge Jamborsky\u2019s opinion. Lynch appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Code \u00a7 33.1-128 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">In the event of an award in a condemnation proceeding being of a lesser amount than that deposited with the court, the Commissioner shall recover the amount of such excess and, if <em>any person has been paid </em>a greater sum than that to which he is entitled as determined by the award, judgment shall be entered for the Commissioner against such person for the amount of such excess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Well-settled rules of statutory interpretation guide us in determining whether Lynch is liable for payment of the excess deposit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">If language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction by the court; the plain meaning and intent of the enactment will be given it. <em>School Board of Chesterfield County v. School Board of the City of Richmond, </em>219 Va. 244, 250, 247 S.E.2d 380, 384 (1978). When an enactment is clear and unequivocal, general rules of construction of statutes of doubtful meaning do not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 250-51, 247 S.E.2d at 384. Therefore, when the language of an enactment is free from ambiguity, resort to legislative history and extrinsic facts is not permitted because we take the words as written to determine their meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-9\"><em>Brown v. Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Lynch contends that there is no ambiguity in the language of the quoted portion of Code \u00a7 33.1-128 and that the withdrawal order \u201ctracks\u201d this language. We agree. Therefore, under the principles articulated in <em>Brown, </em>we do not consider Lynch\u2019s extended discussion of (1) whether he \u201creceived\u201d the proceeds of the check, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>(2) the differing statutory language governing eminent domain proceedings which expressly refers to an \u201cowner\u201d and the statute under consideration which refers to \u201cany person [who] has been paid.\u201d We simply apply the statute and order as written and determine whether Lynch \u201chas been paid\u201d the deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The Commissioner and the lienholder maintain that Lynch was paid because he received the deposit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lynch responds that he has not been \u201cpaid\u201d within the meaning of the statute and order for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">First, Lynch asserts he was not \u201cpaid\u201d because in the deed of trust he assigned the \u201cdeposit\u201d to the lienholder. We will assume, but not decide, that Lynch is correct in his contention that the earlier-quoted language of the deed of trust encompassed an alleged assignment of any deposit as well as any later award in a condemnation action. However, Lynch also reasons that this \u201cassignment operates as a complete divestiture of all rights from the assignor and vests those rights in the assignee.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The deed of trust provided that Lynch \u201cshall appear in and prosecute any such [condemnation] action or proceeding unless otherwise directed by Lender in writing.\u201d The lienholder never directed \u201cotherwise,\u201d and, in fact, Lynch did \u201cappear in and prosecute\u201d the action. His \u201cprosecution\u201d included his filing a petition to withdraw the deposit. Indeed, at Lynch\u2019s request the court ordered the deposit \u201cdisburse[d]\u201d to him. Thus, the alleged assignment did not divest Lynch of all rights in the deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Next, Lynch argues that he was not \u201cpaid\u201d any money. He reasons that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">[although the Clerk\u2019s check was made payable to him, [he] had no power to cash the check and no control or discretion as to how to apply the proceeds. It must be remembered that pursuant to the Payment Order ... the check was disbursed in care of Lynch\u2019s attorney, who was ordered to \u201cuse such funds as are necessary, if any, to satisfy or partially satisfy the Deeds of Trust . . . currently owing on the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Lynch concludes that because the withdrawal order required his counsel to use the funds to satisfy the lienholder\u2019s deed of trust, he was \u201ca mere conduit whose only role was to endorse the check \u2014 the real payee was the [lienholder].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">If the language of the deed of trust gave Lynch no right to these proceeds, as he apparently contends, then he need not have petitioned for an early withdrawal and thus subjected himself to possible liability for a refund of the excess. Moreover, if the lienholder exercised its right under the deed of trust to require Lynch to petition for such withdrawal, as he contends, then on his motion, the court could have protected him from liability for payment of any possible excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Lynch was the payee of the check and the order only required his attorney to \u201cuse such funds as are necessary, if any, to satisfy or partially satisfy\u201d Lynch\u2019s deed of trust. The attorney could have negotiated with the lienholder for a proration of the deposit between Lynch and the lienholder, based on the value of the property taken in relation to the residue of the land still covered by the deed of trust. And, if they could not agree, under the provisions of Code \u00a7 33.1-124, Lynch could have petitioned the court for a hearing to resolve this issue and to give him appropriate protection against liability for a return of any excess deposit ultimately paid by Lynch to the lienholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 33.1-124 states that \u201cif the record in the proceeding discloses any . . . dispute as to the persons entitled to such distribution [of the deposit] or to any interest or share therein, the court shall direct such proceedings as are provided by [Code] \u00a7 25-46.28 for the distribution of awards.\u201d Code \u00a7 25-46.28 provides in part that \u201c[i]f it appears to the court that there exists a controversy among claimants to the fund . . ., the court shall enter an order setting a time for hearing the case and determining the rights and claims of all persons entitled to the fund or to any interest or share therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">These statutory provisions, coupled with Rule 3:9A, authorized Lynch to petition the court to join the lienholder as a party and petition the court either to order the check made payable to the lienholder or make specific provisions for the lienholder\u2019s liability for refund of any excess withdrawal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lynch filed no such petition; in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>fact, he simply requested that the court enter the withdrawal order which imposed liability for the excess upon anyone to whom the excess was \u201cpaid.\u201d And we are of opinion that under the circumstances of this case, Lynch was the person who was \u201cpaid\u201d within the meaning of the statute and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court correctly imposed liability upon Lynch for payment of such excess. Accordingly, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-11\"> Code \u00a7 33.1-120 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he Commissioner shall pay ... to the clerk . . . such sum as [the Commissioner] shall estimate to be the fair value of the land taken . . . before entering upon, or taking possession of, such land [prior to filing a condemnation proceeding].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-10\"> On appeal, the Commissioner contends that the lienholder was also \u201cpaid\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We do not consider the Commissioner\u2019s argument that the lienholder thus became jointly and severally liable with Lynch to the Commissioner for the excess deposit. The record does not indicate that this argument was asserted in the trial court, Rule 5:25, and the Commissioner did not assign cross-error to the action of the court in entering judgment solely against Lynch, Rule 5:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\"> As pertinent, Rule 3:9A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">A person who is subject to service of process may be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
