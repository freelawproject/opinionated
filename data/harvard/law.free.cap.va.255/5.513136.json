(A&amp;N) under an assignment of lease to A&amp;N. Thiab and A&amp;N were the named insureds in the policy, and K&amp;W was listed as an additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Thiab and A&amp;N used the building for the operation of a restaurant known as \u201cMixers.\u201d On April 3, 1994, the building and its contents were destroyed by fire. K&amp;W made claim against Merchants for the loss of the building. However, Merchants discovered evidence that the fire had been set by or at the direction of Thiab or A&amp;N, or both of them, and that one or both had intentionally misrepresented and concealed material facts during the investigation into the cause of the fire. Relying upon a fraud provision and a dishonest act exclusion in its policy, Merchants denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">On January 4, 1995, K&amp;W filed a motion for judgment against Merchants seeking recovery of $208,000, the face amount of the policy, plus the sum of $17,446.77, \u201cwhich represents lost rent.\u201d As an affirmative defense, Merchants alleged that \u201cAhmad Thiab and/or A and N Food, Inc.\u201d had engaged in \u201cfraudulent conduct\u201d by deliberately setting the fire and had \u201ccommitted concealment\u201d and \u201cmade material misrepresentations,\u201d all in violation of the terms of the policy \u201cso as to render the policy null and void as to all insureds,\u201d even an insured who is \u201cinnocent of any wrongdoing.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">K&amp;W filed \u00e1 motion for summary judgment, asserting that there was \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and that it was \u201centitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Following argument, the trial court denied the motion, accepting Merchants\u2019 interpretation of the policy that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-9\">any act of Ahmad Thiab and/or A and N Food, Incorporated which violates the \u201cconcealment, misrepresentation or fraud\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>provision or falls within the scope of the \u201cdishonest or criminal act\u201d exclusion contained in the policy at issue will void any coverage to which [K&amp;W] might otherwise be entitled, irrespective of whether [K&amp;W] was involved to any extent in the commission of such act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that the only issues that should be submitted to the jury were \u201cwhether the fire was set by or at the direction of A and N Food, Inc. and/or Ahmad Thiab, and whether A and N Food, Inc. and/or Ahmad Thiab made material misrepresentations to [Merchants] during the course of its investigation of this fire loss.\u201d The parties also agreed that these issues would be submitted to the jury in a special verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The jury found that the fire had been set by or at the direction of Thiab and a representative of A&amp;N and that Thiab and a representative of A&amp;N had made material misrepresentations to Merchants. Then, consistent with its prior ruling, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Merchants, and we awarded K&amp;W this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">As noted previously, Thiab and A&amp;N were the named insureds in Merchants\u2019 policy and K&amp;W was listed as an additional insured. The policy states that \u201c[t]hroughout this policy the words \u2018you\u2019 and \u2018your\u2019 refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations\u201d and the words \u201c \u2018we,\u2019 \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018our\u2019 refer to the Company providing this insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The fraud provision of the policy, relied upon by Merchants when it denied coverage for K&amp;W\u2019s claim, is found in the part of the policy related to commercial property coverage. In pertinent part, the provision reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">This Coverage Part is void in any case of fraud by you as it relates to this Coverage Part at any time. It is also void if you or any other insured, at any time, intentionally conceal or misrepresent a material fact ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">The dishonest act exclusion of the policy, also relied upon by Merchants when it denied coverage for K&amp;W\u2019s claim, reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>h. Dishonest or criminal act by you, any of your partners, employees, directors, trustees, authorized representatives or anyone to whom you entrust the property for any purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Citing <em>Rockingham Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hummel, </em>219 Va. 803, 250 S.E.2d 774 (1979), K&amp;W argues that when, as here, the interests of coinsureds are severable, an innocent insured is not barred from recovery by the wrongdoing of another insured over whom the innocent insured exercises no control. In <em>Hummel, </em>the insured property was owned by husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. The property was destroyed by fire and the insurer paid the insureds the amount of the loss. The insurer later discovered that the husband had intentionally burned the property and sought to recover the amount it had paid. The wife claimed she was entitled to retain a share of the insurance proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The insurance policy covering the property named both the husband and the wife as the \u201cNamed Insured\u201d and provided that the policy would be void \u201cin case of any fraud ... by the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804, 250 S.E.2d at 775. We held that because the husband and wife\u2019s legal interest in the insured property was joint and not sever-able, the wife\u2019s claim was subject to the general rule that \u201c[wjhen the interests of the insureds are deemed joint and nonseparable, . . . the innocent insured may not recover under the policy following a fraudulent act on the part of the other coinsured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 805, 250 S.E.2d at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">It follows from this holding, K&amp;W argues, that because it had no joint interest with either A&amp;N or Thiab and was innocent of any wrongdoing, it was entitled to recover for its loss. However, we made an additional holding in <em>Hummel, </em>a holding with dispositive effect here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">Furthermore, the form of the insurance contract was joint; the \u201cNamed Insured\u201d was [the husband and the wife]. Thus under the policy and as the \u201cinsured\u201d, each spouse had ... the joint duty to refrain from defrauding the insurer. If either spouse violated [this duty], the breach was chargeable to the \u201cNamed Insured\u201d preventing either spouse from recovering any amount under the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 806, 250 S.E.2d at <em>776.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Hence, even absent a joint interest between insureds and notwithstanding that one of the insureds may be innocent of any wrongdoing, resort must be had to the form of the insurance contract to determine the rights and liabilities of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">At this point, it is necessary to resolve a dispute between the parties over whether the word \u201cyou,\u201d as used in the policy, refers only to the named insureds, Thiab and A&amp;N, or to all the insureds, including K&amp;W, which was listed as an additional insured. K&amp;W accuses Merchants of vacillating on the subject, saying at one point in the course of this proceeding that \u201cyou\u201d includes only the named insureds and at another point that it includes all the insureds, whether listed as named insureds or as an additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">To resolve the dispute, we will agree with K&amp;W that \u201cyou\u201d includes all the insureds. When so included, K&amp;W maintains, \u201cthere can be little doubt that [a] guarantee [contained in the policy] protects K&amp;W as an innocent insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Entitled \u201cControl of Property,\u201d this \u201cguarantee\u201d provision is found in the part of the policy relating to commercial property coverage. The provision reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">Any act or neglect of any person other than you beyond your direction or control will not affect this insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">After quoting this language, K&amp;W concludes that \u201can innocent insured is not its co-insured\u2019s keeper, and if a co-insured acts improperly \u2014 outside the innocent insured\u2019s direction or control \u2014 such misconduct \u2018will not affect this insurance\u2019 with respect to the innocent insured.\u201d If the Control of Property provision is not so interpreted, K&amp;W contends, there is ambiguity concerning \u201cthe question of whether the fraud clause or dishonest acts exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>negate[s] coverage for all insureds based upon the acts of any coinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">However, to reach the conclusion K&amp;W argues for, one must read the word \u201cyou,\u201d as used in the Control of Property provision, as though K&amp;W were the only insured, resulting in this reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">Any act or neglect of any person other than K&amp;W beyond K&amp;W\u2019s direction or control will not affect this insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Under this version, since the act or neglect in question was attributed to Thiab and A&amp;N, a person or entity other than K&amp;W beyond K&amp;W\u2019s direction or control, the insurance provided by Merchants\u2019 policy would not be affected. However, this is an impermissible reading because it ignores the indisputable fact that there are other insureds under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">With \u201cyou\u201d interpreted as including K&amp;W, the only proper reading of the Control of Property provision is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">Any act or neglect of any person other than Thiab, A&amp;N, or K&amp;W beyond Thiab, A&amp;N, or K&amp;W\u2019s direction or control will not affect this insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">Under this reading, since the act or neglect in question was not attributed to a person or entity other than Thiab, A&amp;N, or K&amp;W, the Control of Property provision simply does not apply, and, contrary to K&amp;W\u2019s contention, there is no ambiguity concerning \u201cthe question of whether the fraud clause or dishonest acts exclusion negate[s] coverage for all insureds based upon the acts of any coinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">Indeed, the reading we give the Control of Property provision is entirely consistent with the view that the fraud clause and dishonest acts exclusion negate coverage for all insureds based upon the acts of any coinsured. The fraud clause provides that coverage is void \u201cin any case of fraud by you\u201d or \u201cif you or any other insured . . . intentionally conceal or misrepresent a material fact.\u201d We read this language to mean that coverage will be void in the event K&amp;W or either of its coinsureds acted fraudulently or intentionally concealed or misrepresented a material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">The dishonest acts exclusion provides that the insurer \u201cwill not pay for loss or damage caused by ... [a d]ishonest or criminal act by you.\u201d We read this language to mean that the insurer will not pay for loss or damage in the event any one of the three insureds commits a dishonest or criminal act. This exclusion, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>contains additional language demonstrating the error of K&amp;W\u2019s position that an innocent insured is entitled to coverage notwithstanding the wrongdoing of others. Although a particular insured might be innocent of wrongdoing, the exclusion bars coverage for loss or damage caused by the dishonest or criminal act of that insured\u2019s \u201cpartners, employees, directors, trustees, authorized representatives or anyone to whom [that insured] entrusts] the property for any purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Similar to the situation in <em>Hummel, </em>the three insureds here had the joint duty to refrain from defrauding the insurer and committing dishonest or criminal acts. And, as in <em>Hummel, </em>if any one of the insureds violated that duty, \u201cthe breach was chargeable to the [other insureds] preventing [all the insureds] from recovering any amount under the policy.\u201d 219 Va. at 806, 250 S.E.2d at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">K&amp;W argues, however, that \u201c[e]ven if the policy language could be read unambiguously to support the insurer\u2019s restrictive interpretation, a clause barring an innocent insured from recovery based on occurrences fully outside his control runs afoul of Va. Code \u00a7 38.2-2105 and the public policy underlying that statute.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-2105, which prescribes standard language for inclusion in a fire insurance policy, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">This entire policy shall be void, if whether before or after a loss, the insured has wilfully concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance concerning this insurance- or the subject thereof, or the interest of the insured therein, or in case of any fraud or false swearing by the insured relating thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">K&amp;W says that \u201c[pjlainly, this language speaks in terms of actions by <em>the insured </em>\u2014 not any other possible insured \u2014 as the trigger for voiding coverage\u201d and that this \u201cis consistent with the concept that an innocent insured (who does not share a joint interest in property with the wrongdoer) should not lose coverage based on the unratified wrongdoing of a coinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">In response to an argument by Merchants that \u201cnothing in Va. Code \u00a7 38.2-2105 prevents \u2018the insured\u2019 as used in that section \u2018from being defined as all of the identified insureds,\u2019 \u201d K&amp;W submits that \u201c[t]o the contrary, basic rules of grammar reveal that \u2018the insured\u2019 is singular and \u2018all insureds\u2019 is plural.\u201d Furthermore, K&amp;W asserts, \u201c[o]ther courts have viewed \u2018the insured\u2019 in this context as referencing the individual wrongdoing insured and not all innocent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>co-insureds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\">We disagree with K&amp;W. With due deference to the other courts whose decisions K&amp;W cites, we do not think it is reasonable to read the term \u201cthe insured\u201d in Code \u00a7 38.2-2105 as encompassing only a wrongdoing insured. Had this been the General Assembly\u2019s intention, it could have expressed the intention merely by prescribing a standard provision stating that a policy shall be void <em>as to any insured </em>who engages in the proscribed conduct, thus insulating an innocent insured against a coinsured\u2019s wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">We are not at liberty to substitute the italicized language for the words the General Assembly actually used. And without such substitution, the fraud provision and the dishonest acts exclusion of Merchants\u2019 policy do not run afoul of Code \u00a7 38.2-2105 and the public policy underlying that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Finding no error in the judgment of the trial court, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-11\"> Merchants conceded below that it \u201cfound no evidence that K &amp; W was involved with or participated in the wrongful acts of Thiab and A &amp; N.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b30-10\"> K&amp;W also cites <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>170 Va. 312, 196 S.E. 641 (1938). There, the insurer denied coverage on the ground that the insured\u2019s 15-year-old daughter, acting as the insured\u2019s agent, deliberately set the fire. We affirmed a verdict in favor of the insured, holding there was no proof of either the incendiarism or the agency. <em>Id. </em>at 325, 196 S.E. at 647. We did recognize the rule that \u201cno fraudulent acts of an agent or of a third person, even though the incendiary be a relative, will void the policy unless the insured is implicated in the fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 196 S.E. at 647. However, <em>Carpenter </em>is inapposite. The case involved no policy provisions similar to those at issue here. Indeed, we said that if the insurer desired to avoid coverage for the willful or deliberate act of an agent, it should have included an express exception on the subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
