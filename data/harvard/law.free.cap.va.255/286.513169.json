Martin was injured when Hermond A. Mabry shot her four times using two pistols while the parties were at Mabry\u2019s residence. Martin notified State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Insurance Company (State Farm), Mabry\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance carrier, of the event. State Farm issued reservation of rights letters to Mabry and Martin, asserting that insurance coverage might not be available due to the intentional act exclusion in the homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">Martin filed a motion for judgment against Mabry seeking recovery of $125,000 for injuries resulting from the shooting. In her pleadings, Martin alleged that the shootings were the result of negligence on the part of Mabry. After Martin filed her lawsuit, State Farm sent a second reservation of rights letter to Mabry and a reservation of rights letter to counsel for Martin. State Farm retained an attorney to provide legal representation for Mabry.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">State Farm, represented by another attorney, filed a motion for declaratory judgment to determine whether the intentional act exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>sion in Mabry\u2019s policy applied to exclude coverage for Mabry\u2019s acts. Prior to resolution of the declaratory judgment proceeding, Mabry, Martin, and their attorneys agreed to the entry of a consent judgment against Mabry for $95,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Martin subsequently filed an answer in the declaratory judgment proceeding asserting that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precluded State Farm from litigating whether Mabry\u2019s acts were negligent or intentional. Martin maintained that entry of the consent order \u201con the pleadings,\u201d as recited in the order, established that Mabry\u2019s acts were negligent as alleged in the motion for judgment in the tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Following an <em>ore terms </em>hearing and post-trial memoranda, the trial court issued an opinion letter in which it determined that State Farm was estopped from litigating whether Mabry\u2019s actions in shooting Martin were negligent or intentional. The trial court based its opinion on \u201cthe public policy grounds expressed by the Virginia Supreme Court in <em>State Farm v. Wright, </em>173 Va. 261 (1939), and the estoppel effect of a consent judgment expressed by the Virginia Supreme Court in <em>Culpeper Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>168 Va. 379, 385 (1937).\u201d A final order was entered on February 26, 1997, declaring that Mabry was entitled to coverage under the State Farm Policy for the claims made against him by Martin, and that State Farm was obligated to pay the judgment rendered in the tort action in favor of Martin. We awarded State Farm an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In its appeal, State Farm argues that the trial court\u2019s decision improperly applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel to preclude State Farm from arguing in the declaratory judgment action that Mabry\u2019s actions were intentional. Mabry and Martin reply that entry of the consent judgment \u201con the pleadings\u201d collaterally estopped State Farm from relitigating whether Mabry negligently or intentionally fired the shots that injured Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We agree with State Farm that collateral estoppel is not applicable in this case. One of the elements of collateral estoppel is that the parties, or their privies, must be the same in both the prior and subsequent actions. <em>Angstadt v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co., </em>249 Va. 444, 446, 457 S.E.2d 86, 87 (1995). State Farm was not a party in the tort litigation; therefore, this element of collateral estoppel could only be met if the requisite privity existed between it and Mabry.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Privity requires that a party\u2019s interest be \u201cso identical\u201d with another \u201cthat he represents the same legal right.\u201d <em>Nero v. Ferris, </em>222 Va. 807, 813, 284 S.E.2d 828, 831 (1981). Whether privity exists \u201crequires a careful examination of the circumstances of each case.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Angstadt, </em>249 Va. at 447, 457 S.E.2d at 87. In this case, State Farm reserved its right to challenge coverage under the policy based on the nature of Mabry\u2019s acts. By so doing, State Farm established that its position diverged from that of its insured on this issue and that the interests of State Farm and Mabry with regard to coverage were adverse, not identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">This result was foreshadowed by our discussion in <em>Reisen </em>v. <em>Aetna Life and Casualty Co., </em>225 Va. 327, 302 S.E.2d 529 (1983). In <em>Reisen, </em>we held that a declaratory judgment proceeding to determine coverage under an insurance policy could be brought by an insurer while the underlying tort litigation was pending, even if the ultimate factual issue in determining coverage was also at issue in the tort litigation. In the course of the opinion, we stated that \u201cbecause of the likelihood that the insurer, after judgment in the tort action, would be entitled to litigate the very same coverage question it sought to raise before trial,\u201d the declaratory judgment proceeding declaring the parties\u2019 rights in advance was proper. <em>Id. </em>at 336, 302 S.E.2d at 534. This statement would be in error if the insurer was collaterally estopped from raising the factual issue addressed in the tort litigation in the subsequent proceeding determining coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Accordingly, because State Farm was not a party to the tort litigation nor was it in privity with Mabry regarding the nature of Mabry\u2019s acts, we conclude collateral estoppel does not apply to preclude State Farm from litigating that issue.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Accord, Alabama Farm Bureau Mut.

Co., </em>197 N.E. 75, 77 (Mass. 1935). <em>See generally, </em>Comment, <em>The Effect of Collateral Estoppel on the Assertion of Coverage Defenses, </em>69 Colum. L. Rev. 1459 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">We also conclude that none of the other forms of estoppel noted by the trial court operate here to preclude State Farm from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>pursuing its declaratory judgment proceeding. Under principles of estoppel and waiver, providing the insured a legal defense generally makes the insurer liable for amounts recovered against the insured because the insurer\u2019s actions indicate that the policy coverage applies, and, therefore, the insurer is estopped from subsequently seeking to avoid liability under the policy. <em>Cooper v. Employers Mut. Liability Ins. Co. of Wisconsin, </em>199 Va. 908, 916, 103 S.E.2d 210, 216 (1958); 14 George J. Couch, <em>Cyclopedia of Insurance Law </em>\u00a7 51:239 (Mark S. Rhodes ed., 2d ed. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">If an insurer provides a reservation of rights, however, the insurer \u201cis not deemed to have waived, nor be estopped to set up, the defense of lack of coverage\u201d because of its participation in the tort litigation. <em>Norman v. Ins. Co. of N. America, </em>218 Va. 718, 726, 239 S.E.2d 902, 907 (1978). As the trial court acknowledged, State Farm provided Mabry a defense under a reservation of its right to later assert its defenses to coverage under the policy, and, thus, these principles of estoppel and waiver are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Finally, the trial court referred to an \u201cestoppel\u201d based on its view that actions taken by State Farm in the conduct of the tort litigation provided the insurer with \u201cits day in court,\u201d and, therefore, State Farm was not entitled to another opportunity to try its case on the merits, citing <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>173 Va. 261, 3 S.E.2d 187 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">However, here State Farm did not have \u201cits day in court\u201d in the tort proceeding. <em>See Farm Bureau Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Hammer, 177 </em>F.2d 793, 799-800 (4th Cir. 1949). State Farm was not a party to the tort litigation and, therefore, could not independently assert its position on the nature of Mabry\u2019s acts in that proceeding. Nor could it assert its position in conjunction with providing a defense to its insured. The attorney employed by the insurer to defend the insured \u201cis bound by the same high standards which govern all attorneys, and owes the insured the same duty as if he were privately retained by the insured.\u201d <em>Norman, </em>218 Va. at 727, 239 S.E.2d at 907. To comply with this duty in the tort litigation, Mabry\u2019s attorney could not argue that Mabry\u2019s acts were intentional because such an argument could expose Mabry to punitive damages and would not be in his best interest. Thus, the declaratory judgment proceeding to determine the issue of policy coverage was State Farm\u2019s first opportunity to assert its coverage defense and to try its case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In the instant case, State Farm sent reservation of rights letters to its insured, Mabry, and to Martin when it was initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>informed of Martin\u2019s claim. Reservation of rights letters were again sent to Mabry and to Martin\u2019s counsel when the tort litigation was initiated. Under these circumstances, neither waiver, estoppel, nor collateral estoppel precluded State Farm from raising its coverage defense, specifically the question whether Mabry shot Martin intentionally or negligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\"> In <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America, </em>218 Va. 718, 725, 239 S.E.2d 902, 906 (1978), we <em>stated that the judgment entered </em>in <em>the tort </em>litigation holding the insured\u2019s actions to be intentional \u201cconstitutes a collateral estoppel\u201d of the insured\u2019s action against the insurer in which the insured asserted his actions were \u201caccidental.\u201d However, we did not examine the elements of collateral estoppel and specifically did not discuss privity. Accordingly, <em>Norman </em>does not provide binding precedent for the principle that collateral estoppel would apply to insurers in the circumstances of the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
