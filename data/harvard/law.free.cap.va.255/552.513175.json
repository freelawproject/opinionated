On January 10, 1995, Lynnette M. Jackson entered a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to a charge of misdemeanor concealment of merchandise, Code \u00a7 18.2-103, in the General District Court of the City of Hampton. That court found the evidence sufficient to convict, but refrained from entering a judgment of guilty and imposing sentence on condition that Jackson be on \u201cgood behavior,\u201d pay court costs, and not return to the store where the act of concealment occurred for one year. One year later and upon stipulation from the Commonwealth that Jackson had complied with these conditions, that court dismissed the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">On March 25, 1997, Jackson filed a petition in the Circuit Court of the City of Hampton seeking expungement under Code \u00a7 19.2-392.2 of the police and court records related to the concealment charge. In the petition, Jackson alleged that she \u201cwas innocent of any and all charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The Commonwealth did not file an answer, but appeared at the hearing on the petition, opposing it on the ground that Jackson was not \u201cinnocent\u201d as contemplated in the statement of policy governing expungement contained in Code \u00a7 19.2-392.1. The Commonwealth asserted that the general district court\u2019s determination that the evidence was sufficient to convict her precluded Jackson from asserting her innocence in the expungement proceeding. In support of its position, the Commonwealth relied upon <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 504, 507, 316 S.E.2d 741, 742-43 (1984), for the proposition that \u201c[t]he expungement statute applies to innocent persons, not those who are guilty.\u201d Alternately, the Commonwealth asserted that, under the holding in <em>Gregg, </em>the charge against Jackson was not \u201cotherwise dismissed\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-392.2(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In granting the petition for expungement, the circuit court distinguished <em>Gregg </em>on the ground that the defendant in that case had entered a plea of guilty to the charge subsequently dismissed following deferral of judgment, whereas Jackson had pled <em>nolo contendere. </em>The trial court\u2019s final order directed that the police and court records of Jackson\u2019s arrest on the concealment charge be expunged. We awarded the Commonwealth this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">On appeal, the Commonwealth reasserts the arguments it advanced in the circuit court. In response, Jackson asserts that the circuit court properly distinguished <em>Gregg </em>from her case based upon her entry of a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>rather than a guilty plea. Moreover, she asserts that, as a result of amendments to Code \u00a7 19.2-392.2 enacted subsequent to our decision in <em>Gregg, </em>this statute no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>longer restricts expungement to those dismissals involving innocent defendants. Specifically, Jackson relies upon the 1992 amendment to Code \u00a7 19.2-392.2(A)(2) to include charges dismissed \u201cby accord and satisfaction pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-151\u201d and the amendment of Code \u00a7 19.2-392.2(E) to include the provision that \u201cif the petitioner has no prior criminal record and the arrest was for a misdemeanor violation, the petitioner shall be entitled, in the absence of good cause shown to the contrary by the Commonwealth, to expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge.\u201d In short, Jackson argues that these amendments modify the applicability of <em>Gregg </em>and allow expungement in the case of a person convicted of a first-offense misdemeanor and in such cases shift the burden to the Commonwealth to show why the records should not be expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">We first consider whether the trial court properly distinguished <em>Gregg </em>on the ground that the defendant in that case entered a plea of guilty, whereas Jackson entered a plea of <em>nolo contendere. </em>Asserting that a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>is not a confession of guilt, Jackson contends that there has been no determination of guilt in her case, and she should be considered an \u201cinnocent person\u201d entitled to petition for expungement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We recognize that a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>is not a confession of guilt and has no effect beyond permitting the court to impose sentence in a particular case. <em>Roach </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>157 Va. 954, 959, 162 S.E. 50, 51 (1932). Nonetheless, by entering a plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>the defendant \u201cimplies a confession ... of the truth of the charge . . . [and] agrees that the court may consider him guilty\u201d for the purpose of imposing judgment and sentence. <em>Honaker </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 50, 53 (1869). Thus, while not an admission of guilt, neither is a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>a declaration of innocence equivalent to a plea of not guilty. <em>Roach, </em>157 Va. at 960, 162 S.E. at 52; <em>Honaker, </em>60 Va. (19 Gratt.) at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The difficulty with Jackson\u2019s position is that she views her plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>in isolation from the proceeding in which it was entered. The plea was not the sole basis for the general district court\u2019s action. That court did not merely accept the plea, but further determined that the evidence was sufficient to prove Jackson\u2019s guilt of the offense and then \u201cdeferred\u201d judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jackson agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>abide by the terms imposed by the court, and the charge was dismissed upon her satisfactory completion of those terms. In these respects, the present case is indistinguishable from <em>Gregg. </em>We hold that, based on the record of the criminal prosecution, Jackson is precluded from maintaining her innocence in the expungement proceeding because, as in <em>Gregg, </em>the record that would be expunged affirmatively establishes her guilt of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">We must now consider Jackson\u2019s contention that even if she is not an \u201cinnocent person\u201d under the rationale of <em>Gregg, </em>the subsequent amendments to Code \u00a7 19.2-392.2 have altered the further holding of that case that a dismissal following a deferral of judgment of guilt is not a case \u201cotherwise dismissed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 19.2-151 permits the trial court to dismiss <em>pending </em>criminal charges for assault and battery and other misdemeanors for which there is a civil remedy where the injured party acknowledges satisfaction of the civil wrong. Jackson asserts that such cases \u201cnearly always involve a guilty defendant, but may nevertheless be expunged\u201d under the 1992 amendment of Code \u00a7 19.2-392.2(A)(2). Thus, she contends that this amendment is evidence of the legislature\u2019s rejection of that part of <em>Gregg </em>which, in effect, restricted dismissals only to cases where the defendant was innocent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The addition of the reference to dismissals upon accord and satisfaction under Code \u00a7 19.2-151 is fully consistent with the rationale expressed in <em>Gregg </em>distinguishing dismissals following deferral of judgment from those cases \u201cotherwise dismissed\u201d as contemplated by the expungement statute. Under Code \u00a7 19.2-151, the dismissal takes place without a determination of guilt just as in the case of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>or other procedural dismissal. Accordingly, while it may be true that a defendant who provides redress for a civil wrong may actually have committed the concomitant criminal offense, the dismissal occurs without any determination of guilt or imposition of penalty by judicial authority. Thus, a dismissal under Code \u00a7 19.2-151 is of the same quality as those contemplated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>expungement statute at the time <em>Gregg </em>was decided, and the addition of such dismissals to the statute does not affect the continued viability of the rationale of that case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In sum, we hold that both principles of our decision in <em>Gregg </em>regarding the right to seek expungement remain in force. A person deferred from judgment following a determination that the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction is not \u201cinnocent\u201d of the offense regardless of the plea originally entered. Nor does a dismissal following satisfaction of the terms of that deferral render the case \u201cotherwise dismissed\u201d for purposes of expungement.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We will reverse the judgment of the trial court directing that the police and court records related to the charge against Jackson be expunged, and enter final judgment for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\"> The Commonwealth did not challenge the authority of the general district court to \u201cdefer\u201d judgment or assert the lack of such authority as a basis for opposing the expungement petition. Accordingly, we express no opinion as to whether the action of the general district court was proper. <em>But see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-303.2 (excluding larceny offenses from those eligible for deferral).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\"> Jackson concedes that she must first establish her entitlement to petition for expungement under subsection (A)(2) of \u00a7 19.2-392.2 before reaching the issue raised by the amendment of subsection (E). It is apparent on the record that Jackson could not qualify for the right to petition for expungement of this charge under any other provision of subsection (A) or (B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\"> Jackson further notes that prosecutions are often resolved upon a motion of <em>nolle prosequi </em>\u201cfor reasons other than the innocence of the defendants.\u201d However, the provision for expungement of records of a criminal charge resolved upon a motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>was in place at the time of our decision in <em>Gregg, </em>and, thus, has no bearing on our determination of the effect of the subsequent amendment to the statute on the continued viability of that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\"> Because we conclude that Jackson was not eligible to petition for expungement, we need not consider the effect of the amendment to Code \u00a7 19.2-392.2(E) on the burden of proof in expungement hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
