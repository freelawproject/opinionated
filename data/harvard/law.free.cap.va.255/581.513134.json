Because we find that the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\u201cincurred\u201d includes only those amounts that the insured would be legally obligated to pay, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">On April 17, 1995, Carroll Keith Bowers was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which he sustained injuries requiring medical treatment. At the time of the accident, Bowers was insured under an automobile insurance policy issued by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm). Under the medical payments provision of the policy, State Farm agreed to pay \u201con behalf of each injured person, medical expense benefits as a result of bodily injury caused by accident.\u201d The policy defines medical expense as \u201call reasonable and necessary expenses for medical. . . services . . . incurred within three years after the date of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Bowers was also insured under a health insurance plan through Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Virginia (Blue Cross). All the health-care providers that rendered services to Bowers as a result of the accident had signed contracts with Blue Cross agreeing to accept fees based upon a fee schedule setting forth the reasonable value of the services provided. According to a representative of Blue Cross, the fee schedule was based on a governmental study performed by the Health Care Financing Administration to determine the reasonableness of fees for various medical services. Under the agreement with Blue Cross, a participating health-care provider could collect only the amount established by the fee schedule plus any co-payment that the insured was required to pay. In other words, the agreements with Blue Cross prohibited providers from collecting as full payment for their services any more than the scheduled fee and required co-payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Following his accident, Bowers sought medical treatment from various health-care providers and then submitted claims to State Farm under the policy\u2019s medical payments provision. One such claim was for $1,586 for treatment received from a rehabilitation and therapy services company. However, due to an administrative error, the check that State Farm issued to Bowers was for $31,586 instead of $1,586. Upon realizing its mistake, State Farm contacted Bowers and requested that he return the $30,000 overpayment. Bowers informed State Farm that he had spent the entire overpayment and refused to repay the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>As a basis for his refusal to repay State Farm, Bowers asserted that, subsequent to the overpayment, he had incurred additional medical expenses that should be offset against the amount allegedly owed to State Farm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A dispute arose between Bowers and State Farm in regard to the amount that he was entitled to offset. Specifically, Bowers sought to offset the amounts that the health-care providers, absent agreements with Blue Cross, would have charged Bowers rather than the amounts that the providers accepted as full payment for their services under the Blue Cross fee schedule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Because of the dispute and Bowers\u2019 refusal to repay, State Farm filed an action for unjust enrichment against Bowers, seeking to recover the money it mistakenly paid to him. On October 25, 1996, the circuit court granted State Farm\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. Because Bowers\u2019 claimed offset would reduce only a portion of the overpayment, the court awarded State Farm the sum of $17,703.51, plus interest. Following a bench trial on January 29, 1997, the circuit court, in an order dated March 18, 1997, entered judgment against Bowers in \u201cthe total amount of $19,894.90 plus interest. . . , this amount representing the amount of the Partial Summary Judgment ($17,703.50) plus the sum of $2,191.40.\u201d In a letter opinion, the court reasoned that State Farm cannot benefit from the agreement between Blue Cross and the health-care providers and, thus, allowed Bowers to offset the full amount of the medical bills rather than the amounts accepted by the health-care providers as full payment. In other words, the court allowed Bowers to include in the offset the amounts that his health-care providers wrote off. The court also stated that \u201c[t]he fact that the medical provider and [Blue Cross] have negotiated a figure acceptable to both of them for services per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>formed does not set the standard of what is reasonable.\u201d State Farm appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In its assignments of error, State Farm raises three issues, all of which concern the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of the medical payments provision of the State Farm policy and the amount that the court allowed Bowers to offset against the overpayment. Specifically, State Farm asserts that the circuit court erred (1) in determining the amount of \u201cincurred\u201d medical expenses, (2) in deciding the \u201creasonable\u201d value of the medical services provided, and (3) in failing to reduce the amount of the offset because Bowers did not mitigate his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The first issue requires us to construe the term \u201cincurred\u201d as used in the definition of medical expense. As already noted, the State Farm policy defines medical expense as \u201call reasonable and necessary expenses for medical . . . services . . . incurred . . . .\u201d State Farm argues that the \u201cincurred\u201d expenses are those amounts which the health-care providers accepted as full payment for their services. Bowers, however, posits that he \u201cincurred\u201d the full amount of the bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">\u201cIf the language of an insurance policy is unambiguous, we will give the words their ordinary meaning and enforce the policy as written.\u201d <em>United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Webb, </em>235 Va. 655, 657, 369 S.E.2d 196, 198 (1988). We have previously construed the term \u201cincurred\u201d in a nearly identical medical payments provision of an automobile insurance policy as unambiguous and concluded that \u201c[a]n expense can only be \u2018incurred\u2019 . . . when one has paid it or become legally obligated to pay it.\u201d <em>Virginia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hodges, </em>238 Va. 692, 696, 385 S.E.2d 612, 614 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The evidence in the instant case was that Bowers would never be liable for any amount greater than that which the various health-care providers accepted as full payment for their services based on the Blue Cross fee schedule. Stated differently, the healthcare providers\u2019 agreements with Blue Cross prevented them from collecting more than the scheduled fee and any required co-payment. Therefore, we conclude that the medical expenses Bowers \u201cincurred\u201d were the amounts that the health-care providers accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>as full payment for their services rendered to him. Bowers has not paid nor is he \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d the amounts written off by the providers. <em>Id.; accord Irby v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>175 So.2d 9, 10 (La. Ct. App. 1965); <em>United Services Auto Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Schlang, </em>894 P.2d 967, 969 (Nev. 1995); <em>Lefebvre v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>259 A.2d 133, 135 (N.H. 1969); <em>Sanner v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>376 A.2d 180, 182 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1977); <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>189 S.E.2d 501, 504 (N.C. Ct. App. 1972).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To decide otherwise would be to grant Bowers a windfall because he would be receiving an amount greater than that which he would ever be legally obligated to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Turning to the second issue, we agree with the circuit court that the fact that medical providers and Blue Cross negotiate a fee schedule that is acceptable to them does not necessarily set the standard for what is a \u201creasonable\u201d medical expense. However, the only evidence in this case regarding reasonableness was from the Blue Cross representative. She testified that the Blue Cross fee schedule was based on a government study that determined the reasonableness of fees for various medical services. Thus, absent any evidence to the contrary, we must conclude in this case that the \u201creasonable\u201d expenses were those contained in the Blue Cross fee schedule and accepted as full payment by the health-care providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Finally, State Farm claims that Bowers failed to mitigate his damages by reducing the amount of medical expenses he \u201cincurred.\u201d State Farm argues that, because Bowers directed a rehabilitation and therapy clinic not to submit one of its bills to Blue Cross, the bill was never reduced in accord with the Blue Cross fee schedule even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>though the clinic was a participating provider with Blue Cross. However, we do not decide this issue because State Farm presented no evidence regarding the amount that the rehabilitation and therapy clinic would have accepted as full payment under the Blue Cross fee schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that the circuit court erred by granting an offset for any amount in excess of that which Bowers\u2019 health-care providers accepted as full payment for their services. The amount erroneously allowed by the circuit court is the amount that the health-care providers wrote off, $7,669.60. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court and enter judgment here for State Farm in the additional amount of $7,669.60, for a total judgment in the amount of $27,564.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-5\"> Following the $30,000 overpayment, Bowers submitted additional claims for medical expenses totaling $2,428 to State Farm for payment. State Farm gave Bowers credit against the $30,000 overpayment, reducing his obligation to $27,572.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\"> For example, an orthopedic clinic billed $3,770.50 for the services provided to Bowers. However, since the orthopedic clinic was a participating provider under the Blue Cross plan, it agreed to accept $1,157.25 as full payment for its services in accord with the Blue Cross fee schedule. Of that amount, Blue Cross paid the orthopedic clinic $861.70, ahd Bowers was to pay $295.55. (At the time of trial, Bowers had paid only $35 of the $295.55.) In other words, the orthopedic clinic wrote off $2,613.25 of its original bill. Bowers, nevertheless, claims that he should be able to offset the amount the orthopedic clinic billed rather than the amount that it accepted as full payment. Thus, Bowers wants to offset the full $3,770.50 rather than the reduced fee of $1,157.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Six health-care providers issued total bills of $10,677.10 but accepted lesser payments totaling $3,007.50, thereby collectively writing off $7,669.60 of the amounts originally billed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\"> The language at issue in <em>Hodges </em>was \u201call reasonable expenses incurred within one year from the date of accident for necessary medical . . . services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 385 S.E.2d at 612.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b606-6\"> In 1997, the General Assembly defined \u201cincurred\u201d in Code \u00a7 38.2-2201(A)(3), which addresses medical payments in liability insurance policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">An expense . . . shall be deemed to have been incurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">a.
