Williams, Jr. (Harvey), Jeffrey L. Harrison, and two of their friends were driving through a subdivision in Fairfax County in four separate cars. Har<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>vey\u2019s vehicle was second in the line, followed by Harrison\u2019s vehicle. Harvey and Harrison were driving at speeds of approximately 60-65 miles per hour and 45 miles per hour, respectively. The speed limit was 35 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Shortly after cresting a hill, Harvey braked suddenly, skidding in a straight line. When Harrison crested the hill and saw the brake lights and the smoke emanating from the tires of Harvey\u2019s car, he moved from the right lane into the center turn lane, hoping to avoid Harvey\u2019s car by passing it on the left side. But Harvey also turned his car to the left, in front of Harrison\u2019s car. Both cars ultimately entered the far left lane where Harrison\u2019s car struck Harvey\u2019s car. Harvey died from injuries sustained in the collision. Harrison was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Harvey R. Williams, Sr. (Williams), qualified as administrator of Harvey\u2019s estate and filed a wrongful death action against Harrison. After a two-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Harrison. Williams raises three issues on appeal: (1) whether the trial court erred in denying his motion in limine and allowing Harrison to assert the defense of contributory negligence, despite Harrison\u2019s manslaughter conviction; (2) whether the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on last clear chance; and (3) whether the trial court improperly limited the scope of Williams\u2019 cross-examination of Harrison. We consider the issues in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Prior to trial, Williams filed a motion in limine, asserting that the <em>ex turpi causa </em>doctrine should be applied to prevent Harrison from r\u00e1ising the defense of contributory negligence. Williams relied on a circuit court case in which the <em>ex turpi causa </em>doctrine was applied to preclude a defendant convicted of manslaughter from raising the contributory negligence defense. The trial court rejected the application of <em>ex turpi causa </em>concluding that the plea of contributory negligence did not involve the wrongdoing of the defendant but rather the wrongdoing of the plaintiff, and denied the motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">On appeal, Williams shifts the focus of his argument. He no longer relies primarily on the doctrine of <em>ex turpi causa, </em>but argues instead that this case is directly controlled by <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Warner\u2019s Administrator, </em>70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 570 (1877). According to Williams, <em>Matthews </em>held that a defendant convicted of murder or manslaughter cannot assert the defense of contributory negligence in a subsequent wrongful death action. Williams argues that, even if we do not adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>his interpretation of <em>Matthews, </em>we should not allow Harrison to assert contributory negligence based on the <em>ex turpi causa </em>doctrine that no one should profit by his illegal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We reject Williams\u2019 position. First, <em>Matthews </em>does not stand for the principle espoused by Williams and is not applicable to this case. Second, we find that <em>ex turpi causa </em>should not be extended to preclude the contributory negligence defense in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In <em>Matthews, </em>Franklin M. Matthews shot and killed Montesco Warner after Matthews received \u201cabusive language\u201d from Warner. 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) at 570. In the ensuing wrongful death action, this Court refused to allow Matthews to raise the defense of contributory negligence because Warner\u2019s death \u201cwas not caused by negligence; it was caused by violence \u2014 by a wrongful act... . [Wjhether it was murder in the first degree, or murder in the second degree, or manslaughter, it is still a wrongful act, which is actionable under the [wrongful death] statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578. Williams erroneously relies on this language for the principle that a manslaughter conviction precludes a contributory negligence defense in a subsequent wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The import of this language must be determined in light of the entire proceeding. Warner\u2019s wrongful death action was based on an intentional tort, not on negligence. The motion for judgment alleged that Matthews \u201cfeloniously, willfully and of his malice aforethought did discharge and shoot\u201d Warner. The language at issue and the holding of <em>Matthews, </em>therefore, simply reflect the familiar principle that contributory negligence is not a defense to an intentional tort. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 481 (1965). As we have stated, in the absence of primary negligence by the defendant, contributory negligence cannot exist. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co., </em>184 Va. 951, 956, 37 S.E.2d 29, 31 (1946); <em>Shumaker\u2019s Adm\u2019x v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co., </em>125 Va. 393, 401, 99 S.E. 739, 741 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The holding in <em>Matthews, </em>that an action for an intentional tort may not be defended with allegations of contributory negligence, is inapplicable to the instant case because Williams\u2019 action here was premised on a negligence theory. In his motion for judgment, Williams alleged that Harrison \u201chad a duty to operate his automobile without negligence,\u201d that he breached that duty by operating his vehicle \u201ccarelessly and negligently,\u201d and that this breach resulted in Harvey\u2019s death. Because Williams\u2019 wrongful death action is based on negligence, not an intentional tort, Harrison was entitled to raise the contributory negligence defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Finally, we decline Williams\u2019 invitation to preclude Harrison\u2019s use of the contributory negligence defense based on the policy that no one should profit from his illegal act, the <em>ex turpi causa </em>doctrine. Williams cites no appellate case from this Court or elsewhere which has extended this doctrine as Williams suggests. This lack of precedent is understandable. The defense of contributory negligence does not allow a defendant to profit from his misdeeds. We find no persuasive rationale for applying the doctrine of <em>ex turpi causa </em>to prohibit the defendant from raising the defense of contributory negligence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not err in denying Williams\u2019 motion in limine and allowing the defendant to raise contributory negligence as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">We next consider Williams\u2019 second assignment of error, that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on last clear chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Prior to our decision in <em>Greear v. Noland Co., </em>197 Va. 233, 89 S.E.2d 49 (1955), the law regarding the doctrine of last clear chance was \u201cin a state of hopeless confusion.\u201d <em>Pack v. Doe, </em>236 Va. 323, 328, 374 S.E.2d 22, 24-25 (1988). <em>Greear </em>clarified the doctrine. <em>Id. </em>The last clear chance doctrine applies in two situations: (1) where the injured party has negligently placed himself in a position of peril from which he is physically unable to remove himself (the helpless plaintiff); and (2) where the injured party has negligently placed himself in a position of peril from which he is physically able to remove himself, but he is unconscious of his peril (the inattentive plaintiff). <em>Id. </em>at 328-29, 374 S.E.2d at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In the first situation, the plaintiff must be \u201cphysically incapacitated\u201d to qualify as a helpless plaintiff, <em>Vanlandingham v. Vanlandingham, </em>212 Va. 856, 858, 188 S.E.2d 96, 98 (1972), and the defendant is liable if he saw or should have seen the helpless plaintiff. In the second situation, the defendant is liable only if he actually saw the inattentive plaintiff. In either case, however, liability is further predicated upon a showing that the defendant realized or ought to have realized the peril of the helpless or inattentive plaintiff in time to avert the accident by use of reasonable care. <em>Pack, </em>236 Va. at 329, 374 S.E.2d at 25; <em>Greear, </em>197 Va. at 238-39, 89 S.E.2d at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">A final principle applicable to the last clear chance doctrine, is that last clear chance does not supersede contributory negligence. A negligent plaintiff may recover only if his negligence was a remote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>rather than a proximate cause of the accident. If the opportunity to avoid the accident is as available to a plaintiff as to a defendant, then the plaintiff\u2019s negligence is a proximate cause rather than a remote cause, and bars recovery. <em>Cook v. Shoulder, </em>200 Va. 281, 285-86, 105 S.E.2d 860, 863 (1958). The plaintiff has the burden of establishing each element of the doctrine by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Pack, </em>236 Va. at 329, 374 S.E.2d at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In all but one case in which we have considered this issue since 1955, <em>Turner v. Railway Company, </em>205 Va. 691, 139 S.E.2d 68 (1964), we have declined to require the application of the doctrine, and we decline to do so here. Williams, like the other plaintiffs, has failed to provide evidence of each element necessary to invoke the last clear chance doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Williams argues that he was entitled to the last clear chance instruction under the second classification, the inattentive plaintiff, even though the jury instruction offered by Williams and denied by the trial court, instruction No. 13, described a helpless, not an inattentive, plaintiff. Nevertheless, Williams was not entitled to the instruction on either ground because the record contains no evidence showing that Harvey was physically incapacitated or that he was unaware of the peril in which he had placed himself. Further, the collision occurred after both Harrison and Harvey moved from the right lane, across the center turn lane, and into the left lane for oncoming traffic. Harvey\u2019s action in crossing into the left lane was a proximate cause of the accident, not a remote cause. Therefore, Williams was not entitled to the last clear chance instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">in.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Finally, Williams asserts that the trial court improperly limited his cross-examination of Harrison. However, Williams did not proffer the additional questions he intended to ask or the additional testimony he expected to elicit from further cross-examination, nor was he prevented from doing so by the trial court. <em>See Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 460, 464-65, 437 S.E.2d 563, 564-65 (1993). In the absence of a proffer, we will not consider this issue on appeal. <em>Clagett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 79, 95, 472 S.E.2d 263, 272, <em>cert. </em>denied, _ U.S. _, 117 S.Ct. 972 (1996); <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Virginia Electric and Power Co., </em>250 Va. 169, 173-74, 458 S.E.2d 282, 284-85 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">Accordingly, because the trial court did not err in allowing Harrison to raise the defense of contributory negligence or in refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>instruct the jury on last clear chance, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
