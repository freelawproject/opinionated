Butler filed a bill of complaint seeking partition or sale of the property, and the chancellor referred the case to a commissioner in chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Based on an appraisal received in evidence, the commissioner determined that the fair market value of the property is $803,000. The commissioner also found that the property is unique in nature because it is one of the last large undeveloped parcels on Huguenot Road in Chesterfield County. The commissioner noted that neither party had offered to purchase the other party\u2019s interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Orgain and Butler rejected two private offers to purchase the property. One offer was in the amount of the appraised value. The other offer, in the amount of $1,200,000, was acceptable to Butler but was rejected by Orgain because of certain attached conditions. After reviewing all the evidence, the commissioner filed a report recommending \u201cthat since the property ... is unique in . . . nature, it should be publicly marketed through a reputable commercial real estate brokerage firm agreed to by the parties.\u201d Neither party filed exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">The record does not show that any evidence was taken before the chancellor. After the chancellor heard argument of counsel concerning the commissioner\u2019s report, he rejected the commissioner\u2019s recommendation that the property be sold privately. The chancellor noted that the parties already had refused two private offers, and he ruled that a public auction was \u201cthe only alternative,\u201d due to the \u201clikelihood that the parties will be unable to agree upon any price or method for conducting a private sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>On appeal, Orgain argues that there was no evidence to support the chancellor\u2019s conclusion that the parties could not agree on the method and terms for a private sale of the property. Orgain further contends that the chancellor improperly rejected the commissioner\u2019s report, since the chancellor did not find that the report was unsupported by the evidence. Finally, Orgain asserts that the chancellor\u2019s ruling is contrary to the parties\u2019 best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In response, Butler argues that the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in ordering the property sold at public auction. Butler contends that the commissioner\u2019s recommendation was merely advisory and that once the chancellor concluded that an agreement between the parties was unlikely, \u201cit was absolutely within the [chancellor\u2019s] discretion to order the public sale.\u201d We disagree with Butler\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Although the report of a commissioner in chancery does not carry the weight of a jury verdict, Code \u00a7 8.01-610, the report should be sustained unless the chancellor concludes that the commissioner\u2019s findings are not supported by the evidence. <em>Yeskolski v. Crosby, </em>253 Va. 148, 152, 480 S.E.2d 474, 476 (1997); <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>227 Va. 569, 576-77, 318 S.E.2d 292, 296 (1984). This rule applies with particular force to findings of fact that are based on evidence taken in the commissioner\u2019s presence, but does not apply to pure conclusions of law contained in the commissioner\u2019s report. <em>Morris v. United Virginia Bank, </em>237 Va. 331, 337-38, 377 S.E.2d 611, 614 (1989); <em>Hill, </em>227 Va. at 577, 318 S.E.2d at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Code \u00a7 8.01-610 gives the chancellor substantial discretion in the manner of reviewing the commissioner\u2019s report. While the recommendations of the commissioner are merely advisory, <em>Hill, </em>227 Va. at 579, 318 S.E.2d at 298, the statute does not allow the chancellor to ignore the commissioner\u2019s report or portions thereof. <em>Gulfstream Bldg. Assocs. v. Britt, </em>239 Va. 178, 185, 387 S.E.2d 488, 492 (1990). The chancellor is required to consider the commissioner\u2019s factual findings. <em>See id.; Yeskolski, </em>253 Va. at 152-53, 480 S.E.2d at 476; <em>Hill, </em>227 Va. at 576-77, 318 S.E.2d at 296. When the chancellor has disapproved the commissioner\u2019s findings, we must review the evidence and determine whether, under a correct application of the law, the evidence supports the commissioner\u2019s findings or the conclusions of the chancellor. See <em>Firebaugh v. Hanback, </em>247 Va. 519, 525, 443 S.E.2d 134, 137 (1994); <em>Morris, </em>237 Va. at 338, 377 S.E.2d at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">In a partition suit, when partition of the subject property cannot be conveniently made, the chancellor may order a sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>entire property if such sale will promote the interests of the parties who are entitled to the subject property or its proceeds. Code \u00a7 8.01-83; <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>235 Va. 360, 364, 368 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1988); <em>Sensabaugh v. Sensabaugh, </em>232 Va. 250, 258, 349 S.E.2d 141, 146 (1986). A sale of property in a partition proceeding must be made in a manner that will bring the best price obtainable. <em>Austin v. Dobbins, </em>219 Va. 930, 934, 252 S.E.2d 588, 591 (1979); <em>see Schweitzer v. Stroh, </em>182 Va. 842, 848, 30 S.E.2d 689, 692 (1944); <em>Federal Land Bank </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>170 Va. 240, 242, 196 S.E. 627, 628 (1938). Thus, in the present case, the chancellor was required to order such method of sale as would obtain the highest price for the property, unless the evidence showed that the parties\u2019 conduct or other circumstances made use of that method unachievable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The commissioner\u2019s recommendation, that the highest price for the property could only be obtained through public marketing by a real estate broker, was based entirely on his factual finding that the property was unique in nature because of its size and location. The record does not show that the chancellor considered this factual finding. Moreover, the record contains no evidence to support the chancellor\u2019s conclusion that the parties likely would be \u201cunable to agree on any price or method for conducting a private sale.\u201d The record shows only that the chancellor assumed that the parties would be unable to agree on the method and terms of a private sale because they had not reached an agreement on any other matter during the course of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The chancellor reached this conclusion despite his acknowledgement that the method of sale recommended by the commissioner would be the most advantageous to the parties. Thus, the chancellor abused his discretion because he ordered a sale at public auction in the absence of any evidence that the parties\u2019 interests would be promoted by this method of sale, or that the parties were unable to agree on terms for listing the property through a licensed real estate broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Since the evidence does not support the chancellor\u2019s conclusions, we will reverse the chancellor\u2019s decree, enter final judgment here confirming the commissioner\u2019s report, and remand the case to the chancellor for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\n<em>Reversed, final judgment, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
