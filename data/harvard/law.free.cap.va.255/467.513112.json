An additional issue involves refusal of a proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">Appellant City of Virginia Beach instituted in 1994 eminent domain proceedings against two parcels of land owned by appellee Giant Square Shopping Center Company, a general partnership. The City took the property in connection with the widening of Independence Boulevard adjacent to the appellee\u2019s shopping center. The two actions were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">During the April 1997 trial, the court denied the City\u2019s motion to strike for cause prospective commissioner George R. C. McGuire. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the conclusion of the evidence, the court refused to give proposed instruction B, tendered by the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Following deliberations, the commissioners filed a report fixing the value of the land taken at $129,700 and the damage to the residue at $335,000. After overruling the City\u2019s exceptions and denying its motion for a new trial, the trial court confirmed the report in a May 1997 judgment order, from which we awarded the City this appeal. The City assigns error to the seating of McGuire and to the refusal of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The facts are undisputed. The partnership (hereinafter, the landowners) consisted of a trust and six individuals, including D. L. McKnight. Attorney Grover C. Wright, Jr., represented the landowners at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">During voir dire, the trial court asked the prospective commissioners as a group the following two questions in succession: \u201cDo any of you have any business associations or are you in any joint ventures or business ventures with any of the owners of this property? Have any of you worked in any capacity with any of these landowners?\u201d McGuire responded, \u201cI\u2019ve used Mr. McKnight as an appraiser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Later, the court asked the group, \u201cAre any of you acquainted with any of the lawyers involved in this case?\u201d McGuire responded, \u201cMr. Wright is my attorney, and I know [the City\u2019s attorney], and I don\u2019t think there is anything that would affect my decision.\u201d The court then stated: \u201cMr. McGuire I believe said that he has been a client of Mr. Wright. Have any of the rest of you ever been a client of Mr. Wright?\u201d The court immediately asked eight additional questions in succession, the first of which was: \u201cAnybody currently a client of Mr. Wright?\u201d McGuire did not respond to any of these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Next, the court asked: \u201cHave you ever had any of your property acquired by the city?\u201d McGuire responded: \u201cWe had some negotiations with the city and they acquired some land which they paid for.\u201d To the court\u2019s question: \u201cWould that experience affect your ability to be fair and impartial to both sides in this case,\u201d McGuire answered: \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">At this point during the voir dire, the court granted the City\u2019s motion for individual examination of the prospective commissioners out of the presence of the others. Then, the City\u2019s attorney called McGuire for \u201cfollow-up questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>During examination by the City, McGuire said that his earlier reference to prior \u201cnegotiations\u201d with the City actually entailed \u201cnegotiations followed by a purchase\u201d and \u201ca condemnation trial\u201d involving land owned by \u201cIndian River Associates,\u201d a partnership in which McGuire had a one-third interest. According to McGuire, attorney Wright represented that partnership at trial, held \u201c[t]wo years, three years\u201d prior, and \u201c[m]y appraiser was Mr. McKnight.\u201d McGuire stated he sat in the courtroom as the representative of the partnership during the \u201centire\u201d trial of the prior case. At the conclusion of his interrogation, McGuire answered affirmatively the court\u2019s question whether he \u201ccould be fair and impartial to both sides in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">As noted, the court denied the City\u2019s request to strike McGuire for cause. He served as one of the five commissioners. McKnight, whose interest in the Giant Square partnership was 1272 percent, testified as an appraiser for the landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">On appeal, the City argues \u201cMcGuire should have been struck for cause from the panel of commissioners because of his previous, close, relationship with the landowner and its counsel in nearly identical circumstances.\u201d The landowners contend the \u201ctrial court in the instant matter was correct not to disqualify Dr. McGuire automatically. The correct procedure was to conduct a voir dire examination and assess from his demeanor and answers to questions posed whether he could serve impartially. Having done so, the trial court was well within the bounds of its discretion when it concluded that Dr. McGuire was unbiased and impartial.\u201d We disagree with the landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The principles applicable are settled. Code \u00a7 25-46.20 provides that when, as here, the issue of just compensation is to be determined by a commission, \u201cdisinterested freeholders\u201d shall act as commissioners. Discussing the disqualification of condemnation commissioners for cause, we have said the maintenance of public confidence in the integrity of commission reports is vital. \u201c[S]uch reports should be kept free from the suspicion that the commissioners may have been improperly influenced.\u201d <em>May </em>v. <em>Crockett, 202 </em>Va. 438, 440, 117 S.E.2d 648, 649 (1961). <em>Accord Commonwealth Transp. Comm\u2019r </em>v. <em>DuVal, </em>238 Va. 679, 683, 385 S.E.2d 605, 607 (1989). The eminent domain statutes, designed to implement constitutional mandates, \u201cmust be administered in a manner which promotes confidence in the integrity of the process.\u201d <em>State Highway and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>Transp. Comm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>231 Va. 239, 242, 343 S.E.2d 324, 326 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">However, the trial court is given discretionary authority to decide whether a prospective commissioner should be stricken for cause, and the court\u2019s judgment on this issue will not be reversed on appeal unless there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth Transp. Comm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Chadwell, </em>254 Va. 302, 305-06, 491 S.E.2d 723, 725 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Considering all the circumstances of this case, we hold the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to dismiss McGuire from the panel for cause. First, the record shows that, at the time of trial, McGuire was a client of the landowners\u2019 counsel: \u201cMr. Wright is my attorney.\u201d The trial court obviously misunderstood that response as shown by its statement: \u201cMr. McGuire I believe said that he has been a client of Mr. Wright.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">We have not overlooked the fact that McGuire subsequently did not respond to any of the court\u2019s set of eight questions, the first of which was: \u201cAnybody currently a client of Mr. Wright?\u201d Nevertheless, McGuire\u2019s positive, affirmative response, \u201cMr. Wright is my attorney,\u201d must be accepted as the truth when measured against mere silence that tends to contradict the stated fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Second, in the present case, landowner McKnight served as the landowners\u2019 appraiser with McGuire sitting as a commissioner. In the prior condemnation case, McKnight served as the appraiser for landowner McGuire, who was the landowners\u2019 designated representative sitting at counsel table. In these similar cases tried two or three years apart, McGuire has moved from counsel table in the prior case to the commissioners\u2019 box in the present case to sit in judgment when his former hired appraiser is the present appraiser and one of the parties litigant. This scenario was forecast by the City during voir dire and called to the trial court\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Under these circumstances, it is extremely unlikely the public would have confidence in the integrity of the process when a commissioner has the identity of interests demonstrated by this prospective commissioner. This is true even though, as the record shows, the commissioner is a \u201crespected member of the community\u201d and \u201cknown to be a man of integrity,\u201d who may be determined to discharge his duties in a forthright and unbiased manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Thus, the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to strike McGuire for cause. Because the case will be remanded, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>shall address the other error assigned should the issue arise upon retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The landowners presented evidence about the value of a portion of the shopping center land as an outparcel to be used for a restaurant. They asserted that this portion was suitable for separate development before the take, but that the City\u2019s widening project had eliminated this development potential by reducing the area available for shopping center parking.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Refused instruction B, tendered by the City, was based on principles relating to compensability of damages attributed to frustration of an owner\u2019s plans for development. <em>See State Highway and Transp. Comm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Lanier Farm, Inc., 233 </em>Va. 506, 510-11, 357 S.E.2d 531, 533-34 (1987). We reject the City\u2019s contention the trial court erred in refusing the instruction. The subject was covered adequately in granted instructions 8 and 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Accordingly, the judgment below will be affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case will be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
