We consider whether a circuit court, and not the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, in ruling upon an employer\u2019s petition for reimbursement of compensation benefits paid, has jurisdiction to decide the amount of an employee\u2019s future benefits, when the employee has recovered from a third-party tortfeasor a sum greater than the amount of the past benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">On February 7, 1994, appellant Thelma E. Hawkins, the employee, sustained a compensable back injury in an industrial acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>dent while working for the Commonwealth of Virginia at the South-side Virginia Training Center located in Dinwiddie County. She sustained a herniated cervical disk that damaged her spinal cord. Pursuant to a memorandum of agreement between the employee and the employer, the Commission entered an award under the Act in December 1994 for payment of temporary total disability benefits, the reasonable cost of medical care, and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">In February 1995, the employee filed an action for damages in the court below against a number of physicians who \u201cattended\u201d or treated her following the accident. She alleged the defendants had been guilty of medical negligence for, among other things, failing to timely diagnose and appropriately treat the spinal cord injury that caused her present condition of quadriplegia.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In July 1996, while the action was pending, the employer filed the petition that generated the present dispute. Proceeding pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-310, the employer alleged that it had paid \u201cindemnification benefits\u201d to the plaintiff-employee pursuant to the Act and had \u201cincurred expenses for medical bills arising out of the incident which is the subject of the [pending] action\u201d totalling $229,150 on the date the petition was filed. The employer further alleged that it was entitled to recover the amount it had already paid the plaintiff-employee, including both compensation benefits and medical expenses, \u201cshould this case proceed to judgment for the plaintiff or settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The employer asked the court to enter an order requiring the parties to \u201cascertain the amount of compensation paid and expenses for medical, surgical and hospital attention and supplies incurred by the employer\u201d under the Act. The employer also asked the court to require \u201cthe judgment debtor to pay such compensation and expenses,\u201d less the employer\u2019s \u201cshare of expenses and attorney\u2019s fees, so ascertained by the court, out of the amount of the judgment\u201d or settlement, as provided in \u00a7 65.2-310.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The malpractice action was settled for $850,000. In the August 1996 order dismissing the action, the court retained \u201cjurisdiction over the issue of the Employer\u2019s lien herein asserted.\u201d Reciting that the employee and the Commonwealth-employer \u201cdispute the validity of the asserted lien and the amount thereof,\u201d the court ordered the sum of $230,000 withheld from the settlement proceeds \u201cuntil such time as the issues relating to the amount, and extent, if any, of any lien claimed by\u201d the employer were resolved by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Upon consideration of deposition testimony, documentary evidence, and argument of counsel, the trial court entered the March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>1997 order from which we awarded the employee this appeal. The order provides: \u201c[T]he Court finds that the Commonwealth\u2019s lien amounts to $127,948.00 for medical expenses and the Commonwealth is not entitled to any lien for indemnity paid through July 6, 1996. The Court finds that the Commonwealth\u2019s proportionate share of attorney\u2019s fees and costs is 31.7%.\u201d The order further provides that the employee reimburse the Commonwealth the foregoing sum less $40,559.52 for the Commonwealth\u2019s proportionate share of attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the third-party action, for a net payment of $87,388.48. On appeal, there is no dispute over these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The following sentence of the order is the subject of this controversy: \u201cThe Court further finds that the Commonwealth is entitled to a credit equivalent to 68.3% of (1) indemnity benefits paid after August 27, 1996, and (2) a credit equivalent to 68.3% of all medical expenses accrued after July 6, 1996, until such time as these indemnity benefits and medical expenses total $493,162.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">On appeal, the employee presents the following questions. First, \u201cWhere the employer\u2019s petition sought a determination under \u00a7 65.2-310 of the amount of its lien based upon $229,150.00 in payments through July 6, 1996, did the trial court have jurisdiction to decide the worker\u2019s continuing compensation benefits arising after July 6, 1996 under\u201d the Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Second, \u201cAssuming the trial court had jurisdiction to decide the claimant\u2019s rights after July 6, 1996, did the Commonwealth bear its burden of proving the extent to which third-party medical negligence increased its indemnity liability?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Resolution of the first question is dispositive of this appeal. Therefore, we shall not address further the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Several statutes within the Act are relevant here. Code \u00a7 65.2-700 deals with the jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission and specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">\u201cAll questions arising under this title, if not settled by agreements of the parties interested therein with the approval of the Commission, shall be determined by the Commission, except as otherwise herein provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">Code \u00a7 65.2-310, under which the Commonwealth proceeded in this case, furnishes protection to an employer when an employee sues third parties and provides as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u201cIn any action by an employee . . . against any person other than the employer, the court shall, on petition ... of the employer at any time prior to verdict, ascertain the amount of compensation paid and expenses for medical, surgical and hospital attention and supplies . . . incurred by the employer under the provisions of this title and deduct therefrom a proportionate share of such amounts as are paid by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees as provided in \u00a7 65.2-311; and, in event of judgment against such person other than the employer, the court shall in its order require that the judgment debtor pay such compensation and expenses of the employer, less said share of expenses and attorney\u2019s fees, so ascertained by the court out of the amount of the judgment, so far as sufficient, and the balance, if any, to the judgment creditor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-311 apportions attorney\u2019s fees and expenses between the employer and employee in an action under \u00a7 65.2-310 and provides as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">\u201cIn any action, or claim for damages, by an employee . . . against any person other than the employer, ... if a recovery is effected, either by judgment or voluntary settlement, the reasonable expenses and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of such claimant[] shall be apportioned pro rata between the employer and the employee ... as their respective interests may appear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In 1994, the General Assembly adopted Code \u00a7 65.2-313, the statute that is at the center of this dispute. Acts 1994, ch. 586. As pertinent, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">\u201cIn any action or claim for damages by an employee . . . against any person other than the employer under \u00a7 65.2-310, ... if a recovery is effected, the employer shall pay to the employee a percentage of each further entitlement as it is submitted equal to the ratio the total attorney\u2019s fees and costs bear to the total third-party recovery until such time as the accrued post-recovery entitlement equals that sum which is the difference between the gross recovery and the employer\u2019s compensation lien. In ordering payments under this section, the Commission shall take into account any apportionment made pursuant to \u00a7 65.2-311.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>For the purposes of this section, \u2018entitlement\u2019 means compensation and expenses for medical, surgical and hospital attention and funeral expenses to which the claimant is entitled under the provisions of this title, which entitlements are related to the injury for which the third-party recovery was effected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On appeal, the Attorney General, urging affirmance, refers to \u00a765.2-313 and notes it applies to \u201cany action\u201d under \u00a765.2-310. Thus, he argues, because the matter was pending in the circuit court upon the employer\u2019s petition, \u201cthere can be no question that this matter arose in an action under \u00a7 65.2-310,\u201d and that the circuit court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The Attorney General insists that \u201cthe plain language\u201d of \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-310 and -313 does not limit a circuit court\u2019s authority \u201cto considering only those events occurring on or before the date of the petition.\u201d He points out that \u00a7 65.2-310 states \u201cthe court shall\u201d ascertain the amount of \u201ccompensation paid\u201d and \u201cexpenses . . . incurred.\u201d He says this language shows \u201ca circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction is continuing in nature, encompassing all compensation paid and expenses incurred\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Continuing, the Attorney General contends the second sentence of \u00a7 65.2-313 additionally \u201cprovides direction to the Commission, requiring that when the Commission is ordering payments under \u00a7 65.2-313, it shall follow the apportionment previously made pursuant to \u00a7 65.2-311.\u201d He maintains that if the General Assembly meant the Commission to have exclusive jurisdiction \u201cfor such determinations,\u201d the first sentence of \u00a7 65.2-313 \u201cwould have explicitly stated \u2018the Commission shall,\u2019 as was done in the second sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">We do not agree with the Attorney General. Before we proceed to construe \u00a7 65.2-313, we shall review the state of the law, relevant to the issue presented, at the time of the statute\u2019s 1994 enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">In <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bower, </em>243 Va. 183, 413 S.E.2d 55 (1992), this Court upheld a trial court\u2019s apportionment of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses under the Act with respect to a death claim when the employee had recovered from third-party tortfeasors. The Court stated that former Code \u00a7 65.1-42 (now \u00a7 65.2-310) \u201crequires the trial court to consider only amounts actually paid by the employer in fixing the amount of the employer\u2019s lien,\u201d but that the statute \u201cdoes not restrict the trial court\u2019s consideration to amounts actually paid in apportioning the attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 413 S.E.2d at 57. Thus, the Court approved apportionment of attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>fees and expenses based on the entire amount of a fixed 500-week award.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In <em>Bohle </em>v. <em>Henrico County Sch. Bd., </em>246 Va. 30, 431 S.E.2d 36 (1993), the Court considered the method to be used for apportioning attorney\u2019s fees and expenses under the Act when payment of compensation benefits to an injured employee had been suspended following a settlement between the employee and a third-party tortfeasor. The Court adopted the approach used by the Commission, that is, \u201conce the employee\u2019s net third-party recovery is determined, the employee will be entitled to payment of no further compensation or medical expenses subsequent to the date fixed in the suspension order until the employee can establish that further benefit entitlements exceed the net amount received by the employee from the third-party recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 431 S.E.2d at 39. We said, however, that \u201cthe Commission has not foreclosed the payment of attorney\u2019s fees in increments as medical expenses and compensation benefits accrue during the suspension period.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Against this background and addressing the interests of employees and employers following a third-party recovery, the 1994 General Assembly acted by adopting legislation codified as \u00a7 65.2-313.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The Act (introduced as House Bill 1279) is not a model of clarity. For an article describing the drafting of House Bill 1279, see Louis D. Snesil, <em>Prorating the Costs of a Third-Party Recovery, </em>The Journal of the Virginia Trial Lawyers Association, Summer 1994, at 26, 28 (\u201cThe final version of this statute was hammered out hurriedly by representatives of the compensation carriers and VTLA during a subcommittee meeting of the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Thus, in construing the act we shall look first to its title. A title may be read in an attempt to ascertain an act\u2019s purpose, though it is no part of the act itself. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>180 Va. 36, 41, 21 S.E.2d 721, 723 (1942). The title reads: \u201cAn Act to amend the Code of Virginia by adding in Chapter 3 of Title 65.2 a section numbered 65.2-313, relating to workers\u2019 compensation; suspension of benefits following recovery from third party.\u201d Acts 1994, ch. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Considering the title of the act together with the text of the statute, we conclude that \u00a7 65.2-313 contemplates a situation where there has been a suspension of benefits, as in <em>Bohle, </em>after the employee has recovered from a third-party tortfeasor a sum larger than the total of the past payments of benefits. We cannot determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>from this record whether benefits have been suspended in this case. Nevertheless, that circumstance does not materially impact the jurisdictional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Turning to the statute, we note that nowhere is the word \u201ccourt\u201d used. Nonetheless, the legislature clearly intended for a circuit court to have jurisdiction because the opening clause refers to an \u201caction\u201d under \u00a7 65.2-310, which does authorize \u201cthe court\u201d to proceed. The crucial issue then becomes: How far does the court\u2019s jurisdiction extend under \u00a7 65.2-313?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We hold that the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction extends only to the point where it determines the amount of compensation benefits, as opposed to attorney\u2019s fees and costs, actually paid by the employer. This is confirmed by use of the past tense in \u00a7 65.2-310, \u201cincurred by the employer,\u201d and by this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Bower </em>that the predecessor to \u00a7 65.2-310 \u201crequires the trial court to consider only amounts actually paid by the employer in fixing the amount of the employer\u2019s lien.\u201d 243 Va. at 188, 413 S.E.2d at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">We further hold that \u00a7 65.2-313 permits the circuit court to apportion attorney\u2019s fees and costs based on the amount of benefits paid in the past, and benefits to be paid in the future until, in the language of \u00a7 65.2-313, \u201cthe accrued post-recovery entitlement equals that sum which is the difference between the gross recovery and the employer\u2019s compensation lien.\u201d This is consistent with the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Bower </em>that the precedessor to \u00a7 65.2-310 \u201cdoes not restrict the trial court\u2019s consideration to amounts actually paid in apportioning the attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d 243 Va. at 188, 413 S.E.2d at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">This construction comports with the structure of \u00a7 65.2-313, which, in the first sentence, sets forth the formula for computing the amount the employer \u201cshall pay,\u201d and refers, in the second sentence, to the Commission \u201cordering payments\u201d \u2014 the court sets the apportionment percentage and the Commission orders the amount of the future payments taking \u201cinto account\u201d the apportionment percentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Stated differently, and incorporating the statutory language, the employer is liable for payment \u201cof each further entitlement as it is submitted\u201d based upon a percentage \u201cequal to the ratio the total attorney\u2019s fees and costs bear to the total third-party recovery\u201d until the time when \u201cthe accrued post-recovery entitlement equals that sum which is the difference between the gross recovery and the employer\u2019s compensation lien.\u201d When the circuit court has fixed that percentage and has determined the amount of the lien for payment of past benefits, the Commission enters the picture and orders the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>appropriate payments to be made, taking into account the apportionment percentage fixed by the court. <em>See Eghbal </em>v. <em>Boston Coach Corp., </em>23 Va. App. 634, 638-39, 478 S.E.2d 732, 734-35 (1996) (summary of Commission\u2019s manner of calculation of offset due employer under \u00a7 65.2-313).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Our conclusion is buttressed by the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-700 granting jurisdiction to the Commission over all questions arising under the Act, \u201cexcept as otherwise herein provided.\u201d We do not believe \u00a7 65.2-313 plainly provides \u201cotherwise\u201d as to future payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Turning to the order that is the subject of this appeal, we shall apply the foregoing analysis. In the order, the trial court fixed the amount of the Commonwealth\u2019s lien for medical expenses, determined the Commonwealth was not entitled to any lien for past compensation, and set the proportionate share of attorney\u2019s fees and costs at a fixed percentage. The trial court acted within its jurisdiction in making these rulings, and they are not contested on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">However, the court improperly undertook to apply the apportionment percentage to compensation benefits to be paid and medical expenses to be incurred in the future \u201cuntil such time as these indemnity benefits and medical expenses total $493,162.00.\u201d (This figure apparently equals a sum that is the difference between the gross third-party recovery and the employer\u2019s lien on the amount of the recovery.) This was beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction and was error, for the reasons that we have articulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Accordingly, the order from which this appeal is taken will be affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part. We will modify the order by striking the contested third sentence of the second paragraph of the order, and will enter final judgment upon the order as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, modified, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
