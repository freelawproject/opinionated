Jenkins fired several gunshots at Kelly Jackson, inflicting three wounds. Jackson was later taken to a hospital where he received medical treatment for his injuries, including emergency surgery to repair damage to his colon. Four days later, Jackson died while still in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Jenkins was indicted for unlawfully and feloniously killing Jackson, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32, and for use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. During a jury trial, Dr. Faruk Presswalla, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner for the Commonwealth, testified that he performed an autopsy on Jackson and determined that Jackson had sustained three gunshot wounds. One bullet entered Jackson\u2019s back and moved through the skin and muscles of the back without penetrating any body cavity or vital organ. A second bullet, which entered Jackson\u2019s chest on the right side and fractured a rib, did not injure any vital organ or structure. The third bullet entered Jackson\u2019s abdomen, ultimately perforating his colon.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Dr. Presswalla testified that Jackson had aspirated vomit, as indicated by vomit found in Jackson\u2019s \u201cairway\u201d and in his lungs. Dr. Preswalla explained that the \u201cvomit [went] up and down into the airway, into his lungs.\u201d When asked whether he had formed an opinion regarding the cause of Jackson\u2019s death, Dr. Presswalla stated that Jackson \u201cdied as a result of this aspiration following the gunshot wound to the abdomen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Dr. Jeff Carney, a surgical resident who treated Jackson at the hospital, testified that on May 25, 1995, he entered Jackson\u2019s room and noted that Jackson was markedly pale and was sweating profusely. Dr. Carney then observed Jackson, who was lying on his back, begin vomiting. After rolling Jackson onto his side, Dr. Carney waited until the vomiting episode had ended. He then placed Jackson on his back and observed that Jackson \u201cwas in respiratory arrest or that he was not breathing.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Jackson died.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Dr. Carney testified that Jackson appeared to have been healthy before he sustained the gunshot wounds. Dr. Carney also stated that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>at the time of his death, Jackson might have had \u201csome type of seizure activity.\u201d Dr. Carney explained, \u201cI am not a neurologist, I simply base [the statement regarding a possible seizure] on the opinion that [Jackson] had some spastic movements in his extremities.\u201d Dr. Carney stated that he could not offer an opinion whether Jackson actually had suffered a seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Jenkins introduced into evidence a typewritten discharge summary, which was dictated and signed by Dr. Carney. On this document, a handwritten notation entered in the top margin of the first page stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">Many Factors contributed to his death but all were result of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">Gun Shot wound</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">Bowel injury and contamination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">Extensive laporotomy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">Intubated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">The record contains no testimony from any witness concerning the origin of this handwritten notation. When Jenkins\u2019 counsel offered the document in evidence, he did not request that the handwritten entry be excluded from the exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">The jury found Jenkins guilty of first degree murder and fixed his punishment at 23 years\u2019 imprisonment. The jury also found Jenkins guilty of use of a firearm in the commission of murder and fixed his punishment for that offense at three years\u2019 imprisonment. The trial court entered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. The Court of Appeals awarded Jenkins an appeal from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">In the Court of Appeals, Jenkins argued that the evidence failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that any of the three gunshot wounds he inflicted on Jackson was the cause of Jackson\u2019s death. The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that \u201cthe fact finder had no way of determining whether Dr. Presswalla meant that the aspiration was simply an unrelated event which coincidentally occurred after the gunshot wound, or a result of the gunshot wound with a causal relationship thereto.\u201d In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals acknowledged the presence of the handwritten note on the discharge summary but held that, because \u201c[t]here is no indication in the record of the source or author of this handwritten note .... we can only speculate as to its origin, authenticity, and authorship, and we are constrained by the record before us to disregard it.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Court of Appeals reversed Jenkins\u2019 convictions and dismissed the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The Commonwealth filed a petition for appeal in this Court pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-116.08 and 19.2-317(c).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We awarded the Commonwealth an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The Commonwealth argues that Dr. Presswalla\u2019s testimony provided sufficient evidence to prove that Jackson died from the gunshot wounds inflicted by Jenkins. The Commonwealth also contends that the handwritten notation on the discharge summary constitutes further competent evidence to prove that Jackson died as a result of the gunshot wounds. In addition, relying on <em>Gallimore v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 441, 436 S.E.2d 421 (1993), the Commonwealth argues that even if Jackson had a seizure prior to his death, such an intervening event would not exonerate Jenkins because any such seizure would have been \u201cput into operation\u201d by Jenkins\u2019 acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In response, Jenkins argues that the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Jackson died from the gunshot wounds. Jenkins asserts that Dr. Presswalla did not state that the gunshot wounds caused Jackson to aspirate the vomit, and that Dr. Carney\u2019s testimony suggests that Jackson\u2019s death may have been caused by a seizure, rather than by the gunshot wounds. Thus, Jenkins contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. We disagree with Jenkins\u2019 argument and the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">When a defendant challenges on appeal the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his convictions, it is the appellate court\u2019s duty to examine the evidence that tends to support the convictions and to permit the convictions to stand unless they are plainly wrong or without evidentiary support. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Tyler v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 162, 165-66, 487 S.E.2d 221, 223 (1997); <em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 466, 470 S.E.2d 114, 130, <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. _, 117 S.Ct. 222 (1996). If there is evidence to support the convictions, the reviewing court is not permitted to substitute its own judgment, even if its opinion might differ from the conclusions reached by the finder of fact at the trial. <em>Tyler, </em>254 Va. at 165-66, 487 S.E.2d at 223; <em>Cable </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 236, 239, 415 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1992); <em>Avent </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 474, 477, 164 S.E.2d 655, 657 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Upon review, the appellate court must examine the evidence and all inferences reasonably deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the trial court. <em>Tyler, </em>254 Va. at 165-66, 487 S.E.2d at 223; <em>Goins, </em>251 Va. at 466, 470 S.E.2d at 130; <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 379, 387, 464 S.E.2d 131, 136 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1110 (1996). All evidence properly admitted at the trial is subject to this review. <em>See Tyler, </em>254 Va. at 165-66, 487 S.E.2d at 223; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Nelms, </em>204 Va. 338, 341, 131 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">When a defendant has inflicted wounds upon a victim that result in an affliction or a disease, the defendant is criminally responsible for the victim\u2019s death from that affliction or disease if the wounds caused the death indirectly through a chain of natural effects and causes. <em>Spain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 385, 394-95, 373 S.E.2d 728, 733 (1988); <em>see Gallimore, </em>246 Va. at 447, 436 S.E.2d at 425; <em>Waller v. Commonwealth, </em>178 Va. 294, 307, 16 S.E.2d 808, 813 (1941). An intervening event, even if a cause of the death, does not exempt the defendant from liability if that event was put into operation by the defendant\u2019s initial criminal acts. <em>Gallimore, </em>246 Va. at 447, 436 S.E.2d at 425; <em>see Coleman </em>v. <em>Blankenship Oil Corp., </em>221 Va. 124, 131, 267 S.E.2d 143, 147 (1980); <em>Baxley v. Fischer, </em>204 Va. 792, 798, 134 S.E.2d 291, 295 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Here, the evidence showed that Jackson, the victim, was in good health prior to being shot by Jenkins. Dr. Preswalla testified that Jackson \u201cdied as a result of [the] aspiration following the gunshot wound to the abdomen.\u201d Moreover, the handwritten notation on the discharge summary, introduced into evidence by Jenkins, stated that \u201c[mjany factors contributed to [Jackson\u2019s] death but all were [the] result of Gun Shot wound.\u201d This evidence plainly supports the jury\u2019s finding that Jackson died as a result of the gunshot wounds inflicted by Jenkins. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to prove the required causal connection between Jenkins\u2019 acts and the victim\u2019s death. <em>See Gallimore, </em>246 Va. at 447, 436 S.E.2d at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">We find no merit in Jenkins\u2019 argument that the handwritten notation on the discharge summary was not competent evidence in this case. When Jenkins\u2019 counsel offered the document into evidence, he did not request that the handwritten notation be excluded from the proffered exhibit. Thus, as the proponent of the discharge summary exhibit which was received in evidence, Jenkins has waived any later objection to its consideration by the trier of fact. <em>See </em>Rule 5:25; <em>Frye v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 386, 345 S.E.2d 267, 279 (1986); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 569, 570, 179 S.E.2d 458, 460 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Since the handwritten notation on the discharge summary was received without objection as evidence in the case, the Court of Appeals erred in disregarding that portion of the exhibit in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support Jenkins\u2019 convictions. A reviewing court must consider all evidence properly admitted at trial in determining the sufficiency of the evidence, not merely the evidence that the reviewing court considers most trustworthy. <em>See Tyler, </em>254 Va. at 165-66, 487 S.E.2d at 223; <em>Avent, </em>209 Va. at 477, 164 S.E.2d at 657; <em>Nelms, </em>204 Va. at 341, 131 S.E.2d at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">For these reasons, we will reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment and reinstate Jenkins\u2019 convictions in accordance with the trial court\u2019s judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-11\"> These statutes allow the Commonwealth to seek a writ of error if it is aggrieved by a judgment of the Court of Appeals in any criminal case in which the judgment is not made final under Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-116.07 or 19.2-408.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
