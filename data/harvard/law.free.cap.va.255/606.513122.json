STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"AKf\">The applicable standard of review is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-15\">Where the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged after conviction, it is our duty to consider it in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. We should affirm the judgment unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-16\"><em>Higginbotham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680. Thus, we will present the facts of each case in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>H. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><em>Horton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">On February 6, 1996, H.H.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> age 12, was asleep in her bedroom. She was alone in the house because her parents were at work. At approximately 1:48 a.m., H.H. awoke to find someone standing at the door of her bedroom. Initially, H.H. thought it was her father, but she realized it was not when she looked at her clock and saw the time. H.H. testified that as the man approached her, she could see that he was wearing what she described as a \u201chunting mask\u201d which left his eyes, nose and mouth uncovered. When the man came closer to her, H.H. started kicking and screaming, and the man sprayed something in her eyes or face that burned. When the man realized that she could still see, he sprayed her again. However, before spraying her the second time, he had removed his mask, and H.H. recognized the man as Thomas E. Horton, Sr., her neighbor. Even before seeing his face, H.H. had recognized Horton\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Horton then handcuffed H.H.\u2019s wrists together, pulled down her purple jogging shorts, pulled up her shirt, and got on top of her. Horton had also pulled down his pants. Asserting that she knew the words for the parts of the body because of a Family Life course she took at school, H.H. said she felt his penis on the inside of her leg and described how Horton spread her legs apart, pulled up her shirt, and \u201clicked [her] boobs.\u201d When asked if Horton tried to do anything else, H.H. stated that he tried \u201c[to] get his penis in my vagina,\u201d but he was unable to do so. H.H. then testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">Q. Did he do anything else to your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">A. He licked it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">Q. He licked it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">Q. With his tongue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">When H.H. told Horton she needed to go to the bathroom, he removed the handcuffs and allowed her to go. However, Horton accompanied her to the bathroom and forced her to wash. H.H. testified that upon their return to the bedroom, Horton threatened to kill her if she told her parents. He finally departed around 2:30 a.m. H.H. did not telephone the 911 emergency number for help because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>was afraid that Horton had remained somewhere on the premises. H.H. told her parents about the incident when they returned home at approximately 5:00 a.m. The police were notified shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">A.C. Powers of the Augusta County Sheriff\u2019s Department investigated the incident. He recovered an empty condom pack and a condom wrapper on the floor of H.H.\u2019s bedroom. Since H.H. identified her assailant as Horton, Powers went to Horton\u2019s residence. He subsequently searched Horton\u2019s truck and residence where he found a mask matching the one described by H.H., handcuffs, a canister of pepper spray, and two unused condoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">At trial, Horton moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the basis that there was insufficient proof of penetration to support the sodomy charge. He renewed this motion at the close of all the evidence. The trial court overruled the motions, and the jury found Horton guilty of forcible sodomy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">On October 29, 1996, the trial court denied Horton\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict. Horton then filed a petition for appeal in the Court of Appeals of Virginia, which both a single judge and a three-judge panel denied. Horton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\"><em>Newby </em>v. <em>Commonwealth</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">The victim in this case, D.C.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> began a new job as a waitress/ bartender at a restaurant in Chesterfield County on March 13, 1995. During that evening, she noticed George R. Newby, Jr., in the restaurant because he made several remarks to her about her marriage and appearance. When a co-worker announced that it was closing time, the remaining customers, including Newby, exited the restaurant. While D.C. cleaned up, the co-worker attempted to lock the door but had difficulty with the lock. Newby then re-entered the restaurant on the pretext of helping with the lock and remained until D.C. and the co-worker left. As D.C. walked to her car, Newby asked her if she would give him a ride home, and she agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Newby directed D.C. where to drive, and she eventually arrived in front of a building that Newby described as \u201chis club.\u201d D.C. testified that Newby then brought his left arm around her neck and started squeezing her. She honked her horn, but Newby told her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>take her hand off the horn or he would kill her. D.C. testified that Newby held something with a sharp blade across her nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Then, according to D.C., Newby forced her from the car and pulled her in the direction of some woods adjacent to the building. Newby forced D.C. to remove her clothes and lie flat on her back. He then \u201cput his penis in [her] vagina.\u201d Because her vaginal area was dry and unlubricated, Newby pulled his penis out of her vagina. D.C. testified that Newby next \u201cput his mouth on my vaginal area and he drooled and I know this because it was so cold, I could feel the heat . . . .\u201d When asked if Newby\u2019s mouth was specifically on her vaginal area, D.C. replied that he was \u201con my vulva area.\u201d D.C. further testified that Newby put his penis back in her vagina and that he put his mouth on her genitalia at least twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Newby forced D.C. to engage in sexually explicit conversation with him, and he eventually ejaculated inside her. Newby then returned D.C.\u2019s clothes to her but threatened that he would kill her and her children if she told anybody about what he had done. According to D.C., Newby said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time that I raped and you better not be the first one to tell.\u201d Newby allowed D.C. to get dressed and return to her car, but she drove her car into a ditch. Newby tried unsuccessfully to help D.C. remove the car from the ditch. D.C. eventually walked to a gas station where she telephoned a friend. The friend and the police arrived shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">At trial, Newby\u2019s defense was that D.C. consented to the sexual activity. In support of his defense, Newby testified, \u201cI did lick Mrs. [C.\u2019s] vaginal area and I did penetrate her with my penis and have sex, but at no time did she say, \u2018No,\u2019 did she say \u2018Stop,\u2019 or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and at the close of all the evidence, Newby moved to strike the evidence on the basis that the Commonwealth had failed to prove penetration on the sodomy charge. The trial court overruled both motions. The jury convicted Newby of forcible sodomy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The Court of Appeals of Virginia awarded Newby an appeal and affirmed his conviction of forcible sodomy in an unpublished opinion dated July 1,1997. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the jury could have found that Newby\u2019s mouth penetrated D.C.\u2019s vulva during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>protracted assault and in the course of his effort to moisten her genitalia. Newby appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">m. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The issue in these cases is what constitutes sufficient evidence of penetration to support a conviction of forcible sodomy by engaging in cunnilingus in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[Pjenetration is an essential element of the crime of sodomy.\u201d <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 439, 444, 247 S.E.2d 698, 702 (1978). However, penetration in sodomy, as in rape, can be proved by circumstantial evidence, and the penetration \u201cneed be only slight.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">To resolve this issue, we first address the definition of cunnilingus. Since Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1 does not define \u201ccunnilingus,\u201d we must give the term its ordinary meaning. <em>McKeon v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 24, 27, 175 S.E.2d 282, 284 (1970). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 554 (1993) defines cunnilingus as \u201cstimulation of the vulva or clitoris with the lips or tongue.\u201d The term \u201ccunnilingus\u201d derives from the Latin words <em>cunnus </em>meaning vulva and <em>lingere </em>meaning to lick. <em>Id. See also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 380 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201c[a]n act of sex committed with the mouth and the female sexual organ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Our inquiry does not stop with the definition of cunnilingus. We must also address the anatomy of the female genitalia in relation to the act of cunnilingus. The female external genitalia, starting with the outermost parts, are: \u201cthe mons pubis, the labia majora et minora pudendi, the clitoris, vestibule, vestibular bulb and the greater vestibular glands. The term \u2018vulva\u2019 . . . includes all these parts.\u201d Henry Gray, Anatomy, Descriptive and Surgical 1446 (Peter L. Williams et al. eds., 37th ed. 1989); <em>see also </em>Lawyers\u2019 Medical Cyclopedia of Personal Injuries and Allied Specialties 534 (Richard M. Patterson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>ed., 4th ed. Vol 5A 1997); <em>accord State v. Ludlum, </em>281 S.E.2d 159, 162 (N.C. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We have previously recognized the significance of the anatomical structure of the female genitalia in relation to the element of penetration. In <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 184, 190, 491 S.E.2d 739, 742 (1997), we referenced the Court of Appeals\u2019 statement in <em>Love </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 84, 88, 441 S.E.2d 709, 712 (1994) that \u201cpenetration of any portion of the vulva which encompasses the \u2018external parts of the female sex organs considered as a whole\u2019 and includes, beginning with the outermost parts, the labia majora, labia minora, hymen, vaginal opening and vagina . . . , is sufficient to show penetration.\u201d In <em>Rowland v. Commonwealth, </em>147 Va. 636, 136 S.E. 564 (1927), we held that penetration of the vulva was sufficient to affirm a conviction of rape. In that case, the doctor who had examined the victim testified that he was unable to \u201cinsert his finger in the female organ\u201d because the hymen was intact but that there might have been penetration of the vulva without injury to the hymen. <em>Id. </em>at 638, 136 S.E. at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Since cunnilingus involves stimulation of the vulva or clitoris and the vulva encompasses the outermost part of the female genitalia, we conclude that penetration of any portion of the vulva is sufficient to prove sodomy by cunnilingus. Penetration of the vaginal opening or vagina is not required. In other words, \u201cinsertion of the defendant\u2019s tongue into the victim\u2019s vagina need not be shown to prove cunnilingus.\u201d <em>Love, </em>18 Va. App. at 88, 441 S.E.2d at 712; <em>accord State v. Kish, </em>443 A.2d 1274, 1278 (Conn. 1982); <em>Partain v. State, </em>492 A.2d 669, 672 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1985); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>574 S.W.2d 432, 434 (Mo. Ct. App. 1977); <em>State v. Brown, </em>405 N.W.2d 600, 607 (Neb. 1987); <em>State v. Fraction, </em>503 A.2d 336, 338 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1985); <em>Ludlum, </em>281 S.E.2d at 162; <em>State v. Beaulieu, </em>674 A.2d 377, 378 (R.I. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Turning now to the evidence in Horton\u2019s case, H.H. testified, in response to a question whether Horton did anything else to her vagina, that he licked it with his tongue. According to H.H., this act occurred after Horton had unsuccessfully tried to insert his penis into her vagina. Because of a Family Life course she took at school, H.H. asserted that she knew the words for the parts of the body. Her comprehension is evidenced by the fact that she herself used the words \u201cvagina\u201d and \u201cpenis\u201d in describing Horton\u2019s attempt to insert his penis into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Therefore, we conclude that this evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient to establish that Horton penetrated the vulva or outermost portion of H.H.\u2019s genitalia when he licked her vagina, and in doing so, committed the act of sodomy by cunnilingus in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1. Horton\u2019s conviction is not \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Higginbotham, </em>216 Va. at 352, 218 S.E.2d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We reach the same conclusion in Newby\u2019s case. D.C. testified that Newby \u201cput his penis in [her] vagina\u201d but pulled it out because she was unlubricated. Newby then \u201cput his mouth on [D.C.\u2019s] vaginal area and . . . drooled.\u201d The jury could have inferred from this evidence that Newby licked D.C.\u2019s vagina or vaginal opening for the purpose of lubricating her since he then re-inserted his penis into her vagina. Furthermore, D.C. specifically stated that Newby\u2019s mouth was on her vulva, and Newby admitted that he licked D.C.\u2019s vaginal area. This evidence proves penetration of D.C.\u2019s outermost genitalia and is sufficient evidence upon which to affirm Newby\u2019s conviction of forcible sodomy by engaging in cunnilingus. <em>See also Ryan, </em>219 Va. at 444-45, 247 S.E.2d at 702 (affirming conviction for carnal knowledge by mouth in which victim testified that defendant licked her vagina with his tongue after attempting unsuccessfully to engage in sexual intercourse).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Both Newby and Horton argue that our decision in <em>Moore </em>is dispositive and underscores the insufficiency of the evidence of penetration in their respective cases. We do not agree. The critical factor in <em>Moore </em>was the victim\u2019s ambiguous testimony. The victim did not know or could not adequately describe the structure of her sexual anatomy and used the term \u201cvagina\u201d generally to describe the external portion of her genitalia. Her testimony during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief demonstrated her lack of understanding since she testified that the defendant placed his penis \u201cboth \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018on\u2019 her vagina.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>254 Va. at 187-88, 491 S.E.2d at 741. Finding the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence thus in a \u201cstate of equipoise on an essential element of the crime,\u201d we concluded that proof of penetration failed as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 189, 491 S.E.2d at 741. <em>See also Ashby v. Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 443, 444, 158 S.E.2d 657, 658 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1111 (1969) (finding evidence that boy\u2019s mouth was merely placed on man\u2019s genitals insufficient to prove penetration).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In contrast to <em>Moore, </em>neither H.H. nor D.C. testified equivocally about the nature of the sexual acts committed upon them by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>their respective assailants. In addition, they each understood the structure of their genitalia and used the appropriate terms to describe their own anatomy as well as the anatomy of their assailant. In no respect was the evidence in either Horton\u2019s or Newby\u2019s case in a \u201cstate of equipoise,\u201d as it was in <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Record Number 971645 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AsX\">Record Number 971576 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-15\"> Full name deleted by the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-11\"> The jury also convicted Horton of breaking and entering, attempted rape, and wearing a mask.
