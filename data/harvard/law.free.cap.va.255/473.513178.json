We conclude that, when a defendant does not contest his competency to stand trial, Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1 does not require an explicit finding of competence by the transferring court and, therefore, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">In May 1995, petitions charging 17-year-old Paname\u00f1o with two counts of rape and three counts of extortion were filed in the Arlington County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court. Following a hearing, that court entered an order transferring Paname\u00f1o to the Circuit Court of Arlington County for trial as an adult. The order did not contain an explicit finding that Paname\u00f1o was competent. Paname\u00f1o appealed the certification order. Following a hearing, the circuit court concluded that the transfer order substantially complied with \u00a7 16.1-269.1, and that it had jurisdiction over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">The Commonwealth obtained indictments against Paname\u00f1o. He entered a conditional plea of guilty on two counts of rape and one count of extortion but reserved the right to challenge on appeal his certification as an adult and the transfer of the case to the circuit court. The circuit court accepted Panameno\u2019s conditional plea and sentenced him to a four year indeterminate term. The Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Appeals denied Panameno\u2019s petition for appeal. We awarded an appeal on a single issue: whether \u00a7 16.1-269.1 requires the juvenile and domestic relations court to make an explicit finding that the juvenile is competent before entering an order of transfer to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Prior to 1994, \u00a7 16.1-269 required that, in order to transfer a juvenile defendant to circuit court for trial as an adult, the juvenile and domestic relations court had to make a number of specific findings, including a finding that the juvenile was \u201ccompetent to stand trial.\u201d If the juvenile and domestic relations court did not make this finding, the circuit court could not acquire jurisdiction over the juvenile. <em>See, e.g., Matthews v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 358, 361, 218 S.E.2d 538, 541 (1975) (interpreting former \u00a7 16.1-176 (repealed 1977), the predecessor of \u00a7 16.1-269).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Section 16.1-269 was repealed in 1994 and replaced with \u00a7 16.1-269.1, the statute applicable in this case. The current statute makes transfer of a juvenile to the circuit court \u201csubject to the following conditions.\u201d As relevant here, one condition for transfer is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">3. The juvenile is competent to stand trial. The juvenile is presumed to be competent and the burden is on the party alleging the juvenile is not competent to rebut the presumption by a preponderance of the evidence ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00a7 16.1-269.1(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Paname\u00f1o argues that pursuant to this section, a finding of competence must be made by the transferring court. However, the language in former \u00a7 16.1-269 directing the trial court to make specific findings before transferring a juvenile is not contained in the current section. By this deletion, the General Assembly has determined that, unless the competency of a juvenile is challenged, an explicit finding by the juvenile and domestic relations court that the juvenile is competent is not required. In this case, Paname\u00f1o neither alleged that he was incompetent to stand trial nor did he present any evidence to that effect. Therefore, an explicit finding that Paname\u00f1o was competent to stand trial was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
