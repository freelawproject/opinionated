Martin\u2019s job required him to be \u201con call\u201d to respond to customer requests for service during the weekend beginning Friday, October 13, 1995. Pursuant to company policy, Martin planned to use a company-owned truck for the period he was \u201con call.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">At the end of his regular work shift on October 13, Martin began to transfer his personal belongings from his car, which was in Southern States\u2019 employee parking lot, to the company-owned truck. During this process, Martin noticed that his hunting rifle was in the trunk of his car and that the rifle case was open. When Martin attempted to close the rifle case, the rifle discharged a bullet which traveled through the wall of the trunk and struck Tracy Lee Randolph, another Southern States employee, in the left leg. There is no allegation that this shooting was intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">At the time of the shooting, Martin\u2019s car was insured by a motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued by USAA Casualty Insurance Company (USAA), which provided coverage for injuries caused by Martin\u2019s negligent or reckless use of the car. Martin\u2019s homeowner\u2019s liability insurance policy, also issued by USAA, provided coverage for injuries resulting from Martin\u2019s negligent or reckless acts. USAA denied liability under each policy for Randolph\u2019s injury on the ground that Randolph was injured on Southern States\u2019 property while Martin was in the course of his employment. Southern States\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation carrier, Southern States Underwriters, Inc., t/a Southern States Insurance Exchange (Underwriters), also denied lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>bility for Randolph\u2019s injury, stating that the injury did not arise out of or in the course of Randolph\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Randolph filed a bill of complaint for declaratory judgment in the trial court against several defendants, including USAA, Southern States, Underwriters, and Kevin Martin. The bill of complaint requested a declaration that USAA was hable for Randolph\u2019s injury under either or both of the insurance policies issued by USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">At a bench trial, Randolph\u2019s counsel informed the chancellor that the sole issue he was asking the chancellor to decide was \u201cwhether the Workers\u2019 Compensation bar applies.\u201d Randolph\u2019s counsel further stated that he \u201cwas not going to get into which one of the various USAA policies might apply.\u201d USAA and Martin (collectively, USAA) objected to Randolph\u2019s use of a declaratory judgment proceeding to resolve the issue concerning the workers\u2019 compensation bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">After hearing the evidence, the chancellor ruled that the request for declaratory relief was appropriate because the suit involved an \u201cantagonistic assertion and denial of right.\u201d The chancellor then held that the injury did not arise out of Randolph\u2019s employment and, thus, that the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-100 through -1310, did not bar Randolph from filing a tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">On appeal, USAA contends that the chancellor erred in entering a declaratory judgment on the issue whether Randolph\u2019s injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment. USAA argues that declaratory judgment did not he in this case because the suit raised an issue to be decided in a future tort action and did not involve a determination of Randolph\u2019s rights under a written instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Southern States and Randolph (collectively, Randolph) contend that the trial court did not err in entering a declaratory judgment because the bill of complaint requested a determination whether Randolph had a right to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim or a right to institute a personal injury action. Randolph also asserts that the declaratory judgment suit was an appropriate and efficient mechanism for joining all parties in interest for the conclusive determination of these rights. We disagree with Randolph.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-184 through -191, circuit courts have the authority to make \u201cbinding adjudications of right\u201d in cases of \u201cactual controversy\u201d when there is \u201cantagonistic assertion and denial of right.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-184; <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield v. St. Mary\u2019s Hosp., </em>245 Va. 24, 35, 426 S.E.2d 117, 123 (1993); <em>Erie Ins. Group </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>240 Va. 165, 170, 393 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>S.E.2d 210, 212 (1990); <em>Reisen </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>225 Va. 327, 331, 302 S.E.2d 529, 531 (1983). The purpose of this enactment is to provide relief from the uncertainty arising out of controversies over legal rights. Code \u00a7 8.01-191; <em>Erie, </em>240 Va. at 170, 393 S.E.2d at 212; <em>Reisen, </em>225 Va. at 331, 302 S.E.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The Declaratory Judgment Act does not give trial courts the authority to render advisory opinions, to decide moot questions, or to answer inquiries that are merely speculative. <em>St. Mary\u2019s, </em>245 Va. at 35, 426 S.E.2d at 123; <em>Hughes, </em>240 Va. at 170, 393 S.E.2d at 212; <em>Reisen, </em>225 Va. at 331, 302 S.E.2d at 531. The Act also is not to be used as an instrument of procedural fencing, either to secure delay or to choose a forum. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Bishop, </em>211 Va. 414, 419, 177 S.E.2d 519, 522 (1970); <em>Williams v. Southern Bank, </em>203 Va. 657, 662, 125 S.E.2d 803, 807 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The authority to enter a declaratory judgment is discretionary and must be exercised with great care and caution. <em>Bishop, </em>211 Va. at 421, 177 S.E.2d at 524. As a rule, this authority will not be exercised when some other mode of proceeding is provided. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The fact that multiple actions may be avoided if a declaratory judgment is entered is not always a ground for the trial court to exercise its jurisdiction. There must also be some real necessity for the exercise of jurisdiction on this basis. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 177 S.E.2d at 522-23; <em>Williams, </em>203 Va. at 663, 125 S.E.2d at 807. Further, when a declaratory judgment regarding a disputed fact would be determinative of issues, rather than a construction of definite stated rights, status, or other relations, commonly expressed in written instruments, the case is not appropriate for declaratory judgment. <em>Bishop, </em>211 Va. at 420, <em>177 </em>S.E.2d at 523; <em>Williams, </em>203 Va. at 663, 125 S.E.2d at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Our decisions in <em>Bishop </em>and <em>Williams </em>illustrate some of these basic principles. In <em>Bishop, </em>two insurers which had defended and settled a wrongful death action requested entry of a declaratory judgment against Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual). The two insurers effectively contended that Liberty Mutual was liable to them because they defended, settled, and paid under their policies a claim that should have been defended, settled, and paid by Liberty Mutual. The trial court entered a declaratory judgment decreeing recovery in favor of the two insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">On appeal, Liberty Mutual maintained that the disputed claim was not appropriate for resolution by means of declaratory judgment. We agreed because, when the petition for declaratory judgment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>filed, the various claims and rights asserted had accrued and matured, and the wrongs alleged had been suffered. 211 Va. at 421, 177 S.E.2d at 524. Thus, no rights between the parties remained unsettled and other modes of proceeding were available for resolution of the dispute. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">In <em>Williams, </em>a former customer of a bank threatened to file eleven actions for malicious prosecution against the bank, based on information the bank gave to a prosecutor that led to the indictment of the customer on eleven charges of larceny. When the customer was acquitted on two of the larceny charges, the remaining indictments were terminated by <em>nolle prosequi </em>on motion by the prosecutor. The bank filed a petition for declaratory judgment requesting a determination whether the bank could be held liable in a civil suit for the alleged malicious prosecution. The trial court entered a declaratory judgment decreeing that the bank had made a full disclosure of all material facts to the prosecutor, and the court permanently enjoined the customer from instituting any malicious prosecution actions based on the bank\u2019s conduct. 203 Va. at 658-59, 125 S.E.2d at 804-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We reversed the trial court\u2019s decree, holding that declaratory judgment did not lie because the only controversy in the suit involved a disputed issue, namely, whether the bank made a full disclosure of the facts to the prosecutor. 203 Va. at 663, 125 S.E.2d at 807. The determination of that issue, rather than an adjudication of any rights of the parties, was the true object of the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>We also noted that the trial court\u2019s decree improperly allowed the bank to choose its own forum in equity. <em>Id. </em>at 663, 125 S.E.2d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The present case suffers from many of the same defects that required reversal of the decrees in <em>Bishop </em>and <em>Williams. </em>Like <em>Bishop, </em>the present case involves claims and rights that had accrued and matured when the bill of complaint was filed. Thus, declaratory judgment did not lie because other remedies were available to Randolph, namely, a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or an action at law. <em>See Bishop, 211 </em>Va. at 421, 177 S.E.2d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Like <em>Williams, </em>the present case is inappropriate for declaratory judgment because the case does not involve a determination of rights, but only involves a disputed issue to be determined in future litigation between the parties, namely, whether Randolph\u2019s injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment. The chancellor\u2019s entry of a declaratory judgment also improperly allowed Randolph to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>choose a forum for the determination of this issue. <em>See Williams, </em>203 Va. at 663, 125 S.E.2d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We find no merit in Randolph\u2019s contention that the present case is similar to our decision in <em>Reisen. </em>There, we were presented with an actual controversy requiring the interpretation of rights under an insurance policy. The controversy involved the insurer\u2019s duty to defend a pending tort action. We held that the determination of this coverage question was appropriate for declaratory judgment because the determination guided the parties in their future conduct in relation to each other, and saved them from jeopardizing their interests by taking undirected action incident to their rights. 225 Va. at 335, 302 S.E.2d at 533. The present case is dissimilar to <em>Reisen </em>because Randolph did not seek any adjudication of rights but only requested a determination of the issue whether his injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">For these reasons, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s decree and dismiss the bill of complaint for declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> Based on our decision, we do not reach USAA\u2019s remaining assignment of error challenging the merits of the chancellor\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
