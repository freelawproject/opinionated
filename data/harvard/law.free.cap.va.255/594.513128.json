(Allstate), of all amounts Allstate received from borrowers in connection with its cash advancement loan program in violation of the Consumer Finance Act (CFA). The Commonwealth proceeded on two theories under which to hold Greenberg personally liable: (1) actively participating in the commission of the illegal conduct; and (2) piercing the corporate veil. The trial court refused to pierce the corporate veil but held Greenberg personally liable by applying an active participation theory. Because we find that Code \u00a7 6.1-308(B) precludes imposition of restitution on any entity or individual other than the lender, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment imposing liability on Green-berg. However, we find, as a matter of law, that the evidence is insufficient to pierce the corporate veil and will affirm the. trial court\u2019s judgment on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">We will discuss each theory relied upon by the Commonwealth and the relevant facts seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">I. ACTIVE PARTICIPATION</p>\n<p id=\"A4R\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">From February 10, 1992, until approximately February 1, 1993, Allstate, a Virginia corporation doing business as Allstate Express Checking, operated a check cashing/cash advance business from four different locations in Hampton, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. Allstate provided two basic services to its customers. One service involved cashing government, payroll, travelers, insurance, and personal checks for individuals without checking accounts. Allstate\u2019s fees for this service started at 2% and varied depending on the type of check. Only a small percentage of Allstate\u2019s customers utilized this service.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>The second service that Allstate offered was for customers with a checking account and involved advancing cash against present-dated checks at a discount from the face amount of the checks and holding the checks for a specified period of time before cashing them. The fee Allstate charged for this service was a fixed percentage of the amount advanced, such as 25% or 30%, depending on the amount of the advancement. The majority of Allstate\u2019s customers used this service.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The three major principals in Allstate were Greenberg, Loran S. Martin, and Joseph P. Lynch. They comprised Allstate\u2019s board of directors, with Greenberg serving as the chairman. Martin was Allstate\u2019s president and chief operations officer, and Lynch was Allstate\u2019s secretary and treasurer. All three were also shareholders of Allstate, with Greenberg being the majority shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In early 1993, the Commonwealth brought suit against Allstate alleging that it had violated the CFA by making loans in amounts and at interest rates prohibited under Code \u00a7 6.1-249.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that suit, the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond determined that Allstate\u2019s cash advance services constituted \u201cloans\u201d within the meaning of the CFA and that Allstate\u2019s fees for these services exceeded the CFA\u2019s statutory limits. Accordingly, the trial court enjoined Allstate from violating the CFA and entered judgment for the Commonwealth, \u201cas trustee for the use and benefit of affected borrowers,\u201d against Allstate \u201cfor restitution of all amounts it received from borrowers in connection with its check advancement loan program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On January 5, 1994, the Commonwealth filed a bill of complaint against Greenberg and alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Greenberg actively participated in the illegal acts perpetrated by Allstate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth sought to hold Greenberg individually liable for restitution to borrowers under Code \u00a7 6.1-308(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The trial court found that Greenberg did actively participate in Allstate\u2019s illegal conduct and that the Commonwealth could, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>fore, obtain restitution from Greenberg for the benefit of Allstate\u2019s borrowers. In doing so, the court rejected Greenberg\u2019s argument that Code \u00a7 6.1-308(B) allows for restitution only from the \u201clender\u201d for violations of the CFA. Rather, in a letter opinion, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">The liability has been imposed against the corporation, according to the statute, as a result of the illegal acts of the corporation. Because it was actually individuals who committed the illegal acts, the individuals can be held responsible. Mr. Green-berg is to be held personally liable, not because he was the \u201clender\u201d, but because he was a responsible actor within the corporation which was the \u201clender.\u201d The statute imposes the liability on the corporation as lender and the doctrine of active participation extends that liability to the individuals involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Subsequently, in an order dated April 15, 1997, the trial court entered a permanent injunction against Greenberg and final judgment in favor of the Commonwealth in the amount of $237,154, as restitution in trust and for the benefit of Allstate\u2019s borrowers, and $30,000 as attorney\u2019s fees. Greenberg appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Code \u00a7 6.1-303(A)(2) of the CFA provides that \u201c[t]he Attorney General may seek and the circuit court may order or decree such other relief allowed by law, including restitution to the extent available to borrowers under subsection B of \u00a7 6.1-308.\u201d Code \u00a7 6.1-308 sets forth the penalties for CFA violations and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">A. Any person and the several members, officers, directors, agents, and employees thereof, who violate or participate in the violation of any provision of \u00a7 6.1-249 shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">B. Any contract of loan in the making or collection of which any act has been done which violates \u00a7 6.1-249 shall be void and the lender shall not collect, receive, or retain any principal, interest, or charges whatsoever, and any amount paid on account of principal or interest on any such loan shall be recoverable by the person by or for whom payment was made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>This Court has stated that \u201c[a] corporation can act alone through its officers and agents, and where the business itself involves a violation of the law, the correct rule is that all who participate in it are liable.\u201d <em>Crall and Ostrander v. Commonwealth, </em>103 Va. 855, 859, 49 S.E. 638, 640 (1905). <em>See also Bourgeois v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 268, 274, 227 S.E.2d 714, 718 (1976). Relying on these cases, the Commonwealth argues that Greenberg is personally liable for Allstate\u2019s violations of the CFA. Greenberg, however, contends that the trial court erred in using the active participation theory to hold him personally liable because Code \u00a7 6.1-308(B) precludes the imposition of restitution on any individual or entity other than the lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">A resolution of this issue necessarily requires us to examine Code \u00a7 6.1-308(B). At the outset, we note that the CFA is a remedial statute. <em>Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, </em>230 Va. 422, 428, 337 S.E.2d 291, 295 (1985). Consequently, we construe it liberally so as \u201cto avoid the mischief at which it is directed and to advance the remedy for which it was promulgated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In doing so, we cannot, however, deviate from the language of Code \u00a7 6.1-308, which we find to be plain and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Our duty is \u201cto construe the law as it is written.\u201d <em>Hampton Roads Sanitation Dist. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Chesapeake, </em>218 Va. 696, 702, 240 S.E.2d 819, 823 (1978). We assume that \u201cthe legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words . . . .\u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990). \u201cTo depart from the meaning expressed by the words is to alter the statute, to legislate and not to interpret.\u201d <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Town of South Boston, </em>141 Va. 517, 524, 127 S.E. 380, 382 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We agree with Greenberg that Code \u00a7 6.1-308(B) permits a recovery of restitution only from the lender. In Code \u00a7 6.1-308(A), the General Assembly prescribed misdemeanor criminal liability for \u201c[a]ny person and the several members, officers, directors, agents, and employees thereof.\u201d The CFA defines \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201cindividuals, copartnerships, associations, trusts, corporations, and all other legal and commercial entities.\u201d Code \u00a7 6.1-245. Thus, \u201cindividuals, . . . corporations, and all other legal . . . entities\u201d <em>and </em>their \u201cmembers, officers, directors, agents, and employees\u201d are subject to misdemeanor penalties for violating the CFA. The General Assembly explicitly created a broad category of individuals and entities subject to Code \u00a7 6.1-308(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>In contrast to subsection (A), Code \u00a7 6.1-308(B), provides that only the <em>\u201clender </em>shall not collect, receive, or retain any principal, interest, or charges whatsoever, and any amount paid on account of principal or interest on any such loan shall be recoverable by the person by or for whom payment was made.\u201d (Emphasis added). Absent from subsection (B) is the broad category of entities found in subsection (A). In other words, subsection (B) does not include any individual, officer, director, or entity other than the lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">\u201cWhen the General Assembly uses two different terms in the same act, it is presumed to mean two different things.\u201d <em>Forst </em>v. <em>Rockingham Poultry Mktg. Coop. Inc., </em>222 Va. 270, 278, 279 S.E.2d 400, 404 (1981). As evident in subsection (A), the General Assembly knew how to broaden the range of liability, and the absence of any such provisions in subsection (B) indicates the General Assembly\u2019s intent to limit those from whom borrowers may obtain restitution. To determine otherwise would be to rewrite the statute and to contradict the General Assembly\u2019s express intent. Thus, we hold that the trial court erred in using the active participation theory to allow the Commonwealth to recover restitution from Greenberg for Allstate\u2019s violations of the CEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Our decision is not inconsistent with other cases in which we used the active participation theory to impose individual liability on corporate officers or directors. The distinction between such cases and the present one lies in the language of the relevant statutes. For example, in <em>Bourgeois, </em>a corporate officer was found guilty of grand larceny by obtaining money by false pretenses. The statute at issue provided that \u201c[i]f <em>any person </em>obtain, by any false pretense or token, from any person, with intent to defraud, money or other property which may be the subject of larceny, he shall be deemed guilty of larceny thereof; . . . .\u201d <em>Bourgeois, 217 </em>Va. at 269 n.1, 227 S.E.2d at 715 n.1. (Emphasis added). Likewise, in <em>Crall, </em>the corporation\u2019s vice-president was criminally liable under a statute which provided \u201c[a]ny peddler who shall peddle for sale, or sell or barter, without a license, shall pay a fine . . . .\u201d <em>Crall, </em>103 Va. at 858, 49 S.E. at 639. The statute defined \u201cpeddler\u201d as <em>\u201c[a]ny person </em>who shall carry from place to place any goods, wares or merchandise, and offer to sell or barter the same, or actually sells or barters the same . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 857, 49 S.E. at 639. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In contrast to the above two statutes, Code \u00a7 6.1-308(B) permits a recovery of restitution solely from the \u201clender\u201d and does not impose liability on \u201cany person.\u201d Therefore, to allow the Commonwealth to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>obtain restitution from Greenberg would be to invade the province of the legislature and to expand the scope of liability in Code \u00a76.1-308(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">n. PIERCING THE CORPORATE VEIL</p>\n<p id=\"AvX\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Greenberg first became involved in Allstate prior to its incorporation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when Martin and Lynch gave Greenberg a business prospectus and asked him to provide the initial capitalization for Allstate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After consulting about the proposed business venture with his attorney, who did not advise Greenberg of any potential legal problems, Greenberg agreed to loan $60,000 to Allstate interest-free with the understanding that Allstate would repay Greenberg in full within six months.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Martin, Lynch, and Greenberg each had different responsibilities in regard to Allstate\u2019s business. Martin\u2019s responsibilities included developing Allstate\u2019s fee schedules, managing personnel, screening customers, and advertising. Lynch handled all the bookkeeping, accounting, and record-keeping functions. Greenberg was Allstate\u2019s financial consultant for which he received $500 a week as compensation. As the financial consultant, Greenberg addressed start-up and expansion problems and kept \u201ctabs on what [Martin and Lynch] were doing to protect his investment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">However, unlike Martin and Lynch, Greenberg, according to Martin, did not participate in the daily operations of Allstate in any substantial way. Greenberg occasionally visited the four stores, and an Allstate employee testified that during one such visit, Greenberg instructed her not to use the terms \u201cloan,\u201d \u201cinterest,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\u201cadvance\u201d when speaking to customers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At times, Greenberg would also make bank deposits for Allstate and transfer cash between offices. However, these activities were not part of his regular responsibilities and were considered a \u201crare event.\u201d Greenberg did attend meetings of the directors and, occasionally, those of the managers. However, his participation at the meetings with the managers was minimal, and he was considered a \u201cspectator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In late November or early December 1992, Greenberg learned that the Commonwealth had filed suits alleging violations of the CFA by other companies similar to Allstate. After discovering that other \u201ccash-advance\u201d companies had, in response to the suits, initiated a \u201cgift certificate catalogue business,\u201d Greenberg, Martin, and Lynch concluded that Allstate should do the same.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At this point, however, Greenberg decided that he \u201cwant[ed] to get out of the business\u201d and asked for a return of his money.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Allstate then began \u201cwinding down\u201d its business and paid its trade debts and withholding taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">After considering the testimony and exhibits, the trial court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to pierce the corporate veil. In its letter opinion, the court stated that the evidence failed to show \u201cthat Greenberg incorporated [Allstate] for the purpose of disguising his wrongful actions and evading liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">In its assignment of cross-error, the Commonwealth argues that sufficient evidence exists to justify piercing the corporate veil to impose personal liability on Greenberg. The Commonwealth contends, and we agree, that the trial court\u2019s analysis focused only on Greenberg\u2019s intent in incorporating Allstate and failed to address his subsequent use of the corporation. Nevertheless, based upon our review of the record, we conclude that, as a matter of law, the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>dence is insufficient to disregard the corporate structure and impose personal liability on Greenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We have recognized that \u201cno single rule or criterion . . . can be applied to determine whether piercing the corporate veil is justified.\u201d <em>O\u2019Hazza v. Executive Credit Corp., </em>246 Va. 111, 115, 431 S.E.2d 318, 320 (1993). Disregarding the corporate entity is usually warranted if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">[T]he shareholder sought to be held personally liable has controlled or used the corporation to evade a personal obligation, to perpetrate fraud or a crime, to commit an injustice, or to gain an unfair advantage. . . . Piercing the corporate veil is justified when the unity of interest and ownership is such that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual no longer exist and to adhere to that separateness would work an injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\"><em>Id., </em>431 S.E.2d at 320-21. Ultimately, a decision whether to disregard the corporate structure to impose personal liability is a fact-specific determination, and each case requires a close examination of the factual circumstances surrounding the corporation and the questioned acts. <em>Id., </em>431 S.E.2d at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Only \u201can extraordinary exception\u201d will justify disregarding the corporate entity, and no such exception is present here. <em>Cheatle v. Rudd\u2019s Swimming Pool Supply Co., Inc., </em>234 Va. 207, 212, 360 S.E.2d 828, 831 (1987) (quoting <em>Beale v. Kappa Alpha Order and Kappa Alpha Alumni Found., </em>192 Va. 382, 397, 64 S.E.2d 789, 797 (1951)). The evidence showed that Greenberg did not develop Allstate\u2019s policy or procedure; rather, Martin and Lynch approached Greenberg with a business plan detailing Allstate\u2019s operation. Further, Greenberg, before becoming Allstate\u2019s majority shareholder, sought advice from his counsel regarding the legality of the proposed business. Thus, the trial court correctly concluded that Greenberg did not incorporate Allstate for the purpose of disguising wrongful actions or concealing a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Nor did Greenberg use the company to \u201cevade a personal obligation, to perpetrate fraud or a crime, to commit an injustice, or to gain an unfair advantage.\u201d <em>O\u2019Hazza, </em>246 Va. at 115, 431 S.E.2d at 320. He did not determine the amount of or collect Allstate\u2019s fees, solicit customers, or handle employment matters. At most, as Allstate\u2019s financial consultant, he addressed start-up and expansion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>issues. When Greenberg instructed an employee not to use the words \u201cloan\u201d or \u201cinterest,\u201d he did so because of advice he had received from his attorney. He also sought legal advice before Allstate implemented the gift certificate program. Finally, in recouping his loan to Allstate, Greenberg received interest only after Allstate could not abide by its initial agreement to repay the loan in six months and increased the amount of the interest only after other investors started receiving the higher rate. Thus, the evidence, as a matter of law, establishes that Greenberg, like any other shareholder, used the corporate structure to limit his liability to his initial investment and not to perpetrate or disguise illegal activities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In other words, Greenberg did not use the corporate structure \u201cto mask wrongs\u201d or to facilitate the commission of illegal acts. <em>Bogese, Inc. v. State Highway and Transp. Comm\u2019r, </em>250 Va. 226, 231, 462 S.E.2d 345, 348 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Therefore, for the reasons stated, we will affirm in part and reverse in part the circuit court\u2019s judgment, and enter final judgment in favor of Greenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\"> The version of Code \u00a7 6.1-249 in effect in 1993 provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">No person shall engage in the business of lending in amounts of the then established size of loan ceiling or less, and charge, contract for, or receive, directly or indirectly, on or in connection with any loan, any interest, charges, compensation, consideration or expense which in the aggregate are greater than the rate otherwise permitted by law except as provided in and authorized by this chapter and without first having obtained a license from the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The General Assembly amended this section in 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-11\"> The Commonwealth also included Martin and Lynch in its suit.
