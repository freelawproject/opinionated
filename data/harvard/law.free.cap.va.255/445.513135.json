The trustees had been directors of the corporation, which operated a hospital in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">A brief summary of the relevant business activities of the hospital directors will set the stage for this discussion. Jefferson Memorial Hospital, Inc. (JMHI), was chartered originally as a for-profit, stock corporation in Maryland in 1963. In 1964, the corporation amended its charter to become a nonprofit, nonstock charitable entity; it began operations as an acute-care hospital in Alexandria on March 15, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">In April 1969, the federal Internal Revenue Service began an investigation leading to revocation of JMHI\u2019s tax-exempt status, retroactive to November 1,1965. In 1971, the corporation\u2019s directors attempted to \u201cmerge\u201d JMHI into a for-profit Delaware corporation, Jefferson Memorial Hospital Corporation (JMHC). There was an effort to dissolve JMHI and to transfer its assets and liabilities to JMHC, of which JMHI\u2019s directors would serve as directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>In April 1973, Maryland ordered JMHI\u2019s corporate charter forfeited \u201cfor failure to file the necessary corporate personal property report or failure to pay any late filing penalties due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In 1974, the directors retained counsel \u201cto represent the Hospital in looking after and insuring that the Hospital Corporate structure for the past, present, and for the immediate future, be handled so as to insure that everything is legally correct and in keeping with the best interest of the investors of the Hospital,\u201d according to JMHC\u2019s minutes. Counsel testified that he was \u201casked to rectify the problem that had arisen because a supposed merger in \u201971 had not been done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Unaware that Maryland had revoked JMHI\u2019s charter, counsel had the directors declare JMHI insolvent and approve transfer of JMHI\u2019s assets to JMHC. In January 1975, JMHC\u2019s directors authorized purchase of the assets and assumption of the liabilities. The directors of JMHC, believing they had assembled all the assets of the former charity into the for-profit corporation, agreed to transfer all JMHC\u2019s \u201cassets\u201d to appellant Laszlo N. Tauber as trustee for appellant Jefferson Memorial Hospital Joint Venture (JMHJV), a partnership in which those assets apparently still reside. The directors also agreed to lease back from the partnership the transferred assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">In July 1996, the present suit was instituted by the Commonwealth of Virginia, <em>ex rel. </em>the Attorney General of Virginia and the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney for the City of Alexandria. The defendants are Tauber and nine other named physicians, \u201ceach individually and as a former director, of [JMHI] . . . and/or as partners in Jefferson Memorial Hospital Associates, or [JMHJV], and/or directors or shareholders of [JMHC] (a Delaware Corporation now known as \u2018Jefferson Corporation of Alexandria\u2019)\u201d; Jefferson Memorial Hospital Associates; JMHJV; and Jefferson Corporation of Alexandria. A prior suit had been commenced by the Attorney General against the same defendants in April 1995, but was nonsuited during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">In the present suit, the plaintiffs filed a 112-paragraph, 40-page, three-count bill of complaint. They alleged that funds and assets received by the defendants as directors and trustees of a charitable corporation \u201cwere misappropriated and diverted\u201d contrary to law that requires such funds to be used only for charitable purposes, \u201cand not for private inurement.\u201d The plaintiffs then recited in detail the defendants\u2019 alleged business activities in connection with the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">In count one, the plaintiffs alleged the \u201cpurported merger between JMHI and JMHC in 1971 never took place,\u201d and the \u201csubsequent purported transfers of the property of JMHI were likewise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>null and void.\u201d Asserting \u201cJMHI was and is a non-stock foreign corporation whose assets are located in the Commonwealth\u201d and are subject to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction, the plaintiffs asked the court: to declare \u201cthat the purposes for which JMHI was created have been frustrated and are no longer capable of being accomplished by virtue of\u201d the defendants\u2019 conduct; to declare that legal title to JMHTs assets remain in JMHI; to order that an appropriate custodian gather the assets of the former JMHI and administer them under the court\u2019s supervision; to require that defendants account for the money or other value received in the transactions and that defendants be surcharged for the charitable assets they usurped in the amount of at least $40 million; and to enter judgment against defendants as a result of \u201ctheir conversion, misappropriation, or appropriation of the charitable assets\u201d described.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In count two, the plaintiffs sought similar relief and also asked the court \u201cto impose a constructive trust upon the Hospital, its land, equipment and any other assets,\u201d as well as upon settlement proceeds being paid by an entity which, in 1985, negotiated with JMHJV to buy the right to operate the hospital and its assets as a going concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In count three, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare that \u201cthe corporate opportunities of JMHI have been usurped\u201d by the defendants; that the defendants be required \u201cto account for and disgorge all sums usurped;\u201d that the court impress upon any future sums defendants may receive \u201can appropriate judgement or trust to secure the interests of the beneficiaries of JMHI, and, if necessary, to refer the matter to a Commissioner in Chancery for an appropriate accounting and charging order against JMHJV.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">After the chancellor overruled their demurrer and plea in bar, defendants answered the bill of complaint. They generally denied the allegations, asserting the plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief prayed for, or to any other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The cause was heard ore tenus in January 1997. The parties had stipulated that the trial in the present suit was to commence where the prior trial terminated, and that the record of all proceedings in the prior suit is to be a part of the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Following the trial, the chancellor filed a memorandum opinion ruling that the plaintiffs are entitled to relief sought in the bill of complaint. In a March 1997 decree, from which we awarded defendants this appeal, the court declared that the assets and liabilities of JMHI \u201cbe, reside and remain with [defendants] as trustees and fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>ther that a constructive trust be . . . imposed on such assets and liabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The court also ordered that a custodian \u201cbe appointed with exclusive jurisdiction to hold and administer the said assets and liabilities.\u201d Additionally, the court ordered defendants to submit \u201ca full and complete accounting of all assets and liabilities that are the subject of this Decree.\u201d Finally, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cclaim for monetary damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">On appeal, defendants contend the trial court erred \u201cwhen it concluded that the Attorney General has authority to bring this suit.\u201d The chancellor ruled \u201cthat the Attorney General has standing and authority to bring this action both at common law and pursuant to\u201d Code \u00a7 13.1-909(B). The trial court is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">We need address only the common law. This Court long ago recognized the common law authority of the Attorney General to act on behalf of the public in matters involving charitable assets. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>91 Va. 421, 427-28, 22 S.E. 175, 177 (1895). Indeed, this authority has received legislative recognition as recently as last year. During its 1997 session, the General Assembly granted the Attorney General additional specific powers with respect to the disposition of assets by nonprofit health care entities. Acts 1997, ch. 615. These powers were granted \u201cin order that the Attorney General may exercise his common law and statutory authority over the activities of these organizations.\u201d Code \u00a7 55-532.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Next, defendants argue the chancellor erred in mling that Code \u00a7 55-29 provides authority for the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney of the City of Alexandria to be a proper party to the claims asserted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Code \u00a7 55-29 (1995 Repl. Vol.) provides, as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">\u201cWhen any such gift, grant or will is recorded and no trustee has been appointed, or the trustee dies or refuses to act, the circuit court ... of the city in which the trust subject or any part thereof is, in the case of a gift or grant, or in which the will is recorded, may, on motion of the attorney for the Commonwealth in such court (whose duty it shall be to make such motion), appoint one or more trustees to carry the same into execution. ... In enforcing the execution of any such trust a suit may be maintained against the trustees in the name of the Commonwealth when there is no other party capable of prosecuting such suit. The term <em>\u2018trustees' </em>as herein used shall be construed to mean the persons, or governing body, charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>with the execution of the trust, whether designated as \u2018trustees,\u2019 \u2018directors\u2019 or otherwise. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The phrase \u201cany such gift, grant or will\u201d refers to Code \u00a7 55-26.1, which provides, \u201cEvery gift . . . made hereafter for charitable purposes, whether made in any case to a body corporate or unincorporated . . . shall be as valid as if made to or for the benefit of a certain natural person. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The foregoing provisions are not limited to express trusts arising by virtue of written instruments, as defendants argue, but apply, as here, when the assets of JMHI passed automatically to its directors as formal trustees of the charitable organization in liquidation. Thus, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney is a proper party to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Parenthetically, because the defendants seem to raise this issue on brief, we note that use of the word \u201crecorded\u201d in the first clause of the first sentence of \u00a7 55-29 refers to recorded wills, and not to any requirement that gifts or grants also be recorded. This is made clear later in the same sentence where there is specific reference to \u201cin which the will is recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Next, we shall turn to the merits. A detailed recitation of the evidence gleaned from this record would serve no useful purpose. On appeal, the defendants primarily seek to have us annul factual findings of the chancellor. The evidence, except for opinions of experts, was not in dispute; defendants urge us to invalidate the legitimate inferences drawn by the trial court from those proven facts. This tactic will not succeed upon appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">The findings of a chancellor, hearing evidence ore tenus, carry the weight of a jury verdict. <em>Giannotti </em>v. <em>Hamway, </em>239 Va. 14, 23, 387 S.E.2d 725, 730 (1990). A judgment based upon such findings will not be annulled on appeal \u201cunless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-680. And, the plaintiffs\u2019 burden is to prove these allegations by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Baylor </em>v. <em>Beverly Book Co., </em>216 Va. 22, 24, 216 S.E.2d 18, 19 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Upon review we shall recite the facts, including the legitimate inferences flowing from those facts, in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, who prevailed below. In the early 1960s, following acquisition of real estate by deed and lease by King Street Joint Venture, held by defendant Tauber as trustee, JMHI was formed to transact the business of operating a hospital. This Maryland corporation was authorized to do business in Virginia in 1963. Following the March 1965 opening, the hospital experienced \u201cproblem[sj all the time,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>although an expansion allowing addition of 24 beds occurred in 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In 1970, during the Internal Revenue Service investigation, an attorney was retained to review \u201cthe current corporate status of the hospital.\u201d Counsel recommended \u201ca complete reorganization of the hospital and its affiliates,\u201d establishment of \u201ca new profit corporation with the same name,\u201d and \u201cthat the old non-profit corporation be merged into it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The Delaware for-profit corporation, JMHC, was formed in 1971 and a supposed merger was arranged. This merger was reported on tax returns filed in 1972, but the record is devoid of documents to support such a transaction. However, Dr. Tauber, who mainly orchestrated the myriad transactions involved in this case, testified, \u201cIn my own mind, [the merger] was completed.\u201d The chancellor said no evidence had been presented to show due diligence was used at that time to protect the interests of the beneficiaries of the charitable hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The basis of the 1972 Internal Revenue Service ruling revoking JMHI\u2019s tax-exempt status was: \u201cThe hospital sold 8% bonds to various doctors and individuals in exchange for their 6% demand notes and did not enforce collection of such demand notes. Other hospital bonds were sold to the general public at 8% for cash. Some of the doctors receiving the 8% bonds in exchange for their 6% demand notes were officers, directors, and staff members of the hospital. Issuance of 8% bonds to these doctors and failure to enforce collection of the demand notes received in exchange resulted in <em>inurement of income to private </em>individuals.\u201d This was a violation of the applicable provision of the Internal Revenue Code allowing exemption of charities from federal income taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In 1974, after another attorney had been retained \u201cto rectify the problem that had arisen\u201d because of the putative merger, documents indicate that JMHC assumed the charity\u2019s liabilities in return for receipt of JMHI\u2019s assets. The charity was to receive 5,000 shares of JMHC stock, but no such transfer was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The record amply supports the following findings of the chancellor. \u201cThere are numerous transactions shown, some of-record and some not, dealing with the real estate, the equipment, the leases, and the use of tax benefits. The transactions show an entire course of self-dealing by the directors of the charity. They were able to acquire interests in the real estate, the equipment and lease, and were able to use tax benefits belonging to the former charity to enhance the gain of the for-profit corporation. The record is replete with discussions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>among [defendants] as to their personal profits and gains with no reference to the best interests of the beneficiaries nor of the charitable corporation. The result was the total obliteration of the nonprofit corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">A transaction illustrative of the foregoing conclusions involves a subdivision of the hospital\u2019s real estate in 1970. The charity\u2019s 65% undivided interest was lost and, in its place, the charity obtained a 20% interest consisting of an allocated parcel. Also, after the nonprofit corporation was dissolved by Maryland authorities in 1973, defendants caused the filing of an annual report with the State Corporation Commission of Virginia that JMHI remained in good standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">As the chancellor found, deals were \u201cconvoluted and complex with off-record real estate transactions conflicting with the state of the title as shown on-record. Net operating losses were used as tax deductions by JMHC that had become deductions [as] a result of the revocation of JMHI\u2019s tax exempt status. When [defendants] had exhausted these deductions, they began seeking ways to benefit their own tax status through a complicated series of notes and bonds, and while some personal risk was taken, the [defendants] and others were participating in the venture in basically a risk-free manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Defendants claimed in the trial court that JMHI had no value in 1971 and, thus, the transactions by which they assumed control of its corporate assets by the assumption of its liabilities were \u201cfair.\u201d Responding, the chancellor determined that JMHI \u201chad value as a \u2018going concern\u2019 \u201d when the effort was made to change to a for-profit corporation. But the court concluded that defendants\u2019 expert testimony was more persuasive than plaintiffs\u2019 and that \u201cthe value of the corporation did not exceed its liabilities.\u201d \u201cHowever,\u201d the chancellor ruled, \u201cthis does not constitute a defense to the claims made here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The defendants\u2019 contentions regarding the merits of the suit, including the arguments advanced by amici curiae supporting defendants, are premised upon several erroneous conclusions. For example, defendants believe the trial court recognized that a legally valid \u201ctransaction\u201d of some sort occurred in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Defendants\u2019 description of the nature of this binding \u201ctransaction\u201d has evolved from \u201cmerger,\u201d to \u201creorganization,\u201d and finally, during oral argument of the appeal, to \u201cacquisition.\u201d Also, defendants and their supporters think this case involves the improper meddling by the Commonwealth into the internal affairs of a Maryland corporation, contrary to settled law and violative of the Full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Faith and Credit, Due Process, and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution. This case involves none of the above.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The trial court determined that no transaction in the nature of a merger or reorganization took place in 1971. The chancellor ruled that \u201cno merger of JMHI and JMHC has occurred and that the transactions by directors of JMHI are void, the assets remained in JMHI until its dissolution. At the time of dissolution, these assets passed into and remain in the hands of [defendants] as trustees.\u201d This ruling is fully supported by the applicable law and the uncontradicted evidence, most of which was created by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Because the 1971 \u201ctransaction\u201d never occurred, the 1973 revocation of JMHTs corporate charter converted its directors by operation of law to trustees in dissolution under Maryland law. Md. Code Ann., Corporations Art. 23, \u00a7 78(a) (1957); <em>Cloverfields Improvement Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Seabreeze Properties, Inc., </em>373 A.2d 935, 939-40 (Md. 1977). Virginia law was and is the same. <em>See </em>former Code \u00a7 13.1-254 (1973 Repl. Vol.); present Code \u00a7 13.1-915 (1993 Repl. Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The charter revocation terminated JMHI\u2019s corporate existence and powers, and it could no longer function as a corporation. <em>Cloverfields Improvement Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Seabreeze Properties, Inc., 362 </em>A.2d 675, 679 (Md. App. 1976). From that day forward, the defendants\u2019 actions purportedly taken as corporate officers, and not done to wind up or liquidate the business, were without effect because there was no corporation for which to act. The corporate assets had automatically transferred to the directors as trustees. <em>Cloverfields, 362 </em>A.2d at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Under Maryland law, property of a charitable corporation is held in trust for the public. <em>Inasmuch Gospel Mission, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mercantile Trust Co. of Baltimore, </em>40 A.2d 506, 510 (Md. 1945). Virginia law is the same. \u201cThe corporation was organized for charitable or benevolent or literary purposes. Contributions made to it and the assets realized therefrom were dedicated to those purposes and stamped with a public interest by the charter, the laws of this State, sound reason and public policy. The members acquired no property rights in, nor were they equitably entitled to such assets, either during the lifetime of the corporation or upon dissolution. To hold otherwise would convert the public nature and purpose of the corporation into a vehicle for the personal pecuniary gain of the members.\u201d <em>Hanshaw </em>v. <em>Day, </em>202 Va. 818, 824, 120 S.E.2d 460, 464 (1961). Thus, the defendants\u2019 contentions that this litigation, dealing with appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>ation of charitable assets by directors for their personal gain, involves impermissible interference by Virginia with the internal affairs of a foreign corporation, or that a \u201cfairness\u201d doctrine should be applied to the 1971 activities, are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Accordingly, the circuit court properly exercised its authority to insure that these assets, now held by the defendants as trustees in liquidation, are distributed in accord with the charitable purposes to which they should have been devoted. This power to liquidate the assets and business of a nonstock corporation may be exercised over the property within the court\u2019s jurisdiction \u201cof a foreign corporation that has ceased to exist.\u201d Code \u00a7 13.1-909(B). <em>See </em>former Code \u00a7 13.1-257(e) (1973 Repl. Vol.). The corporate facilities were located solely within this State in Alexandria.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Thus, we hold the trial court did not err in taking charge of the liquidation of the assets of this dissolved foreign corporation, and in providing the relief outlined in the order from which this appeal was taken. This record clearly demonstrates that the directors of JMHI, now trustees in dissolution, have failed and refused to execute the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Finally, we have considered, and reject, defendants\u2019 other arguments. Only one of those contentions merits discussion. Defendants argue the trial court erred in not sustaining its plea based on the doctrine of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Laches may not be pled successfully as a defense in an equitable proceeding to bar the State from asserting a claim on behalf of the public. <em>Board of Supervisors of Tazewell County </em>v. <em>Norfolk and W. Ry. Co., </em>119 Va. 763, 790, 91 S.E. 124, 133 (1916). <em>Accord City of Manassas </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of Prince William County, </em>250 Va. 126, 132, 458 S.E.2d 568, 571 (1995). <em>See Dick Kelly Enter. </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>243 Va. 373, 381, 416 S.E.2d 680, 685 (1992). As we already have said, this cause is brought by the Commonwealth on behalf of the public to hold and administer charitable assets. Hence, laches does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Consequently, we will affirm the judgment appealed from, an interlocutory decree adjudicating the principles of the cause, and we will remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
