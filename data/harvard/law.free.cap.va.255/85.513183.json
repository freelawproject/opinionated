In response to a sheriff deputy\u2019s inquiry whether any students had weapons in their possession, Brian gave the deputy a pocketknife. The deputy gave the pocketknife to a school chaperon, and when Brian returned to school, the chaperon took him to the assistant principal\u2019s office. Curtis Shelton, an assistant principal, asked Brian \u201cwhat happened\u201d and told him to \u201cwrite a brief statement on a sheet of paper.\u201d Brian gave a written statement that he did not intend to take the pocketknife to school, that he placed the knife in his pants pocket the night before the field trip, and that he forgot that the knife was in his pants pocket until the deputy asked if any students had any weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">After hearing Brian\u2019s version of the incident, Shelton suspended Brian from school for 10 days for violating the Henry County Public School Code of Student Conduct which prohibits students from possessing knives at school-sponsored events. Shelton contacted Brian\u2019s mother, by telephone, and informed her of the incident and the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">On March 4, 1996, Robert C. Vogler, director of pupil personnel for the Henry County Public Schools, sent a notice to Brian\u2019s parents, Larry E. and LaVonne W. Wood, informing them that the Bassett High School administration had recommended that Brian appear before the committee for the control of school discipline \u201cto determine if there [was] sufficient cause to recommend to the Superintendent that Brian be excluded from attending Henry County Public Schools.\u201d The notice advised Brian\u2019s parents of a hearing date and location and cited the appropriate policies in the code of student conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Brian, his parents, and their attorney appeared at a hearing before the committee and presented evidence to the committee. The Woods\u2019 attorney participated in this hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The committee decided to recommend to the Henry County Public School Board that Brian be expelled from school. Brian remained on suspension pending official action by the School Board. The committee informed Brian and his parents of its decision and advised them that they had a right to appeal the committee\u2019s recommendation to J. David Martin, Superintendent of the Henry County Public Schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Brian appealed the recommendation of expulsion to the superintendent. During that appeal, Brian was asked to discuss the events surrounding his possession of the pocketknife, and his parents were asked if they had anything they would like to say. Brian\u2019s parents, as well as his attorney, made statements to the superintendent. By letter dated March 22, 1996, the superintendent informed the Woods that \u201c[i]t appeared from the affidavits and testimony that the incident of possession of a weapon on a field trip from Bassett High School did constitute sufficient cause for action beyond the disciplinary options used by the school. It is accordingly decided that the recommendation of an expulsion be made to the full [Sjchool [B]oard and that Brian remain suspended from the Henry County Public Schools pending official action by the [S]chool [B]oard.\u201d The superintendent also informed the Woods that Brian had a right to a hearing before the School Board and that they could be represented by an attorney. The superintendent also notified the Woods of the date, time, and location of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The School Board conducted an evidentiary hearing to consider the superintendent\u2019s recommendation. The superintendent presented evidence, and the Woods\u2019 attorney cross-examined him. Mr. Wood testified at the hearing, and the Woods\u2019 lawyer argued on behalf of Brian. The School Board considered the evidence and argument of the Woods\u2019 attorney, and found that Brian had violated the school division\u2019s policy which prohibits students from possessing knives at school-sponsored events as well as Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-277.01, 18.2-308, and -308.1 which prohibit students from possessing firearms or weapons on school property. The School Board, among other things, voted to expel Brian.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>in.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Brian, by and through his next friends, Larry and LaVonne Wood, filed a petition pursuant to Code \u00a7 22.1-87<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against the Henry County Public Schools. Brian alleged that the Henry County Public Schools had violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process when he was suspended and subsequently expelled from the Henry County Public Schools. The school division filed an answer denying that it had violated Brian\u2019s due process rights. The trial court considered evidence, legal memoranda, and argument of counsel and, on August 5, 1996, entered a judgment which set aside Brian\u2019s expulsion because the School Board had erroneously decided that a pocketknife was a firearm within the intendment of Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-277.01, 18.2-308(A), and -308.1. The trial court did not disturb the School Board\u2019s finding that Brian had violated the Code of Student Conduct which prohibits students from bringing knives to school-sponsored events.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The court remanded the proceeding to the School Board for reconsideration of punishment. The School Board convened to reconsider Brian\u2019s punishment without notice to Brian or his parents and decided that it would not change Brian\u2019s punishment. The trial court entered a final judgment, Brian appeals, and the school division assigns cross-error.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Brian argues that the school division deprived him of his due process rights on numerous occasions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, Brian contends that he was deprived of his due process rights when the assistant principal initially suspended him. Next, Brian claims that his due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>rights were violated because, he says, he was not given sufficient notice of the hearing before the disciplinary committee. Brian also asserts that his appeal from the decision of the disciplinary committee to the superintendent of schools did not comport with due process. We find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The Commonwealth has conferred upon school boards, which are created pursuant to art. VIII, \u00a7 7, of the Constitution of Virginia, broad authority to prescribe and enforce standards of conduct in schools. This authority, however, must be exercised consistently with constitutional safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The United States Supreme Court articulated the, principles that we must apply in this appeal in <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 574 (1975). There, the Court stated that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\u201cState is constrained to recognize a student\u2019s legitimate entitlement to a public education as a property interest which is protected by the Due Process Clause and which may not be taken away for misconduct without adherence to the minimum procedures required by that Clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Thus, a student charged with misconduct may not be suspended from a public school without the minimum procedures required by the due process clause. Explaining the requirements of due process, the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">\u201c \u2018The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard,\u2019 <em>Grannis </em>v. <em>Ordean, </em>234 U.S. 385, 394 (1914), a right that \u2018has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to . . . contest.\u2019 ... At the very minimum, therefore, students facing suspension and the consequent interference with a protected property interest must be given <em>some </em>kind of notice and afforded <em>some </em>kind of hearing. \u2018Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be notified.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">The Supreme Court also held in <em>Goss </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">\u201c[s]tudents facing temporary suspension have interests qualifying for protection of the Due Process Clause, and due process requires, in connection with a suspension of 10 days or less, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story. The Clause requires at least these rudimentary precautions against unfair or mistaken findings of misconduct and arbitrary exclusion from school.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Applying these principles, we hold that the Henry County Public School division did not abridge Brian\u2019s due process rights. The assistant principal, who initially suspended Brian, gave him an opportunity to explain his version of the facts, and Brian was informed of \u201cwhat he is accused of doing and ... the basis of the accusation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The committee for the control of school discipline also afforded Brian due process. That committee forwarded a notice to Brian\u2019s parents that he committed a \u201csevere breach of the conduct code at Bassett High School\u201d and referred to a policy which states that a student shall not possess, handle, or transmit a knife while at school or during an off-site school-sponsored activity. Without question, Brian, his parents, and their attorney knew the reasons Brian had been suspended and that the committee was conducting a hearing to determine whether Brian should be expelled. Additionally, as we have already mentioned, Brian, his parents, and their attorney participated during the hearing before the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The superintendent did not abridge Brian\u2019s due process rights. The Woods requested an appeal to the superintendent \u201cdue to a weapons violation.\u201d The Woods were informed of the date and time for this appeal, and Brian, his parents, and their attorney were given an opportunity to make whatever statements they deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Brian argues that even if the school division accorded him his procedural due process rights, the school division should not be permitted to promulgate policies that require suspension or expulsion of students who possess knives on school property. We find no merit in this contention. Neither the school division\u2019s policies nor the Federal Gun-Free School Act with which Code \u00a7 22.1-277.01(A) complies, divests the School Board of its authority to impose a punishment less severe than expulsion. Moreover, a school division is permitted to suspend or expel a student for possession of a dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>weapon on school property or at school-sponsored events provided that the school division does not abridge a student\u2019s constitutional or statutory rights. <em>See Mitchell </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Oxford, </em>625 F.2d 660, 664-65 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Kolesnick </em>v. <em>Omaha Pub. Sch. Dist., </em>558 N.W.2d 807, 813 (Neb. 1997). In this instance, Brian fails to identify any statutory or constitutional right that the Henry County Public School division has purportedly violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">As we have already stated, the trial court set aside the School Board\u2019s initial decision to expel Brian and remanded the proceeding, by an order dated August 5, 1996, to the School Board because the School Board erroneously concluded that Brian\u2019s knife was a firearm under Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-277.01, 18.2-308.1, and -308(A). Brian argues that the school division violated his due process rights because, upon remand, the School Board failed to give him notice and an opportunity to be present at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">After the trial court remanded this proceeding, the School Board decided it would expel Brian, and the trial court entered a final judgment which dismissed the proceeding. Brian\u2019s counsel objected to this final judgment \u201cfor the reason stated on the order dated August 5, 1996,\u201d which was the order that remanded the matter to the School Board. Brian\u2019s objections to the August 5, 1996 order did not, and could not, contain an objection on the basis that he was not given adequate notice of the School Board\u2019s hearing on remand because the date of that hearing had not yet been fixed. Brian did not make any objection in the record to the School Board\u2019s failure to give him notice of the second hearing. Accordingly, this argument is procedurally barred. Rule 5:25.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">As previously noted, the School Board concluded at Brian\u2019s first hearing that he had violated, among other things, Code \u00a7 22.1-277.01, which prohibits a student from possessing a firearm on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>school property. The trial court held that the School Board misapplied Code \u00a7 22.1-277.01, and the school division assigns cross-error to this determination. Essentially, the school division asserts that a \u201cpocketknife\u201d is a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-277.01, 18.2-308, and -308.1. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Code \u00a7 22.1-277.01 (A) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">\u201cIn compliance with the federal Improving America\u2019s Schools Act of 1994 (Part F \u2014 \u201cGun-Free Schools Act of 1994\u201d), a school board shall expel from school attendance for a period of not less than one year any student whom such school board has determined, ... to have brought a firearm onto school property or to a school-sponsored activity as prohibited by \u00a7 18.2-308.1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.1 states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">\u201cIf any person has in his possession any . . . weapon . . . designated in subsection A of \u00a7 18.2-308 upon (i) the property of any public . . . elementary, middle or high school, including buildings and grounds, (ii) that portion of any property open to the public used for school-sponsored functions or extracurricular activities while such functions or activities are taking place, or (iii) any school bus owned or operated by any such school, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) defines the word \u201cweapon\u201d to include, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cany dirk, bowie knife, switchblade knife, ballistic knife ... or . . . any weapon of like kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Contrary to the school division\u2019s assertion, the pocketknife that Brian had in his possession does not constitute a firearm within the meaning of these statutes. We stated in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 298, 301-02, 295 S.E.2d 890, 892-93 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-10\">\u201cUnder the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>when a particular class of persons or things is enumerated in a statute and general words follow, the general words are to be restricted in their meaning to a sense analogous to the less general, particular words. <em>East Coast Freight Lines </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>194 Va. 517, 525, 74 S.E.2d 283, 288 (1953); <em>Rockingham Bureau </em>v. <em>Harrisonburg, </em>171 Va. 339, 344, 198 S.E. 908, 911 (1938). Likewise, according to the maxim <em>noscitur a sociis </em>(associated words) when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>general and specific words are grouped, the general words are limited by the specific and will be construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those things identified by the specific words. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>United Airlines, </em>219 Va. 374, 389, 248 S.E.2d 124, 132-33 (1978); <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>216 Va. 369, 374, n.5, 218 S.E.2d 735, 740, n.5 (1975).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Applying these principles, we hold that Brian\u2019s pocketknife is not a firearm because a pocketknife is neither a dirk, bowie knife, switchblade knife, ballistic knife, nor a weapon of like kind.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-16\"> The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states in relevant part that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\"> The School Board\u2019s decision states: \u201c[T]he Board accepted] the recommendation of the Superintendent that the student be expelled for 365 days provided that the student may return for the [19]96-[19]97 school year if he remains of good behavior and provided further that, number one; the student be provided homebound instruction for the remainder of this school year and number two; that if the student is of good behavior and does not violate the Code of Student [CJonduct for the remainder of the 365 day period, that this action of the [School] Board and the original suspension be expunged from the student\u2019s record, and number three; that if the student violates the Code of Student Conduct dining the 365 day period, he will be expelled for the remainder of the original 365 day period.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\"> Code \u00a7 22.1-87 states: \u201cAny parent, custodian, or legal guardian of a pupil attending the public schools in a school division who is aggrieved by an action of the school board may, within thirty days after such action, petition the circuit court having jurisdiction in the school division to review the action of the school board. Such review shall proceed upon the petition, the minutes of the meeting at which the school board\u2019s action was taken, the orders, if any, of the school board, an attested copy of the transcript, if any, of any hearing before the school board, and any other evidence found relevant to the issues on appeal by the court. The action of the school board shall be sustained unless the school board exceeded its authority, acted arbitrarily or capriciously, or abused its discretion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b110-11\"> Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-277 and 22.1-277.01 confer certain statutory rights upon a student subject to expulsion or suspension by a school board. Brian does not contend, however, that the school division contravened his statutory rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b113-10\"> Brian raises the following arguments that we do not consider because he failed to raise them in the trial court, Rule 5:25: Brian was denied due process because Shelton was a member of the committee for the control of school discipline; the School Board was required to provide Brian a more expeditious review of his suspension and subsequent expulsion; Brian was excluded from the educational process because he did not receive any homebound instruction until after the School Board\u2019s hearing, more than 30 days after his initial hearing; and the trial court lacked the authority to remand this case to the School Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b115-8\"> A \u201cdirk\u201d is defined as \u201ca long straight-bladed dagger formerly carried [especially] by the Scottish Highlandersf,] 2. a short sword formerly worn by British junior naval officers.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International </em>Dictionary, 642 (1981).
