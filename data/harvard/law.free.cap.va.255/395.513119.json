We next determine whether the denial of a permit required by the City\u2019s Coastal Primary Sand Dune Zoning Ordinance (the Ordinance) constitutes a regulatory taking and thereby requires the City to compensate the property owner for the value of the property taken. Because the denial of the permit was pursuant to the City\u2019s Ordinance, the City is a proper defendant. However, because the City\u2019s Ordinance pre-dates the owner\u2019s acquisition of the property, the denial of the permit does not constitute a compensable taking. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">The General Assembly enacted the Coastal Primary Sand Dune Protection Act (the Dune Act) in 1980. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-13.21 to -13.28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The policy behind the Dune Act is to \u201cpreserve and protect coastal primary sand dunes and beaches and to prevent their despoliation and destruction and whenever practical to accommodate necessary economic development in a manner consistent with the protection of such features.\u201d Code \u00a7 62.1-13.21. The Dune Act contains a model ordinance which certain local governments, including the City, could adopt. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 62.1-13.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">In 1980, the City passed the Ordinance, which mirrors the Dune Act\u2019s model ordinance. <em>See </em>Va. Beach Code \u00a7\u00a7 1600-1619. The Ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>nance regulates the use and development of coastal primary sand dunes and requires developers who wish to \u201cuse or alter any coastal primary sand dune within this city\u201d to obtain a permit from the Virginia Beach Wetlands Board (the Wetlands Board). Va. Beach Code \u00a7 1603. If the Wetlands Board denies the permit application, the applicant may either resubmit the application in modified form or seek review by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC). <em>See </em>Va. Beach Code \u00a7 1608(c); Code \u00a7 62.1-13.27.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The instant appeal involves two parcels of land, lots 21 and 22, located seaward of the primary coastal dune on the Chesapeake Bay shore. In 1979, Seawall Enterprises, Inc. (Seawall), a corporation in which Richardson C. Bell (Bell) and his wife owned 50% of the stock, bought the two parcels. When Seawall purchased lots 21 and 22, neither the Dune Act nor the Ordinance was in existence. Seawall intended to develop residential houses on the lots and attempted to do so in 1979; however, the City did not approve the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">When Seawall dissolved, Bell and his wife received title to lots 21 and 22 by a deed dated August 5, 1982. In late 1982, Bell submitted to the City an application to develop lots 21 and 22, but the City did not approve the 1982 plan either. In 1992, Bell again submitted a development plan for the two lots.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The City informed Bell that he first had to submit the plan to the Wetlands Board and obtain a dune permit as required by the Ordinance. However, upon his pursuit of such a permit, the Wetlands Board denied Bell\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">After the Wetlands Board\u2019s denial, Bell appealed to the VMRC, which also denied Bell\u2019s application. Bell then appealed to the court below, and on November 3, 1993, the court affirmed VMRC\u2019s decision. By that time, the Bells had divorced, and in a deed dated March 17, 1993, Bell and his wife transferred lots 21 and 22 to the Bell Land Trust. Bell is currently the trustee of that trust.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In August 1995, the Trustee filed an amended motion for judgment against the City. In the motion, the Trustee alleged that the Wetlands Board\u2019s denial of Bell\u2019s application for a permit deprived lots 21 and 22 of all economically beneficial use and therefore constituted a regulatory taking in violation of Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>stitution of Virginia. The Trustee thus sought compensation from the City for the value of the property taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">A jury trial was held in January 1997. The City moved to strike the evidence at the conclusion of the Trustee\u2019s evidence as well as at the conclusion of all the evidence. The trial court denied both motions, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Trustee, awarding damages of $110,000 plus interest. The City filed a motion to set aside the verdict, which die court denied. The trial court then entered judgment in favor of the Trustee. The City appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The first issue is whether the City is a proper defendant. \u201cIt is axiomatic that a plaintiff has the duty to name the proper parties as defendants . . . .\u201d <em>Lake </em>v. <em>Northern Virginia Women\u2019s Medical Center, Inc., </em>253 Va. 255, 260, 483 S.E.2d 220, 222 (1997). The City contends that it is not a proper defendant because when it adopted the Ordinance, it was implementing state policy. The City also posits that the Wetlands Board, in denying Bell\u2019s application, was acting pursuant to the Dune Act and was therefore also implementing state policy. Consequentiy, under this theory, the denial of the permit constituted state action. In sum, the City argues that since the City had minimal involvement with the regulation of lots 21 and 22, the City is not a proper defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">We reject these contentions. First, the City enacted the Ordinance with the stated intent to \u201cregulat[e] the use and development of coastal primary sand dunes.\u201d Va. Beach Code \u00a7 1600. Thus, the restriction imposed on the property was the result of city, not state, policy. Second, in refusing to issue the permit, the Wetlands Board was acting pursuant to the City\u2019s Ordinance, which bestows upon the Wetlands Board the power to grant or deny permit applications.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor is it relevant that the final administrative decision was from the VMRC, a state agency. In denying the application, the VMRC was using its statutory power to review the decision of the Wetlands Board. Code \u00a7 62.1-13.11. In conducting its review, the VMRC was ensuring that the Wetlands Board, a city agency, was acting in accord with the Dune Act. Therefore, the VMRC was determining the legal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ity of city, not state, action. Thus we conclude that the City is a proper defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">We next consider whether the Wetlands Board\u2019s denial of Bell\u2019s application resulted in a compensable taking. Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia prohibits the government from taking or damaging private property for public uses without just compensation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has stated that a compensable taking exists for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, without the need for a \u201ccase-specific inquiry,\u201d when state regulations compel property owners \u201cto suffer a physical \u2018invasion\u2019 of [their] property\u201d or when regulatory action \u201cdenies all economically beneficial or productive use of land.\u201d <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 1015 (1992).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Trustee contends that the denial of the permit was a categorical taking under <em>Lucas </em>because the Ordinance\u2019s effect is to eliminate the property\u2019s only economically beneficial use.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">However, in <em>Lucas </em>the Court also recognized that not all categorical takings are compensable. The Court declared that a state may \u201cresist compensation,\u201d even in categorical takings, if an \u201cinquiry into the nature of the owner\u2019s estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of his title to begin with.\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1027. Thus, a property owner may seek compensation for a categorical taking only when the state is exercising regulatory power over the \u201cbundle of rights\u201d that the owner acquired when first obtaining title to the property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">We, therefore, disagree with the Trustee\u2019s contention that the denial of the application is akin to the compensable taking found in <em>Lucas. </em>The instant case differs from <em>Lucas </em>in a significant aspect: the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>timing of the owner\u2019s purchase of the property in relation to the effective date of the regulatory restriction. In <em>Lucas, </em>the plaintiff property owners purchased the land prior to the enactment of the regulation restricting the use of their property. Thus, the subsequent regulation directly affected the property owners\u2019 \u201cbundle of rights\u201d which, at the time of their purchase, included the right to develop their property freely.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In contrast to <em>Lucas, </em>however, the Ordinance at issue here predated Bell\u2019s and the Trustee\u2019s acquisition of the property. Therefore, the \u201cbundle of rights\u201d which either Bell or the Trustee acquired upon obtaining title to the property did not include the right to develop the lots without restrictions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, because the regulatory restriction was in Bell\u2019s and the Trustee\u2019s chain of title, the City did not deprive Bell or the Trustee of the right to develop the property freely since that right was never Bell\u2019s or the Trustee\u2019s to lose. At best, any rights impaired by the Ordinance were those of the property owner at the time the Ordinance came into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The Trustee argues, however, that the principle in <em>Lucas </em>is not that a property owner, in order to enjoy unrestricted development of the property, must buy the property before the enactment of the regulatory restriction. Rather, the Trustee posits that under <em>Lucas, </em>a state must show that the regulatory restriction \u201cdoes not proscribe a productive use that was previously permissible under relevant property and nuisance principles,\u201d and only then can the state claim that it is not taking any rights from the property owner. <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1029-30. In other words, according to the Trustee, the prohibited purpose under a regulatory restriction must have \u201calways [been] unlawful;\u201d otherwise, a restriction on development constitutes a taking. <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">However, the Trustee\u2019s argument again ignores the critical fact distinguishing <em>Lucas </em>from the instant case. In <em>Lucas, </em>the owners\u2019 acquisition pre-dated the regulatory restriction. Therefore, the only way the State of South Carolina could have argued that the restriction was not a taking would have been to show that, at the time of the owners\u2019 purchase, fundamental nuisance and property law had always prevented them from developing their property and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>statutory restriction was simply making explicit relevant property and nuisance law. In contrast to <em>Lucas, </em>not only Bell but also the Trustee acquired lots 21 and 22 after the enactment of the Ordinance restricting the property\u2019s development. Therefore, the City need not prove the existence of any nuisance or property law preceding the Ordinance that would have prevented the development of the property. Such an inquiry is irrelevant and unnecessary since Bell and the Trustee acquired property already burdened by regulatory restrictions. Thus, the City, by enacting the Ordinance, took no property rights from Bell or the Trustee since they cannot suffer a taking of rights never possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Nevertheless, the Trustee seeks to avoid the Ordinance\u2019s restrictions by contending that the Ordinance did not pre-date Bell\u2019s ownership rights to lots 21 and 22. The Trustee posits that Seawall\u2019s acquistion of lots 21 and 22 in 1979 established Bell\u2019s ownership rights in the property because he was a' shareholder in Seawall. Essentially, the Trustee asks this Court to look at the substance, and not the form, of ownership and to determine Bell\u2019s ownership rights as of 1979.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The Trustee\u2019s position, however, is contrary to well-settled principles of law. It \u201cis elementary that a corporation is a legal entity entirely separate and distinct from the shareholders or members who compose it.\u201d <em>Cheatle v. Rudd\u2019s Swimming Pool Supply Co., Inc., </em>234 Va. 207, 212, 360 S.E.2d 828, 831 (1987). In <em>Bogese, Inc. v. State Highway and Transp. Comm\u2019r, </em>250 Va. 226, 462 S.E.2d 345 (1995), we considered whether, under the unity of lands doctrine, unity of ownership existed when a corporation owned one parcel of land and a general partnership, whose partners were the same individuals as the corporate shareholders, owned the adjacent parcel. In holding that unity of ownership did not exist and that two distinct entities owned the two parcels, we stated that \u201cwhere persons have deliberately adopted the corporate form to secure its advantages, they will not be allowed to disregard the existence of the corporate entity when it is to their benefit to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 462 S.E.2d at 347 (quoting <em>Board of Transp. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>249 S.E.2d 390, 396 (N.C. 1978)). Thus, we recognized that only \u201c \u2018an extraordinary exception\u2019 will justify piercing the corporate veil.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 462 S.E.2d at 348 (quoting <em>Cheatle, </em>234 Va. at 212, 360 S.E.2d at 831).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Accordingly, Bell, who accepted the benefits of corporate ownership, cannot avoid its disadvantages. Seawall\u2019s acquisition of lots 21 and 22 in 1979 does not protect Bell or the Trustee from the restrictions of the Ordinance. Any rights that Seawall acquired in lots 21 and 22 belonged solely to Seawall as Seawall was an entity distinct and separate from Bell.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, Bell\u2019s ownership rights in lots 21 and 22 must be defined as of 1982, not 1979. Since the Ordinance pre-dated Bell\u2019s acquisition of lots 21 and 22, Bell, and now the Trustee, took the property subject to the Ordinance\u2019s restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Our decision that neither Bell\u2019s nor the Trustee\u2019s ownership rights include the right to develop the property free from regulatory restrictions is in accord with <em>Prince William County </em>v. <em>Omni Homes, Inc., </em>253 Va. 59, 481 S.E.2d 460, <em>cert. </em>denied, _ U.S. _, 118 S.Ct. 58 (1997). In that case, Omni purchased a parcel of unimproved land, which was adjacent to another undeveloped parcel, with the intent of building an urban residential development. Since the development of Omni\u2019s subdivision would require obtaining road and utility access, Omni secured an informal agreement with the adjacent landowners to gain such access through the adjoining parcel. However, Prince William County subsequently purchased the adjoining tract, thwarting Omni\u2019s plans to obtain road and utility access through the adjacent property. Omni therefore brought suit, and the trial court ruled that the county\u2019s purchase of the adjoining tract was a regulatory action that constituted a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">This Court reversed, holding that the county\u2019s purchase of the adjoining tract was not a taking. We stated that Omni had not \u201clost the <em>right </em>to develop its property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 481 S.E.2d at 467. Rather, Omni \u201chad not acquired the rights necessary to realize its preferred method of development either as a matter of contract or easement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the county\u2019s action did not affect Omni\u2019s property rights since Omni, at the time of the county\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>purchase, had no right of access through the adjacent property. Thus, since the county could not damage a nonexistent right, the purchase was not an uncompensated taking under either the United States or Virginia Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Like the property owners in <em>Omni, </em>neither Bell nor the Trustee acquired the right to develop lots 21 and 22 free of the Ordinance\u2019s restrictions. Rather, the restriction on the lots was in the chain of title at the time of Bell\u2019s acquisition and likewise when Bell and his wife deeded the property to the Bell Land Trust. Thus, Bell, and now the Trustee, acquired the property with full knowledge of the risk involved in attempting to develop it. \u201cOne who buys with knowledge of a restraint must assume the risk of economic loss.\u201d <em>Omni, </em>253 Va. at 69, 481 S.E.2d at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">For these reasons, we hold that the denial of Bell\u2019s permit was not a regulatory taking for which the City owes compensation to the Trustee. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court and enter final judgment here for the City.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-13\"> The Dune Act was originally codified in Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-13.21 to -13.28.

However, in interpreting art. I, \u00a7 11 of the Constitution of Virginia, we have cited to and sought guidance from cases involving takings under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., City of Virginia Beach v.
