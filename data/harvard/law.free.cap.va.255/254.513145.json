The statute, a part of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, requires every employer to \u201csecure his liability thereunder\u201d by \u201c[i]nsuring and keeping insured his liability\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Appellee Harold C. Mounts, the claimant, while working as a coal miner for appellee Greasy Creek Coal Company, the employer, suffered a disabling, compensable back injury in an industrial accident on October 12, 1988. On that date, the employer was insured by Rockwood Insurance Company, an insurer authorized to transact the business of workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the Commonwealth, as required by former Code \u00a7 65.1-104.1(A)(1), now \u00a7 65.2-801(A)(1). The claimant stopped working because of the disability, and the insurer began paying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In August 1991, a Pennsylvania court declared the insurer insolvent, and liquidation proceedings commenced. All persons with claims against the insurer were required to file their claims with the court\u2019s liquidator by August 26, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">In August 1991, appellee Virginia Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association, pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-1606, began paying Mounts\u2019 award for the October 1988 accidental back injury because, at the time of the insurer\u2019s insolvency, Rockwood had been paying the award. The Guaranty Association, established by statute to \u201cprovide prompt payment of covered claims to reduce financial loss to claimants\u201d resulting from an insurer\u2019s insolvency, \u00a7 38.2-1600, is obligated to pay such claims that existed prior to the insolvency determination. \u00a7 38.2-1606(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">On September 15, 1993, an x-ray report indicated that the claimant was suffering from coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. Nine days later, he filed with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission a claim for benefits for that occupational disease, naming Greasy Creek Coal Company as his last employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Subsequently, at a January 1996 hearing, a deputy commissioner found \u201cthat claimant received a communication of diagnosis of occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>pational disease on September 15, 1993.\u201d The deputy denied the claim, however, ruling that it was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Upon review, the full Commission reversed the deputy\u2019s ruling, finding the claim was timely. Turning to the merits, the Commission determined that the date of claimant\u2019s last injurious exposure to the hazards of the disease was October 12, 1988, while he was employed by Greasy Creek. The Commission ruled that the claimant\u2019s \u201cpneumoconiosis is compensable as an occupational disease\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-400.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Next, the Commission considered whether the Guaranty Association \u201cis responsible for payment of the claim.\u201d The Commission concluded that because the September 1993 claim was filed after the August 1992 deadline established during the liquidation proceedings, the claim was not \u201ccovered\u201d and the Guaranty Association was \u201cnot responsible for paying benefits to this claimant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Continuing, the Commission ruled, without assigning a reason, that the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund \u201cis responsible for this claim.\u201d Thus, the Commission entered an award against Greasy Creek and the Fund for payment of disability benefits at the weekly rate of $451 for a period of 50 weeks, plus medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The Fund appealed, and a panel of the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the Commission. <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund </em>v. <em>Mounts, </em>24 Va. App. 550, 484 S.E.2d 140 (1997). Among other issues, the Court of Appeals determined that the Fund was responsible for payment of benefits to the claimant and that the Guaranty Association had no such obligation. <em>Id. </em>at 557, 484 S.E.2d at 143. According to the Court of Appeals, the Fund\u2019s liability stemmed from the employer\u2019s violation of Code \u00a7 65.2-801(A)(l) in failing to keep its liability insured. Greasy Creek was not insured on September 15, 1993, the date the diagnosis was communicated to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The Fund filed a petition for appeal in this Court, assigning error to only one of the Court of Appeals\u2019 rulings. The Fund\u2019s assignment of error states: \u201cThe Court of Appeals\u2019 reliance upon \u2018keeping insured his liability\u2019 language in \u00a7 65.2-801(A)(l) to make the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund hable for pneumoconiosis benefits is erroneous.\u201d Thus, because the Fund does not assign as error the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that the Guaranty Association is not liable for payment of the claimant\u2019s benefits, the judgment in favor of the Guaranty Association is final.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Determining that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision involves a matter of significant precedential value within the meaning of Code \u00a7 17-116.07(B), we awarded the Fund this appeal from the April 1997 judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Initially, the relevant workers\u2019 compensation statutes must be summarized. Code \u00a7 65.2-404 provides that when an employee has a compensable occupational disease, \u201cthe employer in whose employment he was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease and the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, if any, at the time of the exposure, shall alone be liable therefor, without right to contribution from any prior employer or insurance carrier.\u201d The claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits for an occupational disease, however, accrues on the date of the \u201cfirst communication of the diagnosis.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-403(A), formerly \u00a7 65.1-49 (1987 Repl. Vol.); <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Mary E. Coal Corp., </em>215 Va. 806, 809, 214 S.E.2d 162, 164-65 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">On the date of this claimant\u2019s last injurious exposure to the hazards of pneumoconiosis in October 1988, former Code \u00a7 65.1-149(A) (1990 Cum. Supp.) (now \u00a7 65.2-1203(A)(2)) provided: \u201cAfter an award has been entered against an employer for compensation benefits . . . and upon a finding that the employer has failed to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 65.1-104.1 ... the Commission shall order the award, or any unpaid balance, to be paid from the Uninsured Employers Fund.\u201d The Fund was created by the General Assembly to provide funds to claimants for benefits awarded against an employer which has breached its duty \u201cto secure compensation insurance.\u201d <em>A. G. Van Metre, Jr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gandy, </em>7 Va. App. 207, 213, 372 S.E.2d 198, 202 (1988). <em>See </em>\u00a7 65.2-1201(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In October 1988, former Code \u00a7 65.1-104.1(A)(1) (1987 Repl. Vol.), like present \u00a7 65.2-801(A)(l), provided that every employer \u201cshall secure his liability\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation payments by, among other methods, \u201c[i]nsuring and keeping insured his liability\u201d with an authorized workers\u2019 compensation carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The Court of Appeals, in ruling against the Fund, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">\u201cTo read Code \u00a7 65.2-801 to require only that employers have insurance on the date of the employee\u2019s last exposure, and not on the date when the diagnosis of the disease was communicated to the employee, would exempt employers from insuring themselves against a great number of occupational disease claims. Moreover, Code \u00a7 65.2-801, by its use of the phrase \u2018keeping insured,\u2019 requires employers to remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>insured. Therefore, we hold that because Greasy Creek was not insured on the date the diagnosis was communicated to Mounts, Greasy Creek failed to \u2018keep[] [itself] insured\u2019 as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-801.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><em>Mounts, </em>24 Va. App. at 556, 484 S.E.2d at 143 (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In this appeal, the Attorney General contends, on behalf of the Fund, that by virtue of the language in \u00a7 65.1-149 (\u00a7 65.2-1203), Greasy Creek was in compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 65.1-104.1 (\u00a7 65.2-801) because it was insured by Rockwood on October 12, 1988. Thus, the Attorney General argues, because the Fund can be responsible for an award only \u201cupon a finding that the employer has failed to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 65.1-104.1,\u201d this Court should reverse that portion of the award that imposes liability upon the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Continuing, the Attorney General says that the Court of Appeals, in holding the Fund liable, incorrectly \u201clatched onto\u201d the \u201ckeeping insured\u201d language in \u00a7 65.1-104.1 (\u00a7 65.2-801(A)(l)), while noting the employer was not insured in 1993. He argues that the Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning is flawed because only the carrier that insured the employer\u2019s liability on the date of the last injurious exposure can be held liable, in view of the provisions of \u00a7 65.2-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The Court of Appeals answered this argument by saying that \u00a7 65.2-404, by its terms, \u201caddresses only the liability of the employer in whose employment the employee was last injuriously exposed, and its insurance carrier, in contradistinction to prior employers and their insurance carriers.\u201d <em>Mounts, </em>24 Va. App. at 557, 484 S.E.2d at 143. The Court of Appeals stated: \u201cNothing in Code \u00a7 65.2-404 was intended to release employers from the duty of \u2018keeping [themselves] insured\u2019 as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-801 or to exempt the Fund when the employer has breached its statutory obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">In a final argument, the Attorney General contends: \u201cThe \u2018keeping insured\u2019 language is not meant to require an employer like Greasy Creek to anticipate future pneumoconiosis claims when his carrier is declared insolvent, particularly in the face of the plain wording of \u00a7 65.2-404 that makes the employer and carrier on the last date of injurious exposure liable.\u201d We disagree with the Attorney General, and agree with the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The \u201ckeeping insured\u201d language has been a part of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes since the Act was adopted in 1918. Acts 1918, ch. 400, \u00a7 68. We have observed, as the Court of Appeals correctly held, that the language under scrutiny here means that an employer subject to the Act \u201cmust be and remain insured.\u201d <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Guar. Ins. Underwriters, Inc., </em>223 Va. 641, 643, 292 S.E.2d 327, 328 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">We shall elaborate on the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis to answer one portion of the Attorney General\u2019s argument in this Court. He contends that the statutes do not require an employer to anticipate future pneumoconiosis claims and to remain insured when its insurer has been declared insolvent. This argument, however, is answered by merely referring to the statute of limitations governing occupational diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">An employer has potential liability for a claim of coal miners\u2019 pneumoconiosis for \u201cthree years after a diagnosis of the disease\u201d is first communicated to the employee, or for \u201cfive years from the date of the last injurious exposure in employment, whichever first occurs. . . .\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-406(A)(l), formerly \u00a7 65.1-52(1). Therefore, given the statutory mandate to insure and keep insured its liability, an employer whose employees are susceptible to pneumoconiosis must anticipate that such claims will accrue in the future and must secure its liability for such potential claims as required by \u00a7 65.2-801, even when its insurer has been declared insolvent. When, as here, there has been a failure to do so, the Fund will be liable because the employer has violated its statutory duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Consequently, the judgment of the Court of Appeals will be</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
