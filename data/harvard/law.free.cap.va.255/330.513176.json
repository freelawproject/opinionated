Lanier and Christopher M. Lanier, the prevailing parties in the trial court. <em>Horton </em>v. Horton, 254 Va. 111, 115, 487 S.E.2d 200, 203 (1997); <em>Tuomola </em>v. <em>Regent Univ., </em>252 Va. 368, 375, <em>477 </em>S.E.2d 501, 505 (1996). On September 3, 1989, Allyson Hudson, the daughter of David S. Hudson, was severely injured when a tree fell on her while she was playing at the Surry County home of her maternal grandparents, Joseph S. Lanier, Sr., and Frances D. Lanier. The day after the incident, Frances and her son, Christopher M. Lanier, went to Hud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>son\u2019s home, where Hudson informed them that he was planning to sue the elder Laniers to recover damages for Allyson\u2019s injuries. Hudson asked Frances and Christopher to leave his home and called the \u201ccounty sheriff\u201d when they failed to leave. When the \u201csheriff\u2019s car\u201d entered the driveway, Frances and Christopher left the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Five days later, Hudson went to the home of Joseph and Frances to take photographs of the area where Allyson was injured. Joseph and Frances were not home at the time, but Christopher was present. Although Christopher asked Hudson to leave, Hudson remained on the Laniers\u2019 property. Christopher then called his parents to inform them that Hudson was on their property. Christopher spoke with Frances, who asked that he again tell Hudson to leave the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">As instructed by his mother, Christopher again told Hudson to leave the property. Hudson left the Laniers\u2019 property at that time, but he continued to take photographs from an adjacent property. Christopher then asked Hudson to leave the neighbor\u2019s property, and Hudson responded, \u201cThis is not your property.\u201d Hudson cursed Christopher and made an obscene gesture before leaving the adjacent property.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Shortly thereafter, Christopher, under instructions from Frances, initiated a criminal complaint against Hudson for trespass on the Laniers\u2019 property. A warrant for Hudson\u2019s arrest, alleging trespass in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-119, was issued. Five days later, Christopher initiated another criminal complaint against Hudson for \u201ccurse and abuse,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-416. An arrest warrant later was issued against Hudson on this charge. Hudson was tried and acquitted on both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Hudson filed a motion for judgment against Frances and Christopher alleging malicious prosecution. At a bench trial, Frances testified that she asked Christopher to obtain an arrest warrant for trespass because the \u201csituation had gotten hostile.\u201d Frances also stated, \u201cWe could see we had to have somebody settle it. We had to have a judge decide it.\u201d Frances explained that she was concerned because she thought that Hudson was harassing the family and \u201cbad things happen when people have tempers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Christopher testified that he initiated the criminal complaint for trespass because he wanted an independent party to settle the family\u2019s problem, and he wished to see \u201cjustice be done.\u201d Christopher also explained that he initiated the complaint for \u201ccurse and abuse\u201d because he thought that, at trial on the trespass charge, he would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>asked why he had not taken any action in response to Hudson\u2019s cursing.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court held that Hudson failed to prove the element of malice by a preponderance of the evidence. Based on this ruling, the court did not reach a determination whether there was probable cause to support the criminal charges. The court later entered an order dismissing the action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Hudson contends that the trial court erred in ruling that he failed to prove the element of malice. He asserts that the evidence showed that Frances and Christopher initiated the criminal complaints against him for reasons other than a desire to see justice done.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In response, Frances and Christopher argue that Hudson failed to meet his burden of proving that their controlling motive in initiating the criminal complaints was improper. They also argue that there was ample evidence showing that their actions were not motivated by malice, but were based on a desire to resolve the hostilities among the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">In an action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the prosecution was (1) malicious; (2) instituted by, or with the cooperation of, the defendant; (3) without probable cause; and (4) terminated in a manner not unfavorable to the plaintiff. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Southland Corp., </em>219 Va. 23, 26, 244 S.E.2d 756, 758 (1978); <em>Bain v. Phillips, </em>217 Va. 387, 393, 228 S.E.2d 576, 581 (1976); <em>Gaut v. Pyles, </em>212 Va. 39, 41, 181 S.E.2d 645, 646-47 (1971). In the context of a malicious prosecution action, malice is defined as any <em>controlling </em>motive other than a good faith desire to further the ends of justice, enforce obedience to the criminal laws, suppress crime, or see that the guilty are punished. <em>Freezer v. Miller, </em>163 Va. 180, 206, 176 S.E. 159, 169 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The existence of malice is generally a question to be resolved by the fact finder from all the circumstances in the case. <em>Lee, </em>219 Va. at 27, 244 S.E.2d at 759; <em>Gaut, </em>212 Va. at 42, 181 S.E.2d at 647; <em>see Freezer, </em>163 Va. at 208, 176 S.E. at 170. We review the sufficiency of the evidence of malice, and the trial court\u2019s judgment that Hudson failed to meet his burden of proof on this issue, under the established principle that the trial court\u2019s judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>will be upheld unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Board of Supervisors v. Omni Homes, Inc., </em>253 Va. 59, 65, 481 S.E.2d 460, 463, <em>cert. denied, </em>_ U.S. _, 118 S.Ct. 58 (1997); <em>Tuomala, </em>252 Va. at 375, 477 S.E.2d at 506. Applying this standard, we conclude that the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s judgment that Hudson failed to prove that either defendant acted with malice in initiating the prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The testimony of both Frances and Christopher supports this determination. As stated above, both testified that they were concerned that Hudson\u2019s conduct had escalated existing family hostilities, and that the intervention of a neutral party was necessary to prevent further confrontations from occurring. Christopher also stated that he wanted to see \u201cjustice be done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">While Frances testified that she did not want Hudson to gather evidence on the property to use against her in a lawsuit, the balance of the testimony supports the court\u2019s implicit finding that this concern was not the controlling motive for initiating the criminal complaints. Thus, the record supports a conclusion that Hudson failed to prove that either Frances or Christopher had a controlling motive other than to \u201cfurther the ends of justice, enforce obedience to the criminal laws, suppress crime, or see that the guilty are punished.\u201d <em>Freezer, </em>163 Va. at 206, 176 S.E. at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Hudson argues, nevertheless, that the trial court\u2019s judgment must be reversed because the court applied an erroneous principle of law. When explaining his decision to the parties, the court stated, \u201cI\u2019m unable to find a requisite malice between members of a family.\u201d Hudson contends that this statement indicates that the court believed that family members are legally incapable of acting with malice toward one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">We disagree with Hudson\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s comment requires reversal of this case. While the court\u2019s comment is not clear on its face, the substance of such a comment is not relevant to our examination of the sufficiency of the evidence of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">For these reasons, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\"> Hudson also argues that the trial court erred in questioning a witness concerning the witness\u2019 religious beliefs and practices. We do not consider this assignment of error, however, because Hudson failed to object to the trial court\u2019s questioning of the witness or to the content of the questions.
