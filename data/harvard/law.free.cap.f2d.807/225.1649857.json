The Notice seeks to draw a bright line between \u201ccarcinogenic\u201d lubricating oils and \u201cnoncarcinogenic\u201d lubricating oils. In these consolidated cases, petitioners contend that the Notice is invalid because OSHA failed to follow the notice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 <em>et seq. </em>(1982) (\u201cAPA\u201d) and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, (required procedures codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b) (1982)) (\u201cOSH Act\u201d); and that OSHA\u2019s action in promulgating the Notice was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and therefore unlawful, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 766(a)(A). We do not reach the merits of these claims because we are convinced that petitioners lack standing to challenge OSHA\u2019s issuance of the Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">The genesis of this lawsuit occurred on November 25, 1983, when, pursuant to its authority under the OSH Act, the Secretary of Labor issued the Hazard Communication Standard, 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200 (1985) (\u201cStandard\u201d), scheduled to take effect two years later (November 25,1985). The Standard requires chemical manufacturers and importers to assess the hazards of the chemicals they produce or import and affix labels with appropriate warnings to the containers of all chemicals deemed to be hazardous. It further specifies that carcinogenic chemicals be labelled as health hazards. A listing in one of several authoritative sources, including the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) <em>Monographs, </em>establishes that a chemical is carcinogenic.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">In April, 1984, IARC issued a Monograph that examined the carcinogenity of lubricating oils. In its study, IARC divided lubricating oils into eight classes, including the four classes pertinent here: vacuum distillates, acid-treated oils, solvent-refined oils, and hydrotreated oils. The Monograph concluded: (1) all vacuum distillates and acid-treated oils are carcinogenic; (2) \u201cmildly\u201d solvent-refined oils are carcinogenic, but \u201cseverely\u201d solvent-refined oils are <em>not </em>carcinogenic; and (3) \u201cmildly\u201d hy-drotreated oils are carcinogenic, but the evidence concerning \u201cseverely\u201d hydrotreat-ed oils does not permit a conclusion that such oils either are or are not carcinogenic. IARC did not, however, provide any definition of either \u201cmild\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d solvent-refining or \u201cmild\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d hydrotreat-ing.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">Affected oil refiners (those who make hydrotreated and solvent-refined lubricating oils) were quite perturbed by this series of events. Taken together, the Standard and the IARC Monograph required label-ling \u201cmildly\u201d solvent-refined and hydro-treated oils. But where, they asked, was the line distinguishing \u201cmild\u201d from \u201csevere?\u201d As the effective date of the Standard drew near, numerous refiners and other interested parties urged OSHA to clarify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the labelling requirements to identify the distinction between \u201cmildly\u201d and \u201cseverely\u201d hydrotreated oils.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In an effort to do so, OSHA examined several research papers that had formed the basis of IARC\u2019s study, seeking to identify those factors that distinguished the two forms of hydrotreating. Although OSHA was unable to find a definitive distinction between the two, it concluded from its research that temperature and pressure were the two most significant factors distinguishing \u201cmild\u201d from \u201csevere\u201d hydro-treating. Accordingly, OSHA decided to issue a \u201cNotice of Interpretation,\u201d which took the form of a definition of \u201cmild\u201d hydrotreatment for labelling purposes under the Standard. On December 20, 1985, OSHA published its Notice of Interpretation, which said: \u201cOSHA will ... regard an oil as mildly hydrotreated if it has been processed at a pressure of 800 pounds per square inch (psi) or less, at temperatures up to 800\u00b0 P, independent of other process parameters.\u201d 50 Fed.Reg. 51854 (Dec. 20, 1985). The Notice did not address the distinction between \u201cmildly\u201d and \u201cseverely\u201d solvent-refined oils.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Petitioners do not make either hydro-treated or solvent-refined lubricating oils; Calumet and Seaview manufacture vacuum distillate oils, and Macmillan makes vacuum distillate and acid-treated oils. All three petitioners acknowledge that the Standard clearly requires them to label all their products and that they have complied with that requirement. Despite the fact that IARC\u2019s 1984 Monograph did not create any confusion about <em>their </em>labelling obligation, petitioners nevertheless participated in the efforts described above to convince OSHA to more precisely interpret the Standard\u2019s labelling requirements as they pertained to hydrotreated oils. But while directly affected refiners merely requested clarification of the labelling requirements, petitioners urged OSHA to adopt a more stringent labelling policy whereby any product for which health evidence was inconclusive must be labelled as hazardous. Petitioners argued this approach would, among other things, reduce the availability of unlabelled lubricating oils, thus protecting the market position of those refiners (like petitioners) who were already required to label their products. OSHA rejected that argument, choosing (as we have noted) to permit its unclarified Standard to go into effect as scheduled on November 25, 1985. Petitioners then filed suit in district court seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Standard until OSHA clarified the labelling requirements for hydro-treated and solvent-refined oils. When OSHA subsequently issued the Notice purporting to clarify the Standard, petitioners amended their complaint to reflect the contentions they now assert: the Notice is invalid because OSHA failed to follow notice and comment rulemaking; the Notice is not supported by the record, lacks a rational basis, and is inconsistent with the purpose of the OSH Act; and the Notice, as it stands, is arbitrary and capricious. The district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, transferred the complaint to our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Conceding that the Notice does not pertain to the products they make, petitioners nevertheless contend they have standing to bring this complaint because they are losing sales and profits to producers of hydro-treated and solvent-refined oils who are <em>not </em>required to label their products under the Standard as interpreted by the Notice. Petitioners argue that the line drawn between \u201cmildly\u201d and \u201cseverely\u201d hydrotreat-ed oils is underinclusive and should be redrawn to require labelling additional hydro-treated oils. They also imply that manufacturers of carcinogenic solvent-refined oils are exploiting the continuing impreciseness in the Standard regarding solvent-refined oils to avoid labelling their products. Petitioners seek reversal of OSHA\u2019s Notice and a stay of the Standard, as it pertains to lubricating oils, until the labelling require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ments of the Standard are \u201cadequately\u201d clarified.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Petitioners contend they have met both the constitutional and prudential requirements of standing. Although we very much doubt petitioners could establish constitutional standing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we need not reach that issue because it is, in our view, abundantly clear that petitioners do not meet non-constitutional prudential standing criteria. When a litigant seeks judicial review of an agency decision, he must show that \u201cthe interest sought to be protected by the complaint is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute ... in question.\u201d <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). There must be \u201csome indicia \u2014 however slight \u2014 that the litigant before the court was intended to be protected, benefited or regulated by the statute under which suit is brought.\u201d <em>Copper &amp; Brass Fabricators Council, Inc. v. Department of the Treasury, </em>679 F.2d 951, 952 (D.C.Cir.1982). Petitioners gain standing under the APA not because their interests are merely \u201cimplicated\u201d by the agency action but because \u201cCongress intended ... that class to be relied upon to challenge agency disregard of the law.\u201d <em>Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, </em>467 U.S. 340, 347, 104 S.Ct. 2450, 2455, 81 L.Ed.2d 270 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Petitioners would have standing under the \u201cprotected interests\u201d leg of the zone of interest test if their complaint asserted the infringement of an interest that is protected by the OSH Act. However, it is now well settled in other Circuits that the interest to be protected by the OSH Act is worker safety, <em>see, e.g., R.T. Vanderbilt Co. v. OSHRC, </em>728 F.2d 815, 818 (6th Cir. 1984); <em>R.T. Vanderbilt Co. v. OSHRC, </em>708 F.2d 570, 577 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Fire Equipment Manufacturers\u2019 Association, Inc. v. Marshall, </em>679 F.2d 679, 682 (7th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1105, 103 S.Ct. 728, 74 L.Ed.2d 953 (1983), and <em>not </em>business profits, <em>see, e.g., R.T. Vanderbilt, </em>708 F.2d at 578 (manufacturer\u2019s economic injury not sufficient to obtain judicial review); <em>Fire Equipment Manufacturers\u2019, </em>679 F.2d at 682 (manufacturers\u2019 lost profits not within zone of interest protected by OSH Act). We agree with these courts. As petitioners here do not come before us as protectors of worker safety, but instead as entrepreneurs seeking to protect their competitive interests, we think it plain they lack standing under the \u201cprotected interests\u201d leg of the zone of interests test.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Nevertheless, petitioners contend that although not arguably protected by the OSH Act, they are certainly included within the Act\u2019s \u201cregulatory scheme\u201d and therefore have standing under the \u201cregulated interests\u201d leg of the zone of interests test. To be sure, petitioners are regulated by the OSH Act, which gives the Labor Secretary authority to promulgate a wide range of occupational safety and health standards. And petitioners are also regulated by the Hazard Communication Standard, which requires them, as manufacturers of hazardous chemicals, to label their lubricating oils. But petitioners are concededly <em>not </em>regulated by the agency action they challenge \u2014 the Notice. We have held that to have standing under the \u201cregulated interests\u201d leg, it is not enough that petitioners be regulated merely by the statute upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>which the agency action is based. <em>Tax Analysts and Advocates v. Blumenthal, </em>566 F.2d 130, 143-45 (D.C.Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1086, 98 S.Ct. 1280, 55 L.Ed.2d 791 (1978) (taxpayer regulated by Internal Revenue Code cannot challenge tax credit provision not pertaining to him). Granting \u201cregulated interest\u201d standing to petitioners to challenge OSHA\u2019s Notice simply because they happen to be regulated by the OSH Act in general and by other aspects of the Standard would \u201cstretch[] the concept of regulation [as used in the zone of interests test] to implausible limits.\u201d <em>Tax Analysts, </em>566 F.2d at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Arguing that a competitor oil manufacturer not subject to an OSHA regulation has standing to allege that another oil manufacturer was treated too leniently by that regulation is simply another way of contending that a competitor\u2019s market position is protected by the OSH Act \u2014 a proposition we, and other courts, soundly reject. Instead, to gain standing under the \u201cregulated interests\u201d leg of the zone of interests test, petitioners must show they are directly, even if only minimally, regulated by the agency action they challenge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since they do not manufacture hydrotreated oils (or, for that matter, solvent-refined oils), petitioners are merely challenging the Standard\u2019s application (as interpreted by the Notice) to third-party competitors. To paraphrase our statement in <em>Tax Analysts, </em>where we denied standing in a similar situation, \u201c[petitioners are] not directly regulated by the rulings being challenged in this case. Rather, a more appropriate description is that [they] operate[] in an industry which is regulated by the rulings but do[ ] not operate in that sphere of the industry which is the object of the regulation.\u201d <em>Tax Analysts, </em>566 F.2d 143 n. 82. Accordingly, we hold that petitioners lack standing; their petition is therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">. Apparently, the imprecise distinction between \"mildly\" and \u201cseverely\u201d solvent-refined oils was not the major focus of refiners\u2019 complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">. To have standing under the Constitution, \u2018\u2018[a] plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" <em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans for Separation of Church and State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982). If the Notice that petitioners challenge were invalidated, then the Standard for manufacturers of hydrotreated oils would again be ambiguous; arguably, petitioners\u2019 competitors would exploit this ambiguity to avoid label-ling their products. It is difficult to see how that result could enhance petitioners' competitive position. Indeed, petitioners appear to complain about that very situation with respect to manufacturers of solvent-refined oils. Petitioners would therefore seem to run afoul of the causation requirement reflected in both the \"fairly traceable\u201d and \u201credressible\" aspects of the standing test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\">. The only litigants who would have \"regulated interests\u201d standing to challenge OSHA\u2019s Notice are manufacturers of hydrotreated oils processed at a pressure of 800 psi or less, at temperatures up to 80O\u00b0F, who are required by virtue of the Notice to label their products. Moreover, such litigants would have standing only to contest the burden the Notice imposes on <em>them, </em>and not to contest the Notice\u2019s failure to similarly burden others.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
