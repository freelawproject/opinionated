HANSON, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern and Southern Districts of Iowa, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b222-11\">FAGG, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Plaintiffs appeal the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing their product liability lawsuits on the ground the actions are barred by the applicable Nebraska statute of repose. <em>See </em>Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 25-224(2) (Cum. Supp.1984). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">In 1984 plaintiffs suffered hearing losses which they claim were the result of operating rotary air compressors in a confined area below the deck of a barge owned by their employer. The compressors were supplied and installed and the barge first sold for use in 1967. Plaintiffs in 1985 sued the manufacturer of the compressors, Fuller Company (Fuller), and the builder of the barge, Maxon Marine (Maxon), employing various product liability theories including defective manufacture, installation, design, and warning. CNA Insurance Company was joined as a defendant under Nebraska workmen\u2019s compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">The Nebraska product liability statute of limitations and repose provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-17\">(1) All product liability actions, except one governed by subsection (5) of this section, shall be commenced within four years next after the date on which the death, injury, or damage complained of occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-18\">(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section or any other statutory provision to the contrary, any product liability action, except one governed by section 2-725, Uniform Commercial Code, or by subsection (5) of this section, shall be commenced within ten years after the date when the product which allegedly caused the personal injury, death, or damage was first sold or leased for use or consumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-19\">Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 25-224(l)-(2) (Cum.Supp. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-20\">The district court determined that plaintiffs\u2019 actions were \u201cproduct liability\u201d actions within the terms of the statute, <em>see </em>Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 25-21,180 (1979), and that because the claimed hearing losses occurred some seventeen years after the compressors were first sold for use, the actions were clearly barred by the period of repose in section 25-224(2). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-21\">Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries in this case did not occur until well after the ten-year period of repose had passed. By operation of law, when the \u201cinjury [occurs] outside of the ten-year period, no substantive cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>action * * * ever exist[s],\u201d <em>Miers v. Central Mine Equip. Co., </em>604 F.Supp. 502, 505 (D.Neb.1985), and plaintiffs\u2019 actions are barred by section 25-224(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Plaintiffs argue, however, that the statute of repose may be equitably tolled when a defendant has fraudulently concealed information about the dangers of the product. <em>See, e.g., Givens v. A.H. Robins Co., Inc., </em>751 F.2d 261, 264 (8th Cir. 1984); <em>MacMillen v. A.H. Robins Co., Inc., </em>217 Neb. 338, 348 N.W.2d 869, 871-72 (1984). Plaintiffs seek an evidentiary hearing or discovery to further develop facts in support of this estoppel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Regardless of whether this theory was properly presented to the district court, reliance on it here is misplaced. Because the injuries for which plaintiffs seek recovery occurred <em>after </em>expiration of the ten-year period, plaintiffs could not have been fraudulently induced to postpone timely filing of their lawsuits. Thus, the theory of equitable tolling is unavailable under the circumstances of this case. <em>See Groth v. Sandoz, Inc., </em>601 F.Supp. 453, 456 (D.Neb. 1984); <em>see also Colton v. Dewey, </em>212 Neb. 126, 321 N.W.2d 913, 916 (1982) (quoting <em>Rosenberg v. Town of North Bergen, </em>61 N.J. 190, 293 A.2d 662, 667 (1972)) (medical malpractice statute of repose); <em>compare Miers, </em>604 F.Supp. at 507 (equitable tolling available when injury occurs within ten-year period).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In a diversity case we give substantial deference to the local district court\u2019s interpretation of state law unless it is \u201cfundamentally deficient in analysis or otherwise lacking in reasoned authority.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Platte Valley State Bank &amp; Trust, </em>805 F.2d 332, 334 (8th Cir.1986) (quoting <em>Dabney v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., </em>761 F.2d 494, 499 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 233, 88 L.Ed.2d 232 (1985)). The district court in this case has made a sound interpretation of the relevant Nebraska statute and its judgment dismissing the actions is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
