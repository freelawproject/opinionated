Judge Edgar relied upon <em>Trident Marine Construction, Ind v. District Engineer, United States Army Corps of Engineers, </em>766 F.2d 974 (6th Cir.1985), to conclude that fees should not be awarded because there was substantial justification for the government\u2019s <em>litigation </em>position. The government had settled with plaintiff before trial and paid him a lump sum of nearly $60,000.00. Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>quent to that decision by the district court and pending appeal, an amendment to EAJA was adopted which required consideration of the government\u2019s litigation <em>and agency </em>position in determining whether there was substantial justification for the government\u2019s stance. An issue on appeal is whether the 1985 EAJA amendment applies to cases in which the fee petition was the only aspect of the case that was pending at the time the amendment became effective. If the amendment is not applicable, we must also decide whether <em>Trident Marine </em>was properly construed to bar the award of fees to plaintiff\u2019s attorney under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">In September 1976 while on the job, plaintiff Blackmon, a mail carrier, sustained a back injury. He continued to work intermittently until April 1978 when he was awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act. In November 1978 his compensation was discontinued by the Director of Office of Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation (OFEC) after a determination that Blackmon was no longer disabled. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Joe Timberlake, promptly requested reconsideration of this termination of benefits. Reconsideration was denied on April 5, 1979, despite recommendation by an OFEC claims examiner that the order of termination of benefits be vacated. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney then requested further reconsideration, and a hearing was held by the Branch of Hearings and Review in March of 1980 (almost a year after the hearing was requested). A decision affirming the order rejecting plaintiff\u2019s claim for benefits was finally entered ten months later, in January 1981. To compound the delay, the order was sent only to plaintiff, not to Timberlake, his attorney, who then requested an appeal to the Employees\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board. The Appeals Board then set aside OFEC\u2019s previous decision holding that OFEC had not carried the burden of showing that plaintiff\u2019s disability had ceased, and OFEC was directed to refer plaintiff to a Board-certified medical specialist for further examination. OFEC was then directed to issue a <em>de novo </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">After several months delay, plaintiff\u2019s attorney filed a motion in October 1981 to obtain interim compensation for plaintiff, but there was no response. On July 15, 1982, plaintiff (again, not his attorney) was notified of another examination before a Board-certified orthopedic surgeon. The examination was conducted, and the doctor\u2019s report was sent to OFEC the same day. Five months later OFEC requested additional information from the plaintiff in connection with his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Because of OFEC\u2019s continuing delay, plaintiff filed suit on February 8, 1983, in District Court, alleging due process violations arising from OFEC\u2019s inaction and delay in handling of plaintiff\u2019s claim. The government responded by indicating its willingness to award benefits retroactively, to a total amount of $59,414.27. $2,755.16 of that amount was retained to cover retroactive health and life insurance premiums, .and, by court order, 25% of the balance was retained as approved attorney\u2019s fees. Checks in these amounts were promptly issued to plaintiff and his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorney, however, pursued a claim for attorney\u2019s fees under EAJA against the Department of Labor. The District Court limited recovery under EAJA for \u201cservices rendered in obtaining past due benefits and only through the period ending no later than the date of receipt by the plaintiff of the government\u2019s check for these benefits.\u201d Subsequently, Mr. Timberlake submitted an application for fees asserting that he had spent 77.5 hours on this case and suggesting $75.00 per hour as the prevailing rate. The government opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">The District Court denied plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, finding that pursuant to <em>Trident Marine Construction, Inc. v. District Engineer, United States Army Corps of Engineers, </em>766 F.2d 974 (6th Cir.1985), the Sixth Circuit had adopted what is known as the litigation position approach in determining whether to award attorneys\u2019 fees under EAJA. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>der <em>Trident Marine </em>the District Court found that the government\u2019s litigation position was to \u201cpay the plaintiff his benefits. The Court can find no fault with this position and finds that it was indeed substantially justified.\u201d In dicta, however, the court observed that a contrary result would have been indicated if the \u201cunderlying agency position\u201d had been the proper standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">In the case at bar, if the Court were to take the \u201cunderlying agency position\u201d approach, it would award attorneys fees to the plaintiff under the Act. The complaint alleges unconscionable delay in the processing of plaintiff\u2019s claim by the Office of Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation, as well as a denial of benefits due the plaintiff under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act. These actions occurred in the face of a clear and uncon-tradicted certified (by reputable physicians) medical disability inflicting [sic] plaintiff. None of the above has ever been denied by the Government. In fact, these allegations were implicitly admitted by the Government which, as the District Court recited in its order of March 3, 1983, \u201cthe Office of Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation had made a mistake in handling the claim of Bryant Franklin Blackmon, Jr____\u201d It is evident that this position was not substantially justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">We must decide whether the recent EAJA amendment stating that the government\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d includes both its litigation and underlying agency position, is applicable to a case like this which was pending on appeal only with respect to a petition for attorney\u2019s fees. The 1985 amendments are \u201capplicable to cases pending on or commenced on or after August 5, 1985____\u201d The Fifth Circuit addressed that question in <em>Russell v. National Mediation Board, </em>775 F.2d 1284 (5th Cir.1985). In <em>Russell, </em>claimant had originally lost his appeal because the court of appeals had adhered to the \u201clitigation position\u201d test. The court had also denied Russell\u2019s petition for reconsideration or rehearing en banc. The EAJA amendment became effective on the date that en banc rehearing was denied. Because the amendment to EAJA was thought to conflict with its interpretation of the government\u2019s position, the <em>Russell </em>court withheld its mandate and directed the parties to brief the effect of the new statute on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Timberlake and his client rely on this reasoning from <em>Russell:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">We begin our consideration of this argument with the language of the statute. The phrase \u201ccases pending\u201d makes no distinction between the fee application stage of a case and consideration of the merits. On its face, therefore, the statute applies to fee applications pending on the date of enactment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-12\">The statutory language is not entirely free of ambiguity, however, so we turn to the legislative history for further guidance. The House Report accompanying H.R. 2378, which became Pub.L. No. 99-80, states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-13\">The changes which are made by H.R. 2378 which merely clarify existing law are retroactive, and apply to matters which were pending on, or commenced on or after October 1, 1981. However, changes which are made by H.R. 2378 and which expand or otherwise change existing law shall take effect on the date of enactment and shall apply to matters pending on or commenced after that date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">H.R.Rep. No. 120 (pt. 1), 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 11 (1985), <em>reprinted in </em>1985 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 132, 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">The House Report makes clear that the definition of \u201cposition of the United States\u201d contained in Pub.L. No. 99-80 is intended to clarify existing law. <em>See id. </em>at 7, 1985 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 135 (\u201cH.R. 2378 clarifies that the United States will be liable unless the position of the government \u2014 the action or failure to act by the government upon which the administrative proceeding or civil action is based, as well as the litigation position \u2014 is substantially justified____\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 9, 1985 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 137 (\u201cH.R. 2378 clari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>fies that the broader meaning [of \u2018position of the United States\u2019] applies.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 12, 1985 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 140 (\u201cThe Committee here defines the \u2018position\u2019 term in a way to clarify the EAJA, consistent with the original Congressional intent and the underlying purposes of the statute.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 16, 1985 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 144 (\u201c[T]he Committee, consistent with the original Act, has determined that it would be unfair to parties ... to be denied fees when the underlying agency action was not substantially justified.\u201d). Thus, the definition of \u201cposition of the United States\u201d contained in the new Act should apply to this action, which was before the district court on the merits on October 1, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The Board relies heavily on a statement by Representative Kastenmeier, a co-sponsor of H.R. 2378:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">I would like to clarify the effective date provisions of H.R. 2378 and the relationship of these provisions with the original act. Cases which were pending on October 1, 1984, including fee application proceedings would be governed by the original act, provided that the time to file the fee application expired before the date of enactment of this bill. This bill would apply to any case pending on October 1, 1984, and finally disposed of before the date of enactment of this bill, if the time for filing an application for fees and other expenses had not expired as of such date of enactment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">131 Cong.Rec. H4762 (daily ed. June 24, 1985). The Board points out that this fee application proceeding was \u201cpending on October 1,1984\u201d and that the time to file the application expired that year. It concludes, therefore, that this proceeding is \u201cgoverned by the original act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">Although the Board\u2019s interpretation of Representative Kastenmeier\u2019s statement is plausible, it does not resolve the statement\u2019s crucial ambiguity. Representa-five Kastenmeier does not address the distinction in the House Report between provisions that \u201cclarify existing law\u201d and those that \u201cexpand or otherwise change existing law.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 120 (pt. 1) at 11, 1985 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 139. Thus, we cannot be sure whether Representative Kastenmeier\u2019s reference to the \u201coriginal act\u201d means the Act as \u201cclarified\u201d by the new amendments or the Act as interpreted by the courts before the amendments were enacted. We doubt, however, that he intended courts with fee applications pending to disregard the clarifying provisions of the new Act in defining the terms of the original EAJA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">We conclude that the language and legislative history of Pub.L. No. 99-80 indicate that its definition of \u201cposition of the United States\u201d applies to this case. The case law supports this conclu-sion____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-12\"><em>Russell, </em>775 F.2d at 1286-87 (footnote omitted). The <em>Russell </em>court then relied upon the rule set forth in <em>Bradley v. School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974), \u201c \u2018that a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Russell, </em>775 F.2d at 1287, <em>quoting Bradley, </em>416 U.S. at 711, 94 S.Ct. at 2016. <em>Accord Linn v. Chivatero, </em>790 F.2d 1270 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Herron v. Bowen, </em>788 F.2d 1127, 1129-30 (5th Cir.1986). Dicta in <em>Wyoming Wildlife Federation v. United States, </em>792 F.2d 981, 985 n. 1 (10th Cir.1986), implicitly assumes without analysis that the 1985 EAJA amendments apply to fee petitions pending on the effective date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">We are persuaded, however, by the reasoning employed by several circuits on the issue of whether the <em>original </em>EAJA was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>applicable to pending fee petitions. <em>See Tongol v. Donovan, </em>762 F.2d 727 (9th Cir. 1985); <em>Nichols v. Pierce, </em>740 F.2d 1249 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>Commissioners of Highways of Towns of Annawan v. United States, </em>684 F.2d 443 (7th Cir.1982). These courts reasoned that the principle of <em>Bradley v. School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974), cited in <em>Russell, </em>is inapplicable when the United States is the party from whom the prevailing petitioner seeks attorney\u2019s fees. The latter decisions indicated that EAJA operated as a waiver of the government\u2019s sovereign immunity, and such waivers must be construed narrowly, with any reasonable doubts resolved in the government\u2019s favor. These cases have construed the word \u201cpending\u201d with respect to the <em>original </em>Act\u2019s effective date, to mean only those cases in which the <em>merits </em>of the case, not merely collateral issues such as fee applications, remain to be decided.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">While the dispute in this suit was pending for over one year prior to the Act\u2019s passage, there are many other fee controversies which have been pending even longer; the total number of such cases is indefinite. If liability were imposed [on the government], the financial drain on the Treasury would be staggering. The Supreme Court has noted the existence of over 150 federal fee shifting statutes. Under the interpretation propounded by the appellant, the United States would suddenly become potentially responsible for attorneys fees in all fee disputes arising under any one of these statutes, even though the underlying lawsuits had been settled many months or years prior to the effective date of the Act. We cannot infer this large liability out of congressional silence as to the scope of pending cases, even when prompted by the appellant\u2019s broad interpretative innuendo, which stretches the term \u201cpending\u201d beyond the ordinary meaning apparent from the face of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\"><em>Nichols, </em>740 F.2d at 1257 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The court in <em>Tongol </em>also criticized reliance on <em>Bradley, </em>as \u201cdevoid of any statutory analysis ... and hampered by a failure to heed principles of narrow construction.\u201d 762 F.2d at 732.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">These latter courts merely applied the general principle of <em>Bradley v. School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974) <em>(Bradley), </em>\u201cthat a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless ... there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 711, 94 S.Ct. at 2016, without considering the difference between the purpose and effect of the Act and the statute at issue in <em>Bradley. </em>The Supreme Court articulated the <em>Bradley </em>principle as justification for allowing a group of civil rights plaintiffs to obtain attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to section 718 of the Education Amendments of 1972 ..., even though the only issue pending on that section\u2019s effective date was the propriety of an attorneys\u2019 fee award. 416 U.S. at 709-11, 94 S.Ct. at 2015-16. In <em>Bradley, </em>however, the Court did not face any potential waiver of sovereign immunity requiring application of the principle of narrow construction. By contrast, when this principle applies as it does with the Act, it harmonizes with the <em>Bradley </em>principle to require the narrowest interpretation of the sovereign immunity waiver not inconsistent with \u201cstatutory direction or legislative history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711, 94 S.Ct. at 2016. This result is required by the latest teaching of the Supreme Court that \u201c[w]aivers of immunity must be \u2018construed strictly in favor of the sovereign,\u2019 and not \u2018enlarge[d] ... beyond what the language requires.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club</em>], 463 U.S. [680] at 685, 103 S.Ct. [3274] at 3277 [77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983)] (citations omitted). We are disinclined to follow the Fifth and Eighth Circuit approaches because they failed to make this critical distinction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\"><em>Tongol, </em>762 F.2d at 732.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Because a majority of circuits had adopted the litigation position analysis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>determining whether to make an award under EAJA, application of the 1985 amendments, which require consideration of the litigation <em>and </em>agency position, to pending fee petitions would likely result in a further and substantial drain on this nation\u2019s already beleaguered Treasury. Thus the reasoning found in <em>Tongol </em>and <em>Nichols </em>is equally applicable to the issue before us. Additionally the Fifth Circuit in <em>Russell </em>acknowledged as \u201cplausible\u201d the government\u2019s interpretation of the legislative history of the 1985 amendments, which would apply the original Act to cases pending on the effective date, if the time for filing a fee petition had expired by the date of enactment, as it had in this case. With this indicia of legislative intent given by the Act\u2019s co-sponsor, Congressman Kastenmeier, we should strictly construe, in the government\u2019s favor, this further waiver of its sovereign immunity and not apply the EAJA amendments to this case. We are not persuaded to the contrary by appellant\u2019s arguments, including those made in his reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s application of <em>Trident Marine </em>in this case. Since there is evidence that the <em>litigation </em>position of the government in this case was justified, and since we find the 1985 EAJA amendment to be inapplicable and we are not, therefore, required to take into account the underlying agency position, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of fees under EAJA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\">. <em>But see Massachusetts Fair Share v. Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, </em>776 F.2d 1066 (D.C.Cir.1985), where the court observed in a footnote that the 1985 amendments would not apply because petitioner filed the action \"before October 1, 1984.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1068-69 n. 17.
