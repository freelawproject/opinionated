For reversal, he argues that (1) he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing in this matter; (2) he has been subjected to double jeopardy; and (3) his convictions do not support consecutive sentences. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Gann plead guilty to and was given consecutive sentences of two years on count I, one year on count II, and one year on count III. The convictions concerned the following violations: Count I \u2014 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (1982) (felon in possession of a firearm); Count II \u2014 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(c) (1982) (possession of a firearm illegally made) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871 (1982) (penalties); and Count III \u2014 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(h) (1982) (possession of a firearm with serial number removed) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871 (1982) (penalties).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">All three convictions arose from one instance of possession of a single firearm. After reviewing the record, the district court denied Gann\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b205-18\">A. Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b205-19\">Gann asserts that he should have been granted an evidentiary hearing. Generally, if factual issues are in dispute, an evidentiary hearing should be granted. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>751 F.2d 291, 294 (8th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1126, 105 S.Ct. 2659, 86 L.Ed.2d 275 (1985). Gann alleges no factual dispute, however, and no hearing is required if the record clearly shows that the petitioner is not entitled to relief. <em>Hodges v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 139, 140, 82 S.Ct. 235, 236, 7 L.Ed.2d 184 (1961) (per curiam); <em>Johnson, </em>751 F.2d at 294. Because we conclude that the record clearly shows that Gann is not entitled to relief, the trial court did not err in denying the \u00a7 2255 motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-20\">B. Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b205-21\">Gann\u2019s double jeopardy claim is without merit. A single transaction can give rise to distinct offenses without violating the double jeopardy clause. <em>Albemaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 344 n. 3,101 S.Ct. 1137, 1145 n. 3, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981). The test is whether each offense requires proof of an additional fact. <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). <em>Accord United States v. Norton, </em>657 F.2d 1003, 1005 (8th Cir. 1981) (per curiam). It is readily apparent that each of Gann\u2019s convictions required proof of an additional fact. For conviction under 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1), Gann must have been a convicted felon. For conviction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(c), Gann must have possessed a firearm upon which a making tax had not been paid. For conviction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(h), Gann must have possessed a firearm with its serial number removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-22\">C. Consecutive Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b205-23\">Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871 permits a maximum sentence of ten years for viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>tion of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861. \u201c[A] defendant may be <em>convicted </em>of multiple counts under section 5861, but may not receive a total <em>sentence </em>exceeding ten years for one course of conduct violating that section.\u201d <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>731 F.2d 545, 547 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1085, 105 S.Ct. 589, 83 L.Ed.2d 699 (1984) (citing <em>United States v. Ackerson, </em>502 F.2d 300 (8th Cir.1974)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The conviction and consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) are similarly permissible. Although Gann received the maximum sentence permissible under that statute, his aggregate sentence of four years was well within the ten-year maximum allowable sentence under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871 and did not include the permissible $10,000 fine. In <em>Norton, </em>this court upheld consecutive sentences of two years for violation of \u00a7 1202(a)(1) and two years for violation of \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d) and 5871. <em>Norton, </em>657 F.2d at 1004-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The district court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-15\">.
