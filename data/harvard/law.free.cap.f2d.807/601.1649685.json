The district court determined that Sanchez was not entitled to such a credit, and it dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-24\">Petitioner is currently incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana. Four years ago on October 19, 1982, Sanchez refused to answer any question posed to him by a Grand Jury for the Southern District of New York, which was investigating crimes allegedly committed by the Omega 7, a terrorist group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles. The district court found Sanchez to be in civil contempt and thus ordered him to be confined for the lesser of eighteen months or for the life of the Grand Jury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because he continued to refuse to testify, he was indicted for criminal contempt<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>March 9, 1984. Three months later, on June 14, 1984, he was sentenced to a term of nine years\u2019 imprisonment, but on direct appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reduced Sanchez\u2019s sentence to four years. <em>United States v. Gracia, </em>755 F.2d 984 (2d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">In July 1985, Sanchez filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus contending that because he had been incarcerated for seventeen months on the civil contempt charge, which was for the identical act that gave rise to the criminal contempt charge, he was entitled under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to seventeen months credit against his subsequent sentence for criminal contempt. On February 19, 1986, the district court rejected Sanchez\u2019s claim for credit, holding that \u201cthe terms of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568 cover only criminal as opposed to civilly-sanctioned offenses.\u201d After the court entered final judgment on April 30,1986, Sanchez filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Our primary task in this appeal is to construe Section 3568, and we initially note that we must not expand the criminal statute beyond its plain language. <em>United States v. Braverman, </em>373 U.S. 405, 408, 83 S.Ct. 1370, 1372, 10 L.Ed.2d 444 (1963); <em>United States v. Olinger, </em>759 F.2d 1293 (7th Cir.1985). Sanchez basically claims that since both contempt charges arose from the same \u201cact\u201d \u2014 his failure to testify at the Grand Jury proceeding \u2014 he must get credit under Section 3568 toward his criminal contempt sentence for the seventeen to eighteen months he served for civil contempt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He argues that \u201c[t]he language of section 3568 is unambiguous.\u201d We agree. <em>See Anglin v. Johnston, </em>504 F.2d 1165, 1167 (7th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 962, 95 S.Ct. 1353, 43 L.Ed.2d 440 (1975). Under the statute, credit shall be given for time spent \u201cin connection with the offense or acts for which the sentence was imposed\u201d and \u201coffense\u201d is defined as a \u201ccriminal offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">Sanchez asserts that the term \u201coffense\u201d was not at issue and it mattered not that his first incarceration was for civil contempt, an \u201cact,\u201d as opposed to an \u201coffense.\u201d Sanchez, however, fails to provide any support for his novel argument. Moreover, as in <em>Anglin, </em>\u201c[t]he confinement for which petitioner seeks credit was imposed in connection with a civil contempt (refusal to testify) and not in connection with the criminal offense \u2018for which sentence was imposed\u2019____\u201d <em>Anglin, </em>504 F.2d at 1167; <em>see also Williamson v. Saxbe, </em>513 F.2d 1309 (6th Cir.1975). The civil contempt sentence to coerce Sanchez to testify pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ceded the criminal contempt conviction designed to punish Sanchez for his refusal. The policy justifications for rejecting Sanchez\u2019s claim were stated in <em>McQuage v. United States, </em>746 F.2d 759 (2d Cir.1984) (per curiam), where the federal petitioner sought to modify a criminal prison sentence he was then serving by crediting it against a thirteen-month period he served for civil contempt arising from his refusal to testify. The court held that the petitioner was not entitled to this credit, for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aik\">\u201c[Retroactive crediting of a contempt citation would undermine the courts\u2019 capacity to effectuate any coercive purpose under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826. The contemnor would need only to wait out the life of the grand jury, or the term of the citation, and then claim that the contempt citation had been punitive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">746 F.2d at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Previously, this court has sanctioned a four-year criminal contempt sentence imposed upon a recalcitrant witness previously held for civil contempt, <em>see United States v. Patrick, </em>542 F.2d 381, 384 (7th Cir.1976), and we are not persuaded to accept Sanchez\u2019s construction of Section 3568. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-16\">. This section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-17\">\u00a7 1826. Recalcitrant witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-18\">(a) Whenever a witness in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States refuses without just cause shown to comply with an order of the court to testify or provide other information, including any book, paper, document, record, recording or other material, the court, upon such refusal, or when such refusal is duly brought to its attention, may summarily order his confinement at a suitable place until such time as the witness is willing to give such testimony or provide such information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-26\">. This indictment was pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401, which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-28\">\u00a7 401. Power of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-29\">A court of the United States shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority, and none other, as\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>(1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice,</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">(2) Misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transactions,</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">(3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b672-10\">. The relevant section follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">\u00a7 3568. Effective date of sentence; credit for time in custody prior to the imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">The sentence of imprisonment of any person convicted of an offense shall commence to run from the date on which such person is received at the penitentiary, reformatory, or jail for service of such sentence. The Attorney General shall give any such person credit toward service of his sentence for any days spent in custody in connection with the offense or act for which sentence was imposed. As used in this section, the term \"offense\" means any criminal offense, other than an offense triable by court-martial, military commission, provost court, or other military tribunal, which is in violation of an Act of Congress and is triable in any court established by Act of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-17\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b672-18\">. Sanchez neither challenges the authority of the judiciary to impose separate sentences for civil and criminal contempt nor claims any double jeopardy bar to the sentences. <em>See Yates v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 66, 74, 78 S.Ct. 128, 133, 2 L.Ed.2d 95 (1957); <em>United States v. United Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). Recently, this circuit rejected a claim that a defendant\u2019s criminal conviction based on the same conduct for which the defendant was incarcerated civilly violated the fifth amendment\u2019s prohibition against double jeopardy. <em>United States v. Monteleone, </em>804 F.2d 1004, 1009 n. 8 (7th Cir.1986) (district court need not warn defendant during civil contempt proceedings that his recalcitrance could also result in separate and additional criminal penalties).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
