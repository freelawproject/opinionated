In this case, defendant-appellant Curtis Babb claims that his conviction for committing perjury before a United States grand jury is fundamentally unfair because the prosecutor falsely assured him, immediately before his grand jury testimony and in the presence of the grand jury, that he was neither a subject nor a target of the grand jury\u2019s inquiry. Alternatively, Babb urges us to exercise our supervisory powers to suppress his testimony because the prosecutor disregarded Department of Justice guidelines regarding subject and target warnings. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">The ease arises from an investigation by a United States grand jury, sitting in Boston, Massachusetts, of a massive heroin and cocaine distribution organization, known as the Capsule Boys for its practice of encapsulating the drugs it distributed. The record before us reveals that the grand jury had questioned a large number of witnesses, beginning at least as early as March 21, 1984 and extending to at least July 25, 1984. The record also shows that the same Assistant United States Attorney, Oliver C. Mitchell (the prosecutor), had conducted the questioning throughout the investigation. Babb was among the last witnesses questioned in this group, having been called on July 25, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">The record before us also indicates that it was the prosecutor who first had mentioned Babb\u2019s name in the course of the grand jury proceedings, during the questioning of Jackson Blandley in Mr. Blandley\u2019s third appearance before the grand jury. The prosecutor specifically had asked, \u201cAnd Curtis Babb, sir, do you know him?\u201d Testimony of Jackson Blandley, April 25, 1984, at 13. Subsequent witnesses either had named Babb spontaneously<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or had responded to the prosecutor\u2019s direct questions about Babb.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, the testimony of Charles Irby on July 13, 1984 had directly implicated Babb in the organization and supervision of the Capsule Boys. Irby, who had been given an opportunity to recant his prior grand jury testimony, had begun his recantation by describing Babb as the person who had recruited him to sell drugs in Boston. Moreover, throughout his testimony, Irby had mentioned Babb as a central figure in the organization and supervision of drug sales in Boston. Testimony of Charles Irby, July 13, 1984, <em>passim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">When called to testify before the grand jury on July 25, 1984, Babb was incarcerat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>ed. He appeared without the assistance of counsel. After having been given the usual oath, Babb was advised of his fifth amendment rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, the prosecutor informed him that, \u201cat this stage of the Grand Jury investigation you are neither a target nor a subject of the investigation.\u201d Testimony of Curtis Babb, July 25, 1984, at 4. The prosecutor then informed Babb of the subject matter of the investigation but did not inform him that his name had come up frequently in the questioning of other witnesses. The record reveals that Babb was a reticent witness, answering most questions with a terse \u201cNo, sir\u201d or \u201cYes, sir.\u201d <em>Id., passim. </em>Nevertheless, Babb\u2019s answers were sharply at variance with the testimony of prior witnesses; his short answers were a categorical denial of both his involvement with the Capsule Boys and his relationships with numerous other witnesses. Once Babb had so testified, the prosecutor warned him about the possibility of a perjury indictment and asked him if he wished to change his testimony. Babb, however, continued to testify in the same manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">On August 12, 1985, Babb was indicted both for knowingly making false material declarations before a United States grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(a) and for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and conspiracy to distribute heroin and cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Prior to trial, Babb moved both to suppress his grand jury testimony and to dismiss the perjury indictment alleging that the misrepresentations regarding his status before the grand jury were a violation of his fifth amendment rights. The trial court denied both motions and also refused Babb\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Following a jury-waived trial at which the government did not use his grand jury testimony, Babb was found guilty of the conspiracy charge. Babb then entered a conditional plea of guilty to the perjury charge, reserving his motion to suppress for this appeal, which he timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-18\">Babb admits that he committed perjury before the United States grand jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Nevertheless, he seeks to excuse this perjury by pointing out that the prosecutor affirmatively misrepresented to him that he was neither a target nor a subject<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the grand jury investigation. We turn first to Babb\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s misrepresentations regarding his status were a violation of his fifth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">A. <em>Self-Incrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Babb argues that the prosecutor\u2019s misrepresentations taint any supposed waiver by him of his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination because, under the circumstances, his waiver cannot be found to be knowing and intelligent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Babb\u2019s self-incrimination claim must fail, however, because at no time did Babb incriminate himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">Witnesses appearing before the grand jury enjoy the protection of the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Counselman v. Hitchcock, </em>142 U.S. 547, 12 S.Ct. 195, 35 L.Ed. 110 (1892). The privilege extends to all questions that require self-incriminating answers, but the privilege must be claimed if the witness seeks to show that he was compelled within the meaning of the fifth amendment. <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. 564, 574, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 1775, 48 L.Ed.2d 212 (1976) <em>(citing United States v. Monia, </em>317 U.S. 424, 427, 63 S.Ct. 409, 410, 87 L.Ed. 376 (1943)). Nevertheless, the failure of the witness to understand the privilege against self-incrimination will not require the subsequent suppression of the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ness\u2019s concededly false statements. <em>United States v. Wong, </em>431 U.S. 174,177-79, 97 S.Ct. 1823, 1825-26, 52 L.Ed.2d 231 (1977). There is also no requirement that the witness be warned regarding the consequences of committing perjury before the grand jury. <em>Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. at 581-82, 96 S.Ct. at 1778-79. Nor can a witness, at his trial for the substantive offense investigated by the grand jury, have his testimony suppressed because he was not warned that he was a target or potential defendant. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>431 U.S. 181, 189, 97 S.Ct. 1814, 1819, 52 L.Ed.2d 238 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">As Babb correctly points out, however, these cases do not address the distinct question of whether misleading warnings should lead to a different result. Babb, however, ignores the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination. Babb asserts that he had relied on the prosecutor\u2019s misrepresentations and that, consequently, he had incriminated himself before the grand jury. This assertion, however, is not supported by the record. Instead, it is clear from the record that Babb did not incriminate himself \u2014 rather, he committed perjury, a separate crime which has never been held to be the substantive equivalent of self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u201cThe privilege against self-incrimination bars compelled testimony as to past crimes; it does not shelter new perjury.\u201d <em>United States v. Chevoor, </em>526 F.2d 178, 181 (1st Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 935, 96 S.Ct. 1665, 48 L.Ed.2d 176 (1976); <em>see also id. </em>n. 7 <em>(citing </em>supporting case law). \u201c \u2018Our legal system provides methods for challenging the Government\u2019s right to ask questions \u2014 lying is not one of them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wong, </em>431 U.S. at 180, 97 S.Ct. at 1826 <em>(quoting Bryson v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 64, 72, 90 S.Ct. 355, 360, 24 L.Ed.2d 264 (1969 ) (footnote omitted)). The seriousness of the crime of perjury and the appropriateness of sanctions for its commission are well-established:</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In this constitutional process of securing a witness\u2019 testimony, perjury simply has no place whatever. Perjured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concepts of judicial proceedings. Effective restraints against this type of egregious offense are therefore imperative. The power of subpoena, broad as it is, and the power of contempt for refusing to answer, drastic as that is \u2014 and even the solemnity of the oath\u2014 cannot insure truthful answers. Hence, Congress has made the giving of false answers a criminal act punishable by severe penalties; in no other way can criminal conduct be flushed into the open where the law can deal with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Similarly, our cases have consistently \u2014 indeed without exception \u2014 allowed sanctions for false statements or perjury; they have done so even in instances where the perjurer complained that the Government exceeded its constitutional powers in making the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"AmG\"><em>Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. at 576-77, 96 S.Ct. at 1776 (footnote and citations omitted). Although Babb committed the crime of peiju-ry by testifying before the grand jury, the commission of perjury does not fall, within the protection afforded compelled self-incriminating statements. Consequently, we find Babb\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s misrepresentations tainted his waiver of his fifth amendment privilege to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">B. <em>Fundamental Fairness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Turning now to Babb\u2019s claim that the misrepresentations undermined the fundamental fairness of the proceedings against him, we note that peijured testimony before a grand jury will be suppressed because of prosecutorial misconduct only if the misconduct undermines the validity of the grand jury process itself. <em>United States v. Doss, </em>545 F.2d 548, 552 (6th Cir. 1976) (perjury indictment of a defendant, called to testify before grand jury regarding the crime for which he was indicted, \u201cquashed because the proceeding itself is void\u201d); <em>Brown v. United States, </em>245 F.2d 549, 555 (8th Cir.1957) (perjury conviction reversed where testimony of the witness could not support any possible action of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>grand jury within its competency and thus prosecutor\u2019s sole purpose in calling the witness was to lay the foundation for the perjury indictment). <em>See also United States v. Doe </em>(Ellsberg), 455 F.2d 1270, 1273 (1st Cir.1972) (noting that the grand jury should not be used to prepare a pending indictment for trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Target and subject warnings, however, do not affect the validity of the grand jury process. Indeed, they \u201cadd nothing of value to protection of Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>431 U.S. at 189, 97 S.Ct. at 1819. Our task is not to evaluate the specific warnings given; it is to determine \u201cwhether, considering the totality of the circumstances, the free will of the witness was overborne.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 97 S.Ct. at 1819. In making this determination, we first consider the analysis offered by the Third Circuit in a case remarkably similar to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In <em>United States v. Crocker, </em>568 F.2d 1049 (3d Cir.1977), the Third Circuit considered whether affirmative misrepresentations by a prosecutor regarding a grand jury witness\u2019s target status would require the suppression of the witness\u2019s false testimony before the grand jury. The misrepresentations were made when the witness\u2019s attorney expressly inquired of the prosecutor whether his client was a target of the grand jury investigation. The prosecutor advised the attorney that the witness was not a target. When the witness subsequently testified before the grand jury, the prosecutor warned him regarding his fifth amendment rights, his oath, and the consequences of perjury. Although the Third Circuit characterized the prosecutorial misrepresentations as \u201cquite troublesome,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1055, the court found that due process did not entail an \u201cobligation to do anything more than inform the witness of the dangers of testifying falsely by administering an oath.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the witness had knowledge of the subject of the grand jury\u2019s inquiry, the court refused to find that the misrepresentations were a due process violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">This court has also had the opportunity to consider whether prosecutorial misrepresentations regarding a grand jury witness\u2019s target status require the suppression of that witness\u2019s self-incriminating testimony. In <em>United States v. Winter, </em>663 F.2d 1120 (1st Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1011, 103 S.Ct. 1250, 75 L.Ed.2d 479 (1983), the witness-defendant sought to suppress incriminating statements made before the grand jury. Although these statements were not used in the government\u2019s case-in-chief against him, the witness alleged that they were obtained because he waived his privilege in reliance on the misrepresentations and that they were used to refresh other witnesses\u2019 memories and thus consequently led to his indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 1150-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In <em>Winter, </em>we approached the witness\u2019s due process claim by evaluating the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the misrepresentations had actually misled the witness. <em>Id. </em>at 1151. We noted that the warnings that were given more than fulfilled the constitutional requirements. In addition, we found that the witness could not \u201cpossibly have been misled into waiving his rights\u201d since the prosecutor had warned him that his name had been mentioned by other witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 1152. Finding no relationship between the misconduct and the harm of which the witness complained, we concluded that his due process claim was \u201ctenuous indeed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Turning now to the present case, we find that the reasoning of <em>Winter </em>and <em>Crocker </em>is dispositive. We note first that Babb received all the warnings required by the Constitution. In addition, Babb was informed of the subject matter of the grand jury\u2019s inquiry. As both <em>Winter </em>and <em>Crock-er </em>hold, once the prosecutor has fulfilled any constitutional requirements and if the witness is apprised of the subject of the inquiry, additional warnings, even if inaccurate, are irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Finally, we disagree with Babb\u2019s assertion that the record supports an inference that Babb\u2019s reliance on the misrepresentations make any subsequent proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>against him fundamentally unfair. Even if we assume, for purposes of Babb\u2019s contentions, that the prosecutor purposely attempted to mislead Babb, the obvious reason for such misrepresentations would have been to induce Babb to waive his fifth amendment privilege and to give helpful testimony to the grand jury. As we discussed above, Babb was not misled in this manner. In fact, it defies logic to argue that assurances that might have lulled a witness into giving incriminating statements had the effect of inducing the witness to commit perjury. Consequently, we find that Babb has failed to establish the necessary nexus between the alleged misconduct and his subsequent peijurious testimony in order to support a claim of fundamental unfairness. <em>See United States v. McNeill, </em>728 F.2d 5, 11 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Finally, Babb urges us to reach the issue that we did not reach in <em>In re Angiulo, </em>579 F.2d 104 (1st Cir.1978): whether we should adopt the reasoning of <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>531 F.2d 87, <em>vacated, </em>429 U.S. 909, 97 S.Ct. 299, 50 L.Ed.2d 277 <em>on remand, </em>547 F.2d 772 (2d Cir.1976), and, in the exercise of our supervisory powers, suppress any testimony of a grand jury witness whom the prosecutor fails to warn is a target in accordance with Department of Justice guidelines. Leaving aside the lack of a factual finding that Babb was indeed a target, <em>see supra </em>note 4, we first note that we consider quite seriously the suggestion of prosecutorial misconduct. <em>See United States v. Bourque, </em>541 F.2d 290, 293 (1st Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Our review of the record reveals that the prosecutor failed to give target or subject warnings to any witness called before the grand jury in this investigation. Other than the statements at issue in this appeal, there is only one additional mention of target and subject status \u2014 the prosecutor informed one other witness that she was not a target or a subject. <em>See </em>Testimony of Brenda Thomas Austin, July 25, 1984, at 6. During the course of this same testimony, however, this same prosecutor also stated: \u201cMrs. Austin, the Grand Jury has reason to believe that you had some association with the Capsule Boys group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. In light of this record, we find the government\u2019s characterization of the prosecutor\u2019s statements as a good faith error, Brief for Appellee at 17 n. 3, to be totally unpersuasive. Moreover, as we mentioned at argument, we are particularly displeased that this prosecutor did not appear before us to argue the case. In sum, we find the prosecutor\u2019s behavior to be more than \u201cquite troublesome;\u201d we find it to be unprofessional and worthy of severe condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Nevertheless, as we noted in <em>United States v. Lieberman, </em>608 F.2d 889 (1st Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1019, 100 S.Ct. 673, 62 L.Ed.2d 649 (1980), \u201c[o]ur supervisory powers are to be used sparingly. We would be reluctant to exercise them to overturn a conviction that was not the <em>product </em>of manifestly improper conduct by federal officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 899 <em>(citing Lopez v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 427, 440, 83 S.Ct. 1381, 1388, 10 L.Ed.2d 462 (1963)) (emphasis added). <em>See also United States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 506, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1979, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (supervisory powers should not be used if the error alleged is harmless). Because we find that Babb\u2019s penury and his subsequent conviction for that crime were not a \u201cproduct\u201d of the prosecutorial misconduct, this is not a proper case in which to exercise our supervisory powers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We therefore refuse to suppress Babb\u2019s testimony on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>We have considered Babb\u2019s other arguments and find them without merit.

Babb argues that at the time of his testimony he was a subject or a target of the grand jury investigation. Under the relevant Department of Justice guidelines, a \"target\u201d is defined as \u201ca person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is a putative defendant.\u201d A \"subject\u201d is \u201ca person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury's investigation.\" It is clear from the record that Babb was at least a subject. The government, however, apparently concedes that Babb was a target. Brief for Appellee at 17 n. 3. Usually, a determination of target status requires an evidentiary hearing. <em>See United States v. Winter, </em>663 F.2d 1120, 1151 (1st Cir.1981). Nevertheless, because a finding that Babb was a target of the grand jury\u2019s inquiry in no way changes our reasoning, we proceed in accordance with the government\u2019s concession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\">.

One thing, I am not sure what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t have no knowledge of what\u2019s happening and I don\u2019t want to get involved in nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-12\">Q. And so you\u2019re telling the Grand Jury that the only reason you don\u2019t want to testify is you have no knowledge regarding the activities of the Capsule Boys, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-15\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-16\">Q. And you're telling the Grand Jury that you don't want to testify also because you don\u2019t want to get involved, is that right? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-17\">Q. And those are the only reasons you don't want to testify before the Grand Jury, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-18\">A. Yeah, I don\u2019t want to get involved with nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-19\">Q. And you say you don\u2019t know anything about the activities of the Capsule Boys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-20\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-21\">Testimony of Curtis Babb, July 25, 1984, at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-22\">If the fifth amendment privilege before a grand jury were as broad as the privilege that attaches to custodial interrogation, Babb\u2019s allegation would indeed heighten our inquiry. Unlike a person subject to custodial interrogation, however, a witness before a grand jury cannot refuse to answer all questions. Instead, the witness must assert the privilege as to those questions that require a self-incriminating answer; once the privilege is asserted, however, the grand jury may pursue other lines of inquiry. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. 564, 572-75, 580-81, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 1778, 48 L.Ed.2d 212 (1976). In Babb's case, the prosecutor sought a clarification of Babb\u2019s initial refusal to give any testimony. Although the prosecutor's inquiry did not include a reminder that Babb could refuse to testify if the testimony would incriminate him, there is no requirement that this warning, once initially given, must be repeated. We note that the prosecutor did later repeat the warning, Testimony of Curtis Babb, July 25, 1984, at 26-27, and that Babb also spontaneously mentioned his right \"to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">. We cannot overly stress this distinction between the prosecutor\u2019s misrepresentations and Babb\u2019s perjury. To be convicted for perjury, Babb\u2019s false statements must have been both knowingly made and material. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(a). Even if the prosecutor had knowingly made false statements to Babb, in this context these misrepresentations would not have been material. If his misrepresentations had been material, then Babb\u2019s conviction would have been a product of the prosecutor\u2019s improper conduct, and we would have been willing to exercise our supervisory powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
