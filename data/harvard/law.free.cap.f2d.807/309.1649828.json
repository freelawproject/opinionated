At the time the lawsuit was instituted \u2014 December 3, 1984 \u2014 and throughout most of the litigation, Romandette was incarcerated. Due to his incarceration, he was dependent upon prison library facilities to research his legal claims and, because of his <em>in forma pauperis </em>status, dependent upon United States Marshals to effectuate service of process. Because of the special circumstances constraining Romandette in the prosecution of his suit, we hold that the district court erred in dismissing for failure to effect service and abused its discretion in dismissing for neglect to prosecute. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-23\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b379-24\">Romandette filed this diversity action on December 3,1984, asserting products liability claims against Weetabix Company, Inc. (\u201cWeetabix\u201d), a Massachusetts corporation. He sought compensatory and punitive damages for physical injuries, including a broken tooth, and emotional harm allegedly attributable to ingesting a foreign substance while eating Weetabix Cornflakes at the Downstate Correctional Facility. After plaintiff was granted leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>his <em>pro se </em>summons and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>complaint was forwarded to the United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York for service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 31, 1984, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(2)(C)(ii), the Marshal\u2019s Service mailed a copy of the summons and complaint by first class mail to Weetabix. On January 7, 1985, Weeta-bix\u2019s vice-president and treasurer signed and returned the acknowledgment form. In its answer, Weetabix asserted Roman-dette\u2019s failure to effect service in accordance with New York law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">On April 25, 1985, Romandette moved, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f), to strike Weetabix\u2019s affirmative defense, arguing that Weetabix had been served properly on January 7 in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, when the acknowledgment form was signed. Weetabix countered that service had not been effected in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(3), pertaining to service upon a corporate defendant. Between April 25 and July 2, 1985, Romandette and Weetabix actively engaged in discovery and each filed a number of motions. Finally, on July 2, Judge Gagliardi responded to several of these motions. With regard to Weetabix\u2019s defense of improper service, the court noted that whether Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) permits service by mail on out-of-state defendants is the subject of disagreement among various district courts. Although courts in the Southern District of New York have held such service invalid, Judge Gagliardi concluded that it would not be in the interests of justice to penalize Romandette for his reliance on the actions of the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Service and that Weetabix was not prejudiced since it had formally acknowledged service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">[I]t would not be in the interest of justice and the philosophy of <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519 [92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652] (1972) <em>(pro se </em>litigants given the benefit of liberal interpretation of federal rules) to foster continued uncertainty concerning the propriety of service in this case or to penalize plaintiff for his reliance on the actions of the U.S. Marshal\u2019s service. There is little risk of prejudice to defendant in this regard, since defendant formally acknowledged the service by mail, and in fact received the summons and complaint in January 1985.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Memorandum Opinion, July 2, 1985. The court noted that the Marshal\u2019s Service had indicated that it would personally serve Weetabix.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">On July 26, 1985, the case was reassigned to Judge Brieant. Weetabix moved for dismissal on December 10, 1985, on the grounds that personal service had never been effected and that Romandette had failed to prosecute by taking no action since June 1985. Romandette responded that \u201con information and belief [the service defect] was cured in Judge Gagliardi\u2019s or-der____\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Affidavit, December 23, 1985. Additionally, he explained his six months of inaction in the case as resulting from a reversal of his state conviction and the granting of a new trial, which necessitated his transfer to Albany County Jail on July 3, 1985. That transfer placed him in a facility alleged to be lacking adequate library and legal assistance resources. He explained that he was \u201cunable to determine the exact significance and meaning of FRCP 4 and FRCP 41(b) because said FRCP are not in our law library.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, he requested assignment of counsel, or, alternatively, a \u201cstay in all proceedings\u201d through March 28,1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">Judge Brieant determined that, \u201c[h]aving chosen to proceed <em>pro se, </em>this litigant should have complied with Judge Gagliar-di\u2019s directives,\u201d and granted Weetabix\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to effect service and neglect to prosecute on January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>21, 1986. Memorandum Opinion, January 21, 1986. Unfortunately for Romandette, although the Marshal\u2019s Service had noted a request to serve Weetabix personally on June 13, 1985, personal service was not effected until April 1, 1986, nearly three and a half months after dismissal of his action. Apparently, the delay in service was due to the volume of requests for service received by the Marshal to whom Romandette\u2019s complaint was forwarded, and not to any dilatoriness on the part of Romandette.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AE9\">I. <em>Personal Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The preliminary issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in dismissing this suit, brought by an incarcerated <em>pro se </em>litigant proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>because the U.S. Marshal had yet to effect personal process through no fault of the litigant. Initially, we note that Judge Gagliardi ruled that \u201cthe interests of justice\u201d mandated that Romandette be allowed the chance to serve Weetabix personally through the Marshal\u2019s Service. Judge Brieant, however, apparently believing that Romandette had failed to take some action to effect this service, concluded that the \u201clitigant should have complied with Judge Gagliardi\u2019s directives.\u201d In fact, Romandette had done everything in his power to effect personal service through the Marshal\u2019s Service. Because the special circumstances of the litigant\u2019s position were before the court, and yet were not considered, we hold that the district court erred in dismissing the case for failure to effect service.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">It is apparent that the court was not required to dismiss the action. As we observed in <em>Grammenos v. Lemos, </em>457 F.2d 1067, 1070 (2d Cir.1972), Rule 4 of the Federal Rules is to be construed liberally \u201cto further the purpose of finding personal jurisdiction in cases in which the party has received actual notice.\u201d We further noted that \u201cincomplete or improper service will lead the court to dismiss the action <em>unless it appears that proper service may still be obtained..\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). In the case before us, Weetabix had actual notice, as evidenced by its return of the acknowledgment form signed by a Weeta-bix officer, and would not have been prejudiced by allowing the suit to continue. Furthermore, this is, in fact, a case in which proper service could be yet obtained (as it was on April 1, 1986). We therefore believe that dismissal was premature. Our brethren on the Fifth Circuit aptly addressed the point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">There may well come a time in which the Trial Court, in the administration of the affairs of the Court, sees that there is simply no reasonably conceivable means of acquiring jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. When that time comes it may be proper to dismiss the cause. But, on this record, ... the point has not yet been reached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-10\"><em>Stanga v. McCormick Shipping Corp., </em>268 F.2d 544, 554 (5th Cir.1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">As Judge Gagliardi found, the provision in Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(j) that service be effected within 120 days after filing the complaint posed no bar to Romandette\u2019s action. By the explicit terms of Rule 4(j), the court can disregard a failure to meet the 120-day limit if the plaintiff can show \u201cgood cause why such service was not made.\u201d <em>See generally </em>Siegel, <em>Practice Commentary on Amendment of Federal Rule 4, </em>96 F.R.D. 88, 101-02. Romandette plainly exhibited good cause. As an incarcerated <em>pro se </em>litigant proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>he was entitled to rely on service by the U.S. Marshals, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(2)(B)(i). He indicated to the court his reliance on service by the Marshals and he timely requested that the Marshals effect personal service.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">In sum, we find that dismissal by the district court was not mandated by the failure to effect service. Moreover, the interests of justice, informed by a liberal interpretation of Rule 4, are best served by allowing this litigant to rely on the personal service, albeit untimely, ultimately effected by the Marshal\u2019s Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>II. <em>Failure to Prosecute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Dismissal for failure to prosecute, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), is a matter committed to the discretion of the district court, <em>Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 633, 82 S.Ct. 1386,1390, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962); <em>Lyell Theatre Corp. v. Loews Corp., </em>682 F.2d 37, 43 (2d Cir.1982), which we will review on an abuse of discretion standard, <em>see Chira v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., </em>634 F.2d 664, 666 (2d Cir.1980). At the outset, however, we note that dismissal is \u201ca harsh remedy to be utilized only in extreme situations.\u201d <em>Theilmann v. Rutland Hospital, Inc., </em>455 F.2d 853, 855 (2d Cir.1972) (per curiam); <em>accord Merker v. Rice, </em>649 F.2d 171, 173-74 (2d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In <em>Harding v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, </em>707 F.2d 46, 50 (2d Cir.1983), we identified the factors that an appellate court, viewing the record as a whole, need assess in ruling on the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to prosecute. These factors include (1) the duration of plaintiff\u2019s failures; (2) whether plaintiff had received notice that further delays would result in dismissal; (3) whether defendant is likely to be prejudiced by further delay; (4) whether the district judge has carefully balanced the need to alleviate court calendar congestion and a party\u2019s right to due process; and (5) whether the court has assessed the efficacy of lesser sanctions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The record indicates that from the inception of this case through Judge Gagliardi\u2019s order of July 2, 1985, Romandette actively prosecuted his claim. He diligently pursued discovery and both set forth and responded to a number of motions. During this period, Weetabix itself was responsible for several delays in moving the action forward. However, from July to December, 1985 no action was taken by Roman-dette. This six-month hiatus was readily explainable by his transfer to a county facility, a facility apparently lacking the library and legal assistance resources that Romandette required to pursue this civil claim, where he awaited the retrial of his criminal case. Indeed, by affidavit filed with the district court on December 23, 1985, Romandette communicated his research difficulties to the court and requested assignment of counsel or, alternatively, a stay of further proceedings. Thus, we find that the period of inaction on Roman-dette\u2019s part was excusable. While our application of the first <em>Harding </em>factor, therefore, is the controlling element here, the remaining factors also favor Romandette. Romandette never was warned that further delay would result in dismissal. Neither do we believe that Weetabix was prejudiced by the delay, there being no indication that evidence is likely to be lost, or that discovery has been made more difficult. <em>See Davis v. Musler, </em>713 F.2d 907, 916 (2d Cir.1983). Additionally, there is no indication that the district court considered calendar congestion or Romandette\u2019s due process rights. Finally, while we do not believe that any sanctions were appropriate, the district court gave no consideration to the \u201cefficacy of lesser sanctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">We therefore hold that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">In sum, we hold that Romandette\u2019s special circumstances as a <em>pro se </em>litigant, proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>while incarcerated, should have been taken into account by the district court. In the interests of justice, the court should have allowed the U.S. Marshals Service to effect personal service, since Romandette had done everything in his power to comply with Rule 4 and the defendant had actual notice of the suit. Furthermore, we hold that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing for failure to prosecute, when the period of inaction was readily explainable by Romandette\u2019s transfer to await retrial in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">.
