The administrative law judge (AU) concluded that the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments. The AU, therefore, terminated the review process at Step 2, or the severity stage, of the five-step sequential inquiry. <em>See Goo-dermote v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>690 F.2d 5 (1st Cir.1982). The decision of the AU became the final decision of the Secretary when the Appeals Council denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The claimant contends that the AU erred in basing his determination of non-disability on medical factors alone without considering vocational factors. The claimant did not raise this issue either in his request for review to the Appeals Council or before the district court. \u201cThe ordinary rule is that appellate courts will not consider issues not raised below.\u201d <em>United States v. Krynicki, </em>689 F.2d 289, 291 (1st Cir. 1982); <em>see Krafsur v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>757 F.2d 446, 447 (1st Cir.1985) (claimant\u2019s challenge to severity regulation was not raised below).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Even ignoring this procedural problem, the claimant\u2019s argument is unavailing. Subsequent to the filing of the claimant\u2019s brief in this case, this court decided the case of <em>McDonald v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>795 F.2d 1118 (1st Cir.1986). In the <em>McDonald </em>case, we concluded that the Step 2 severity regulation, as interpreted by the Secretary in Social Security Ruling 85-28, constitutes a <em>de minimis </em>screening device and that the Secretary is not precluded from implementing a threshold test of medical severity to screen out claims that would clearly be disallowed even if vocational factors were considered. <em>Id. </em>at 1121-1126. In the case at bar, the AU utilized the correct definitional framework for determining whether an impairment or combination of impairments was severe, <em>i.e., </em>whether the impairment or combination of impairments significantly limited the claimant\u2019s ability to perform basic work activities such as walking, standing, sitting, lifting or carrying. Record at 11-13; <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521 (1986). Further, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the AU\u2019s conclusion that the claimant\u2019s impairments were not shown to limit his activities in any way that would interfere with work activity. Therefore, denial of disability benefits at the Step 2 level of review was appropriate since \u201c \u2018medical evidence established] only a slight abnormality or combination of slight abnormalities which would have no more than a minimal effect on [the claimant\u2019s] ability to work even if the individual\u2019s age, education, or work experience were specifically considered____\u2019\u201d <em>McDonald v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>795 F.2d at 1124 (quoting Social Security Ruling 85-28).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The claimant argues that the AU should have given greater consideration to Dr. Rafael Morales\u2019 assessment of the claimant\u2019s condition since Dr. Morales is a treating physician. We have repeatedly refused to adopt any <em>per se </em>rule to that effect. <em>Tremblay v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>676 F.2d 11, 18 (1st Cir.1982). While Dr. Morales\u2019 assessment of the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity indicated that the extent of the claimant\u2019s use of his upper and lower extremities is limited by recurring inflammatory arthritis and that activities such as bending and carrying may aggravate \u201cdegenerative changes of his cervical spine and discogenic disease\u201d (R. at 160), this assessment is in contrast to the assessment of other examining physicians who found that the claimant had a full range of motion. R. at 84, 129,133-135,149-153. Conflicts in the evidence are for the Secretary to resolve. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 399, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1426, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). We find no error in the AU\u2019s resolution of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
