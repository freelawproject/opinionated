Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-22\">We glean from the pleadings that An-drade raises a sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The district court rejected that claim because Andrade failed to allege any facts that would constitute a violation of the standard announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-23\">Further, the district court found this application to be an abuse of the writ. 28 U.S.C. foil. \u00a7 2254, Rule 9(b). Having concluded that Andrade has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a federal right, we must deny the requested certificate of probable cause, <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>and therefore do not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-24\">The request for a certificate of probable cause is DENIED; the motion for stay of execution is DENIED; the judgment of the trial court stands AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
