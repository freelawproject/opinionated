Hill, <em>Bankruptcy Judge, </em>entered June 26, 1985. The latter judgment dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint in an adversary proceeding against Robert Porter Smith and Julie Rose Smith (\u201cRobert\u201d; \u201cJulie\u201d; or, collectively, \u201cappel-lees\u201d). Appellant\u2019s complaint sought a determination that Robert\u2019s financial obligation incurred under the Physician Shortage Area Scholarship Program (\u201cPSASP\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 295g-21 (Supp. V 1975), was a debt \u201cfor an educational loan\u201d, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8) (1982), and as such was not dis-chargeable in bankruptcy. Both the bankruptcy court and the district court held that Robert\u2019s PSASP scholarship was not a \u201cloan\u201d and, therefore, was dischargeable. We hold that Robert\u2019s obligation incurred under PSASP was a nondischargeable \u201ceducational loan\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(8). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-23\">The facts are straightforward and not in dispute. Most were stipulated in the bankruptcy court. We summarize only those facts believed necessary to an understanding of the issue raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-24\">Robert is a physician. He studied medicine at the University of Missouri from August 1974 through May 1977. During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>that period, appellant awarded him $13,-984.00 in PSASP scholarship grants to finance his medical training. Before its repeal by Pub.L. No. 94-484, Title IV, \u00a7 409(a), Oct. 12, 1976, 90 Stat. 2290, PSASP authorized appellant to \u201cmake scholarship grants to individuals who are medical students and who agree to engage in the practice of primary care after completion of their professional training ... in a physician shortage area____\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 295g-21(a). PSASP grants were awarded on the condition that the recipient would engage in such practice \u201cfor a twelvemonth period for each full academic year with respect to which he receives such a scholarship grant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 295g-21(c)(l). If a PSASP grant recipient failed to comply with this condition, the United States was entitled to recover from the recipient the amount of the grant plus \u201cinterest which would be payable ... if, at the time such grant was made, such grant were a loan bearing interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury____\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 295g-21(c)(3). PSASP\u2019s repeal does not affect the right of the United States to recover from recipients who fail to practice in a shortage area.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Robert\u2019s signed PSASP application stated that he agreed to practice in a physician shortage area on completion of his medical training; he also signed an agreement accepting the grant \u201cand all applicable conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">On Robert\u2019s graduation from medical school in May 1977, appellant deferred his obligation to practice in a physician shortage area for four years. During that period he pursued his residency in ophthalmology-</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">He never has practiced in a physician shortage area. In a letter dated March 11, 1983, appellant informed Robert that he was in breach of his PSASP agreement and that he was obligated \u201cto monetarily repay all funds awarded to you or on your behalf, plus 9 percent interest.\u201d At that time, his PSASP obligation was $27,841.44. He never has made any payments on account of this debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">On February 21, 1984, appellees filed a petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-766 (1982 &amp; Supp. III 1985). Appellees\u2019 bankruptcy schedules listed Robert\u2019s PSASP obligation, then amounting to $29,289.96, as an unsecured claim without priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">On January 3, 1985, appellant commenced the instant adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court- for the District of North Dakota to determine dischargeability. 11 U.S.C. Bankruptcy Rules 4007, 7001(6) (Supp. III 1985). Appellant sought an order determining that Robert\u2019s PSASP obligation was a debt for an educational loan and hence was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8). Section 523(a)(8) makes nondischargeable \u201cany debt ... for an educational loan made ... by a governmental unit\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">A joint stipulation of counsel was filed with the bankruptcy court on May 17,1985. One of the provisions of the stipulation stated that appellant \u201cmakes no claim by this action against\u201d Julie and that Julie \u201cmay be dismissed from this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">In a memorandum opinion and order filed June 26, 1985, the bankruptcy court held that the PSASP grants awarded to Robert constituted a \u201ccontingent scholarship\u201d and not a \u201cloan\u201d and hence that Robert\u2019s PSASP obligation was dischargeable. A judgment dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint was entered on this order on June 26, 1985. On July 5, 1985, appellant appealed from that judgment to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">In a memorandum opinion and order filed December 31, 1985, the district court affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court. This appeal followed. The sole issue on appeal is whether Robert\u2019s PSASP obligation is a nondischargeable \u201cdebt ... for an educational loan\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">The bankruptcy laws embody a congressional policy to free an honest debtor from his financial burdens and thus to allow him to make an unencumbered fresh start. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>Kokoszka v. Belford, </em>417 U.S. 642, 645-46 (1974). Consistent with this fresh-start policy, the provisions of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727 (1982 &amp; Supp. III 1985) require the bankruptcy court in most cases to discharge the debts of an honest consumer-bankrupt. S.Rep. No. 95-989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (\u201cAt the heart of the fresh start provisions of the bankruptcy law is section 727 covering discharge.\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5793. Congress has determined, however, that this fresh-start policy at times must yield to certain exceptions designed either to implement overriding policies or to curb abuses. One such exception, the one here at issue, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">\u201c(a) A discharge under section 727 ... of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt\u2014 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">(8) for an educational loan made ... by a governmental unit, or made under any program funded ... by a governmental unit____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The issue before us is whether Robert\u2019s financial obligation incurred under PSASP constitutes a \u201cdebt ... for an educational loan\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(8). Appellees concede that Robert\u2019s PSASP scholarship was for an educational purpose but dispute that it was a loan. We hold that it was a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The Bankruptcy Code does not define \u201ceducational loan\u201d. \u201cWhere Congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under ... common law, a court must infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that Congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Amax Coal Co., </em>453 U.S. 322, 329 (1981). Courts have defined \u201cloan\u201d in a variety of contexts. In <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Valley Morris Plan, </em>305 F.2d 610, 618 (9th Cir. 1962), for example, the Ninth Circuit, in deciding whether a transaction constituted a loan for tax purposes, applied the definition of loan set forth in <em>National Bank of Paulding v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em>131 F.Supp. 121 (S.D.Ohio 1954):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-11\">\u201cIn order to have a loan, there must be an agreement, either express or implied, whereby one person advances money to the other and the other agrees to repay it upon such terms as to time and rate of interest, or without interest, as the parties may agree____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-12\"><em>Paulding, </em>131 F.Supp. at 123-24. Other courts have applied the <em>Paulding </em>definition to cases involving insurance contracts. <em>Shoals National Bank of Florence v. Home Indemnity Co., </em>384 F.Supp. 49, 53 (N.D.Ala.1974), <em>aff'd mem., </em>515 F.2d 1182 (5th Cir.1975); <em>Sutro Bros. &amp; Co. v. Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>264 F.Supp. 273, 289-90 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd, </em>386 F.2d 798 (2d Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">In <em>In re Grand Union Co., </em>219 F. 353 (2d Cir.1914), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Hamilton Investment Co. v. Irving Ernst, </em>238 U.S. 626 (1915), the Second Circuit defined a loan as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-14\">\u201cA loan of money is a contract by which one delivers a sum of money to another and the latter agrees to return at a future time a sum equivalent to that which he borrows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-15\">\u2018In order to constitute a loan there must be a contract whereby, in substance one party transfers to the other a sum of money which that other agrees to repay absolutely, together with such additional sums as may be agreed upon for its use. If such be the intent of the parties, the transaction will be considered a loan without regard to its form.\u2019 39 Cyc. 926.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-m\">219 F. at 356. <em>Accord, </em>6 The Michie Co., Banks &amp; Banking, Ch. 11, \u00a7 1, at 238 (Rev. ed. 1975); <em>see also United Virginia Factors Corp. v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>624 F.2d 814, 816 (4th Cir.1980) (quoting <em>Grand </em>Union); <em>Calcasieu-Ma-rine National Bank v. American Employers\u2019 Insurance Co., </em>533 F.2d 290, 296-97 (5th Cir.) (using <em>Grand Union\u2019s </em>\u201cclassic definition of a loan\u201d to distinguish loan from sale in insurance context), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Louisiana Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Employers Liability Assurance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Corp., </em>429 U.S. 922 (1976); <em>IBM Pough-keepsie Employees Federal Credit Union v. Cumis Insurance Society, </em>590 F.Supp. 769, 775 (S.D.N.Y.1984) (Weinfeld, J.) (quoting <em>Grand Union).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Under the well settled definitions of loan set forth above, Robert\u2019s scholarship was a loan. Appellant advanced money to Robert. By signing an agreement accepting the grant \u201cand all applicable conditions\u201d, Robert agreed to repay appellant with interest if Robert failed to practice in a physician shortage area for the requisite period.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Appellees argue that Robert\u2019s PSASP scholarship was not a \u201cloan\u201d since his obligation to reimburse the United States was not \u201cabsolute[ ]\u201d, <em>Grand Union, supra, </em>219 F. at 356, but rather was contingent on his failure to practice in a physician shortage area. Courts have differed on whether the contingency of the obligation to repay defeats the status of the transaction as a loan. <em>Compare Northern Mining Corp. v. Trunz, </em>124 F.2d 14, 17 (9th Cir.1941) (in deciding real property dispute, the court quoted \u201cVolume 38 C.J., page 127\u201d for the proposition that \u201c \u2018[i]f the obligation to return is based on a contingency or on a certain condition which may or may not happen or occur, the transaction is not a loan.\u2019\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>316 U.S. 664 (1942) <em>with United Gas Improvement Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>240 F.2d 312, 318 (3d Cir.1956) (in determining tax consequences of a transaction, the court stated: \u201c \u2018A loan is no less a loan because its repayment is made contingent\u2019 \u201d.) (quoting <em>Island Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>57 F.2d 992, 994 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>287 U.S. 646 (1932)) <em>and Old Colony Trust Assoc. v. Hassett, </em>150 F.2d 179, 183 (1st Cir.1945) (same; quoting <em>Island Petroleum) and American Bemberg Corp. v. United States, </em>150 F.Supp. 355, 360 (D.Del. 1957) (same; quoting <em>United Gas, supra, </em>240 F.2d at 318), <em>affd, </em>253 F.2d 691 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 827 (1958). <em>Cf. Saunders v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>720 F.2d 871, 873 (5th Cir.1983) (recognizing \u201cthat the contingency of repayment standing alone does not invalidate a loan for tax purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">We follow the weight of authority that \u201c[a] loan is no less a loan because its repayment is made contingent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Appellees contend further that Robert\u2019s scholarship was not a loan in view of the use of the subjunctive verb form in PSASP. The United States, on the failure of a PSASP grant recipient to practice in a physician shortage area, is entitled to recover the amount of the grant plus \u201csums of interest which <em>would </em>be payable on each such scholarship grant <em>if </em>at the time such grant was made, such grant <em>were </em>a loan bearing interest____\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 295g-21(c)(3) (emphasis added). Appellees argue that a PSASP grant cannot constitute a loan since, through its use of the italicized words, the statute suggests that the scholarship grant <em>in fact </em>was not a loan. Whatever may be the surface appeal of appel-lees\u2019 argument, our examination of the legislative history of both \u00a7 523(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code and PSASP compels the conclusion that there is no merit to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">We have carefully considered appellees\u2019 other arguments and we conclude that they likewise are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">In a House Report leading to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549, Congress recognized the unique nature of educational loans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-14\">\u201c[EJducational loans are different from most loans. They are made without business considerations, without security, without cosigners, and relying for repayment solely on the debtor\u2019s future increased income resulting from the education. In this sense, the loan is viewed as a mortgage on the debtor\u2019s future. In addition, there have been abuses of the system by those seeking freedom from educational debts without ever attempting to repay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 133, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5963, 6094. The unique nature of such loans was recognized in <em>In re Shipman, </em>33 B.R. 80 (Bankr.W.D.Mo.1983). There the bankruptcy court, as part of its rationale in concluding that the loan in question was not \u201ceducational\u201d, explained the background and purpose of \u00a7 523(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">\u201cUnder the Bankruptcy Act, educational loans were dischargeable resulting in millions of dollars in federally guaranteed loans defaulted upon annually. To correct this situation, section 439A(a) of the Higher Educational Act of 1965 was amended to provide that these loans were nondischargeable in a bankruptcy proceeding. When the Bankruptcy Act was reformed in 1978, this exception to discharge for educational loans was removed from the Higher Educational Act and placed in section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code. See, 4 Collier on Bankruptcy, 523.18 at 523-136-138 (15th Ed. 1983). <em>This direct link to the federal education statute is an excellent indication that the central issue in determining dischargeability is whether the funds were for educational purposes, not whether the funds constituted a loan.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">33 B.R. at 82 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In <em>In re Avila, </em>53 B.R. 933 (Bankr.W.D. N.Y.1985), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">\u201cThe legislative history of subsection 523(a)(8) indicates that Congress sought to quell the situation where an individual graduated from college owing one or more educational loans and then discharged them through a bankruptcy proceeding without making a good faith effort to repay those loans. See Report of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.R.Doc. No. 93-137, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess., Pt. 1, 176-77.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1G\">53 B.R. at 935. The <em>Avila </em>court applied the <em>Shipman </em>court\u2019s formulation of the \u201ccentral issue\u201d under \u00a7 523(a)(8) to determine that a scholarship awarded pursuant to the Public Health and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Training Program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 234 (Supp. Y 1975), a federal program similar to PSASP, constituted a nondischargeable \u201ceducational loan\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">As in <em>Avila, </em>the facts of the instant case \u201cappear to track the abuse which Congress tried to eliminate by enacting [\u00a7 523(a)(8) ].\u201d 53 B.R. at 935. A PSASP grant recipient accepts public funds to finance his education. Following graduation, the recipient defaults both on his obligation to practice in a physician shortage area and on his resulting obligation to reimburse the United States. To allow him then to go into bankruptcy, avoid his debt, and subsequently to engage in a lucrative medical practice, would make a farce of the clear congressional purpose which underlies \u00a7 523(a)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The legislative history of PSASP supports this conclusion. The cosponsor of the Senate Bill leading to PSASP made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">\u201cIf a scholarship recipient fails to hon- or his commitment, the scholarship is in effect converted to a loan, and the individual is required to repay to the Government the value of the scholarship plus interest at the commercial market rate. If the program works, we will have taken important action in helping to solve the maldistribution problem; if it does not, the Government will not lose a cent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">117 Cong.Rec. 25139 (July 14, 1971) (statement of Sen. Beall).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">In construing the statutes which control the issue before us, we must be mindful of our duty \u201c \u2018to find that interpretation which can most fairly be said to be imbedded in the statute[s], in the sense of being most harmonious with [their] scheme and with the general purposes that Congress manifested.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Engle, </em>464 U.S. 206, 217 (1984) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Lion Oil Co., </em>352 U.S. 282, 297 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part)). Although we recognize that the language of PSASP, standing alone, arguably may give rise to certain ambiguities as to the status of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>PSASP scholarship as a loan, the circumstances which led to the enactment of both statutes compels the conclusion that Congress intended \u00a7 523(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code to except from dischargeability debts incurred under scholarship programs such as PSASP.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">We hold, therefore, that Robert\u2019s PSASP obligation is a \u201cdebt ... for an educational loan\u201d and hence is not dischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">To summarize:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The Bankruptcy Code does not define \u201ceducational loan\u201d. Under well established definitions, however, Robert\u2019s PSASP scholarship constituted a \u201cloan\u201d, since he agreed to reimburse the United States if he failed to practice in a physician shortage area. Although a strained construction of the language of PSASP arguably may be said to give rise to certain ambiguities as to whether a PSASP scholarship is a loan, we are satisfied that the legislative history shows beyond doubt that Congress intended \u00a7 523(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code to make nondischargeable those debts incurred under programs such as PSASP. We therefore reverse the order of the district court which affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
