The district court found that when Gilliland appeared before the grand jury, he thought that he had been given immunity. Although Gilliland\u2019s belief was erroneous, the court nonetheless suppressed the testimony, concluding that Gilliland\u2019s mistaken belief rendered it involuntary. The district court based its decision solely on the transcript of the grand jury proceedings; thus, we accord no deference to the court\u2019s findings of fact. We conclude that the district court erred, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>reverse and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The parties do not dispute the facts relevant to this stage of the proceedings. A police officer, who was a personal friend of Gilliland\u2019s, visited Gilliland at his jewelry store. While there, the police officer saw several boxes of .357 magnum guns. Subsequent investigation led law enforcement officials to conclude that the guns were stolen property, and they questioned Gilli-land. The Government then subpoenaed Gilliland to testify before a grand jury concerning any knowledge he might have about the theft of the guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">When Gilliland appeared before the grand jury, the prosecutor warned him that he was a target of the grand jury\u2019s investigation, and that he had a fifth amendment right not to respond to a question if the answer might incriminate him. Briefly stated, the following sequence of events took place shortly after Gilliland had been sworn as a witness and had testified briefly about his background: (1) the prosecutor asked Gilliland if he knew Bobby Harris (whom Gilliland knew to be another target of the grand jury\u2019s investigation); (2) Gilli-land asked the prosecutor whether he had immunity and was told that he did not; (3) Gilliland invoked the fifth amendment, but then chose to answer the prosecutor\u2019s question; (4) Gilliland again asked about immunity; again the prosecutor told him that the Government had not granted him immunity; (5) Gilliland thereupon invoked his right to silence, but then agreed to answer further questions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gilliland invoked his fifth amendment right to silence four more times. On one occasion he asked the prosecutor to refer a question to his lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-19\">The district court concluded that Gilliland\u2019s testimony was involuntary because he believed that he was testifying under a grant of immunity. Examining Gilliland\u2019s statements under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d <em>see United States v. Washington, </em>431 U.S. 181, 188, 97 S.Ct. 1814, 1819, 52 L.Ed.2d 238 (1977), we hold that even if Gilliland actually believed that the prosecution had granted him immunity, such a belief was unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gilliland twice asked the prosecutor whether he was immune from prosecution, and both times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>the prosecutor responded that he was not. Furthermore, Gilliland fails to explain why he invoked the fifth amendment four times <em>following </em>the colloquy with the prosecutor that allegedly led him to believe that he was testifying under a grant of immunity. Finally, we find the prosecutor\u2019s comment that it was \u201call right\u201d for Gilliland to \u201cmake a statement\u201d simply too weak a keystone to support his argument that he had a reasonable, subjective belief that he had been granted immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">The district court chose not to rule on Gilliland\u2019s claim that his grand jury testimony was involuntary because the prosecutor continued to question him after he had invoked his fifth amendment right. Although we question whether Gilliland\u2019s claim has any merit, <em>see Washington, </em>431 U.S. at 188, 97 S.Ct. at 1819 (test of compulsion is whether \u201cthe free will of the witness was overborne\u201d); <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. 564, 581, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 1778, 48 L.Ed.2d 212 (1976) (prosecutor may pursue \u201c[o]ther lines of inquiry\u201d after witness asserts fifth amendment right to silence), we need not decide that issue at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-6\">. The district court based its conclusion that Gilliland's grand jury testimony was involuntary on the following colloquy between the prosecutor and Gilliland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-7\">Q Do you know Bobby Harris?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-8\">A Could I ask something? Do I have immunity in any questions I answer about these guns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-9\">Q Sir, at any time you can ask to talk to your attorney or if at any time you believe an answer to a question would incriminate you, you may refuse to answer on those grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-10\">A I understand that. Do I have immunity [sic] anything I know about these guns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-11\">Q No, sir, that's not my understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-12\">A Okay, sir. Then I don't want to answer any questions. I\u2019ll take what you say the Seventh or whatever it is, the Fifth. In other words, I don\u2019t want to answer any questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-13\">Q I asked you the question if you knew Bobby Harris.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-14\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-15\">Q And you are not going to answer that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-16\">A Yes, sir, I know Bobby Harris.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-17\">Q All right. Should I continue to ask questions and you can selectively decide whether you want to answer them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-20\">A No, sir, I [sic] rather not answer because I haven\u2019t stole [sic] anything, never have in my life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-21\">Q So, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re refusing to answer any further questions of the Grand Jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-22\">A Well, I thought the paper said anybody knew anything up through today, answer anything had immunity from the state and federal [sic],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-23\">Q Well, sir, I\u2019m telling you that I\u2019m not guaranteeing you immunity for anything that you tell this Grand Jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-24\">A Well, then I'd rather not answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-25\">Q All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-26\">[Prosecutor] Well, with that, I would ask that Mr. Gilliland\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-27\">Q I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-28\">A I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-29\">Q You want to make a statement, that\u2019s all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-30\">A I don\u2019t mind \u2014 I know Bobby Harris, yes, sir. Let\u2019s just take it a question at a time. I want to be honest and fair about the whole thing. Okay. I haven\u2019t stole [sic] anything.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b962-31\">. In his motion to suppress his grand jury statements, Gilliland did not claim that he had testified under the belief that his statements could not be used against him. The trial court, nevertheless, suppressed his testimony on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b963-14\">. In the absence of at least a showing of actual subjective belief, we doubt that the mere existence of conditions that would make it reasonable for a witness to believe that he had received immunity is a sufficient reason to suppress his testimony. We need not decide what showing is necessary, however, because, as a legal matter, any such belief in this case would have been unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
