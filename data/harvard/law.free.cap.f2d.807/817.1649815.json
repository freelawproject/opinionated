He wrote to a number of law professors, including some of the most noted in the nation, requesting they send him copies of legal texts they had authored. Many of the professors did so, and some wrote letters complimenting Pratt on his diligence and interest. The prison maintains a policy of returning all books sent to prisoners \u2014 hardcover and softcover \u2014 unless they originate directly from a publisher or bookstore. Books sent to Pratt by law professors were returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-16\">Pratt filed an action against the prison warden, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1981), claiming that the denial of meaningful access to the courts violated his civil rights. His complaint alleged that Professor James Jeans, author of <em>Trial Advocacy </em>(West 1975), sent him a softcover copy of the book, that without notice or hearing the prison returned the book to Jeans pursuant to its \u201cpublisher or bookstore only\u201d regulation, that the treatise contained legal advice not otherwise available to Pratt, and that the prison\u2019s \u201cpublisher or bookstore only\u201d regulation was overly broad. Pratt sought a declaratory judgment that notice and a hearing are required prior to the return of printed materials sent to prisoners, that softcover books pose no greater threat to prison security than lengthy personal correspondence and may not be banned on a \u201cpublisher or bookstore only\u201d basis, and that law books should receive preferential treatment, at least while the prison\u2019s law library remains deficient. He also sought the cost of the book as damages, the same amount in punitive damages, postage costs for Professor Jeans, and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-17\">The complaint was submitted to a magistrate to determine whether Pratt should be allowed to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 (1966 &amp; Supp.1986). The magistrate permitted him to do so but concluded that the complaint was \u201cfrivolous within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), in that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of the claim.\u201d The magistrate stated that federal courts have a very limited role in determining whether prison policy is reasonably related to security interests, citing <em>Block v. Rutherford, </em>468 U.S. 576, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984), and <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), and that a similar policy restricting the receipt of books was upheld in <em>Guajardo v. Estelle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>580 F.2d 748, 762 (5th Cir.1978). The district court adopted the recommendations of the magistrate and dismissed the complaint. Pratt appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">A federal district court has original jurisdiction over any legal action to redress the deprivation under color of law of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution or by any federal equal protection statute. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) (West Supp.1986). Ordinarily, federal jurisdiction is not negated by the likelihood that a complaint may fail to state a cause of action, inasmuch as that is grounds for dismissal on the merits and not for lack of jurisdiction. Dismissal for want of jurisdiction may occur, however, where a claim is \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682-83, 66 S.Ct. 773, 776, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). Independent of this jurisdictional issue, section 1915(d) empowers the district court to dismiss an <em>in forma pauperis </em>action that is \u201cfrivolous or malicious.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) (1966). The conclusion of the district court that Pratt\u2019s claim is frivolous thus forms the basis of its dismissal both for want of subject matter jurisdiction and on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In <em>Franklin v. Murphy, </em>745 F.2d 1221,1225 (9th Cir.1984), we defined a frivolous action under section 1915(d) as \u201can action lacking arguable basis in law or in fact.\u201d We hold that Pratt\u2019s claim is not frivolous. Pratt squarely raises a legal issue not previously resolved by the Supreme Court or our circuit. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), is the leading case involving regulations prohibiting receipt of books by incarcerated persons. Wolfish and other pretrial detainees challenged the constitutionality of conditions at a federally operated short-term custodial facility. Among the challenges was one addressed to the facility\u2019s \u201cpublisher only\u201d rule. The rule limited the books detainees could receive to those mailed directly by publishers and book clubs. The court of appeals found the rule unconstitutional because it \u201cseverely and impermissibly restricts the reading material available to inmates.\u201d <em>Wolfish v. Levi, </em>573 F.2d 118, 130 (2d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Subsequent to the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Wolfish, </em>the Bureau of Prisons amended the \u201cpublisher only\u201d rule to include bookstores and advised the Court it intended to amend the rule further to permit inmates to receive softcover materials from any source. On these changed facts, the Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals and held that a \u201cpublisher and bookstore only\u201d rule limited to hardcover books did not violate the First Amendment, finding the rule to be a reasonable time, place and manner regulation necessary to further significant governmental interests. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. at 550-52, 99 S.Ct. at 1880-81. The Court concluded that hardcover books presented \u201can obvious security problem,\u201d particularly with respect to the smuggling of contraband in the bindings. <em>Id. </em>at 550, 99 S.Ct. at 1880. The Court expressly refrained from considering the validity of a rule encompassing <em>softcover </em>materials. <em>Id. </em>at 550 n. 31, 99 S.Ct. at 1880 n. 31. Here, the policy of the Nevada State Prison applies to softcover materials as well as hardcover books; Pratt thus challenges a policy clearly not considered or addressed in <em>Wolfish.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">In deciding that the \u201cpublisher and bookstore only\u201d policy for hardcover books was a reasonable time, place and manner restriction on First Amendment rights, the Court in <em>Wolfish </em>was \u201cinfluenced by several other factors,\u201d including (1) the fact that there were sufficient, unburdensome alternative means of obtaining reading materials, i.e., <em>softcover </em>books from any source and a \u201crelatively large\u201d library for inmate use, and (2) the fact that the policy affected only pretrial detainees, whose stays in the institution were limited to approximately 60 days. 441 U.S. at 551-52, 99 S.Ct. at 1880-81. Here, softcover materials do not provide an alternative means for the prisoners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>to obtain reading materials, we have no information at this stage of the proceedings as to the adequacy of Nevada State Prison\u2019s library, and we must assume that the length of Pratt\u2019s felony sentence is well in excess of 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">We note that neither of the Supreme Court cases cited as controlling by the magistrate and adopted by the district court, <em>Block v. Rutherford, </em>468 U.S. 576, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984), and <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), implicated First Amendment rights or involved a prisoner\u2019s claim that he was denied fair access to the courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Fifth Circuit case cited by the magistrate, <em>Guajardo v. Estelle, </em>580 F.2d 748 (5th Cir.1978), did uphold a \u201cpublisher and bookstore only\u201d policy that applied on its face to both hardcover and softcover books. However, <em>Guajardo </em>was decided prior to <em>Wolfish; </em>even were we ultimately to conclude that its holding is correct, we could not now label Pratt\u2019s claim as frivolous or dismiss it without the benefit of any evidence as to the availability to Pratt of legal assistance or other legal materials. Finally, we note that no case has discussed a prohibition on receipt of books mailed directly from authors. We do not believe that a challenge to such a prohibition is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Given that neither the Supreme Court nor this circuit has addressed the constitutionality of a total ban on a felony prisoner\u2019s receipt of books, including all softcover legal materials, from sources other than publishers and bookstores, it is clear the district court erred in finding Pratt\u2019s complaint frivolous. The district court has jurisdiction to review his claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) (West Supp.1986), and may not dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(c) (1966). We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\">. A recent decision of this circuit, <em>Toussaint </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>801 F.2d 1080 (9th Cir.1986), which addresses <em>inter alia </em>the right of prisoners to meaningful access to the courts, does not affect our decision here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
