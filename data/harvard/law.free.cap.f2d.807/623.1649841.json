For the reasons stated below, we will deny the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b694-18\">On December 3, 1984, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) issued to Donald E. and Ruth V. Hiley (referred to collectively as \u201ctaxpayer\u201d) a notice of jeopardy assessment pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6861 for income tax, penalties, and interest in the amount of $58,329.74 and $74,619.49 for the tax years of 1982 and 1983, respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The notice stated that the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d or \u201cService\u201d) had been informed that the taxpayer had been arrested for wagering violations with a large sum of money found in his possession and that his \u201cfinancial solvency\u201d was or appeared \u201cto be imperiled, thereby tending to prejudice or render ineffectual collection of the income taxes\u201d due for the years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-19\">On December 13, 1984, the IRS issued another notice of jeopardy assessment pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6862 for wagering and registry taxes, penalties, and interest in the amount of $201,175.54 for the period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>May 1982 through October 1984.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This notice stated that, pursuant to a search by the authorities, the taxpayer had been found in possession of a large sum of money, \u201cthereby tending to prejudice or render ineffectual collection of wagering tax and registry tax\u201d for the relevant period and that the taxpayer appeared to be concealing income and assets from the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">On that same day, the IRS issued to the taxpayer a notice of termination assessment pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6851 for income taxes in the amount of $33,084.64 for the 1984 tax year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The notice referred to the same facts listed in the second notice as the basis for the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">All of the notices advised taxpayer of the right to obtain administrative and judicial review of the assessments pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The taxpayer filed his administrative challenges in a timely manner and, after they were rejected by the IRS, filed an action on January 18, 1985, in federal district court for review of the IRS\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">A hearing was held on February 13, 1985, and the Service, which bears the burden of proof on the issue whether the assessment was reasonable under the circumstances, called the taxpayer as its first witness. He refused to answer the questions posed by counsel for the United States and instead asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled to testify against himself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The government then moved to dismiss the taxpayer\u2019s complaint and also filed with the court that same day a memorandum setting forth the facts that served as the basis for the assessments. On February 14, 1985, the court granted the United States\u2019s motion on the ground that the taxpayer, who had \u201cinitiated\u201d this action, could not use the Fifth Amendment as both a \u201csword\u201d and a \u201cshield.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 25, 1985, the district court entered its order dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">On March 11, 1985, the taxpayer filed in this court a petition for a writ of mandamus. We denied the petition and stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-15\">Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy which will not issue absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dorf-man, </em>690 F.2d 1217 (7th Cir.1977). Due to the lack of precedent in the area and the availability of further remedies short of mandamus for petitioners, we do not find mandamus warranted in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">The taxpayer then filed a notice of appeal on April 26, 1985. On July 12, 1985, the United States filed a motion to dismiss this action for lack of jurisdiction. We issued an order on August 1, 1985, stating that the motion to dismiss would be decided with the merits of this appeal by the panel assigned to hear the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b695-18\">A. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b695-19\">1. Denial of Petition for Writ of Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">The government contends that our denial of the taxpayer\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus precludes consideration of this appeal in its entirety or at least of the subject-matter jurisdiction questions presented. We disagree. Where, as here, the denial of the petition is based not on the merits of the dispute, but rather on the limitations inherent in the extraordinary nature of the writ, such a denial does not preclude examination of the merits of the questions presented in the mandamus peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>tion under the doctrines of res judicata or law of the case (unless perhaps those questions were actually decided by the denial). <em>See Hoffman v. Blaski, </em>363 U.S. 335, 340 &amp; n. 9, 80 S.Ct. 1084,1088 &amp; n. 9, 4 L.Ed.2d 1254 (1960); <em>United States v. Dean, </em>752 F.2d 535, 541-42 (11th Cir.1985); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4445 at 393-94, 396-97, \u00a7 4478 at 798 &amp; n. 31 (1981); <em>cf. Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., </em>798 F.2d 1051, 1056-1058, (7th Cir.1986). As noted above, our order denying the taxpayer\u2019s petition stated only that \u201c[d]ue to the lack of precedent in the area and the availability of further remedies short of mandamus for petitioners, we do not find mandamus warranted in this case.\u201d This is manifestly not a decision on either the jurisdiction question or the merits and is, therefore, entitled to no preclusive effect in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">2. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Having found that we are not precluded from examining the jurisdictional issues, we will now consider the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Of course, even in the absence of such a motion, we have an obligation to determine <em>sua sponte </em>the basis of our subject-matter jurisdiction as well as that of the district court. <em>Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., </em>798 F.2d 1051, 1055-56 (7th Cir.1986). For the reasons developed below, we find that this court has jurisdiction to consider the district court\u2019s dismissal of the taxpayer\u2019s complaint under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429 and will, therefore, deny the United States\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Our primary statutory grant of jurisdiction is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, which provides in relevant part that the courts of appeals \u201cshall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d Thus, we have a broad and generalized authority to review the decisions of the lower courts. In addition, it must also be noted that plenary judicial review of administrative action (here, that of the IRS) is presumed to be available in all cases and that \u201conly upon a showing of \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.\u201d <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1511, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967); <em>see also Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>470 U.S. 768, 778-82, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 1627-28, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (\u201cCode\u201d) provides for \u201cjeopardy\u201d and \u201ctermination\u201d assessments that operate to freeze the assets of the taxpayer until the existence and amount of tax liability can be determined; thus, the taxpayer loses the use of whatever property is seized by the IRS until judgment is rendered. <em>Williams v. United States, </em>704 F.2d 1222, 1225 n. 3 (11th Cir.1983). Before 1976, the taxpayer\u2019s remedies for jeopardy and termination assessments were the same as those for normal assessments, <em>i.e., </em>petitioning the Tax Court for a redetermination or filing a refund suit in a United States district court or in the former Court of Claims. Congress, recognizing that these procedures often work a serious hardship on the taxpayer, enacted \u00a7 7429 of the Code as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-455, \u00a7 1204(a), 90 Stat. 1520, 1695-96. <em>See Vicknair v. United States, </em>617 F.2d 1129, 1131 (5th Cir.1980). Section 7429 provides for \u201cexpedited\u201d administrative and judicial action in an effort to eliminate to the extent practicable the inevitable delay in obtaining review of jeopardy and termination assessments under prior law. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 938 (Part 1), 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 359-67, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News 3439, 3789-96; H.R.Rep. No. 658, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 299-304, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2897, 3195-3200; Joint Committee of Taxation, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., General Explanation of the Tax Reform Act of 1976; <em>see also Commissioner v. Shapiro, </em>424 U.S. 614, 96 S.Ct. 1062, 47 L.Ed.2d 278 (1976); <em>Laing v. United States, </em>423 U.S. 161, 96 S.Ct. 473, 46 L.Ed.2d 416 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Under \u00a7 7429(b)(1), the taxpayer, after seeking administrative review of the assessment, may bring a civil action in district court within 30 days of the administrative determination or within 30 days of the 16th day after the taxpayer\u2019s request for administrative review (whichever is earlier). Section 7429(b)(2) provides that, within 20 days after the action is commenced, the district court \u201cshall determine\u201d whether \u201cthe making of the assessment under section 6851, 6861, or 6862 ... is reasonable under the circumstances\u201d and whether \u201cthe amount so assessed or demanded as a result of the action taken under section 6851, 6861, or 6862 is appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d Under \u00a7 7429(g), the IRS bears the burden of proof on the issue whether the making of the assessment is reasonable and the taxpayer bears the burden of proof on the issue whether the amount of the assessment is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">We come now to the focus of the jurisdictional challenge. Section 7429(f) provides that \u201c[a]ny <em>determination </em>made by a district court under this section shall be final and conclusive and shall not be reviewed by any other court\u201d (emphasis added). The government contends that the \u201cclear meaning\u201d of this provision forecloses appellate review of any action by the district court taken pursuant to \u00a7 7429, with the exception of dismissals for want of jurisdiction or venue. We disagree. As Justice Frankfurter stated in <em>United States v. Monia, </em>317 U.S. 424, 431, 63 S.Ct. 409, 412, 87 L.Ed. 376 (1943) (dissenting opinion), \u201cThe notion that because the words of a statute are plain, its meaning is also plain, is merely pernicious oversimplification.\u201d He also observed that a statute, \u201cderives significance and sustenance from its environment, from which it cannot be severed without being mutilated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 63 S.Ct. at 413; <em>see also Milwaukee County v. Donovan, </em>771 F.2d 983, 986, 990 (7th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 2246, 90 L.Ed.2d 692 (1986). Reading \u00a7 7429 in the context of the circumstances surrounding its enactment, we must reject the interpretation advanced by the United States, because such a reading is inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s intent to provide more effective judicial review of jeopardy and termination assessments and, at the same time, does not provide a legitimate benefit to the government that would offset the acknowledged high cost to taxpayers that would result from a narrow reading of the provision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Indeed, this court and the Eleventh Circuit have previously concluded that, although a district court\u2019s decision on the merits of the making and amount of the assessment is unreviewable, an appellate court does have jurisdiction to determine whether the district court acted within the scope of its statutory authority in dismissing a \u00a7 7429 action on procedural grounds. <em>See Schuster v. United States, </em>765 F.2d 1047, 1049 &amp; n. 7 (11th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Doyle, </em>660 F.2d 277 (7th Cir.1981); <em>cf. Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermans-dorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976); <em>Allen v. Ferguson, </em>791 F.2d 611 (7th Cir.1986).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>court\u2019s unauthorized acts are subject to review; its authorized, yet erroneous, acts are not. <em>See Meadows v. United States, </em>665 F.2d 1009, 1012 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Notwithstanding the United States\u2019s assertions to the contrary, this interpretation of \u00a7 7429 is, in fact, consistent with the language of that provision. Section 7429(b)(2) defines a \u201cdetermination\u201d of the district court as a decision regarding the reasonableness of both the making and the amount of the disputed assessment. Section 7429(f) states that only a \u201cdetermination\u201d made by a district court is unreviewable. The government\u2019s position would be more persuasive if \u00a7 7429(f) prohibited the review of, for example, all \u201cdecisions,\u201d \u201cactions,\u201d or \u201corders\u201d of a district court made pursuant to that section. <em>Cf. </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b) (1982); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) (1982); <em>cf also Briscoe v. Bell, </em>432 U.S. 404, 97 S.Ct. 2428, 53 L.Ed.2d 439 (1977). As we understand \u00a7 7429 (and as the government\u2019s concession that we may review dismissals for want of jurisdiction or venue suggests), that section indicates that a \u201cdetermination\u201d is but one of a number of decisions a district court may make in considering a taxpayer\u2019s \u00a7 7429 challenge. A decision that does not determine the reasonableness of either the making or the amount of the assessment does not come within the scope of \u00a7 7429(f) and, therefore, should be open to appellate review, especially in view of the presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action. <em>See Zuluaga v. United States, </em>774 F.2d 1487, 1490 (9th Cir.1985) (Wiggins, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">We will, then, deny the United States\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction and move now to consider whether the district court erred in dismissing this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">B. Propriety of Dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">As noted above, the government called as its first witness at the hearing the taxpayer; the latter refused to answer questions and instead asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled to testify as a witness against himself. On the government\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed the case on the ground that the taxpayer could not use this right as both a \u201csword\u201d and a \u201cshield\u201d in a civil action. No decision regarding the reasonableness of either the making and the amounts of the disputed assessments was made. Indeed, at oral argument before this court counsel for the government conceded that the district court imposed a sanction of dismissal, so that the merits were never considered. The United States does not now argue that the taxpayer was not entitled to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The taxpayer asserts that the district court erred in dismissing the action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">As a general matter, it may be true that a plaintiff, who initiates a civil action but refuses to present evidence, cannot then prevail on the merits with regard to those issues on which he bears the burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., Kisting v. Westchester Fire Insurance Co., </em>290 F.Supp. 141, 149 (W.D.Wis.1968), <em>aff'd, </em>416 F.2d 967 (7th Cir.1969). However, the instant case is not a typical civil action. In addition, the taxpayer does not initiate the proceedings at all, but rather it is the IRS that, by imposing the assessments, takes the first legal step and it is the taxpayer who then responds by pursuing his administrative and judicial avenues for review of these assessments under \u00a7 7429. To conclude otherwise would mean, for example, that an individual \u2014 by engaging in illegal activity \u2014\u201cinitiates\u201d the subsequent proceedings that result in his conviction. Thus, we find unavailing the government\u2019s argument that the taxpayer initiated this \u00a7 7429 action and that he then, in essence, refused to prosecute by declining to answer questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Furthermore, under \u00a7 7429(g)(1), the IRS, not the taxpayer, bears the burden of proof on the reasonableness of the making of the assessments. The Service called as its first witness the taxpayer who (given the posture of this appeal) must be considered to have legitimately exercised his Fifth Amendment rights. The Service demonstrated below and represented to this court that it had other evidence that would tend to justify the imposition of the assessments. It should also be noted that (1) the IRS does not have to show that the information it relied upon in making the assessments would be admissible at a trial on the merits and (2) the government is not required to make its final case against the taxpayer, but only a preliminary showing of reasonableness. <em>See Marranca v. United States, </em>587 F.Supp. 663, 666, 668 (M.D. Pa.1984); <em>see also Miller v. United States, </em>615 F.Supp. 781, 785-87 (N.D. Ohio 1985). Thus, we find that the district court should not have dismissed the instant case, but instead should have required the government to rely on a source other than the taxpayer to make its case. <em>See United States v. Local 560, </em>780 F.2d 267, 292-93 n. 32 (3d Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2247, 90 L.Ed.2d 693 (1986); <em>Rogers v. Webster, </em>776 F.2d 607 (6th Cir. 1985); <em>National Acceptance Co. v. Bathalter, </em>705 F.2d 924 (7th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Second National Bank, </em>48 F.R.D. 268 (D.N.H.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The dismissal is especially inappropriate in view of the fact that \u201cmost jeopardy assessments and termination assessments [have been] utilized against taxpayers allegedly engaged in illegal activities.\u201d S.Rep. No. 938 (Part 1), 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 362, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News 3439, 3792. This state of affairs opens the door to gamesmanship on the part of the IRS, which, knowing (or at least suspecting) that the taxpayer will not testify on Fifth Amendment grounds, could simply call him as its first witness and then convert the taxpayer\u2019s silence into a certain and summary dismissal of the \u00a7 7429 action. The taxpayer, even though he is entitled not to testify and even though the IRS has the burden of proof on the issue of the reasonableness of the making of the assessment, must then resort to the pre-1976 remedies that Congress has already found to be inadequate to protect his interests. The dismissal undermines the rights of the taxpayer under both the Fifth Amendment and \u00a7 7429, because it forces him either to exercise his constitutional rights or to lose the use of the property subject to the assessment when it is the Service that must show that the making of the assessment was reasonable. <em>Cf National Acceptance Co., </em>705 F.2d at 926-32; <em>Second National Bank, </em>48 F.R.D. at 270-71. The government has advanced no argument for such a sanction and we perceive none under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">We hold, therefore, that the district court erred in dismissing this \u00a7 7429 action. Of course, we express no opinion on the effect of the taxpayer\u2019s invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights either (1) <em>after </em>the IRS has presented its evidence regarding the reasonableness of the making of the assessment so that the taxpayer must then rebut the Service\u2019s evidence or (2) on those issues on which the taxpayer bears the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">For the reasons stated above, the motion of the United States to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction is Denied and the order of the district court dismissing the action below is Reversed.

The Secretary shall immediately assess the amount of the tax so determined (together with all interest, additional amounts, and additions to the tax provided by law) for the current taxable year or such preceding taxable year, or both, as the case may be, and shall cause notice of such determination and assessment to be given the taxpayer, together with a demand for immediate payment of such tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">(2) Computation of tax. \u2014 In the case of a current taxable year, the Secretary shall determine the tax for the period beginning on the first day of such current taxable year and ending on the date of the determination under paragraph (1) as though such period were a taxable year of the taxpayer, and shall take into account any prior determination made under this subsection with respect to such current taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">(3) Treatment of amounts collected.\u2014 Any amounts collected as a result of any assessments under this subsection shall, to the extent thereof, be treated as a payment of tax for such taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">(4) This section inapplicable where section 6861 applies. \u2014 This section shall not authorize any assessment of tax for the preceding taxable year which is made after the due date of the taxpayer\u2019s return for such taxable year (determined with regard to any extensions).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">(b) Notice of deficiency. \u2014 If an assessment of tax is made under the authority of subsection (a), the Secretary shall mail a notice under section 6212(a) for the taxpayer\u2019s full taxable year (determined without regard to any action taken under subsection (a)) with respect to which such assessment was made within 60 days after the later of (i) the due date of the taxpayer\u2019s return for such taxable year (determined with regard to any extensions), or (ii) the date such taxpayer files such return. Such deficiency may be in an amount greater or less than the amount assessed under subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">(c) Citizens. \u2014 In the case of a citizen of the United States or of a possession of the United States about to depart from the United States, the Secretary or his delegate may, at his discretion, waive any or all of the requirements placed on the taxpayer by this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">(d) Departure of alien. \u2014 Subject to such exceptions as may, by regulations, be prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">(1) No alien shall depart from the United States unless he first procures from the Secretary or his delegate a certificate that he has complied with all the obligations imposed upon him by the income tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">(2) Payment of taxes shall not be enforced by any proceedings under the provisions of this section prior to the expiration of the time otherwise allowed for paying such taxes if, in the case of an alien about to depart from the United States, the Secretary or his delegate determines that the collection of the tax will not be jeopardized by the departure of the alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">(e) Sections 6861(f) and (g) to apply.\u2014 The provisions of section 6861(f) (relating to collection of unpaid amounts) and 6861(g) (relating to abatement if jeopardy does not exist) shall apply with respect to any assessment made under subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">(f) Cross references.\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b700-15\">(1) For provisions permitting immediate levy in case of jeopardy, see section 6331(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-16\">(2) For provisions relating to the review of jeopardy, see section 7429.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-17\">\u00a7 6861. Jeopardy assessments of income, estate, gift, and certain excise taxes</p>\n<p id=\"Aof\">(a) Authority for making. \u2014 If the Secretary or his delegate believes that the as-</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>APPENDIX \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"azc-dedup-1\">sessment or collection of a deficiency, as defined in section 6211, will be jeopardized by delay, he shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6213(a), immediately assess such deficiency (together with all interest, additional amounts, and additions to the tax provided for by law), and notice and demand shall be made by the Secretary or his delegate for the payment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">(b) Deficiency letters. \u2014 If the jeopardy assessment is made before any notice in respect of the tax to which the jeopardy assessment relates has been mailed under section 6212(a), then the Secretary or his delegate shall mail a notice under such subsection within 60 days after the making of the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">(c) Amount assessable before decision of Tax Court. \u2014 The jeopardy assessment may be made in respect of a deficiency greater or less than that notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, despite the provisions of section 6212(c) prohibiting the determination of additional deficiencies, and whether or not the taxpayer has theretofore filed a petition with the Tax Court. The Secretary or his delegate may, at any time before the decision of the Tax Court is rendered, abate such assessment, or any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that he believes the assessment to be excessive in amount. The Secretary or his delegate shall notify the Tax Court of the amount of such assessment, or abatement, if the petition is filed with the Tax Court before the making of the assessment or is subsequently filed, and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction to redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and of all amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">(d) Amount assessable after decision of Tax Court. \u2014 If the jeopardy assessment is made after the decision of the Tax Court is rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the deficiency determined by the Tax Court in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">(e) Expiration of right to assess. \u2014 A jeopardy assessment may not be -made after the decision of the Tax Court has become final or after the taxpayer has filed a petition for review of the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">(f) Collection of unpaid amounts. \u2014 When the petition has been filed with the Tax Court and when the amount which should have been assessed has been determined by a decision of the Tax Court which has become final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which has been stayed by bond as provided in section 6863(b) shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the Secretary or his delegate, and any remaining portion of the assessment shall be abated. If the amount already collected exceeds the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed, such excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer as provided in section 6402, without the filing of claim therefor. If the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed is greater than the amount actually assessed, then the difference shall be assessed and shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the Secretary or his delegate.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">(g) Abatement if jeopardy does not exist. \u2014The Secretary or his delegate may abate the jeopardy assessment if he finds that jeopardy does not exist. Such abatement may not be made after a decision of the Tax Court in respect of the deficiency has been rendered or, if no petition is filed with the Tax Court, after the expiration of the period for filing such petition. The period of limitation on the making of assessments and levy or a proceeding in court for collection, in respect of any deficiency, shall be determined as if the jeopardy assessment so abated had not been made, except that the running of such period shall in any event be suspended for the period from the date of such jeopardy assessment until the expiration of the 10th day after the day on which such jeopardy assessment is abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">(h) Cross references.\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">(1) For the effect of the furnishing of security for payment, see section 6863.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">(2) For provision permitting immediate levy in case of jeopardy, see section 6331(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>APPENDIX \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"A6o\">\u00a7 6862.

Such tax, additions to the tax, and interest shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, and immediate notice and demand shall be made by the Secretary for the payment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">(b) Immediate levy.\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">For provision permitting immediate levy in case of jeopardy, see section 6331(a). \u00a7 7429.

This is true not only for the limitation on judicial review of \u00a7 7429(f). It is, for example, well settled that, although \u00a7 7429(b)(2) requires that the district court reach a decision \"[wjithin 20 days\u201d after an action under this section has been commenced, the courts have consistently interpreted that time period as setting forth only a strong admonition for the judiciary to act expeditiously. It has not been read literally as a limitation on the lower courts\u2019 jurisdiction, so that those tribunals would be divested of all power to act on the taxpayer\u2019s complaint after the 20 days had elapsed, <em>see, e.g., Meadows v. United States, </em>665 F.2d 1009 (11th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Doyle, </em>660 F.2d 277 (7th Cir. 1981), for such a procrustean forfeiture is wholly inconsistent with Congress's goal of providing more rapid and effective judicial review of jeopardy and termination assessments. <em>See Meadows, </em>665 F.2d at 1012; <em>cf.
