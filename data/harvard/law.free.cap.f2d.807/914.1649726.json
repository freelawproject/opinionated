The case was subsequently settled, and as part of the settlement each appellant executed a release witnessed by their attorney, David Roberson, which provided in part that \u201cthe undersigned, release, acquit and forever discharge ... [the defendants] ... from any and all claims, actions, causes of action ... [and] costs (including assessable court costs and attorney\u2019s fees) ... which the undersigned now have or which may hereafter accrue on account of ... [the incidents which gave rise to the section 1983 action],\u201d including \u201cany claims which were or could have been brought in Civil Action No. 482-323 [the section 1983 action].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Roberson later filed a Motion for Award of Costs and Attorneys\u2019 Fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. His initial brief in support of this motion made no mention of the releases executed by appellants, which expressly included attorney\u2019s fees and costs, or of the provision in the district court order dismissing the section 1983 suit that the parties bear their own costs. The district court [609 F.Supp. 772] concluded that Roberson\u2019s failure to address the language of the settlement agreement and the provisions in the dismissal order constituted a lack of factual candor, which merited the imposition of sanctions under Rule 11. 609 F.Supp. 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Roberson argues that his failure to disclose was not improper in this case, because the judge before whom he filed the motion for fees and costs was the same judge who had presided over and participated in the settlement conferences. We disagree with Roberson\u2019s assessment of his duty of candor. Roberson had the affirmative obligation in his initial filings, not just in his supporting briefs, to apprise the trial judge that although the settlement agreement foreclosed claims for attorney\u2019s fees as well as everything else, he nevertheless felt that he was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988. The district court properly exercised its discretion in imposing Rule 11 sanctions on Roberson for his lack of factual candor in his original motion and brief. <em>See Itel Containers Int\u2019l Corp. v. Puerto Rico Marine Mgt., Inc., </em>108 F.R.D. 96, 104 (D.N.J.1985) (counsel has duty to deal fairly and sincerely with court and opposing counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">The district court additionally concluded that the arguments Roberson made in his supplemental briefs in support of his motion so lacked legal merit that their submission also violated Rule 11. In these subsequent briefs, Roberson advanced three arguments contending that despite the terms of the settlement agreement he was entitled to seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs: (1) that public policy and congressional intent in enacting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 prevents litigants from settling claims for attorney\u2019s fees; (2) that success on the equitable claim of one appellant seeking a transfer to a different prison facility was outside the terms of the releases; and (3) that including attorney\u2019s fees within the settlement offer constituted an act of duress creating an ethical conflict between Roberson and his clients. We need not decide the merits of each of these arguments, except to say that we disagree with the district court that Roberson\u2019s contentions were so lacking in legal merit as to justify by themselves the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions. In fact, only during the pendency of this appeal has the Supreme Court reversed a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which had arguably supported Roberson\u2019s public policy and conflict of interest arguments. <em>See Jeff D. v. Evans, </em>743 F.2d 648 (9th Cir.1984), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 1531, 89 L.Ed.2d 747 (1986). Although the district court erred in concluding that Roberson\u2019s subsequent arguments violated the legal reasonableness requirements of Rule 11, we uphold its imposition of sanctions based upon the attorney\u2019s failure to discharge his duty of candor in ini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>tially not disclosing to the court the terms of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Appellees request that we invoke Fed.R.App.P. 38, or in the alternative 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912, and award appellees double costs and the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defending the appeal. Fed.R.App.P. 38 provides: \u201cIf a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellees.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 provides: \u201cWhere a judgment is affirmed by the Supreme Court or a court of appeals, the court in its discretion may adjudge to the prevailing party just damages for his delay, and single or double costs.\u201d While we uphold the district court\u2019s imposition of Rule 11 sanctions as to Roberson\u2019s conduct in pursuit of the underlying claim for attorney\u2019s fees in the section 1983 action, we do not deem this appeal regarding the scope and application of Rule 11 to warrant the application of either of these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
