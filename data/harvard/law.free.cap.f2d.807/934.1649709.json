Wyden had been registered to practice but was suspended in 1978 for two years for reasons we need not review, subject to reinstatement only upon satisfying the Commissioner\u2019s requirements, including passing an examination. Wyden took the examination, after numerous litigated attempts in the District Court for the District of Columbia to become restored to the register without taking it, but failed by a large margin to obtain a passing grade. This is the fourth in a series of suits Wyden has prosecuted, pro se, in the District of Columbia courts. Wyden is not a lawyer. By Order filed July 16,1985, the District Court found Wyden\u2019s present claims barred either as untimely under Local Rule 1-26 or because of res judicata predicated on decisions on the same claims in one or more of Wyden\u2019s prior suits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">The brief filed by the Office of the Solicitor, PTO, raises a question as to this court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, its argument section being devoted mostly to that question. Our jurisdiction is, of course, a threshold question to be cleared in every case, whether or not challenged by a party. <em>Dubost v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 777 </em>F.2d 1561, 227 USPQ 977 (Fed.Cir.1985). The court in banc now decides this jurisdictional question as it arises in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">As recently stated in <em>Dubost, </em>our jurisdiction to review district court decisions in cases arising under the patent laws comes from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1) which states that we have <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction \u201cof an appeal from a final decision of a district court ... if the jurisdiction of that court was based, in whole or in part, on section 1338 of this title,\u201d copyright and trademark cases, which are named in \u00a7 1338(a), being excepted by \u00a7 1295(a)(1) unless combined with a patent claim. As we also said in <em>Dubost, </em>\u201cnor does if make any difference that the district court failed to articulate \u00a7 1338(a) as a basis for its jurisdiction.\u201d Chapter 85 of Title 28 of the United States Code is entitled \u201cDistrict Courts; Jurisdiction,\u201d and contains \u00a7 1338(a) which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-14\">(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection, copyrights, and trade-marks. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in patent, plant variety protection and copyright cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">As the PTO clearly seems to appreciate, at least one of Wyden\u2019s major claims arises under section 32 of Title 35 of the United States Code (USC) which is the Patent Act of 1952, as amended, the heading of that entire title being \u201cPATENTS.\u201d Section 32 and its companion section, 31, are the statutory provisions in the organic patent law which pertain to the registration in the PTO of agents and attorneys, which is a prerequisite to their practicing in the PTO in patent matters, their discipline, and removal from the register. Those sections are also the authorization for the Commissioner\u2019s promulgation of regulations, which are found in 37 CFR, pertaining to \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>recognition and conduct of agents, attorneys, or other persons representing applicants or other parties before the Patent and Trademark Office,\u201d which, if not inconsistent with law, or not suspended by the Commissioner under 37 CFR 1.183, have the force and effect of law. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Sections 31 and 32 of Title 35, which are best understood when read together, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-5\">\u00a7 31. <em>Regulations for agents and attorneys</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-6\">The Commissioner, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Commerce, may prescribe regulations governing the recognition and conduct of agents, attorneys, or other persons representing applicants or other parties before the Patent and Trademark Office, and may require them, before being recognized as representatives of applicants or other persons, to show that they are of good moral character and reputation and are possessed of the necessary qualifications to render to applicants or other persons, valuable service, advice, and assistance in the presentation or prosecution of their applications or other business before the Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-7\">\u00a7 32. <em>Suspension or exclusion from practice</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-8\">The Commissioner may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend or exclude, either generally or in any particular case, from further practice before the Patent and Trademark Office, any person, agent, or attorney shown to be incompetent or disreputable, or guilty of gross misconduct, or who does not comply with the regulations established under section 31 of this title, or who shall, by word, circular, letter, or advertising, with intent to defraud in any manner, deceive, mislead, or threaten any applicant or prospective applicant, or other person having immediate or prospective business before the Office. The reasons for any such suspension or exclusion shall be duly recorded. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia, under such conditions and upon such proceedings as it by its rules determines, may review the action of the Commissioner upon the petition of the person so refused recognition or so suspended or excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">The review of Wyden\u2019s suspension under \u00a7 32, by the District Court for the District of Columbia, took place pursuant to the last sentence of that section. Wyden brought his appeal to this court believing it to be the proper forum to review the decision against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">During the pendency of Wyden\u2019s appeal here, one Edmund M. Jaskiewicz who, like Wyden, had been suspended from practice before the PTO and had petitioned the District Court for the District of Columbia to review his case, had taken an appeal from an adverse decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Notwithstanding the PTO\u2019s questioning of our jurisdiction in this Wyden appeal, the PTO, represented by the United States Attorney, inconsistently moved the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on June 27,1986, to transfer the Jaskiewicz appeal to this court, supporting its motion with lengthy arguments and discussion of authorities. October 7,1986, the Court of Appeals, with a fully reasoned opinion 802 F.2d 532, granted the motion. The opinion concludes at p. 536, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b998-13\">An action for review of a decision of the Commissioner of the Patent and Trademark Office disciplining an attorney pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 32 arises under an Act of Congress relating to patents. Therefore, jurisdiction in the District Court is based at least in part on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338, and appellate review of that court\u2019s decision is granted exclusively to the Federal Circuit by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a). Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, this case shall be transferred to [the] United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>\n<em>Jaskiewicz v. Mossinghoff, Commissioner.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>**</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">Since we are in full agreement with the statements of the law in that conclusion, which apply equally to the Wyden appeal, particularly in view of the fact that our sister court believes that it does not have jurisdiction, we hold that we have jurisdiction over Wyden\u2019s appeal, noting that the PTO now seems to be of that view also.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">In deciding that \u00a7 82 is an Act of Congress which relates to patents within the meaning of \u00a7 1338(a) and that Wyden\u2019s action is a civil action arising under \u00a7 32, we express no opinion as to other statutes not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">\n<em>The Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">After filing its order of July 16, 1985, the District Court considered a Wyden motion for a \u201cnew trial\u201d dated July 26, 1985, and issued a second order, filed August 5, 1985, denying it. Of course, there having been a summary judgment, there has been no trial. Appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal states that the appeal is \u201cfrom the order denying a new trial entered in this action on the 5th day of August, 1985.\u201d While the PTO has noted this fact, neither party has taken this notice literally or so much as mentioned denial of a new trial as being an issue before us. The briefs argue the merits of the original order granting the summary judgment and we therefore treat it as raising the questions really before us, considering the fact that Wyden is not a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">Having carefully considered the presentations of both parties, we are unable to find any merit in appellant\u2019s contentions. The decision below granting summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks is therefore <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b999-10\"> 802 F.2d 532, 231 USPQ 477.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b999-11\">MARKEY, Chief Judge, dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">Convinced that this court lacks jurisdiction, I cannot join the court in deciding the merits of this appeal. Nor (absent congressional revision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295 or Supreme Court reversal in this case) can I escape what I see as the effect of the present exercise of jurisdiction on future appeals in which our jurisdiction is said to be present simply because an involved statute \u201crelates to patents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">With all due respect, my reasons follow.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-14\">\u201cJudicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge; always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the legislature; or, in other words, to the will of the law.\u201d <em>Osborn v. Bank of the United States, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738, 865, 6 L.Ed. 204, 234 (1824) (Marshall, C.J.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">The present action of the court is in my view an illegitimate exercise of raw judicial power. Because it has the doubtless unintended effect of substituting the will of judges for that of the legislature which it does not discuss, the exercise is at best unfortunate, for the necessary result (if <em>stare decisis </em>be not abandoned) is to transfer to this court jurisdiction long present in its sister circuits and not transferred by Congress. Not to put too fine a point on it, and again with all due respect, concern for the position of this court in the judicial system makes the assertion of jurisdiction in this appeal to me an embarrassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">Seizing upon the naked phrase \u201crelating to patents\u201d as a basis for its assertion of jurisdiction never granted by the Congress, the court disturbingly finesses the effect of its decision on untold future appeals involving other statutes, and on future panels of this court, with \u201cexpress no opinion.\u201d I can discern no principled basis for distinguishing \u00a7 32 from any other section of Title 35 governing Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administration, see Part II, <em>infra, </em>or from any of the many statutes listed in Part III, <em>infra, </em>each of which \u201crelates to patents\u201d as much and often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number><em>more </em>than \u00a7 32 does. The end result of the court\u2019s action here, whether desired by one or all judges, is to place the entire administration of the PTO under review by this court. The result is also to sweep into the jurisdiction of this court numerous petitions and statutes now within the jurisdiction of our sister circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">\n<em>Part I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ACB\">\n<em>Legitimacy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Congress created this court and enacted \u00a7 1295(a)(1) to help solve the specific problem of nonuniformity in application of the patent law and forum shopping in suits for infringement or declaration of invalidity of existing patents, saying that was its <em>\u201ccentral purpose,\u201d </em>H.R.Rep. No. 312, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 23 (1981), and that \u201cdoctrinal stability\u201d was needed because \u201capplication of the law\u201d had produced \u201cdifferent outcomes,\u201d S.Rep. No. 275, 97th Cong., 2nd Sess. 5, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 11, 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">In \u00a7 1295(a)(1) Congress dealt with <em>problems in court decisions on issued patents, </em>not with the administration of the PTO. Congress <em>selected </em>\u00a7 1338, which had long been in existence, because that was where the problem was, in patent suits filed under \u00a7 1338, not in petitions under administrative provisions of Title 35, which had always been brought under \u00a7 1331 and had never been properly brought under \u00a7 1338. \u201cRelating to patents\u201d in \u00a7 1338 does not mean \u201cthe administration of the PTO.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Section 1338 of title 28 was written to provide jurisdiction in the federal district court over law suits on issued <em>patents, </em>i.e., as it said, <em>in \u201cpatent cases. </em>\u201d This is not a patent case, involves no patent, and deals only with <em>administrative </em>law. Contrary to the <em>Jaskiewicz </em>panel\u2019s assertion, it is not difficult to distinguish the \u201cpractice\u201d (disciplinary rules) of the PTO from patent <em>law. </em>Moreover, the word \u201cpatents\u201d in \u00a7 1338 was a substitute for \u201cthe patent right\u201d, which the Reviser said was a change \u201cin phraseology.\u201d Reviser\u2019s Notes, 1948 U.S. Code Cong.Service 1701, 1838.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">Nothing could be more remote from uniform interpretation of the patent laws than the question of whether an applicant (Wy-den or Jaskiewicz) received due process when denied permission to practice in the PTO. That is the <em>sole </em>issue raised by a \u00a7 32 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">Where is there any <em>evidence </em>that Congress has granted this court jurisdiction over administrative decisions like those challenged in <em>Wyden </em>and <em>Jaskiewicz? </em>No such evidence is cited. None exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-13\">Neither the majority here nor the panel in <em>Jaskiewicz </em>points to any indication, in the legislative history or otherwise, that Congress had the slightest intent to place oversight of PTO administration exclusively in this court. Nor can they. There was and is no uniformity/forum shopping problem with \u00a7 32 or with any other section of Title 35 governing PTO administration. The outcome of <em>Wyden </em>and <em>Jaskiewicz </em>cannot possibly influence the uniform application of the patent law. Forum shopping is impossible under \u00a7 32, where the appeal goes and should go to the one circuit for the District of Columbia. Congress dealt fully with petitions challenging the Commissioner\u2019s actions not in \u00a7 1295(a)(1) but elsewhere, placing jurisdiction over them in the district courts under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and allowing appeals in those <em>administrative law </em>cases to remain in the regional circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">In \u00a7 32, clearly not itself a grant of jurisdiction to this or any court, Congress provided for a <em>petition </em>(not a \u201ccause of action,\u201d Wyden\u2019s sole \u201cclaim\u201d being to his right to due process) and for its determination not under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but under rules set by the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Section 32 petitions, and numerous other petitions under other statutes, see Part II, <em>infra, </em>have long been decided on the sole issue of due process under the Administrative Procedure Act and jurisdiction of the district court has been universally based on \u00a7 1331. How the <em>petition for review of administrative action </em>authorized in \u00a7 32 can be converted to a \u201ccivil action arising under\u201d envisaged in \u00a7 1338 escapes at least my understanding. Further, that conversion disregards considerations that have long characterized the field of administrative law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">Congress did visit Title 35 in the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982. In so doing, it granted this court jurisdiction over appeals from district court judgments in proceedings filed under the authority of \u00a7 145 (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(A)) and \u00a7 146 (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(C)). It <em>stopped </em>there. It did not touch \u00a7 32 or any other section of Title 35. Nor did it touch any of the many other statutes that can be said (by those bent on doing so) to \u201crelate to patents.\u201d The court here goes far beyond Congress\u2019 stopping point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">If the Congress had the slightest intent in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1) of granting this court jurisdiction over appeals that involve statutes \u201crelating to patents,\u201d <em>why </em>did it not just say so? <em>Why </em>did it single out \u00a7\u00a7 145, 146 (that \u201crelate\u201d more to \u201cpatents\u201d than \u00a7 32 does) and then bother to enact the totally unnecessary sections 1295(a)(4)(A) and 1295(a)(4)(C)? <em>See Richards v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 1, 11, 82 S.Ct. 585, 591, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962). The court here and the panel in <em>Jaskiewicz </em>do not, and cannot, say.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\"><em>Why </em>did Congress go to the trouble of limiting our jurisdiction to <em>cases </em>in which district court jurisdiction \u201cwas based, in whole or in part, on section 1338,\u201d if it intended to include <em>petitions </em>over which the jurisdiction of the district courts had always been based on \u00a7 1331? The court here and the panel in <em>Jaskiewicz </em>do not, and cannot, say.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">If Congress thought \u00a7 1332\u2019s \u201ccivil action arising\u201d language included \u00a7 32 petitions, <em>why </em>did it not repeal the then redundant provision for a petition in \u00a7 32? <em>Why </em>did Congress speak only of \u00a7 1338 and say nothing of \u00a7 1331?</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Treating <em>Dubost </em>(that probably was not within our jurisdiction but at least involved refusal of a patent application) as a self-grant of jurisdiction over appeals on \u00a7 32 petitions because \u00a7 32 \u201crelates to patents\u201d is judicial leap-frogging with a vengeance. It is <em>Congress, </em>not our own pronouncements, that is the <em>source </em>of our jurisdictional grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">Neither the court here nor the panel in <em>Jaskiewicz </em>says what provision of <em>patent law </em>must be \u201cconstrued.\u201d We are not told what patent law construction might vindicate some unmentioned \u201cright\u201d of Wyden, or what patent law Wyden is \u201cinvoking.\u201d Neither the court here nor the <em>Jaskiewicz </em>panel discusses the contrary thrust of this court\u2019s holdings in: <em>In re Bose Corp., </em>772 F.2d 866, 227 USPQ 1 (Fed.Cir.1985); <em>Beghin-Say International v. Rasmussen, </em>733 F.2d 1568, 1570-71, 221 USPQ 1121, 1123 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>In re Makari, </em>708 F.2d 709, 218 USPQ 193 (Fed.Cir.1983); or in the adopted precedents of this court: <em>In re James, </em>432 F.2d 473, 475, 167 USPQ 403 (CCPA 1970); <em>In re Marriott-Hot Shoppes, </em>411 F.2d 1025, 262 USPQ 106 (CCPA 1969); <em>In re Wiechert, </em>370 F.2d 927, 152 USPQ 247 (CCPA 1967); and <em>Sundback v. Blair, 47 </em>F.2d 378, 8 USPQ 220 (CCPA 1931).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>Neither this court nor the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (and certainly not the PTO) has legitimate authority to assign, transfer, or confer jurisdiction. That authority resides exclusively with the Congress. To employ congressional silence, or a judge\u2019s view on what congress \u201cwould\u201d do or \u201cshould\u201d have done, as a basis for the present self-grant of jurisdiction (or for the shedding of jurisdiction by the <em>Jaskiewicz </em>panel) is in my view a grossly unwarranted and unnecessary example, even if unintended, of rampant judicial legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">\n<em>Part II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\"><em>Other Courts </em>\u2014 Other <em>Petitions</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALXE\">Directing appeals from all district courts in patent and Little Tucker Act cases to one appellate court was a big \u201cfirst\u201d in our country\u2019s history and a big step for Congress to take. In so doing, Congress was at pains to remind this court that \u201cFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,\u201d that there \u201cis no presumption of jurisdiction,\u201d that \u201cjurisdiction must always be affirmatively shown\u201d and cannot \u201cmerely be inferred argumentatively.\u201d Congress praised our predecessor courts for not allowing \u201cinferential and unwarranted increases\u201d in their jurisdiction. Noting the concern that this court \u201cmight appropriate for itself\u201d other elements of federal law, Congress pointed to the \u201csubstantial requirement\u201d that the district court must have had jurisdiction under \u00a7 <em>1338, </em>and went on to remind us that a \u201ccanon of construction\u201d requires that \u201ccourts strictly construe their jurisdiction.\u201d S.Rep. No. 275, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 18-19, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 11, 28-29. In sum, Congress <em>trusted </em>us not to do what we are doing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">The federal district courts have for years reviewed petitions against a variety of Commissioner\u2019s orders, with appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 heard in the various circuit courts: petitions in interferences,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> petitions to revive abandoned applications,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>titions to compel filing dates,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> petitions to enter amendments,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> petitions to compel public use proceedings,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> petitions to cancel a section 141 appeal, and petitions objecting to requirement for cancellation of references in the specification to prior applications,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and petitions challenging the Commissioner\u2019s construction of the confidentiality requirement of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 122 in Freedom of Information Act cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">All the foregoing petitions clearly implicate sections of Title 35 that \u201crelate to patents\u201d as much as does a \u00a7 32 petition. If \u201crelating to patents\u201d gives this court jurisdiction over petitions under \u00a7 32, it surpasses understanding, as above indicated, how a future panel of this court, confronted by any such petitions and bound by the precedent of this case, could deny jurisdiction. Thus candor requires a recognition that, over time, the court\u2019s \u201crelating to patents\u201d rubric will have succeeded in appropriating from our sister circuits the entire body of administrative law represented by petitions challenging any administrative action of the PTO. Congress could have so mandated, but it did not. For this court to do so (or to acquiesce in another court\u2019s doing so) is in my view at best unfortunate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Congress\u2019 grant of appellate jurisdiction to this court in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1) cannot possibly, in my view, be construed as reflecting a congressional intent to <em>transfer appeals from decisions on all the foregoing petitions </em>to this court. Even if this or any court had the legislative authority to take that drastic step (which it obviously does not), no reason for doing so existed when this court was created, and none exists now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">\n<em>Part III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\"><em>Other Courts </em>\u2014 Other <em>Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">Responsible judicial decisionmaking involves a type of dichotomy: One should avoid hypothetical, and, at the same time, recognize the decision\u2019s inevitable effect on future cases to which it will apply. In the present appeal it is decided that this court has jurisdiction over appeals from district court judgments on \u00a7 32 petitions to review the administration of the PTO in denying Wyden permission to practice as a patent agent. It does so on the rationale that \u00a7 32 \u201crelates to patents.\u201d It then says Wyden\u2019s \u00a7 32-authorized petition for review of that administrative action is \u201ca civil action arising under an Act of Congress relating to patents.\u201d It then says jurisdiction of the district court was \u201cbased, in whole or in part, on \u00a7 1338.\u201d It then says \u201cwe express no opinion as to other statutes not before us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">With all due respect, the court should recognize the inevitable effect of its decision. Other statutes stand in the wings and will confront future panels of this court. If those panels are not to discard respect for precedent, they must hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>the court has jurisdiction if any of those statutes \u201crelate to patents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The following statutes \u201crelate to patents\u201d as much or more than \u00a7 32 does:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-5\">(1) <em>Every one </em>of the 135 sections of Title 35.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-6\">(2) 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 178j (patentable inventions relating to native rubber made under contract with various federal agencies are property of the United States).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-7\">(3) 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 178 (authorizes Foundation For The Advancement Of Military Medicine to obtain patents).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-8\">(4) 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320 (exemption of government and its contractors\u2019 patent rights from Department of Defense regulation).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-9\">(5) 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2386 (funding for military acquisition of patent rights).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-10\">(6) 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7210 (authorizes Secretary of the Navy to purchase patents).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-11\">(7) 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2054 (public availability of patents resulting from contracts with Consumer Products Safety Commission).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-12\">(8) 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 (patentable inventions made under contract with Energy Research and Development Administration relating to electric and hybrid vehicles are property of the United States).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-13\">(9) 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2707 (patentable inventions relating to automotive propulsion made under contract with Department of Energy are property of the United States).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-14\">(10) 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 831r (Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s access to patents; suits against the TVA for patent infringement).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-15\">(11) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 497 (felony for forging patent or for knowingly transferring or publishing that patent).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-16\">(12) 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 91 (access of PTO for educational purposes).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-17\">(18X14) 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3477, 3480 (authorize Secretary of Education to obtain patents).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-18\">(15) 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 372 (access to PTO materials by Food and Drug Administration).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-19\">(16) 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2356 (suit against government in district court or Claims Court for unauthorized disclosure or practice of patented inventions).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-20\">(17) 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 186 (tax deduction for injury sustained as result of patent infringement).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-21\">(18) 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 483 (interest accrued on sale of patents).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-22\">(19) (20) 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 861, 862 (royalties from patent licensing as gross income).

Our sister circuits to which an appeal involving such a statute was taken could cite that grant in transferring that appeal to this court. As matters now stand, the <em>only authority </em>the majority here and the <em>Jaskiewicz </em>panel cite is this court\u2019s decision in <em>Dubost. </em>Future panels of this court will be bound by <em>Dubost </em>and <em>Wyden, </em>and may cite <em>Jaskiewicz. </em>Whether our sister circuits will agree that court decisions that cite no congressional grant are effective to deprive them of their long-exercised jurisdiction is unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">When a court acts beyond the jurisdiction granted it by Congress, a situation most grave is created. The gravity of that situation is compounded when a court acts to appropriate, or acquiesces in another court\u2019s gift of, the jurisdiction previously and currently exercised by other courts. In the present case, the assertion of jurisdiction not granted also gravely injures the jurisprudence surrounding 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 32, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1338, 1331, and 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Jurisdiction is not properly granted by judicial fiat. It was concern for just such judicial overreaching that produced in the Constitutional Convention such deep distrust of the notion that there should be a federal judiciary at all. <em>See </em>Farrand, <em>The Records of the Federal Convention </em>(Rev. Ed.1937); Prescott, <em>Drafting the Federal Constitution, </em>Ch. 17 (1941). Harkening as I do here to a \u201cdifferent drummer\u201d from that heard by my colleagues, I am compelled to dissent from the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">.

The attempt was rejected, the court saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>It can be <em>argued </em>that a <em>formalistic </em>analysis of section 33 demonstrates that it is \"related to\u201d patents. The Patent Office was established by Congress for the purpose of processing patent applications pursuant to the patent power granted by the Constitution____ The purpose of section 33 is to protect patent applicants against predation by unauthorized practitioners during the patent application process____ But this appears to us to be a somewhat <em>tenuous and literalistic connection. </em>From a common sense reading of sections 33 and 1338, it becomes apparent that there is a <em>substantial difference between statutes directly relating to patents and those concerning merely collateral aspects of practice before the Patent Office. </em>We deem this distinction to be critical and to dictate the outcome of this case. While the <em>human mind may be capable of formulating a literal connection between a particular statute and patents, </em>the test must be whether there is a relationship strong enough to support a conclusion that it <em>relates to patents for purposes of providing jurisdiction under section 1338. </em>Based upon our reading of these two statutes we conclude that section 33 does not relate to patents but is merely connected with patents.

The District of Columbia Circuit has so held. <em>Jaskiewicz v. Mossinghoff </em>802 F.2d 532 (D.C.Cir.1986). The question is close, and I see no reason to create a conflict with our sister circuit.

If a subsequent decision by the Supreme Court is rendered which would in theory mean that Wyden should have taken this appeal to the District of Columbia Circuit, the judgment will not, under current jurisprudence, be void. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 12 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">With respect to this case, it is ripe for resolution at this level of the federal court system. The District of Columbia Circuit has said that it has no jurisdiction in such an appeal. Appellant is entitled to a decision and we are the only other available forum. Accordingly, in my view, it is appropriate to defer to the decision of the District of Columbia Circuit and resolve the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">On the merits, I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
