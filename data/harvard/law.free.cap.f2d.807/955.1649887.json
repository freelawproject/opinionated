SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1018-28\">This is an appeal by Custom Accessories, Inc. (Custom), from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, holding invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 claims 1 and 6 of United States Patent No. 4,264,083 (the '083 patent). We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\">The facts recited in this opinion, unless otherwise indicated, are either uncontested by the parties or are findings of the district court not shown to have been clearly erroneous. FED.R.CIY.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">1. <em>The Technology</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Mud flap or splash guard assemblies are commonly used on motor vehicles to prevent damage to the frame due to pebbles, salt, mud, and other debris thrown from the vehicle path by rotating wheels. They are placed in close proximity to a wheel and occupy a rearward position relative to the primary direction of travel of the motor vehicle. The assembly usually includes a splash intercepting body portion, such as a flat resilient flap or a rigid metallic plate of light construction, anchored by a fastener to a fender area of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">2. <em>The Patent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">The \u2019083 patent was issued on April 28, 1981, to Matthew, <em>et al., </em>and was assigned to Custom. A reissue patent application was filed on June 23, 1981, in the name of the original inventors. On February 19, 1982, Pretty Products, Inc., filed a request for reexamination in light of nine references not considered during prosecution. On June 3, 1982, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) merged the reissue application with the reexamination proceeding. Custom then expressly abandoned the reissue application on June 17, 1982. Original claims 1 and 6 were amended during, and ultimately survived, reexamination. A reexamination certificate including those claims was issued on March 22, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">Claim 1 reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">1. A splash guard or mud flap assembly for attachment to the fender of a motor vehicle, comprising: a flexible, splash-intercepting body portion: resilient, self-sustaining anchoring means for supporting the body portion and being adapted to be snugly engaged along the fender of a motor vehicle for securing the body portion in a splash-intercepting position thereon, said anchoring means including a front wall and a back wall resiliently integrally joined along one side in substantial overlying relation to one another and converging in the direction of the free ends thereof, the free ends of said walls being resiliently separable a distance to enable the anchoring means to be snugly frietionally engaged on a motor vehicle fender, the resiliency of the anchoring means being such that the front wall and the back wall thereof provide substantially the total gripping force for maintaining the anchoring means on a motor vehicle fender while providing a rigid support base for the splash-intercepting body portion of the splash guard, and an outwardly extending pin-like member carried on the front wall of the resilient anchoring means in spaced, inward relation to the free ends of said walls of the anchoring means for engaging and retaining said body portion on the anchoring means, said pin-like member being provided with locking means for securing and maintaining the splash-intercepting body portion on the anchoring means, said locking means being characterized in that it overlies and is in contact with a sufficient area of the splash-intercepting body portion to resist any forces tending to dislodge said body portion from the pin-like member.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">Claim 6 recites:</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-17\">A splash guard or mud flap assembly as claimed in claim 1 wherein the pin-like member of the anchoring means is provided with external threads for receiving a nut-like retaining member for securing and maintaining the splash-intercepting body portion on the anchoring means, said nut-like retaining member being characterized in that the base of the nut-like retaining member overlies and is in contact with a sufficient area of said body portion to resist any forces tending to dislodge the body from the pin-like member.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-18\">3. <em>District Court Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ad_\">Custom filed suit in the district court alleging infringement by appellee Jeffrey-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Alian Industries, Inc. (Jeffrey-Allan). Jeffrey-Allan denied infringement. It also raised as affirmative defenses and counterclaimed that claims 1 and 6 were invalid on the grounds of obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, improper inventorship under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(f), and overclaiming under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">The district court judge entered judgment for Jeffrey-Allan for the reasons contained in a July 26, 1985, \u201cMemorandum and Order\u201d that constituted the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. The district court found claims 1 and 6 of the \u2019083 patent invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but did not adjudicate any other issue. The Memorandum and Order does state, however, that \u201c[djefendant does not seriously contend that its splash guard assembly does not infringe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Whether the district court erred in holding that claims 1 and 6 of the \u2019083 patent are invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">Section 103 of 35 U.S.C. precludes a patent grant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-9\">if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">Though the ultimate question is one of law, a determination of obviousness under section 103 is based on these factual inquiries set forth in <em>Graham v. John Deere Co.:</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(a) the scope and content of the prior art; (b) the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue; (c) the level of ordinary skill in the art; and (d) objective evidence of nonobviousness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-15\">Under <em>Graham, </em>a district court makes proper fact findings on those four inquiries and then assesses the ultimate legal question of nonobviousness. Thus, given the scope and content of the prior art, the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art, the level of ordinary skill in the art, and the existence of commercial success and any other objective considerations of nonobviousness, the district court determines whether the claimed invention would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the appropriate art at the time the invention was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-16\">At the conclusion of its <em>llk </em>page Memorandum and Order, the district court for the first time cites <em>Graham, </em>stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-17\">This court concludes, in accordance with the teachings of <em>Graham v. John Deere Co., </em>383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966); <em>Dual Mfg. &amp; Engineering, Inc. v. Burris Industries, Inc., </em>619 F.2d 660 (7th Cir.) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 870, 101 S.Ct. 208, 66 L.Ed.2d 90 (1980) and <em>Republic Industries, Inc. v. Schlage Lock Co., </em>592 F.2d 963 (7th Cir. 1979), that the use of that anchoring means rather than another in an old combination was, in the circumstances of this case, obvious within the meaning of section 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-18\">That fleeting reference to <em>Graham </em>does not convince us that the district court in fact properly analyzed obviousness using the <em>Graham </em>analysis. Indeed, Custom has persuaded us to the contrary. That <em>Graham </em>was not properly applied is evidenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>by the district court: (1) improperly focusing on \u201ca combination of old elements\u201d; (2) ignoring objective evidence of nonobviousness; (3) paying lip service to the presumption of validity; and (4) failing to make sufficient <em>Graham </em>findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">A. <em>Improperly Focusing on a Combination of Old Elements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">In assessing the patentability of Custom\u2019s device, the district court\u2019s Memorandum and Order refers to \u201ca combination of old elements,\u201d which \u201cis not necessarily an invention\u201d but is entitled to patent protection if the combination \u201ccauses a new and useful result.\u201d Though it perceives one of the elements (the protruding pin in the anchoring means) as possibly novel, it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-6\">A U-clip with a locked pin surely was not itself patentable as an independent invention. Indeed, the plaintiff cancelled claims limited to the anchoring means during reexamination, when they were rejected as obvious. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Such an approach is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">The dispositive question is not whether the claimed device is an \u201cinvention\u201d; rather, it is whether the invention satisfies the standards of patentability. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 100-103. To suggest that Custom\u2019s new combination \u201cis not necessarily an invention\u201d or otherwise to require some concept of \u201cinventiveness\u201d or \u201cflash of genius\u201d for patentability would improperly misplace the focus of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">That each element in a claimed invention is old or unpatentable does not determine the nonobviousness of the claimed invention as a whole. \u201cThere is no basis in the law * * * for treating combinations of old elements differently in determining patent-ability.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As stated in Stratoflex:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-14\">The reference to a \u201ccombination patent\u201d is equally without support in the statute. There is no warrant for judicial classification of patents, whether into \u201ccombination\u201d patents and some other unnamed and undefined class or otherwise. Nor is there warrant for differing treatment or consideration of patents based on a judicially devised label. Reference to \u201ccombination\u201d patents is, moreover, meaningless. Virtually <em>all </em>patents are \u201ccombination patents,\u201d if by that label one intends to describe patents having claims to inventions formed of a combination of elements. It is difficult to visualize, at least in the mechanical-structural arts, a \u201cnon-combination\u201d invention, i.e., an invention consisting of a <em>single </em>element. * * * [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-15\">Casting an invention as \u201ca combination of old elements\u201d leads improperly to an analysis of the claimed invention by the parts, not by the whole. That is what seems to have happened here. The critical inquiry is whether \u201c \u2018there is something in the prior art as a whole <em>to suggest </em>the desirability, and thus the obviousness, of making the combination.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-16\">A traditional problem with focusing on a patent as a \u201ccombination of old elements\u201d is the attendant notion that patentability is undeserving without some \u201csynergistic\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d effect. Here, the district court spoke of the need for \u201ca new and useful result.\u201d Such tests for patentability have been soundly rejected by this court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Though synergism is relevant when present, its \u201cabsence has no place in evaluating the evidence on obviousness.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">The district court\u2019s citation to <em>Dual Man</em>ufacturing<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> together with <em>Graham v. John Deere, </em>supports our conclusion that the district court was misled by improper \u201ccombination\u201d notions. <em>Dual Manufacturing </em>expressly adopts the type of rationale regarding \u201ccombination patents\u201d and synergism that this court has expressly rejected and only serves to confuse the real test of obviousness prescribed by the 1952 Patent Act. Though <em>Republic Industries, Inc. v. Schlage Lock Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>also cited by the district court, is more in tune with Federal Circuit precedent on combination patents and synergism, the possibility exists that the district court gave more credence to <em>Dual Manufacturing </em>because it was decided in banc and subsequent to <em>Republic Industries.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">B. <em>Ignoring Objective Evidence of Nonobviousness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">The district court found that Custom\u2019s \u201cassembly was an improvement, as persuasively evidenced by its adoption by competitors.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Though \u201cnot a major breakthrough,\u201d stated the court, \u201cit was a better mousetrap than those on the market,\u201d and \u201c[ojthers have adopted that design, so that it has become a commonly sold configuration, thus providing support for a contention of commercial success, although plaintiff has had virtually no success in persuading its competition to take licenses.\u201d After saying that, however, the district court seemed to ignore the concrete evidence of copying and commercial success. Failure to consider such evidence is clearly error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-15\">Under <em>Graham, </em>objective evidence of nonobviousness includes commercial success, longfelt but unresolved need, failure of others, and copying.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When present, such objective evidence must be considered.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It can be the most probative evidence of nonobviousness in the record, and enables the district court to avert the trap of hindsight.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On the other hand, the absence of objective evidence does not preclude a holding of nonobviousness because such evidence is not a requirement for patentability.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As stated in <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Intermedies, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the absence of objective evidence \u201cis a neutral factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-16\">The district court\u2019s failure to consider objective evidence was probably fueled by the two cases it cited together with <em>Graham. </em>Both <em>Dual Manufacturing </em>and <em>Republic Industries </em>mistreat the importance of objective evidence, such as commercial success. They incorrectly state that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>objective criteria \u201cwithout invention will not make patentability.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A05W\">C. <em>Paying Lip Service to the Presumption of Validity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">A patent is presumed valid. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282. Indeed, each claim of a patent is presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims. <em>Id. </em>The burden is on the party asserting invalidity to prove the invalidity of each claim (here, claims 1 and 6) with facts supported by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Though the district court stated that the presumption operates to \u201cshift the burden of proof,\u201d the Memorandum and Order does not indicate a recognition by the district court that the burden is by clear and convincing evidence. Moreover, the Memorandum and Order occasionally suggests that the district court may have incorrectly placed the burden on the patentee to establish validity. For example, it states: \u201cThis court finds unpersuasive plaintiffs contention that Bedford does not anticipate * * * <em>if </em><footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Nor did the district court give any credence to the PTO reexamination proceeding, which upheld the validity of claims 1 and 6 despite the presence of much the same art as was presented before the district court. In <em>Interconnect Planning Corp. v. Feil,</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this court stated that an examiner\u2019s decision on an original or reissue application is \u201cevidence the court must consider in determining whether the party asserting invalidity has met its statutory burden by clear and convincing evidence,\u201d and that, upon reissue, the burden of proving invalidity was \u201cmade heavier.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">D. <em>Failing To Make Sufficient Graham Findings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">The amount and specificity of findings needed are determinations to be made on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201c[W]e must be convinced from the opinion that the district court actually applied <em>Graham </em>and must be presented with enough express and necessarily implied findings to know the basis of the trial court\u2019s opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Certainly, when significant legal errors are reflected in the opinion, as here, which themselves shed doubt on the district court\u2019s use of <em>Graham, </em>the need for findings becomes greater and their absence rises to the level of error.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">In this case, the failure of the district court to make sufficient <em>Graham </em>findings further supports our conclusion that <em>Graham </em>was not in fact properly applied. The findings were insufficient in at least three regards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-15\">(1) <em>Scope and Content of Prior Art/Differences Between Prior Art and Claimed Invention</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-16\">The Memorandum and Order briefly discusses as prior art United States patents to Bedford, Jr., and to Wootton, a line of</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>\u201cAu-ve-co\u201d devices, a Tinnerman parts cat-alogue, and a Rubber Queen assembly. However, the Memorandum and Order does not make clear which reference/devices (references) or combination of references provides the basis for determining obviousness. It is also not clear what teachings are relied on from each reference, and how each reference differs from the claimed invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Some differences were found, but improperly considered by the district court. For one, the district court did not find a teaching in any reference of a pin protruding or extending from a clip, but dismissed that difference by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-5\">That the Au-ve-co unit and the Woot-ton patent disclosed an anchoring means in which a bolt threaded into the clip rather than a pin projecting from the clip does not dilute the force of the disclosure. Indeed, the idea taken to DeChant could have ended up in commercial production in that form. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">It is unclear what is meant by \u201cdoes not dilute the force of the disclosure.\u201d Clearly, the district court identified a difference between the claimed invention and the pri- or art \u2014 the protruding pin. Before deeming the claimed invention obvious, the district court would have to find some suggestion in the references for using an \u201coutwardly extending pin-like member,\u201d as required by the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">The district court also stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">What was brought to him [DeChant, who designed the fastener] was the idea, reduced to practice in a primitive form, of an anchoring means in a splash guard assembly which used a pin attached as part of a clip and projecting through the splash guard. There was no reason, in light of the conception, that the attachment to the clip could not have been by screwing a bolt into threads [like in the prior art] * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">That approach appears inappropriately to perceive an element of the claimed invention <em>(i.e., </em>a pin as part of the clip protruding through the splash guard) broadly as an \u201cidea\u201d or \u201cconception\u201d (screwing a bolt into threads) that the district court viewed as being old in the prior art. Such treatment emasculates a real difference in this case between the claimed invention and the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">(2) <em>Level of Ordinary Skill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">The <em>Graham </em>analysis includes a factual determination of the level of ordinary skill in the art. Without that information, a district court cannot properly assess obviousness because the critical question is whether a claimed invention would have been obvious at the time it was made to one with ordinary skill in the art.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The important consideration is \u201cthe need to adhere to the statute, <em>i.e., </em>to hold that an invention would or would not have been obvious, as a whole, when it was made, to a person of \u2018ordinary skill in the art\u2019 \u2014 not to the judge, or to a layman, or to those skilled in remote arts, or to geniuses in the art.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">The person of ordinary skill is a hypothetical person who is presumed to be aware of all the pertinent prior art.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The actual inventor\u2019s skill is not determinative.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Factors that may be considered in determining level of skill include: type of problems encountered in art; prior art solutions to those problems; rapidity with which innovations are made; sophistication of the technology; and educational level of active workers in the field.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Not all such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>factors may be present in every case, and one or more of them may predominate.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">In appropriate cases we have noted a district court\u2019s failure to make a specific, or correct, finding on level of skill, without the consequence of reversal.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In those instances, however, it was not shown that the failure to make a finding or an incorrect finding on level of skill influenced the ultimate conclusion under section 103 and, hence, constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">In the present case, we do not reverse or vacate solely because of a failure to make the level of skill finding. We merely consider the district court\u2019s failure to make that and other <em>Graham </em>findings as evidence that <em>Graham </em>was not in fact applied.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">(3) <em>Objective Evidence of Nonobviousness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">It is difficult for us to tell from the district court\u2019s discussion of commercial success <em>(see </em>discussion at section B, <em>supra) </em>whether there was a finding of commercial success and, if so, whether there was \u201cnexus\u201d between the commercial success and the claimed invention. Such nexus, the existence of which Jeffrey-Allan on appeal disputes, is needed if commercial success is to be considered.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">If, on review of a determination of obviousness, an appellant shows that the district court incorrectly applied the law, we will not reverse <em>(i.e., </em>hold that defendant below failed to prove obviousness) unless appellant also convinces us that a proper application of the law to the facts of record would change the result.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Sometimes, however, an appellant will convince us that the law was incorrectly applied, but there are inadequate findings by the district court to enable us to determine independently whether defendant below did or did not prove that the invention would have been obvious. That has happened here because, as explained above, there are inadequate findings in a number of regards. In such circumstances, rather than find material facts ourselves, we must remand to allow the district court to do so. As stated in <em>Icicle Seafoods, Inc. v. </em>Worthington:<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> If the Court of Appeals believed that the District Court had failed to make findings of fact essential to a proper resolution of the legal question, it should have remanded to the District Court to make those findings. If it was of the view that the findings of the District Court were \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d within the meaning of Rule 52(a), it could have set them aside on that basis. If it believed that the District Court\u2019s factual findings were unassailable, but that the proper rule of law was misapplied to those findings, it could have reversed the District Court\u2019s judgment. But it should not simply have made factual findings on its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-14\">Hence, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings. The district court, based on the record before it and in light of the guidance provided herein, is instructed (1) to make proper findings underlying a determination under section 103, sufficient for us to review its judgment and to assure us that the <em>Graham </em>test was in fact applied, and (2) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>determine whether defendant below has carried its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the claimed invention would have been obvious under section 103. If the district court deems it appropriate, it may elicit new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">On remand, the district court should also address the other issues presented, <em>e.g., </em>\u201coverclaiming,\u201d the section 102(f) defense, and infringement, and should enter judgment accordingly. That way, we need not remand the case should we reverse the district court, in a future appeal, on, <em>e.g., </em>a determination of obviousness. Too often, district courts resolve only one of a number of issues presented and, when reversed on that issue, are forced to retry the remainder of the case.
