GINSBURG, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1063-14\">Plaintiffs-Appellees, who proposed to represent several million owners of Ford automobiles, initiated the instant suit against Ford Motor Company to pursue breach of warranty claims by means of class actions. The appellees\u2019 suit arises under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act (\u201cMagnuson-Moss\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the essence of appellees\u2019 complaint is that certain Ford models suffer from a transmission defect that causes the automobiles to slip out of the \u201cpark\u201d position and into \u201creverse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-16\">In order to obtain class action certification under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, appellees grouped their breach of warranty claimants into three principal categories: one group (\u201cwritten warranty incidents\u201d class) included all Ford owners who had allegedly experienced a \u201cpark-to-reverse\u201d incident within Ford\u2019s 12,000 mile/12 month written warranty period; the second group (\u201cimplied warranty incidents\u201d class) included every Ford owner who allegedly experienced a park-to-reverse incident; and the third group (\u201call-owners\u201d class) included all owners of an allegedly defective Ford vehicle, without regard to whether the owner had ever experienced a park-to-reverse incident. Citing a variety of legal objections, Ford opposed class certification; in particular, Ford argued that none of the appellees\u2019 proposed claimant groups was a cognizable \u201cclass\u201d under Rule 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-17\">Although the District Court recognized that appellees\u2019 proposed class groupings raised some difficult legal issues under Rule 23, the trial judge nevertheless conditionally certified all three classes. The District Court decided to apply Rule 23 only where it is consistent with the terms and intent of Magnuson-Moss; therefore, having found that Magnuson-Moss reflects a congressional intent liberally to allow class actions as a device to facilitate consumers\u2019 recovery for breach of warranties, the District Court concluded that appellees\u2019 proposed classes should be certified as suggested. The effect of this ruling was to allow appellees to avoid the strict requirements of class certification under Rule 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-18\">Given the importance of the legal questions at issue, and the enormity of the litigation presently contemplated, the District Court approved appellant\u2019s request for interlocutory review under 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>\u00a7 1292(b). On November 7, 1985, this court granted interlocutory appeal on the issue of class certification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">Because we find that the District Court\u2019s decision to certify appellees\u2019 classes was based in significant part on an improper construction of Magnuson-Moss, rather than on a normal application of Rule 23, we vacate and remand for further consideration as to whether any class certification is appropriate under unmodified Rule 23 standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">A. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ajj\">The plaintiffs-appellees brought this action under section 110 of Magnuson-Moss,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging that the defendant-appellant, Ford Motor Company, breached both its implied and written warranties of merchantability by marketing defectively designed automobiles. In particular, the appellees alleged that 1976-79 (and 1980 pre-design change) Ford vehicles equipped with FMX, C-3, C-4 and C-6 automatic transmissions suffer from a defect that causes the automobiles to slip out of the \u201cpark\u201d position and into \u201creverse.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The appellees, claiming to represent several million Ford owners, sought to pursue their breach of warranty claims by means of class actions. For the purpose of obtaining class action certification, they grouped their principal claims into three broad categories. The first group (\u201cwritten warranty incidents\u201d class) consisted of all Ford owners who allegedly experienced a park-to-reverse incident within Ford\u2019s 12,000 mile/12 month written warranty period. This group sought certification under Rule 23(b)(3) to recover property damages incurred in these incidents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The second group (\u201cimplied warranty incidents\u201d class) consisted of all Ford owners who allegedly experienced a park-to-reverse incident. This group also sought certification under Rule 23(b)(3) to recover property damages. The third group (\u201call-owners\u201d class) consisted of <em>all </em>owners of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>an allegedly defective Ford vehicle, without regard to whether the owner had experienced an actual park-to-reverse incident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This group sought certification under Rule 23(b)(3) to recover damages equal to the difference in value between the transmissions as received and as warranted; or, in the alternative, certification under Rule 23(b)(2) to compel Ford to repair the defective vehicles.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The appellees also asked the District Court to certify two additional \u201cincidents\u201d classes, one to recover punitive damages and the other to pursue personal injury claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Before the District Court, Ford opposed class certification on numerous grounds.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under Rule 23(b)(3), Ford observed, a district court may not certify a class unless it finds that \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the members of the [proposed] class predominate over any question affecting only individual members.\u201d With respect to the implied warranty classes, Ford argued, it could not be found that common questions of <em>law </em>predominated, because Magnu-son-Moss defines implied warranties as those arising under state law,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and there are material variations in state laws governing the interpretation of implied warranties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With respect to <em>all </em>the proposed classes, Ford argued, it could not be found that common questions of <em>fact </em>predominated, because the appellees had not proffered any proof that the four different transmissions (the FMX, C-3, C-4 and C-6) suffered from a common defect.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> With respect to the \u201cincidents\u201d classes, Ford argued, it again could not be found that common questions of fact predominated, because each plaintiff would be required to make an individual showing that her accident was caused by Ford\u2019s allegedly defective design.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-13\">Ford also argued that certification of an \u201call-owners\u201d class was improper in light of the appellees\u2019 concession that they could not bear the cost of providing individual notice of the action to the several million absentee class members. As interpreted in <em>Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, </em>Ford observed, Rule 23(c)(2) requires proposed plaintiff class representatives to send individual notice to all class members whose names and addresses may be ascertained through reasonable effort, irrespective of the financial burden placed on the plaintiffs by this requirement. 417 U.S. 156, 176, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 2151, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974) (\u201c[Individual notice to identifiable class members is not a discretionary consideration to be waived in a particular case. It is, rather, an unambiguous requirement of Rule 23____ There is nothing in Rule 23 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>suggest that the notice requirements can be tailored to fit the pocketbooks of particular plaintiffs.\u201d) In addition, Ford argued, individual notice was required by procedural due process, for without such notice, absentee class members would be deprived of the opportunity to be heard or to opt out of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">B. <em>The District Court\u2019s Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"aqn-dedup-0\">The District Court found that none of the above arguments foreclosed class certification under Rule 23(b)(3). Accordingly, the trial judge conditionally certified an \u201call-owners\u201d class,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> an \u201cimplied warranty incidents\u201d class and a \u201cwritten warranty incidents\u201d class.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Before addressing Ford\u2019s Rule 23 arguments, however, the District Court examined the statutory framework of Magnu-son-Moss to determine the extent to which Rule 23 applies to class actions brought under the Act. Section 110 of the Act establishes jurisdictional requirements for a class action brought in federal district court. In particular, the Act requires that there be at least 100 named plaintiffs, that each individual claim exceed $25 and that the aggregate claims exceed $50,000.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Act also provides that a plaintiff may <em>file </em>a class action, but may not <em>proceed </em>with that action, until she has afforded the defendant a reasonable opportunity to cure its alleged breach. While the class action is held in abeyance pending possible cure, the district court may rule on the representative capacity of the named plaintiffs, its determination to be made \u201cin the application of rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-10\">The appellees contend that these statutory provisions evince a congressional intent that Rule 23 should apply to Magnu-son-Moss class actions only to the extent necessary to determine the representative capacity of the named plaintiffs. Congress, they argue, would not have explicitly mentioned Rule 23 in a particular context had it meant for Rule 23 to apply across the board.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The fact that Congress specified the circumstance under which Rule 23 would apply, and delineated the jurisdictional requirements for a class action in federal court, purportedly suggests that Congress may have intended to create a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>\u201c \u2018self-contained\u2019 class action regime\u201d under which those portions of Rule 23 not explicitly mentioned in the statute would not apply.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">The District Court wisely rejected this contention, refusing to \u201cread section 110 [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310 (1982) ] so broadly as to have it supersede the Rule 23 class action provision.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>However, </em>the court did interpret Magnuson-Moss as mandating a somewhat looser application of Rule 23. In particular, the court found that it should apply Rule 23 only where \u201cit is consistent with the terms and intent of Magnuson-Moss.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">In accordance with this view, the District Court set out to apply Rule 23 \u201cagainst the backdrop of Magnuson-Moss and Congress\u2019 intent to provide class actions as a form of recovery to consumers for breach of written and implied warranty.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> First, the court rejected Ford\u2019s argument that material variations in the Ford transmissions precluded a finding that common questions of fact predominated. As to the four transmission <em>types, </em>the court reserved judgment on whether the appellees could prove that the transmissions were \u201csufficiently and materially similar so as to permit them to be included in a single class.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It did find, however, that the appellees had \u201ccredibly alleged\u201d common defects as to the four transmissions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court found that it could separate each transmission type into a subclass if it concluded at a later stage of the litigation that such a division was necessary. As to the more numerous transmission <em>systems, </em>the court was \u201cnot convinced\u201d that the differences alleged by Ford were \u201cmaterial enough\u201d to prevent classwide proof on the issue of defective design.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Again, the court appeared to reserve the option of subdividing classes at a later date should its initial judgment prove erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-14\">Second, the court refused to accept Ford\u2019s argument that state law variations precluded a finding that common questions of law predominated. Importantly, the court did not reject Ford\u2019s contention that state law variations existed. Rather, the court found it unnecessary for purposes of class certification to decide <em>which </em>state law applied,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> maintaining that \u201c[t]o conclude that a court must look to the many States, with their varying judicial interpretations of what constitutes breach of implied warranty, would make it virtually impossible to apply the Act in multi-State class actions for Magnuson-Moss breach of implied warranty claims.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The court thus concluded that it could not deny class certification because of \u201cpotential\u201d state law variations, for to do so would, in effect, repeal a \u201ccongressionally-mandated Federal cause of action.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The court further concluded that potential state law variations did not bar certification of a <em>written </em>warranty class, because Magnuson-Moss \u201cexplicitly defines written warranty and establishes a cause of action for breach of said warranty.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-15\">Third, the court found that individual issues of causation did not bar certification of an \u201cimplied warranty incidents\u201d class. To overcome the existence of individual causation issues, the court opined, the ap-pellees could rely on class-wide technical and statistical proof demonstrating that Ford vehicles experienced an extremely high rate of park-to-reverse incidents and suffered from common defects in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>transmissions.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Combined with direct proof that intervening causes were unlikely, this evidence could establish a <em>\u201cprima facie </em>presumption\u201d that <em>each </em>park-to-reverse incident was attributable to Ford\u2019s defective transmission design.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Such a \u201crebuttable presumption,\u201d the court found, would be consistent with the remedial purposes of the Act.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> To require instead that the members of the proposed incidents class \u201cprove individually that the design defect was the cause in fact of a \u2018park-to-reverse incident\u2019 would surely preclude the use of class action procedures for breach of implied warranty under the Magnuson-Moss Act.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Finally, the court held that it could certify an \u201call-owners\u201d class without requiring the appellees to provide individual notice of the action to absentee class members. Relying principally on a passage from a House Committee Report, the court found that Congress had intended for <em>Eisen </em>not to apply to class actions brought under Magnuson-Moss.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> At the conclusion of its discussion of <em>Eisen, </em>the court characterized its decision with respect to individual notice, as well as with respect to the other class certification issues, as an attempt \u201cto effect [the Act\u2019s remedial] purposes by providing a reasonable interpretation of the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The court went on to find that the appellees\u2019 inability to provide individual notice would not deprive absentee class members of procedural due process, because the absentee class members were adequately represented, which is all that due process requires.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-15\">A. <em>The Interplay Between Rule 23 and Magnuson-Moss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-16\">We recognize that certain aspects of a district court\u2019s determinations under Rule 23 \u2014 such as whether common questions of fact or law predominate \u2014 are entitled to a measure of deference from an appellate court.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> However, it is unquestionably the role of an appellate court to ensure that class certification determinations are made pursuant to appropriate legal standards.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In the instant case, we find that the District Court\u2019s class certification rulings were made under an erroneous legal standard, and must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-17\">A consistent theme pervading the trial court\u2019s opinion is that the remedial purposes of Magnuson-Moss compelled it to bend the requirements of Rule 23 in order to facilitate the maintenance of a class action. Nothing in Magnuson-Moss, however, licenses a district court to manipulate Rule 23 in order to ensure the pursuit of a class action in federal court. Although the Act creates federal jurisdiction over class actions that meet specified jurisdictional requirements,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> it plainly does not <em>mandate </em>that district courts entertain such actions regardless of whether they are cognizable under Rule 23. Congress passed Magnu-son-Moss in part to create additional remedies for breach of warranty, and to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>for the <em>possibility </em>of class actions in federal court. Congress\u2019 primary purpose in enacting Magnuson-Moss, however, was to provide minimum disclosure and content standards particularly for written warranties, <em>not </em>to actively promote class actions in federal court.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">In short, the District Court was required to analyze the appellees\u2019 motion for class certification under traditional Rule 23 standards. We flatly reject the District Court\u2019s assessment that Rule 23 may be applied less stringently in Magnuson-Moss cases in order to effectuate the statute\u2019s remedial purposes.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are to be applied in all civil actions absent a <em>direct expression </em>of congressional intent to the contrary.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> As will be discussed more fully below, Magnuson-Moss contains no such direct expression. For this reason, and for the reasons that follow, we must remand this case to the District Court to determine what classes, if any, may be certified <em>under Rule 23.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">B. <em>Individual Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">The District Court\u2019s most conspicuous departure from Rule 23 standards was its decision to relieve the appellees of their obligation to provide individual notice to all members of the proposed \u201call-owners\u201d class. Rule 23(c)(2), as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Eisen, </em>requires that individual notice be sent to all class members whose names and addresses may be ascertained through reasonable effort.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The appellees did not contend before the District Court that they would be unable to identify the absentee class members through reasonable effort. Rather, they maintained that they would be financially unable to send the requisite notice. <em>Eisen, </em>however, explicitly held that individual notice is an absolute requirement of Rule 23(c)(2), not to be \u201ctailored to fit the pocketbooks of particular plaintiffs.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>cordingly, unless <em>Eisen </em>is somehow inapplicable to class actions brought under Mag-nuson-Moss, the District Court erred in relieving the proposed representatives of the \u201call-owners\u201d class of their obligation to provide individual notice to absentee class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">As noted above, the Supreme Court has held that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are to be applied in all civil actions absent a \u201cdirect expression\u201d of congressional intent to the contrary.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The statutory language of Magnuson-Moss contains no reference to Rule 23(c)(2) or to <em>Eisen, </em>much less a \u201cdirect expression\u201d that the requirement of individual notice is not to obtain in class actions brought under the Act. When Congress has meant to limit <em>Eisen </em>it has known precisely how to do so, as evidenced by its treatment of the notice requirement in the Deepwater Port Act of 1974. In that Act, Congress specified in the statute that when the size of the proposed class exceeded one thousand, Rule 23(c)(2) would be satisfied by notice in the <em>Federal Register </em>and in local newspapers.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Magnuson-Moss contains no comparable language evincing a congressional intent to modify Rule 23(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">The District Court, however, found the requisite \u201cdirect expression\u201d of congressional intent in the legislative history of Magnuson-Moss. The court relied principally on the following language contained in the Report of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-6\">The purpose of [the Act\u2019s] jurisdictional provisions is to avoid trivial or insignificant actions being brought as class actions in the federal courts. However, if the conditions of this section are met ... [s]ection 110(d) should be construed reasonably to authorize the maintenance of a class action____ [T]his section is remedial in nature and is designed to facilitate relief which would otherwise not be available as a practical matter for individual consumers. In particular, assuming that other requirements for a class action are met, your Committee does not believe that the requirement of individual notice to each potential class member should be invoked to preclude a class action where the identification and notification of the class members is not possible after reasonable effort by the plaintiff. <em>In considering whether identification and notification of all members of the class is possible with reasonable effort, the particular circumstances of the plaintiff or plaintiffs should be carefully evaluated by the court, including the question of whether the financial burden of such identification and notification would be likely to deny them </em>relief<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-14\">Although the House Committee Report did not mention <em>Eisen </em>by name,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> the trial court read the above language as an indication that Congress meant for <em>Eisen </em>not to apply in Magnuson-Moss class actions.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> As further support for this view, the trial court cited the floor statements of two House members, one of which explicitly mentioned <em>Eisen, </em>and both of which embraced the views expressed in the House Report.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Finally, the court noted that the Senate-House Conference Committee had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>adopted the class action provisions contained in the House bill,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> inferring from this that the Senate concurred in the views expressed in the House Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">There is a firm presumption that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in all civil actions; nothing in Magnuson-Moss itself indicates that Congress meant to vitiate or reduce the requirements of Rule 23. The legislative history appellees cite, even if it is properly proposed for our consideration,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> falls far short of a \u201cdirect expression\u201d that Congress intended to truncate the Rule or overrule <em>pro tanto </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Eisen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">The appellees would have us rely on that portion of the statute providing that \u201cthe representative capacity of the named plaintiffs shall be established in the application of rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> According to the appellees, the specific mention of Rule 23 in a particular context suggests a congressional intent to dispense with Rule 23 requirements in all other contexts. At a minimum, they argue, the explicit mention of Rule 23 creates an ambiguity concerning <em>which portions </em>of Rule 23 Congress meant to apply in Magnuson-Moss class actions.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">Although we recognize that some commentators have interpreted the Act in the manner urged upon us by appellees,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> we firmly reject the suggestion that Magnu-son-Moss was intended to preclude application of any Rule 23 requirements. Appel-lees\u2019 argument to the contrary is based on a tortured and, in our judgment, untenable reading of the Act. Before any action \u2014 including a class action \u2014 alleging breach of warranty under Magnuson-Moss may proceed, the plaintiffs must afford the defendant a reasonable opportunity to cure its alleged breach. Under section 110(e), however, a class action may proceed at an earlier time for the limited purpose of establishing the representative capacity of the named plaintiffs.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Section 110(e) further provides that this <em>initial </em>determination of representative capacity is to be made in accordance with Rule 23 standards. The obvious reason for the statutory reference to Rule 23, then, was to clarify that courts are to apply the same standards in making the Magnuson-Moss <em>initial </em>determination of representative capacity as would otherwise be applied in a typical Rule 23 proceeding. We refuse to believe that Congress, in clarifying that Rule 23 would apply to an initial determination of representative capacity, intended, <em>sub silentio, </em>to render the remainder of Rule 23 inapplicable.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-13\">To the extent that recourse to legislative history is appropriate, however, we again fail to discern any \u201cdirect expression\u201d of congressional intent to eliminate the individual notice requirement as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Eisen. </em>The most persuasive piece of legislative history cited by the appellees is the passage in the House Report in which a majority of Committee members opined that the requirement of individual notice should not be permitted to burden the maintenance of class actions under Magnuson-Moss. These views, however, apparently were penned prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Eisen, </em>as evidenced by the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>the majority conspicuously failed to mention <em>Eisen </em>by name.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> It seems most likely that the Committee, far from seeking to displace any Rule 23 requirement, was simply indicating what the legislators thought the Rule meant prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s definitive interpretation in <em>Eisen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Of greater significance is the fact that the House Committee\u2019s views on individual notice were never considered or adopted by the full Congress. As the District Court observed, the Senate-House conferees adopted the class action provisions contained in the House bill.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> However, neither the statutory language agreed upon in conference nor the Conference Committee Report<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> made any reference to Rule 23(c)(2) or Eisen.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> At most, then, the House Committee\u2019s desire to soften the individual notice requirement was shared only by members of the House, perhaps only by a majority of the House Committee. The matter was never pursued in the Senate, either by means of statutory amendment or in the Conference Committee Report. More important, <em>neither </em>body of Congress focused on the applicability of <em>Eisen </em>to class actions brought under Mag-nuson-Moss, much less expressed a definite intent that <em>Eisen </em>not apply.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>In short, there is nothing in the language of Magnuson-Moss to suggest that Congress meant to eliminate the individual notice requirement as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Eisen. </em>Nor can such an intent be inferred from those pieces of legislative history indicating some congressional discontent with the individual notice requirement. When Congress has intended to limit <em>Eisen, </em>it has done so expressly, as in the Deepwater Port Act of 1974. We therefore hold that the District Court erred in relieving the appellees of their obligation to adhere to Eisen\u2019s individual notice requirement with respect to any class <em>properly certifiable under Rule 23(b)(3). </em>It is to this latter <em>issue </em>\u2014 i.e., whether <em>any </em>class met the standards for certification established by Rule 23(b)(3) \u2014 that we now turn. In light of our holding that Rule 23(c)(2) applies to class actions brought under Mag-nuson-Moss, we need not reach the question whether individual notice is mandated by due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">C. <em>The Predominance Inquiry</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">As recounted in Part I.B., the District Court conditionally certified three classes, each pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Two of the certified classes involved implied warranty claims, one concerned written warranties. For each of the three conditionally certified classes, the District Court announced the requisite Rule 23(b)(3) \u201cfindpng] that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\u201d That essential finding, we conclude, is flawed and must be vacated so that the District Court can consider the matter anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-12\">Concerning the applicable law, the District Court correctly stated that under the terms of Magnuson-Moss,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> state law governs the existence and basic meaning of implied warranties.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> That court apparently believed, however, that the federal Act alone, uncomplicated by \u201cany State law variations,\u201d covered the class members\u2019 \u201cclaims for breach of written warranty.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> On the matter of class-wide proof crucial to all three certifications, the District Court determined that differences in the transmission systems at issue were not so mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>rial as to impede a threshold finding that common questions of fact predominated.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>The term \"implied warranty\u201d means an implied warranty arising under State law (as modified by sections 2308 and 2304(a) of this title) in connection with the sale by a supplier of a consumer product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>We hold, as the District Court appeared to recognize in a later chapter of this case,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> that, except in the specific instances in which Magnuson-Moss expressly prescribes a regulating rule, the Act calls for the application of state written and implied warranty law, not the creation of additional federal law. The District Court, in this clearer light, should reexamine whether \u201cvariations in State law prohibit a finding of predomination for common questions of law.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Furthermore, in view of the multiple transmission configurations swept into the certifications,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> we remand the \u201cclass-wide proof\u201d issue for closer inspection by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">The District Court initially demonstrated full appreciation of the inquiry a court must make to determine whether, as Rule 23(b)(3) requires, \u201cquestions of law or fact common to members of the [alleged] class predominate.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Thus, the trial judge identified as key to the commonality of law determination in this case \u201cthe impact of potentially varying State laws,\u201d and as critical to the commonality of fact determination \u201cthe availability of class-wide proof.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Her analysis veered off course, it appears, because she regarded Magnuson-Moss as an Act intended to facilitate nationwide class actions; she therefore thought it necessary to take a \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cless strict\u201d approach to Rule 23 certifications.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> We have already held that Rule 23 applies in Magnuson-Moss cases as it does in federal court cases generally. Had the trial judge felt no Act-prompted pressure to certify, she might not have resisted close analysis of state laws governing the existence, scope, and contours of implied warranties. Furthermore, she might not have assumed that federal law alone governed the alleged written warranty claims. Finally, she might not have proceeded so swiftly to the conclusion that differences in the transmission systems at issue \u201care either not material or can easily be [handled by establishing] subclasses pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4).\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-12\">1. <em>The Commonality of Law Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-13\">Magnuson-Moss, appellees urge, federalizes much of the law governing consumer product warranties; thus common questions of law, they assert, necessarily predominate in this case. Appellees\u2019 expansive reading of the Act is not anchored to its text, nor is it securely moored to the legislation\u2019s history. The Act, we harbor no doubt, has a far more limited mission. Congress sought only to supplement state warranty law by prescribing certain minimum standards for warrantors, and by affording consumers additional avenues for redress.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>The Act provides for civil actions by consumers in state courts or, if specified jurisdictional amount requirements are met (each individual claim, at least $25; all claims in suit, at least $50,000), in federal district courts; courts may award prevailing plaintiffs in such actions costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The action Magnuson-Moss authorizes may be instituted for recovery from \u201ca supplier, war-rantor, or service contractor\u201d who has failed \u201cto comply with any obligation under this chapter, <em>or </em>under a written warranty, implied warranty, or service contract.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Had Congress intended Magnuson-Moss to substitute federal for state law as the dominant regulator of consumer product warranties under the Act, the alternative references just quoted would be anomalous. An \u201cobligation under this chapter\u201d derives, of course, from the federal Act. The further, separate reference to obligations under written and implied warranties strongly suggests that Congress contemplated the coexistence of another source of regulating rules in the actions authorized by section 110(d), a source outside the federal Act, <em>i.e., </em>state law.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">Tellingly, the $50,000 amount-in-controversy threshold for federal court jurisdiction stated in section 110(d)(3) confines the mine-run of Magnuson-Moss consumer civil actions to state courts.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> A responsible Congress would not, without offering rhyme or reason, place the laboring oar in developing a corpus of federal consumer product warranty law in the hands of over fifty diverse, non-federal court systems.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">We state further below why we think it beyond genuine dispute that, as to both implied and written warranties, Congress intended the application of state law, except as expressly modified by Magnuson-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>Moss, in section 110(d) breach of warranty-actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">a. <em>Implied Warranty. </em>The Act, in section 101(7) (set out note 62 supra), defines \u201cimplied warranty\u201d by explicit reference to state law as modified by federal standards detailed in sections 108 and 104(a).<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> There is nothing obscure about the interplay Congress ordered: state law creates the warranty<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> and also governs its dimensions, except as otherwise prescribed with particularity in Magnuson-Moss itself. The Federal prescriptions apply as written; where the Act states no prescription, state law continues in force.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>b. <em>Written Warranty. </em>The Act, in section 101(6), sets out a self-contained definition of \u201cwritten warranty\u201d; in contrast to the subsection defining \u201cimplied warranty\u201d (section 101(7), set out note 62 supra), the written warranty definition does not refer to state law.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> An argument that Magnu-son-Moss federalizes written warranty law therefore has surface plausibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">One need not search far, however, to comprehend why the Act presents its own definition of written warranty. State law distinguishes \u201cexpress\u201d warranties from \u201cimplied\u201d ones. \u201cExpress warranty\u201d is defined in state law; the term encompasses both written and oral undertakings.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Congress ultimately decided that oral warranties need not be covered in the federal legislation unless and until they become \u201cmore prevalent.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Because the state law term \u201cexpress warranty\u201d did not suit the limited federal purpose, Congress supplied a definition \u2014 one confined to \u201cwritten warranty\u201d \u2014 that did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-16\">But Congress indicated that, as in the case of implied warranties, state law would guide the determination whether a written warranty had been created. Magnuson-Moss, in section 101(6), defines \u201cwritten warranty\u201d as \u201cany written affirmation of fact or written promise made in connection with the sale of a consumer product____\u201d The Conference Report to S. 356, the bill that became the Act, explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>The conferees intend that, if under State law a warrantor or other person is deemed to have made a written affirmation of fact, promise, or undertaking he would be treated for purposes of [the Act\u2019s consumer remedies section, section 110] as having made such affirmation of fact, promise, or undertaking.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApA\">Here too, if Congress intended displacement of state law beyond the Act\u2019s explicit prescriptions, one would expect to find a clear statement to that effect.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Particularly in an area traditionally in the state's domain, such as sales law, the likelihood is that the national legislature, when it intervenes, and does not say otherwise, opts for the little rather than the much. We have no reason to believe Congress departed from that general pattern in this particular instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">Having determined that state warranty law lies at the base of all warranty claims under Magnuson-Moss, we next state our reasons for instructing the District Court to reconsider the finding that common legal questions predominate in each class certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">c. <em>The District Court Finding. </em>The District Court recognized the controlling role of state law on two issues. First, the trial judge looked to the law of the state of purchase to exclude from class certification purchasers from states in which vertical privity between manufacturer and purchaser is necessary to give rise to an implied warranty.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Later, the trial judge held that state law determined the availability of punitive damages; on that account, the judge refused to certify a punitive damages class.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The District Court declined, however, to inquire further into the existence and character of differences in state warranty laws. Regarding the written warranty claims, the judge apparently believed all relevant law was federal. As to the implied warranty claims, she explained: \u201cTo conclude that a court must look to the many States, with their varying judicial interpretations of what constitutes breach of implied warranty, would make it virtually impossible to apply the Act in multi-State class actions for Magnuson-Moss breach of implied warranty claims.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> While refusing to consider the application of \u201cvarying State laws for breach of implied warranty,\u201d the trial judge deferred for consideration on another day \u201cthe question of which law shall apply.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-13\">Appellees see the \u201cwhich law\u201d matter as academic. They say no variations in state warranty laws relevant to this case exist.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> A court cannot accept such an assertion \u201con faith.\u201d Appellees, as class action proponents, must show that it is accurate.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> We have made no inquiry of our own on this score and, for the current purpose, simply note the general, unstartling statement made in a leading treatise: \u201cThe Uniform Commercial Code is not uniform.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>The governance of state law does not inevitably mean that \u201cno multi-State class action for breach of implied [or written] warranty under the Act could ever be possible.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> A considered predomination determination by the District Court, however, must be made.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> As the Third Circuit observed in <em>In re Asbestos School Litigat</em>ion,,<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> to establish commonality of the applicable law, nationwide class action movants must creditably demonstrate, through an \u201cextensive analysis\u201d of state law variances, \u201cthat class certification does not present insuperable obstacles.\u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> As appellees themselves at one point accurately observed: \u201cThe issue can only be resolved by first specifically identifying the applicable state law variations and then determining whether such variations can be effectively managed through creation of a small number of subclasses grouping the states that have similar legal doctrines.\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Citing decisions of sister courts, appel-lees urge that nationwide class actions may be maintained even when state law variations are marked. The decisions cited, however, invariably involved lawsuits in which \u201cthe evidence in each case [on major factual questions] was either identical or virtually so.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> These cases would be relevant, therefore, only if appellees proffered strong indications that major factual issues in each class member\u2019s claim in this lawsuit are \u201cidentical or virtually so.\u201d We thus reach the commonality of fact issue this case presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">2. <em>The Commonality of Fact Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">The trial judge expressed concern \u201cwhether there are material differences between the four transmissions at issue which would prevent the presentation of class-wide proof.\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> She observed, however, that if material differences became apparent, she could, at a later stage, \u201cseparate each transmission type into a subclass.\u201d <footnotemark>101</footnotemark> She did not home in on Ford\u2019s argument, backed by the affidavits of experts,<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> that the class certifications at issue in fact encompassed at least twenty materially different transmission control systems.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">Appellees have not identified in support of the alleged breach of warranty claims, and we have not found in the record, any indications of evidence <em>common to all the transmission configurations </em>swept into the class definition. Class action proponents may not be called upon to prove their case in order to obtain certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>cation.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> However, appellees must tender some creditable basis for claiming that \u201cdifferences in design among [Ford\u2019s approximately 20] systems are minor and immaterial.\u201d <footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">On appeal, appellees offered a definite statement regarding fact commonality. Ford\u2019s transmission system design variations \u201ctend to cancel each other out,\u201d ap-pellees assert, so that \u201cthe designs all remain in the same defect class.\u201d <footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Standing alone, this assertion is Delphic, but appellees immediately explain: \u201call of [Ford\u2019s] design variations are minor in relation to the overriding common defect of lack of automatic self-centering.\u201d <footnotemark>107</footnotemark> This defect, appellees maintain, is common to every Ford transmission system at issue. It is the defect, appellees say, that permits cars to \u201cjump into reverse.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">Because appellees now assign prime place to the alleged common defect called \u201clack of automatic self-centering,\u201d we inspect that ground for claiming a predominating common question of fact. A transmission suffers from \u201clack of automatic self-centering,\u201d appellees state, if it will not immediately adjust itself into a gear when the driver leaves the control lever in a position between gears. Appellees\u2019 expert, Simon Tamny, has sworn that this alleged defect is due primarily to a rounded or flat, rather than sharp, tooth between the reverse and park positions on the transmission \u201croostercomb.\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> The evidence appears beyond dispute, however, that the roostercombs of numerous other automobiles (including most, if not all, cars of Ford\u2019s domestic competitors and many foreign luxury automobiles) were at least as dull as the Ford roostercombs.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">Thus, Ford\u2019s unsharp roostercombs cannot carry the day for appellees. If Ford transmissions engaged in park-to-reverse more frequently than other automobile transmissions, then something in addition to the roostercomb tooth contour must have brought about the defect. That something else has not been identified as common to all Ford transmission configurations at issue. So far as we can tell from the current record, the unsharp rooster-comb theory still leaves the appellees with the need to show that each configuration had special characteristics which, singularly or in combination, caused lack of automatic self-centering. Before reaching a common fact predominance determination under Rule 23(b)(3), the District Court should have inquired further in order to estimate how varied (configuration-specific) the transmission design defect proof would likely be.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-13\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-14\">In finding that individual notice to each potential class member was unnecessary, and that common questions of law or fact predominated, the District Court was swayed by the view, which we have found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>incorrect, that Congress sought to facilitate nationwide class actions under Magnuson-Moss, and therefore expected an indulgent approach by judges to Rule 23(b)(3) certifications.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> Having clarified that Rule 23 applies in Magnuson-Moss cases as it does in federal litigation generally, <em>i.e., </em>sensibly but without special dispensations, we return the case to the District Court with no prejudgment as to the outcome of a renewed predominance inquiry.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">For further proceedings consistent herewith, the decision of the District Court certifying classes in this litigation is</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1063-19\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301-2312 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">. The decision whether to grant an interlocutory appeal from an <em>order </em>of a district court under \u00a7 1292(b) is within the discretion of the court of appeals. Before the court of appeals may exercise that discretion, however, the district court must certify that the order involves \"a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,\" and that an immediate appeal \u201cmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" In the instant case, the District Court certified as \"controlling\" only one of the legal issues that we deem it necessary to address on appeal. <em>See </em>Memorandum Opinion, <em>reprinted in </em>Record Excerpts (\u201cR.E.\u201d) Tab 8 (certifying the question whether class representatives in class actions brought under Magnuson-Moss are required to send individual notice to all class members whose names and addresses may be ascertained through reasonable effort). Section 1292(b) explicitly provides, however, that the appeal is from an <em>order </em>of the district court, not from the particular question that the district court found controlling. We are therefore called upon to decide an appeal, not a single question of law. Accordingly, we must decide <em>all </em>questions of law necessary to the proper disposition of this appeal. <em>See, e.g., Nuclear Eng\u2019g Co. v. Scott, </em>660 F.2d 241, 246 (7th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 993, 102 S.Ct. 1622, 71 L.Ed.2d 855 (1982); <em>Johnson v.

In 1977, in response to similar complaints of park-to-reverse incidents involving Ford automobiles, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") initiated an investigation to determine whether Ford transmissions were defective. That investigation culminated in a settlement in which Ford agreed to send warning labels to Ford owners instructing them to place their transmissions securely in \u201cpark,\u201d turn off the engine and set the parking brake before leaving their car. <em>See Center for Auto Safety, Inc. v.

We assign no value to the statements of Representatives Vanik and Badillo, who were neither sponsors of the bill nor members of the committee which reviewed the legislation.

From the context of Representative Moss\u2019 remarks, however, it is clear that he was not referring to Rule 23 or the individual notice requirement. Under the Senate bill, a breach of warranty claim could only be brought in federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 151, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 38 (1973). At that time, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>been interpreted to require each member of a proposed class to assert a claim in excess of $10,000. <em>See Zahn </em>v. <em>International Paper Co., </em>414 U.S. 291, 94 S.Ct. 505, 38 L.Ed.2d 511 (1973).

In describing this compromise, Representative Moss could only have been referring to the elimination of this barrier to federal court jurisdiction.

Thus, the relative ratchet and detent spring forces in the C-4 that tend to return the manual valve to reverse rather than holding it in park is counterbalanced by the greater shift effort required to place the C-6 in park, since the C-6 lacks the C-4's additional deficiency. The single rod linkage is more sensitive to engine vibration, but the cable rod is more sensitive to friction. In short, because these design variations tend to cancel each other out, the designs all remain in the same defect class.
