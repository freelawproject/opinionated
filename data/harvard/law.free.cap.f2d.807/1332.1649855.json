Section 544(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(a)(3) (1984), allows a bankruptcy trustee to avoid such an encumbrance when it would be voidable by a bona fide purchaser. The debtor-in-possession and the intervenor argue that the mortgage at issue does not give notice to a bona fide purchaser, and therefore the plaintiff-ap-pellee may avoid it under \u00a7 544(a)(3). The defendant-appellant responds that avoidance is precluded by the debtor-in-possession\u2019s actual knowledge of the mortgage; and that in any case the mortgage provides constructive notice to a bona fide purchaser. We reject the appellant\u2019s actual notice argument and certify the question of constructive notice to the Indiana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-11\">Sandy Ridge Oil Company, Inc. (\u201cSandy Ridge\u201d) purchased oil well services from Halliburton Services (\u201cHalliburton\u201d) for a number of years, but fell slowly into debt. On October 10, 1981, Sandy Ridge executed a promissory note in favor of Halliburton in the amount of $244,686.31 (excluding interest). To secure this note, Sandy Ridge mortgaged its oil and gas leases on six oil wells: four wells in Gibson County, Indiana, one well in Vanderburgh County, Indiana, and one well in Wabash County, Illinois. The executed mortgage was delivered in three identical counterparts and recorded with the Vanderburgh County Recorder, the Wabash County Recorder, and the Gibson County Recorder. Only the Gibson County mortgage is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-15\">On May 13, 1982, Sandy Ridge filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As part of the Chapter 11 proceeding, Sandy Ridge filed an adversary proceeding against the Centerre Bank National Association, Halliburton, and thirteen other defendants. In that adversary proceeding Sandy Ridge contested the validity of various liens and encumbrances on the oil properties it owned or operated, and sought approval for sale of these properties free and clear of any such encumbrances. The Official Unsecured Creditors Committee (\u201cCreditors Committee\u201d) intervened in the adversary proceeding to contest the Gibson County mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-16\">The Gibson County mortgage, though otherwise valid, was recorded in contravention of an Indiana statute requiring the name of the person who prepared the instrument to be indicated in the document.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sandy Ridge argues that because the Gibson County mortgage was improperly recorded, it is voidable by a bona fide purchaser; therefore, Sandy Ridge\u2019s interest in the oil wells is paramount to Halliburton\u2019s. The bankruptcy court ruled in favor of Sandy Ridge, and the district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-18\">We find first that we have jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) (1984). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>This court may exercise jurisdiction over a bankruptcy appeal only when both the bankruptcy court\u2019s and the district court\u2019s decisions are \u201cfinal\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 158(d). <em>Matter of Morse Elec. Co., Inc. (Appeal of Hoosier Fence Co., Inc.), </em>805 F.2d 262, 264 (7th Cir.1986); <em>Matter of Cash Currency Exchange, </em>762 F.2d 542, 546 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Fryzel v. Cash Currency Exchange, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 233, 88 L.Ed.2d 232 (1985). The definition of \u201cfinality,\u201d however, is more flexible in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding than under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Matter of Morse Elec. Co., </em>805 F.2d at 264; <em>Matter of Riggsby, </em>745 F.2d 1153, 1154 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">A bankruptcy order will be considered final for \u00a7 158(d) purposes when it \u201cfinally determines\u201d one creditor\u2019s position. <em>Matter of Morse Elec. Co., </em>805 F.2d at 264. This is so even when there is continuing action in the bankruptcy court adversary proceeding. <em>Id. </em>In this case, Halliburton\u2019s position as to the Gibson County mortgage was \u201cfinally determined\u201d by the bankruptcy court because that court held that Sandy Ridge could avoid the mortgage. The bankruptcy court\u2019s order, and the district court\u2019s affirmance, are therefore final within the meaning of \u00a7 158(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-8\">Section 1107(a) of the Bankruptcy Code gives a chapter 11 debtor-in-possession all the rights of a trustee, other than the right to compensation, and all the duties of a trustee, other than the investigatory duties. Section 544(a)(3), the \u201cstrong arm clause,\u201d permits a trustee to avoid any transfer of property of the debtor, or obligation incurred by the debtor, that would be voidable by a bona fide purchaser of the property. Sandy Ridge seeks to use these sections of the Code to avoid the improperly recorded Gibson County mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-12\">Halliburton, however, argues that Sandy Ridge is bound by the Gibson County mortgage, both because it had actual knowledge of the mortgage and because a bona fide purchaser would have constructive notice of the mortgage. The first argument requires us to interpret the Bankruptcy Code; the second argument requires us to interpret Indiana law. We consider Halliburton\u2019s \u201cactual knowledge\u201d argument first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-14\">Halliburton argues that Sandy Ridge may not avoid the Gibson County mortgage under \u00a7 544(a)(3), because Sandy Ridge had actual knowledge of that mortgage. In support of this argument, Halliburton relies on <em>In re Hartman Paving, Inc., </em>745 F.2d 307 (4th Cir.1984). In <em>Hartman Paving </em>the Fourth Circuit looked to state law to determine whether a debtor-in-possession with actual notice of a deed of trust should be allowed to avoid that instrument under \u00a7 544(a). The court con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>eluded that because the West Virginia law of deeds of trust was not designed to protect a subsequent purchaser with actual knowledge of the transaction, the debtor-in-possession could not assert \u00a7 544(a). <em>Hartman Paving, </em>745 F.2d at 310. Under the <em>Hartman Paving </em>analysis, therefore, this court would determine whether Indiana law was intended to protect parties to a mortgage with actual notice. If not\u2014 and the answer is presumably no \u2014 then Sandy Ridge would not be permitted to rely on \u00a7 544(a)(3). The district court in this case considered the rule of <em>Hartman Paving, </em>but declined to follow it, noting that its reasoning appeared to conflict with the Bankruptcy Code. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">The rights enforced in bankruptcy are rights created by state law. <em>Matter of Kaiser, </em>791 F.2d 73, 74 (7th Cir.1986). Accordingly, the courts generally look to state law to determine whether property is an asset of a debtor. <em>In re Brass Kettle Restaurant, Inc., </em>790 F.2d 574, 575 (7th Cir.1986); <em>see also In re K &amp; L Limited, </em>741 F.2d 1023, 1030 n. 7 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Matter of Gladstone Glen, </em>628 F.2d 1015, 1018 (7th Cir.1980). Here, however, Congress has required that we do otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-8\">Section 544(a) states that a trustee \u201cshall\u201d be able to avoid an encumbrance that would be voidable by a bona fide purchaser \u201cwithout regard to any knowledge of the trustee or of any creditor.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The natural interpretation of this language is that actual knowledge of the encumbrance will never prohibit a trustee from invoking \u00a7 544(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-14\">The Third Circuit\u2019s analysis of the legislative history of \u00a7 544(a) in <em>McCannon v. Marston, </em>679 F.2d 13 (3d Cir.1982), supports the view that Congress meant what it said. In <em>McCannon, </em>the issue before the court was whether the \u201cactual knowledge\u201d clause in \u00a7 544(a) gave a trustee the powers of a bona fide purchaser, regardless of the trustee\u2019s actual knowledge and regardless of any constructive notice that otherwise would be imputed to a subsequent purchaser. The <em>McCannon </em>court noted that the legislative history of \u00a7 544(a) itself was sparse, and therefore turned its attention to a 1973 draft bankruptcy code that contained a similar provision. The language of this provision was very close to the language eventually adopted by Congress as \u00a7 544(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commission on Bankruptcy Laws of the United States explained that this 1973 draft language was \u201cdesigned to make clear that the trustee\u2019s status under the subdivision is purely hypothetical and unaffected by any knowledge which he, personally, or any or all creditors may have.\u201d Report of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.R. Doc. No. 93-137, Part II, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess. 161, n. 3; <em>see McCannon, </em>679 F.2d at 16. The <em>McCannon </em>court concluded that under \u00a7 544(a), actual knowledge was irrelevant regardless of the state law of actual notice. <em>See McCannon </em>at 16-17.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>This evidence of intent, although not conclusive, supports the inference that Congress intended actual knowledge of a transfer of property or encumbrance on property to be irrelevant, regardless of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">Despite the plain language of the statute and some evidence of congressional intent, however, Halliburton argues that this court should follow <em>Hartman Paving </em>and look to state law and policy to decide when a trustee or debtor-in-possession with actual knowledge of a transaction may invoke \u00a7 544(a). This approach is faulty for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">First, the <em>Hartman Paving </em>approach ignores a distinction Congress makes between \u00a7 544(a) and \u00a7 544(a)(3). The phrase \u201cbona fide purchaser\u201d in \u00a7 544(a)(3) is qualified by the words \u201cagainst whom applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected.\u201d This language has been interpreted to mean that the state law of constructive notice remains applicable in the context of \u00a7 544(a)(3). <em>See McCannon, </em>679 F.2d at 17. But the \u201cwithout regard to any knowledge\u201d clause in \u00a7 544(a) is not qualified in any way. In the absence of any reason to believe that this lack of qualification is a drafting error, we must assume that this distinction makes a difference and that state law is not relevant to \u00a7 544(a). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1398-6\">Second, the <em>Hartman Paving </em>approach conflicts with our duty to give meaning to all the language of a statute. <em>See, e.g., Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 2331, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979); <em>Scott v. Anderson Newspapers, Inc., </em>477 N.E.2d 553, 563 (Ind.App.1985). It is hornbook law that property law does not generally protect a bona fide purchaser with actual knowledge of a transfer of or encumbrance on property. <em>See, e.g., </em>8 G. Thompson, <em>Commentaries on the Modern Law of Real Property </em>\u00a7 4325 at 431-42, 434 (J. Grimes repl. ed. 1963) (as a general rule, a purchaser is bound by knowledge of previous conveyances, whether of record or not; mortagee with actual knowledge takes subject thereto and is not protected as a bona fide purchaser.). Hence, if we adopted Halliburton\u2019s suggested .approach, the \u201cactual knowledge\u201d clause of \u00a7 544(a) would be a dead letter for all practical purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-10\">Finally, as the district court in this case noted, the <em>Hartman Paving </em>analysis creates a distinction in the Bankruptcy Code between a trustee (who will rarely have actual knowledge) and a debtor-in-possession (who will often have actual knowledge). This result is in conflict with section 1107(a), which gives the debtor-in-possession all the rights and duties of a trustee. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107(a). <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 95-989, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 117, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 5787, 5903 (\u201cThis section places a debtor in possession in the shoes of a trustee in every way.\u201d); <em>accord, </em>H.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 404, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 5963, 6360.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-11\">We conclude that Congress did not intend Sandy Ridge\u2019s knowledge of the mortgage to prevent it from asserting the strong arm clause, because actual knowledge is irrelevant under \u00a7 544(a). <em>See McCannon v. Marston, </em>679 F.2d at 16-17; <em>see also In re Bygaph, Inc., </em>56 B.R. 596, 603 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1986); <em>In re Ernest &amp; Assoc., Inc., </em>59 B.R. 495, 497-98 (Bankr.W. D.Tex.1985); <em>In re Matos, </em>50 B.R. 742, 744-45 (Bankr.N.D.Ala.1985); <em>In re Hartman Paving, </em>745 F.2d at 311 (Winter, C.J., dissenting). We therefore decline to adopt the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule in <em>Hartman Paving </em>as the law in the Seventh Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-13\">Halliburton places greater emphasis on its constructive notice argument. Halliburton argues that even though the mortgage on the six oil wells was recorded in contravention of a state statute, a bona fide purchaser should nevertheless be deemed bound by the mortgage. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>bankruptcy court rejected this argument, and the district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">Indiana law provides that a mortgage may be received for recordation only if the name of the person who prepared the instrument is indicated at the end of the document. Ind.Code \u00a7 36-2-ll-15(b) (1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the Gibson County mortgage does not so disclose the preparer. We must therefore decide whether, under Indiana law, a mortgage recorded in contravention of this statute is nevertheless deemed to provide constructive notice to a bona fide purchaser. If so, then Halliburton\u2019s claim is paramount. If not, then Sandy Ridge may exercise \u00a7 544(a)(3) and avoid the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-6\">The bankruptcy court and the district court based their decisions in favor of Sandy Ridge on this issue on the only reported decision involving this statute, <em>United States v. Lake County Farm Bureau Co-op Ass\u2019n, </em>205 F.Supp. 808 (N.D.Ind. 1962). In that case, which concerned a chattel mortgage on crops, the court held that the filing of the mortgage in violation of the statute was a nullity and therefore the mortgage, although recorded, gave no constructive notice to the defendant creditor. 205 F.Supp. at 810. In its brief, the Creditors Committee buttresses <em>Lake County </em>with a number of Indiana cases involving other recordation statutes. According to the Creditors Committee, these cases stand for the proposition that in Indiana the recordation of an instrument not entitled to be recorded does not operate as constructive notice. The Creditors Committee argues that the present case simply represents the application of this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-7\">Halliburton presents several answers to this argument. First, Halliburton seeks to minimize the importance of <em>Lake County </em>by pointing out that there the preparer was not disclosed in any way. Here, in contrast, the Gibson County mortgage bore a stamp block containing the initials of persons in the legal and financial departments of Halliburton. Second, Halliburton distinguishes the statute at issue here from the recordation statutes involved in the cases the Creditors Committee cites by arguing that subsection (b) of the Indiana preparer statute is a mere technical requirement. Many of the Creditors Committee cases concern instruments lacking acknowledge-ments, which have evidentiary value and go directly to the validity of the mortgage. But the name of the preparer of an instrument, Halliburton argues, has no evidentia-ry value and has nothing to do with the validity of the mortgage; therefore, a mortgage lacking the preparer\u2019s name is not void.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-11\">Third, Halliburton argues that the statute\u2019s purpose must be to communicate a requirement to county recorders and not to punish the makers of an instrument. Halliburton points to other provisions of the Indiana Code that contain technical requirements, such as Ind.Code \u00a7 36-2-11-14 (to be recorded, deeds must be stamped by the auditor with the language \u201cduly entered for taxation\u201d or \u201cnot taxable\u201d), and Ind. Code \u00a7 33-16-2-9 (notary must indicate county of residence on every notarization after July 1, 1982). Halliburton argues that under the Creditors Committee\u2019s reasoning, every clerical error resulting in a violation of one of these statutes will invalidate the instrument, and the status of real estate titles in Indiana will accordingly become uncertain. The better view, says Halliburton, is that these statutes provide instructions to clerical personnel, but have no effect on the validity of an instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-12\">Finally, and most persuasively, Halliburton argues that the real purpose of the statute is to discourage the unauthorized practice of law. Halliburton points to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>Ohio statute with almost identical language, Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 317.111 (Page 1979).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that this statute was intended only to discourage the unauthorized practice of law, and that therefore a mechanic\u2019s lien recorded in contravention of the statute was not rendered invalid. <em>Bown &amp; Sons v. Honabarger, </em>171 Ohio St. 247, 168 N.E.2d 880, 883 (1960). If this last argument is correct, the statute has nothing at all to do with the integrity or enforceability of the instrument or with constructive notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">Rule 15(0) of the Indiana Rules of Appellate Procedure allows certification of a question of Indiana law to the Indiana Supreme Court when the question is determinative of the case and there is no clear controlling Indiana Supreme Court precedent. Our research has failed to reveal controlling precedent by any Indiana court on the question of whether an instrument disposing of an interest in or lien on property recorded in violation of Ind.Code \u00a7 36-2-ll-15(b) gives constructive notice of recoi'dation to a bona fide purchaser. Accordingly, as provided for by Rule 15(0) of the Indiana Rules of Appellate Procedure, this court respectfully requests the Supreme Court of Indiana to provide this court with instructions concerning the following question of law which will be determinative in this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-10\">Does a recorded instrument conveying, creating, encumbering, assigning, or otherwise disposing of an interest in or lien on property that does not disclose the name of the preparer as required by Ind. Code \u00a7 36-2-ll-15(b) nevertheless impart constructive notice to a bona fide purchaser?</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-11\">The clerk of this court will transmit to the Supreme Court of Indiana a certified copy of this order; a copy of the briefs and appendices submitted to this court; and, if necessary, the record in this matter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-12\">\n<em>Question Certified.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1395-12\">. The Vanderburgh County mortgage bears the statement, \"This instrument prepared by\" stamped above the signature of Mr. R.L. Campbell, who signed the document on behalf of Halliburton, and therefore is not in question. The Wabash County mortgage is not in question because under Illinois law the omission of a preparer statement does not affect the enforceability of the instrument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1396-9\">. The parties in this case offer several grounds for jurisdiction. Halliburton procured an order from the bankruptcy court dated August 26, 1986, in which that court found that all other issues and claims in the adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court had been resolved by previous order or judgment. The order also dismissed for lack of prosecution any unresolved issues and claims that might remain through inadvertence. <em>In re Sandy Ridge Oil Co., Inc., </em>No. 82-884-EV RA (Bankr.S.D.Ind. August 26, 1986). This order, although not necessary to our holding, supports our finding of jurisdiction under \u00a7 158(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-10\">In addition, upon request of the parties, the district court\u2019s order of February 14, 1986 complied with Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and directed that the bankrupt-ey order be modified also to comply. Rule 54(b) allows a court to enter final judgment as to only some of the claims or parties in a multiple claim or multiple party case, if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay. A Rule 54(b) order, however, is not necessary in bankruptcy cases. <em>Matter of Morse Elec. Co., </em>805 F.2d at 265. We need not consider the propriety of the Rule 54(b) order in this case because of our independent determination that the orders below are final.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-15\">Finally, the parties state in their briefs that we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 as well as \u00a7 158(d). We have remarked, however, that, as a rule, \u00a7 1291 is the \"wrong statute\u201d in bankruptcy cases. <em>Matter of Morse Elec.

An instrument is in compliance with this section if it contains a statement in the following form: \"This instrument was prepared by (name).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1400-7\">Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 317.111 (Page 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1400-8\">. In finding the issue of constructive notice to be determinative of this case, we necessarily reject Halliburton\u2019s argument that the mortgage falls within the exemption to the statute for instruments executed or acknowledged outside the State of Indiana, Ind.Code \u00a7 36-2-11-15(a)(4). Halliburton cites <em>Rawleigh Co. v. Snider, </em>207 Ind. 686, 194 N.E. 356 (1935), and <em>Bowen v. Woodfield, </em>33 Ind.App. 687, 72 N.E. 162 (1904), for the proposition that, in Indiana, \"execution\u201d of an instrument involves signature, delivery and acceptance. The Gibson County mortgage was signed, acknowledged, and delivered in Indiana, but Halliburton argues that the mortgage was not accepted until the instrument was returned to Halliburton\u2019s office in Oklahoma for final review and for signature of the financing statement. We agree with the district court that the mortgage was executed in Indiana for the purpose of Ind.Code \u00a7 36-2-1 l-15(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-15\">Unless there is reason to do otherwise, the words of a statute are to be given their common meaning. <em>E.g., Herbert v. State, </em>484 N.E.2d 68, 70 (Ind.App. 1985); <em>Charles W. Smith &amp; Sons Excavating, Inc. v. Lichtefeld-Massaro, Inc., </em>477 N.E.2d 308, 309 (Ind.Ct.App.1985); <em>Central States Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Bellmont Trucking Co., </em>610 F.Supp. 1505, 1510 (N.D.Ind.1985), <em>aff'd, </em>788 F.2d 428 (7th Cir.1986). The word \"executed\u201d is commonly used to describe an instrument that has been properly signed and delivered. <em>See </em>Ind. Code \u00a7 34-1-16-4 (for evidentiary purposes, \u201c[tjhe execution of an instrument is the subscribing and delivering it.\"); Ind.R. Trial Proc. 9.2 (for pleading purposes, execution of a written instrument includes proper signature and delivery). Because the Gibson County mortgage was signed, delivered, and acknowledged in Indiana, we hold that it was executed in Indiana within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
