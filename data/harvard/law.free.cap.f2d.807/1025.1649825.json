(\u201cIowa Interstate\u201d), from prior approval under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10901 and 11301. Iowa Interstate, a new carrier, sought expeditiously to commence permanent rail service over the abandoned Rock Island lines in Iowa and Illinois. The Trustee of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company (\u201cMilwaukee Trustee\u201d or \u201cpetitioner\u201d) and the Iowa Railroad Company (\u201cIRC\u201d or \u201cpetitioner\u201d) seek review of two proceedings before the ICC. Petitioners challenge as arbitrary and capricious the Commission\u2019s order granting an exemption from regulation allowing Iowa Inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>state to operate over a line of the former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Company (\u201cRock Island\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">The first challenged order granted temporary exemptions from regulation, thus allowing various rail carriers to continue previously authorized operations over portions of the Rock Island\u2019s abandoned rail system. Decision, F.D. No. 30489. The second proceeding, involved in this appeal, Finance Docket No. 30554, was initiated when Iowa Interstate, an intervenor in this appeal, sought a permanent exemption from the normal Commission procedure for its proposal to conduct rail operations on the Council Bluffs to Blue Island line. The petition was granted, effective immediately, in an order served October 1, 1984. Decision, F.D. No. 30554.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">Petitioners also challenge the Commission\u2019s decision not to provide a short transition period before the new carrier was allowed to operate the line exclusively. In-tervenor United Transportation Union (\u201cUTU\u201d) contends that the ICC should have provided labor-protective conditions, as mandated by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11343 and 11347. For the reasons articulated below, we affirm the Commission\u2019s orders in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">Among the many railroads to succumb to financial difficulties in the 1970s was the Rock Island, which operated a trunk line through the grain belt from Omaha through Iowa and on to Chicago.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1975, the Rock Island filed for reorganization under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 205 (1975), and in 1979 ceased operation, following a crippling strike. The Commission designated carriers to provide service over the line in place of Rock Island, pursuant to the directed service provisions of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11125 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">Just as the directed service orders were about to expire, Congress enacted the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act, Pub.L. No. 96-254, 94 Stat. 399, 409 (1980) [hereinafter cited as \u201cRI-TEA\u201d]. RITEA was to insure continued service \u201cuntil such time as the transfers of portions of the Rock Island lines could be consummated.\u201d S.Rep. No. 614, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (Mar. 4, 1980). Pursuant to section 122 of that Act, the ICC authorized several carriers to operate over the abandoned Rock Island lines pending reorganization. IRC, which commenced service over much of the 552-mile Council Bluffs-Blue Island line, and Milwaukee Trustee, which operated a 54-mile segment of the same line, were among those carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-13\">The Rock Island was reorganized into the Chicago Pacific Corporation (\u201cCPAC\u201d) on June 1, 1984. Decision, F.D. No. 30489, at 1. CP AC assumed ownership of all Rock Island lines not yet sold, including the Council Bluffs-Blue Island line. <em>See </em>Iowa Interstate Petition at 3 (Aug. 25, 1984) [hereinafter cited as \u201cPetition\u201d]. Because the Commission\u2019s authority under RITEA expired at the conclusion of the Rock Island reorganization, the Commission initiated Finance Docket No. 30489 in May of 1984, for the purpose of granting temporary exemptions from regulation to permit the carriers operating on the Rock Island\u2019s system to continue their operation. Such exemptions were granted in a decision served May 31, 1984. Decision, F.D. No. 30489, at 2. IRC and Milwaukee Trustee continued to operate under a temporary exemption pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10505. According to the Commission\u2019s order, these operating rights were scheduled to terminate when \u201cCPC [sic] disposed of the property.\u201d Decision, F.D. No. 30489, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-15\">To ensure the continuation of future rail service in the vital east-west Rock Island corridor, local Iowa shippers banded together to form the Heartland Rail Corporation (\u201cHeartland\u201d), and determined to purchase the line themselves. Petition at 4-5. On July 20,1984, Heartland entered into an agreement with CP AC for the purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>and sale of the Council Bluffs to Blue Island line. On the same date, Iowa Interstate entered into a long-term lease of the line with Heartland, to become effective upon the closing of the purchase agreement. Petition at 4-6 and Exhibits C and D, F.D. No. 30554 (filed August 27, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\">CP AC and Heartland consummated the sale, with financial assistance from the Iowa Railway Finance Authority (\u201cIRFA\u201d) and Citicorp, on October 10, 1984. <em>See </em>Decision, F.D. No. 30554, at 3. IRC and Milwaukee Trustee had attacked Heartland\u2019s financing in the Iowa state court, challenging the legality of the state-subsidized loan Heartland sought to finance the purchase of the line. They obtained a temporary injunction, restraining termination of their leases with CPAC. <em>Associated General Contractors v. Fitzgerald, </em>Equity No. CE 019 11197 (Iowa Dist.Ct.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">The proceedings in ICC Finance Docket 30554 were initiated on August 27, 1984 when Iowa Interstate petitioned the ICC for exemption <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from Interstate Commerce Act provisions which otherwise would have required Iowa Interstate to obtain the Commission\u2019s prior approval of the lease transaction. Decision, F.D. No. 30554, at 1. The Petition requested expedited consideration and that the Commission grant an \u201cimmediately\u201d effective exemption prior to the September 30, 1984 closing date contemplated in the purchase agreement and lease. Petition at 13-15. In a decision served on October 1, 1984, the Commission granted Iowa Interstate\u2019s petition, effective on the date of decision, September 28, 1984. Decision, F.D. No. 30554.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Iowa Interstate commenced operations on November 2, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">Instead of vacating the line on October 10, IRC and Milwaukee Trustee continued to occupy the track, collecting revenues. They petitioned the ICC for a thirty-day transition period, which was denied by an order served on October 30, 1984. Decisions, F.D. Nos. 30489 and 30554. The Commission confirmed that operating authority had lapsed on October 10, the date of closing, and simultaneously denied a transition period. <em>Id. </em>Milwaukee now seeks review of the October 30 order in No. 84-1553.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">Milwaukee Trustee and Patrick W. Simmons, Illinois Legislative Director for UTU, filed motions to reopen Finance Docket No. 30554, the Iowa Interstate exemption proceeding. <em>See </em>Decision, F.D. No. 30554, at 1. Milwaukee Trustee, responding to the Commission\u2019s October 4,1984 <em>Federal Register </em>notice inviting petitions to reopen, 49 Fed.Reg. 39,245 (Oct. 4, 1984), filed a petition. The Commission accepted both petitions but declined to reopen the proceedings. Decision, F.D. No. 30554, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-12\">Iowa Interstate sued the Milwaukee Trustee on April 8, 1985, seeking immediate payment of the freight revenues the Trustee had collected while occupying the line between October 10 through October 30, 1984. <em>In re Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad Co., </em>No. 77 B 8999 (N.D.Ill.). Petitioners appealed the March 15, 1985 Commission order. This Court granted a motion to consolidate the two appeals for purposes of briefing and oral argument. Order at 2 (filed July 1, 1985) (per curiam). Milwaukee Trustee petitioned the Northern District of Illinois for a stay of Iowa Interstate\u2019s claim for post-petition revenues pending disposition of these appeals. Motion to Dismiss and Stay Application of Iowa Interstate Railroad, Ltd., at 1, <em>In re Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad Company, supra. </em>The motion was denied. <em>Id., </em>Decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>on Motions Involving Application of Iowa Interstate Railroad Limited (Sept. 5, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">Milwaukee Trustee and IRC allege that the ICC\u2019s order, which exempted Iowa Interstate from regulation, was summarily entered without observance of procedures required by law and was arbitrary and capricious. Br. of Joint Petitioners at 19-21. Petitioners contend also that the Commission acted improperly in terminating their operating rights without a short transition period, creating what petitioner\u2019s term as \u201cretroactive liability without proper notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. Finally, intervenor UTU claims that the Commission erred in not imposing employee protective conditions under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11343 and 11347. Br. of UTU at 9-17. We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">Milwaukee Trustee and IRC contend that the ICC failed to provide a meaningful opportunity for a hearing in proceedings that involved vigorously disputed issues of adjudicative fact. Br. of Joint Petitioners at 11. Petitioners assert also that the October 1, 1984 order was arbitrary and capricious. <em>Id. </em>at 19-21. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">The ICC\u2019s decision of October 1, 1984 exempting Iowa Interstate from Commission approval of its rail operations is subject to review under sections 2321 and 2342 of the Judiciary Code, which provide for review in the Courts of Appeals of \u201crule[s], regulation[s], or order[s] of the Interstate Commerce Commission____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321(a), 2342(5) (1982). Under section 706 of Title 5 of the United States Code, which applies to all reviewable agency orders, an agency order must be set aside if it was entered \u201cwithout observance of procedure required by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701(a), 706(2)(A) and (D) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-11\">The standard of review of the ICC\u2019s decision to grant an exemption is well settled: the agency\u2019s action must be upheld unless it lacks a rational basis. <em>See, e.g., Simmons v. ICC, </em>697 F.2d 326, 342 (D.C.Cir. 1982) <em>(\u201cSimmons\u201d)] National Small Shipments Traffic Conference, Inc. v. CAB, </em>618 F.2d 819, 826 (D.C.Cir.1980). A decision to exempt certain transportation from regulation is \u201can essentially legislative policy judgment.\u201d <em>National Small Shipments, </em>618 F.2d at 830 n. 23 (citing <em>Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. Hodgson, </em>499 F.2d 467, 475 (D.C.Cir.1974)). Because the ICC\u2019s decision to exempt is an exercise of its rulemaking authority, the scope of review is quite narrow. <em>Simmons, </em>697 F.2d at 342; <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. ICC, </em>656 F.2d 1115, 1125 (5th Cir.1981) <em>(\u201cATA\u201d). </em>It is limited to whether the agency\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law. <em>See Simmons, </em>697 F.2d at 342; <em>United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corp., </em>406 U.S. 742, 749, 92 S.Ct. 1941, 1946, 32 L.Ed.2d 453 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-13\">The ICC need only make a showing that \u201call relevant factors were considered and that the Commission has articulated a rational connection between the facts as it finds them and the conclusion it premises on those facts.\u201d <em>ATA, </em>656 F.2d at 1127. This Court therefore neither weighs the evidence nor assesses the wisdom of the rules promulgated. Rather, our task is to examine the record to determine whether there are facts capable of sustaining the agency\u2019s findings. <em>Simmons, </em>697 F.2d at 342; <em>National Tour Brokers Association v. ICC, </em>671 F.2d 528, 532 (D.C.Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-14\">A. <em>Right to a Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-15\">In Finance Docket No. 30554, the Commission succeeded in approving Iowa Interstate\u2019s exemption application in five weeks, in time for the September 30, 1984 closing. Despite this expeditious treatment, the Commission afforded the Milwaukee Trustee and IRC three opportunities for written comments and testimony. Petitioners submitted comments on Iowa Interstate\u2019s petition before the Commission entered its decision. They filed motions to clarify the Commission\u2019s October 1 order. The Milwaukee Trustee moved to reopen the proceeding. All told, the two railroads submitted three rounds of filings. Despite these opportunities for comment, petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>ers now complain that they were denied \u201ca hearing\u201d in contravention of the Constitution and the Commission\u2019s own rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">The exemption criteria upon which this Court must focus in determining whether the Commission acted reasonably in granting an exemption is set out in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10505 (\u201csection 10505\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, an examination of section 10505 background history would be useful. In the wake of the collapse of the Rock Island and several other major railroads in the 1970s,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Congress drastically overhauled the Interstate Commerce Act to encourage revived private investment in rail transportation. <em>See Simmons, </em>697 F.2d at 328. Concluding that overregulation and bureaucratic inflexibility had stifled the growth of the railroads, <em>see </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1035, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. at 38, 115, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 3983, 4059, Congress loosened the vise grip of regulation through several important enactments, including the Staggers Act. <em>See Simmons, </em>697 F.2d at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">The Staggers Act hastened the pace of rail deregulation through the expanded exemption provisions of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10505 (1985 Supp.). The express purpose of Congress in enacting section 10505 was to grant the Commission authority to review its regulations and withdraw any regulations found to be unnecessary to effectuate the goals of national transportation policy or regulations that served little or no public purpose.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-17\">In explaining the ICC\u2019s exemptive authority, Congress noted that this provision was to be an \u201cimportant cornerstone\u201d of a new flexible approach to regulating the rail industry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The ICC was charged with the responsibility for \u201c \u2018actively pursuing exemptions for transportation and service that comply with the section\u2019s standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>ATA, </em>656 F.2d at 1119 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 96-1035, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad. News, 3978, 4005).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-18\">The Staggers Act also eliminated the requirement that the Commission afford a hearing prior to approving an exemption. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1430, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 104-05, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4136-37. Under former section 12(l)(b) (1976 ed.) (predecessor of section 10505), the Commission could grant an exemption under certain circumstances only \u201cafter notice and reasonable opportunity for a hearing.\u201d In 1980, however, Congress specifically removed that hearing requirement as part of its overall intention to broaden the ICC\u2019s exemption authority. Ex Parte No. 400.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">The railroads were provided three opportunities to submit written evidence. The need for immediate action to secure continuous service to shippers must be balanced against the temporary duration of the railroads\u2019 exemptions. The benefit of avoiding the expense and delay of a trial-type hearing outweighed the slight increase in probative value that cross-examination would have afforded for purposes of due process. <em>See Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 583, 95 S.Ct. 729, 740, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975); <em>cf United States v. Florida East Coast Ry. Co., </em>410 U.S. 224, 93 S.Ct. 810, 35 L.Ed.2d 223 (1973) (opportunity to submit written materials satisfies APA requirement of \u201chearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">B. <em>Right to Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">Petitioners also claim to be aggrieved because the Commission did not give interested parties notice of Iowa Interstate\u2019s petition prior to its decision. Br. of Joint Petitioners at 14. Petitioners have no \u201cright\u201d to notice in that Ex Parte No. 400 eliminated the initial notice and comment procedure in most cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">Moreover, petitioners had actual notice of Iowa Interstate\u2019s application. <em>See id. </em>Due to widespread actual public knowledge of the proposal, comments both favoring and opposing the exemption proposal were filed. Certified Index Documents, F.D. 30554, Nos. 2-10, 12-17, 19-22, 24-28, 30-31. Finally, the Commission published notice of the exemption in the <em>Federal Register </em>six days before closing, inviting petitions to reopen the proceedings. 49 Fed. Reg. 39,245 (Oct. 4, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">C. <em>Expedited Handling of Iowa Interstate\u2019s Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-12\">Petitioners next attempt to set aside the October 1 order by disputing the extraordinary nature of the circumstances surrounding Iowa Interstate\u2019s application that justified expedited handling according to Commission procedure under Ex Parte No. 400. We defer to the Commission\u2019s finding that this proceeding presented \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d justifying immediate effectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-13\">First, the very fact that the lines at issue were abandoned properties, whose service could have been terminated at any time by CP AC without additional Commission authorization, marked this proceeding for special treatment. Because the initial closing date of the agreement between Heartland and CP AC was scheduled for September 30, 1984, consummation on that date would have automatically terminated the authority of temporary operators to conduct service. <em>See </em>Decision, F.D. 30489, at 2. While Milwaukee Trustee and IRC may have been \u201cprepared to continue serving shippers on the line,\u201d Br. of Joint Petitioners at 16, they were without authority to do so. In addition, Iowa Interstate requested immediate effectiveness of the exemption decision because of the need to perform maintenance on the lines before the onset of winter. Petition at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-14\">Finally, Iowa Interstate had an urgent need for revenues to meet its lease and debt service obligations. Br. of Iowa Inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>state at 19. Under such circumstances, an immediately effective order was imperative to the financial survival of the start-up railroad. In view of the national policy of preserving continued rail service over lines otherwise destined for abandonment, the Commission\u2019s determination that expedited handling was necessary is a rational interpretation of its rules directed at effectuating Congressional transportation policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">D. <em>Consideration of Material Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADC\">Milwaukee Trustee and IRC assert that the Commission failed to give meaningful consideration to all material evidence presented in Finance Docket No. 30554. <em>See, e.g., </em>Br. of Joint Petitioners at 16, 20. Petitioners fault the ICC for \u201ca laundry list of findings\u201d taken from 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101a (1982). <em>Id. </em>at 20. Rather, we find that, in granting Iowa Interstate an exemption to operate, the Commission conducted an exhaustive analysis of the factors entering into its decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">This Circuit has repeatedly held that the Commission \u201c \u2018need not explicitly discuss in its decision each factor enumerated\u2019 in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101a as long as \u2018the essential basis of the ICC\u2019s rationale [is] clear enough so that a court can satisfy itself that the ICC has performed its function <em>Black v. ICC, </em>762 F.2d 106, 118 (D.G.Cir.1985) (quoting <em>Alamo Express, Inc. v. ICC, </em>673 F.2d 852, 860 (5th Cir. 1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">The railroads argue a remand is required because the Commission allegedly overlooked the financial ability of Iowa Interstate in considering whether to grant it an exemption. Br. of Joint Petitioners at. 20. Certainly, when the ICC considers applications under sections 10901 and 11301 of the Interstate Commerce Act, one of the critical issues it considers is the financial ability of the applicant to provide essential service to shippers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">But petitioners proceed on the erroneous assumption that Iowa Interstate applied under the certificate provisions of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10901. Iowa Interstate applied, rather, under the exemption provisions of section 10505, which dispenses with exhaustive financial scrutiny.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This is consistent with the statutory goal of preferring new ventures, albeit somewhat risky ones, to wholesale abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">Even if Congress had mandated a finding of solvency, the agency gave proper consideration to Iowa Interstate\u2019s financial prospects. In its application, Iowa Interstate projected funding of $6 to $8 million in equity, $8 to $10 million in commercial loans, a $15 million low-interest loan from the \u201cIRFA,\u201d and up to $4.5 million in temporary financing available from CP AC. Petition at 5. Iowa Interstate attested to the rail experience of its operating officers, the location and number of shippers on the line, and the commodities and volume of traffic which had been and were estimated to be transported. <em>See id. </em>at 10, Exhibit 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">Petitioners assail the Commission for failing to discuss Heartland\u2019s uncertain fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>nancing or the accuracy of Iowa Interstate\u2019s traffic projections in light of existing competition on the line. <em>See </em>Br. of Joint Petitioners at 15-16, 20. But the ICC did address those concerns in its October 1 decision. The Commission rejected petitioners\u2019 arguments concerning excess capacity, noting that most of the line operated under temporary exemptions that were due to terminate upon CP AC\u2019s disposition of the property. Decision, F.D. No. 30554, at 6. The Commission knew that the financing remained pending, but determined that Heartland\u2019s IRFA financing application was not a Commission-regulated transaction and that the merits of that proposal were not material to the exemption issue. <em>Id. </em>at 4. The ICC was thoroughly familiar with the financial deterioration of the Iowa and Milwaukee railroads and understood the strong economic incentive CPAC had to tear up the track for scrap.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Petitioners challenge the ICC\u2019s interpretation of when their Commission-issued temporary exemptions to operate ended and Iowa Interstate\u2019s permanent authority began. Petitioners contend that the Commission, in its decision of October 30, 1984 and in its March 15, 1985 decision denying rehearing, refused to provide for an orderly transition and \u201cpurported to find, based on an improper interpretation of an earlier order, that IRC\u2019s and Milwaukee Trustee\u2019s operating rights had terminated twenty days earlier.\u201d Br. of Joint Petitioners at 22. IRC and Milwaukee Trustee suggest that the ICC, in taking this action, \u201cpurported to create retroactive liability without proper notice, and without considering evidence as to critical public interest issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find petitioners\u2019 position without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">At the heart of the dispute is the language contained in the Commission\u2019s March 31, 1984 order in F.D. 30489. In that order, the ICC exempted Milwaukee Trustee and IRC from prior approval under section 10901 to operate over Rock Island lines temporarily. The Commission limited their authority to operate, noting: \u201cThis temporary exemption will terminate on the effective date of a decision granting permanent authority (either by application or exemption) or upon disposition of the property by [CPAC].\u201d In its October 30, 1984 decision, the Commission interpreted this to mean that the temporary exemption \u201cterminated on the date [CPAC] disposed of the line (October 10, 1984).\u201d Decision, F.D. No. 30489, at 2. It is well established that an agency\u2019s interpretation of the intended effect of its own orders is controlling unless clearly erroneous. <em>See, e.g., Udall v. Tollman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Costle, </em>657 F.2d 275, 292 (D.C.Cir.1981). The ICC\u2019s interpretation is a reasonable and fair reading of its own order, entitled to deference by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">Petitioners claim that the ICC\u2019s language limiting the duration of the exemption has no binding effect because it was not specifically set forth in the ordering paragraphs. Br. of Joint Petitioners at 24. As such, they assert, the Commission\u2019s later interpretation consequently amounted to an imposition of improper \u201cretroactive liability,\u201d because no other decision purported to terminate petitioners\u2019 operating rights prior to October 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">This argument is frivolous. The ICC granted a \u201ctemporary exemption\u201d in its ordering paragraph. The body of the decision contained the operative language defining what is meant by the term \u201ctemporary\u201d in these circumstances. The terms of a Commission order must be read in conjunction with the accompanying report, where the terms of the order are alleged to be ambiguous. <em>See, e.g., Georgia Public Service Commission v. United States, </em>283 U.S. 765, 771, 51 S.Ct. 619, 621, 75 L.Ed. 1397 (1931) (citing <em>American Express Co. v. South Dakota, </em>244 U.S. 617, 627, 37 S.Ct. 656, 661, 61 L.Ed. 1352 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">Petitioners argue that even if the statement concerning termination could be considered an order, its application in the circumstances here was so unclear that it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>not give fair notice that the temporary exemptions were intended to be terminated as of the date of the Heartland CPAC closing. Br. of Joint Petitioners at 25-28. Petitioners argue also that, under the circumstances presented to the Commission, it was not clear that there was a \u201cdisposition\u201d of property on October 10, 1984 within the meaning of the May 31, 1984 decision, because CPAC\u2019s \u201cdisposition\u201d of the Council Bluffs to Blue Island line was allegedly not yet complete due to the state court proceeding. In effect, petitioners claim that the state court\u2019s temporary injunction against formally terminating ICC\u2019s lease had the effect of overriding the Commission\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">This argument must be rejected. The Commission\u2019s interpretation of what is meant by \u201cdisposition,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>sale closing, is the same as that used in the governing statute, Section 122(a) of RITEA, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 1017(a) (1985 Supp.), to refer to CPAC\u2019s relinquishment of ownership rights through outright sale. The legislative history makes this clear.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The statutory language thus refers to a sale by CPAC, and not to leases entered into by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">Finally, petitioners contend that the Commission\u2019s finding regarding Iowa Interstate\u2019s readiness to commence operations on October 10 was arbitrary. Br. of Joint Petitioners at 32. First, petitioners\u2019 challenge to the reliance on \u201cunsworn representations of counsel\u201d regarding Iowa Interstate\u2019s readiness is unavailing. The signature of an attorney constitutes verification of the facts contained in a pleading and obviates the need for an affidavit. 49 C.F.R. 1104.4 (1984). Accordingly, the statements regarding the new operator\u2019s ability to start up service immediately constitute record evidence in support of the Commission\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">Substantial evidence exists to support the agency\u2019s finding. The lease, tariffs, and car and interchange agreements were in place. Iowa Interstate Statement, Exhibits A and B (Oct. 18, 1984). Counsel averred that Iowa Interstate was able to operate immediately upon closing. Iowa Interstate Statement, p. 5 (Sept. 18, 1984); Iowa Interstate Statement, pp. 3-5 (Oct. 18, 1984). Finally, the new operator actually operated a car on the line on October 14, 1984. Iowa Interstate Statement, p. 4 n. 2 (October 16, 1984). This Court rejects petitioners\u2019 invitation to reweigh the evidence. <em>See Ralston Purina Co. v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad, </em>426 U.S. 476, 477-78, 96 S.Ct. 2160, 2161, 48 L.Ed.2d 781 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-12\">Intervenor UTU claims that because Iowa Interstate\u2019s proposal included a provision for trackage rights over a segment of the lines at issue, specifically, the 98.5 mile segment between Bureau and Blue Island, Illinois, the transactions properly fall under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11343 (\u201csection 11343\u201d), not 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10901 (\u201csection 10901\u201d). If this is the case, the imposition of labor protective conditions is mandatory. Because the proposed overhead trackage rights operations are merely part of a single new integrated operating proposal made by a noncarrier, the Commission properly determined that the discretionary labor protective provisions of section 10901 apply.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Commission rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>sonably determined that imposition of labor conditions was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">The I.C.C. has long distinguished between non-carrier acquisitions and other purchase transactions that involve two or more existing rail carriers. <em>Application Proc. Construe., Acq. or Opr. R. Lines, </em>365 I.C.C. 516, 518 (1982) <em>(\u201cApplication Proc.\u201d)', Okmulgee Northern Ry. Co.

It is well settled that the acquisition of a railroad, even an active line, by a non-carrier, including a newly-formed entity organized for the purpose of providing interstate common carrier service, is governed by the requirements of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10901, and not by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11343. <em>See, e.g., Black v. ICC, </em>762 F.2d 106, 111 (D.C.Cir.1985); <em>Durango &amp; S.N. G.R. Co. </em>\u2014 Acquisition <em>Operation, </em>365 I.C.C. 292, 295 (1979), <em>aff'd sub. nom. RLEA v. United States, </em>697 F.2d 285 (10th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On the other hand, the acquisition of an active rail line by an existing carrier is governed by section 11343, which the ICC has found to be analytically more appropriate for dealing with the unification of existing railroad facilities. <em>Application Proc., </em>365 I.C.C. at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-14\">Section 10901 and its predecessor are directed at the transportation-oriented activities of a single rail carrier or non-carrier applicants where there is little danger of any adverse competitive consequences. In contrast, the focus in section 11343 proceedings is on the potential anticompetitive impact of multi-carrier transactions. <em>Id.; Matter of Chicago, M., St. P. &amp; Pac. R. Co., </em>658 F.2d 1149, 1169 (7th Cir.1981) <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1000, 102 S.Ct. 1632, 71 L.Ed.2d 867 (1982); <em>Okmulgee, </em>320 I.C.C. at 638-40 (1964). Section \u201c11343 is plainly concerned not with new, non-carrier entities entering the railway market through limited acquisitions such as the one at issue here, but with transactions integrating two or more carriers with the effect of multicarrier transactions on competition.\u201d <em>Black v. ICC, </em>762 F.2d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-15\">Iowa Interstate is a new non-carrier entering the railway market. In a single integrated proposal, Iowa Interstate seeks to operate the former Rock Island line from Council Bluffs, Iowa to Blue Island, Illinois. Only the Bureau to Blue Island, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>Illinois segment will be operated pursuant to overhead trackage rights in order to allow Iowa Interstate to reach the Chicago area. CP AC reserved these overhead rights when it gave the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad a 99-year lease on the line in order to preserve the integrity and future viability of the former Rock Island\u2019s Omaha-Chicago operation. These rights were assigned to Iowa Interstate by way of the CPAC-Heartland agreement. <em>See </em>Petition Exhibit C, pp. 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">It is UTU\u2019s view that, although Iowa Interstate is clearly a non-carrier, it must be considered a carrier with regard to that part of the transaction in which it acquired rights to conduct overhead operations from Bureau to Blue Island. <em>See </em>Br. of UTU at 10-12. The Commission held that because Iowa Interstate is a non-carrier, and because the overhead operations are part of a single new integrated operating proposal made by a non-carrier, section 11343 is simply inapposite to the case at hand. Decision, F.D. No. 30554, at 5. We agree that section 11343 by its terms involves transactions integrating two or more <em>existing </em>carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">Intervenor UTU cites two cases, <em>North Western Employees </em>\u2014 Pur.\u2014Chicago <em>&amp; N.W. By. Co., </em>342 I.C.C. 58 (1972) <em>(\u201cNorth Western\u201d) </em>and <em>Newrail Co., Inc. </em>\u2014 Pur.\u2014 <em>Western Pac. R. Co., </em>354 I.C.C. 885 (1979) <em>(\u201cNewrail\u201d), </em>for the proposition that the Commission has \u201clong recognized\u201d that trackage rights come under section 11343. Br. of UTU at 10-11. The Seventh Circuit, in <em>People of State of Illinois v. United States, </em>604 F.2d 519 (7th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 951, 100 S.Ct. 1599, 63 L.Ed.2d 786 (1980) <em>(\u201cState of Illinois\u201d), </em>rejected petitioners\u2019 similar reliance on these two cases. That court held that the Commission properly handled the acquisition of rail properties by a new entity, including trackage rights, entirely under the predecessor provision of section 10901 rather than under the predecessor of section 11343. <em>Id. </em>at 525-27. As the Seventh Circuit noted, each case involved the purchase by a newly-formed corporation of all the rail-related assets of a carrier, including many miles of joint ownership of lines, operating authorities, leases, and contracts to operate the properties, including terminals, of other carriers. <em>Id. </em>at 525. Furthermore, in both cases, the acquisition involved a parent corporation and its subsidiaries, so that property of more than one carrier was being acquired. <em>Id. </em>at 526 n. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-11\">The Seventh Circuit distinguished <em>North Western </em>and <em>Newrail </em>from the case before it. First, while both <em>North Western </em>and <em>Newrail </em>involved the acquisition of huge interstate rail systems with complex facilities-sharing arrangements with a number of different carriers, the case before the Seventh Circuit involved the acquisition of a line which happened to include incidental trackage rights. This <em>\u201cde minimis </em>involvement\u201d did not compel proceeding under section 11343 in what was otherwise a section 10901 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-12\">We find that the instant case similarly involves a straightforward acquisition of a small portion of a previously existing system by a non-carrier. The inclusion of trackage rights required to make the portion acquired economically viable is more in the nature of incidental authority, and not of a complexity involving many different carriers as was the case in <em>North Western </em>and <em>Newrail.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-13\">The <em>State of Illinois </em>court stated that the Commission\u2019s decision to proceed under section 10901 was \u201cfully consistent\u201d with the rationale that section 10901 applies to single applicants, whereas the focus in section 11343 proceedings \u201cis on the potential competitive effect of multi-carrier transactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Similarly, the case at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>bar presents none of the competitive problems of multi-carrier transactions that is the focus of section 11343 proceedings. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s rationale concerning uncomplicated incidental overhead rights being included in a proposal involving a single new applicant applies with equal force here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Finally, UTU argues that the Commission erred in not exercising its discretion to impose labor protective conditions. Br. of UTU at 16. That is, the ICC erred in promoting a new entity \u201cin substitution of major established rail carriers\u201d and that, therefore, the Commission\u2019s refusal to impose labor protective conditions in this case was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">In keeping with its broad discretion under section 10901, the Commission properly declined to impose labor conditions. In the absence of evidence justifying the need for labor protection, the ICC will not impose such conditions. <em>In re Chicago, M. St. Pac. &amp; P.R. Co., </em>658 F.2d at 1169; <em>Railway Labor Executives, </em>697 F.2d at 286. The Commission has a longstanding and judicially approved policy of not imposing the costs of labor protection on fledgling rail operators that seek to continue service over lines that were subject to abandonment. <em>See Black v. ICC, </em>762 F.2d at 116-17; <em>Simmons, </em>697 F.2d at 336-37. For, \u201calthough individual employees are the primary beneficiaries of this [job protection] policy, their interests are secondary to promoting the welfare of the national transportation system.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>697 F.2d at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">We are satisfied that the Commission could rationally conclude from the entire record that circumstances did not require the imposition of labor protective conditions in this case. The Commission was aware that Iowa Interstate stated it would hire the vast majority of IRC personnel who filed applications for jobs, and that it intended to employ former Milwaukee and Rock Island employees. Decision, F.D. 30554, at 7. Consistent with its well-established policy, the Commission properly refused to impose the protection measures on the new carrier, finding the burdens on new operators were great enough without the additional cost of labor protection. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">Since the Commission approved the new carrier\u2019s operating rights under a section of the Interstate Commerce Act that makes labor-protective conditions discretionary at best, the UTU\u2019s contention that the ICC should have provided labor-protective conditions cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Commission is</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">. The segment of the line at issue in this case begins in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on the Nebraska border, and continues east through Des Moines, Davenport, and Blue Island, Illinois on into Chicago.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">.
