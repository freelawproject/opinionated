Cole was charged in a multiple count indictment with conspiracy to possess and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute it in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and \u00a7 846. The indictment also charged Cole with three counts of the unlawful use of a telephone to facilitate the commission of a drug conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). The indictment was based primarily on information obtained from a duly authorized wiretap of Cole\u2019s telephone. There were three other codefendants, only one of whom, Joan Adamson, figures in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-23\">The basis for the motions to dismiss the indictment and suppress evidence was that one of the investigating officers, Detective Charles Bradley, had engaged in a romantic affair with codefendant Joan Adamson, Cole\u2019s live-in companion, both before and after the indictment. Both Bradley and Adamson admitted that they became ro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>mantically entangled during the preindictment investigation of defendant and that their affair continued after defendant and Adamson were indicted. After the extent of the affair became known to the prosecutor, the charges against Adamson were dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The district court held a <em>Franks v. Delaware </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing to determine whether the failure to disclose the affair between Detective Bradley and Adamson in the wiretap application vitiated the wiretap. It found that it did not. After the district court denied defendant\u2019s pretrial motions, he entered a plea of guilty conditioned on his right to appeal the adverse rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The issues before us are whether the affair deprived defendant of due process, interfered with his right to counsel, vitiated the need for a wiretap on defendant\u2019s phone and poisoned all the fruits evidence resulting from the wiretap. Defendant also claims that the court erred in limiting the cross-examination of Bradley on the length of the affair.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Sometime in 1982 or 1983, the Northboro Massachusetts Police Department began to suspect that defendant was a drug dealer. On April 6, 1984, Detective Bradley executed a search warrant on defendant\u2019s residence in Northboro. As a result, charges of illegal possession of weapons and cocaine were filed against defendant in the Westboro District Court. Defendant, who had been a part-time police officer on the Northboro Police Department in 1976, was given a two-year suspended sentence in return for his promise to cooperate with Bradley on other drug investigations. Defendant himself continued to be under investigation. In January, 1985, an investigation into cocaine trafficking by defendant was commenced by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in conjunction with police officers in the Northboro area, including Detective Bradley.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">As part of the investigation, Bradley telephoned defendant at Patrick\u2019s Body Shop. Defendant\u2019s residence, which he shared with Adamson, was located over the Body Shop. When defendant was not at home, Bradley talked to Adamson who took messages for defendant. Bradley and Adamson became telephone acquaintances. In the middle of April, 1985, Bradley asked Adamson to meet him in person, partially because he had enjoyed talking to her on the phone and also because he hoped that she would be a source of information about defendant\u2019s drug dealing activities. Bradley informed his superiors and fellow officers that he was going to try to cultivate Adamson to obtain information about defendant. Adamson knew Bradley was a detective investigating defendant. She told him repeatedly that she did not know anything about drug activities by the defendant and that she would not cooperate in the investigation of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Early in May, 1985, the relationship between Bradley and Adamson culminated in sexual relations. Thereafter, sexual Masons took place from time to time in defendant\u2019s home when defendant was away. Bradley estimated that he was in defendant's residence from twelve to fifteen times. While there, he had an opportunity to observe defendant\u2019s sophisticated security system which consisted of surveillance cameras, TV video monitors and a sequential relay board. Bradley testified that he never saw any drugs or drug related materials at defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">As the affair continued, Bradley and Adamson expressed their love for each other. This did not deter Bradley from inquiring about defendant\u2019s drug activities, nor did it change Adamson\u2019s insistence that she knew nothing about such activities and would not help Bradley in his investigation. Both stuck to their principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">In the beginning of August, 1985, DEA Special Agent Kathleen Bennett, with whom Bradley had been working, began preparing an affidavit for a Title III wiretap on defendant\u2019s phone. Bradley then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>stopped seeing or contacting Adamson. He did not tell Agent Bennett of his affair with Adamson and it was, therefore, not included in the wiretap application. An application for an order authorizing a pen register on defendant\u2019s telephone was made and granted on August 19, 1985. On September 9, an application was made for an order authorizing a wiretap on defendant\u2019s phone; it was granted the same day. Agent Bennett\u2019s wiretap applications included a great deal of information supplied by Bradley.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">On September 24, Agent Bennett submitted an application for a search warrant of defendant\u2019s residence. The information in the affidavit came from the phone wiretap. The warrant was issued and a seizure of cocaine, scales and other cocaine paraphernalia were seized. Defendant and Adamson were arrested after the execution of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Bradley and Adamson renewed their affair after her arrest and she subsequently became pregnant. Bradley was married throughout this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">II. THE MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">A. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The basis of defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of due process is that Bradley\u2019s affair with Adamson was so egregiously improper that it should bar prosecution. He relies on statements, mainly dicta, culled from Supreme Court cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The first case on which defendant relies is <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973). Russell was convicted of manufacturing an illegal substance. He claimed entrapment because a DEA agent supplied him with one of the ingredients. The Court affirmed, finding that since Russell was predisposed to manufacture the drug, there was no entrapment. The language on which defendant relies is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">While we may some day be presented with a situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction, <em>cf. Rochin v. California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952), the instant case is distinctly not of that breed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 431-32, 93 S.Ct. at 1642-43. Nor is this case of such a breed. Likewise, we find no help for defendant in Justice Frankfurter\u2019s concurrence in <em>Sherman v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 369, 378-85, 78 S.Ct. 819, 823-27, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958), which is a careful analysis of the basis of the entrapment defense. The instant case simply is not an entrapment case. Defendant equates Bradley\u2019s conduct with that of the police in <em>Rochin v. California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952), which the Court found \u201cshocks the conscience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172, 72 S.Ct. at 209. The police in <em>Rochin </em>broke into defendant\u2019s home without a warrant, assaulted him, and then took him to a hospital and had his stomach pumped out against his will. Bradley's affair with Adamson cannot be equated with such conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">We find no grounds for a due process violation of defendant\u2019s rights in the affair between Bradley and Adamson. We agree with the district court that there is a real question as to who seduced whom. Indeed, if we take the parties at their words, there was no deliberate seduction by either one; Bradley and Adamson fell in love with each other and entered into sexual relations. This is not an uncommon occurrence in this age or any other. While we do not condone the conduct of Detective Bradley, there was nothing done by him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>that deprived defendant of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">B. <em>Interference with Defendant\u2019s Right to Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The second reason advanced by defendant for dismissing the indictment is that Bradley interfered with defendant\u2019s right to counsel. Following the indictment of defendant and Adamson and the imprisonment of defendant, Bradley and Adamson renewed their affair. During this time, Bradley disparaged the attorneys who were representing defendant and Adamson. The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">Based on the affidavits and motion papers before it, this Court is prepared to infer that Detective Bradley, during the period following the indictments of Adamson and Cole, intentionally pursued a course of action designed to interfere with those defendants\u2019 Sixth Amendment right to counsel and that such conduct is fully binding on the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The court, however, found that there was no demonstrable prejudice to defendant. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Bradley\u2019s disparaging remarks had no effect on defendant, assuming that they were relayed to him. Because defendant and Adamson were represented by attorneys who were partners in the same law firm, the district court held a hearing pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 44(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court fully and meticulously explained to both defendant and Adamson the risks involved in being represented by members of the same law firm. By the time of the hearing, the defendant must have been aware that Adamson\u2019s affections were at least shared with Bradley. Defendant chose to keep the attorney whom he had retained originally. And that attorney has capably represented defendant through this appeal. We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Bradley\u2019s disparagement of defendant\u2019s counsel to Adamson did not result in prejudice to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">The next question is whether, in light of the district court\u2019s finding that Bradley \u201cintentionally pursued a course of conduct designed to interfere with [defendant\u2019s] Sixth Amendment right to counsel,\u201d the indictment should have been dismissed as a matter of law for prophylactic purposes. The Supreme Court teaching prohibits a dismissal on purely prophylactic grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">In <em>Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977), an undercover agent, unknown as such to defendant and his attorney, attended a meeting between defendant and his attorney. The agent did not attempt to obtain any information for the prosecutor, nor did he relay any information to the prosecutor. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that attending the meeting amounted to a <em>per se </em>violation of defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial. The Supreme Court rejected this \u201cprophylaxis\u201d approach and found that because there was \u201cno tained evidence in this case, no communication of defense strategy to the prosecution, and no purposeful intrusion by Weatherford, there was no violation of the Sixth Amendment....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558, 97 S.Ct. at 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">An even stronger case is <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 101 S.Ct. 665, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981). In <em>Morrison, </em>federal agents, fully aware that defendant had been indicted on drug charges and had retained counsel, met with her without her attorney\u2019s knowledge. The purpose of the meeting was to seek her cooperation in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>related investigation. The government agents disparaged defendant\u2019s counsel and told her that she would gain various benefits if she cooperated, but faced a stiff jail term if she failed to cooperate. Defendant refused the agents\u2019 overtures and notified her attorney of what had transpired. The agents visited defendant again in the absence of counsel. \u201cAt no time did respondent agree to cooperate with them, incriminate herself, or supply any information pertinent to her case. Contrary to the agents\u2019 advice, respondent continued to rely upon the services of the attorney whom she retained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362-63, 101 S.Ct. at 666-67. The district court denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. As here, there was a conditional plea of guilty while defendant appealed. The Third Circuit held that, whether or not defendant had been prejudiced, her sixth amendment right to counsel had been violated and dismissed the indictment with prejudice. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion, reversed. It held, \u201cabsent demonstrable prejudice or substantial threat thereof, dismissal of the indictment is plainly inappropriate, even though the violation may have been deliberate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365, 101 S.Ct. at 668. (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Since there was no demonstrable prejudice here, there is no ground for dismissing the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">III. THE WIRETAP APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The wiretap application made no mention at all of the Bradley-Adamson affair. Defendant argues that this omission, particularly that Bradley was in defendant\u2019s home twelve to fifteen times when defendant was away, violated two subsections of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(l)(c) and (3)(c). Section 2518, which establishes the procedure for interception of wire or oral communications, requires that a wiretap application include, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous[.]\u201d \u00a7 2518(l)(c). The statute further provides that a judge may issue an ex parte order for a wiretap if he determines on the basis of the facts submitted that, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cnormal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous[.]\u201d \u00a7 2518(3)(c). It is defendant\u2019s position that if the clandestine visits of Bradley to defendant\u2019s home had been included in the wiretap application the strictures of \u00a7 2518(l)(c) and (3)(c) would have prevented the wiretap order from being issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">There can be no question that \u201c[\u00bfJudicial wiretap orders must be preceded by applications containing prescribed information, \u00a7 2518(1). The judge must make certain findings before authorizing interceptions, including the existence of probable cause, \u00a7 2518(3).\u201d <em>United States v. Giordano, </em>416 U.S. 505, 514, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 1826, 40 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974). This is because wiretaps should be used only if necessary. Necessity, however, does not mean that the government must exhaust all other investigative procedures before resorting to a wiretap. The requirements of \u00a7 2518(l)(c) and (3)(c) are \u201csimply designed to assure that wiretapping is not resorted to in situations where traditional investigative techniques would suffice to expose the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Kahn, </em>415 U.S. 143, 153 n. 12, 94 S.Ct. 977, 983 n. 12, 39 L.Ed.2d 225 (1974); <em>United States v. Santarpio, </em>560 F.2d 448, 452 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 984, 98 S.Ct. 609, 54 L.Ed.2d 478 (1977); <em>United States v. Scibelli, </em>549 F.2d 222, 226-27 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 960, 97 S.Ct. 2687, 53 L.Ed.2d 278 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">The district court, fully aware of the problem raised by the omission in the application, held a hearing pursuant to the requirements of <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 (1978), to determine whether the omission was material and, if it were, would the order still have issued. It found that, although the information withheld was \u201cnot insubstantial,\u201d it was not material. The court\u2019s findings on materiality deserve quoting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Materiality means if the statements had been made and what we know today after two days of hearing, had been in the affidavit, would the warrant necessarily, nevertheless, have issued. If it would have issued even though we knew these things, the information is immaterial. If this Court would not have issued the warrant had it known of Bradley\u2019s romantic involvement with Adamson and all the circumstances that we now know, then it is material and the wiretaps and all information deriving therefrom must be suppressed. The Court rules it\u2019s not material. It\u2019s not material because the Court finds that from all the circumstances that Ms. Adamson was not, given the nature of the conspiracy here, the use of the telephones, the surreptitous delivery and apparent movement of the cocaine, she was not the means for breaking open the conspiracy. On at least one occasion she evidenced her unwillingness, out of a fear of retaliation, to make statements inculpatory of Cole. Therefore, the Court rules that even had it known all the information that it now has, the standards set forth by Title 19, Section 2518 1(c) would have been met and the warrant would have issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The court went on to point out that the application \u201cdetailed in an appropriate and careful manner ... all those reasons why an appropriate way to investigate this conspiracy was through wiretaps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">This circuit\u2019s standard of review of wiretap application is well defined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201c \u2018It is not our province to engage in <em>de novo </em>review of an application; instead, we \u201ctest it in a practical and commonsense manner\u201d to determine whether the facts which it sets forth are \u201cminimally adequate\u201d to support the findings made by the issuing judge.\u2019 <em>United States v. Smith, </em>726 F.2d 852, 864 (1st Cir.1984), citing and quoting <em>United States v. Southard, </em>700 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1983), and <em>United States v. Scibelli, </em>549 F.2d 222 (1st Cir.1977).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\"><em>United States v. Bynum, </em>763 F.2d 474, 476 (1st Cir.1985). In reviewing findings made after a <em>Franks </em>hearing, we apply the clearly erroneous test. <em>United States v. Southard, </em>700 F.2d 1, 10 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 823, 104 S.Ct. 89, 78 L.Ed.2d 97 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">We have read carefully the wiretap application and the testimony adduced at the <em>Franks </em>hearing. We find that the district court properly applied the test required under <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>made no clearly erroneous findings of fact and that the facts set forth in the application were more than adequate to support the issuance of the wiretap orders. This ruling makes it unnecessary to discuss the validity of the search warrant issued for defendant\u2019s residence since it was challenged only on a \u201cfruits\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">IV. THE CROSS-EXAMINATION ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">There is one final issue, whether the district court committed reversible error in refusing to allow defense counsel to question Detective Bradley about the post-indictment renewal of his affair with Adam-son. Defendant argues that Bradley had a vested interest in seeing to it that he was convicted and imprisoned. He points to an affidavit of Adamson in which she stated that Bradley had commented to her that they both would be together after defendant was convicted and imprisoned. Bradley, in his affidavit, denied making this comment. Defendant argues that the Adamson affidavit raised substantial questions about Bradley\u2019s credibility and that since the comment was allegedly made during the couple\u2019s post-indictment relationship, cross-examination about it should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">We point out first that the court did allow defense counsel to question Bradley about his post-indictment relationship with Adamson. Tr. 2, 18-19. It was defense counsel\u2019s attempts to cross-examine again on this topic that were rebuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">\u201cTrial courts are granted broad discretion to control the scope of cross-examination.\u201d <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>790 F.2d 186, 190 (1st Cir.1986) \u201cOnly in exceptional circumstances will reversible error be found in the district court\u2019s determination of the probative value of testimony in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>particular case.\u201d <em>United States v. Kepreos, </em>759 F.2d 961, 964 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 227, 88 L.Ed.2d 227 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Bradley was cross-examined extensively at the hearing on all the facts and nuances of his preindictment affair with Adamson. We fail to see how dredging up more details about the renewal of the sexual liason would have affected Bradley\u2019s credibility. It was already clear that he let his emotions override acceptable moral standards. Even if everything Adamson said, both by affidavit and testimony, were accepted and Bradley\u2019s statements completely rejected, the result would be the same. The testimony of Adamson and Bradley was to a large extent consistent. The basic question was not credibility, but whether what both admitted had transpired adversely affected defendant\u2019s right to due process, assistance of counsel and the wiretap application. For the reasons stated, we find that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\">. 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b335-10\">.
