(\u201cBeef Nebraska\u201d), a \u201cpacker\u201d subject to the provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 181-231 (1982 &amp; Supp. III 1985) (\u201cthe Act\u201d), petitions this court to set aside a decision and order entered November 26, 1985 by respondent United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d), Donald A. Campbell, <em>Judicial Officer, </em>ordering Beef Nebraska to cease and desist from paying for livestock with checks drawn on remote, distant, or coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>try bank accounts. The judicial officer held that Beef Nebraska\u2019s use of checks drawn on a distant bank to pay for livestock often lengthened the check-clearing process by at least one day, and hence delayed the \u201ccollection of funds\u201d in violation of \u00a7 409(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 228b(c) (1982) (\u201c\u00a7 228b(c)\u201d). In its petition, Beef Nebraska claims, first, that its use of checks drawn on the distant bank did not delay the \u201ccollection of funds\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 228b(c), and, second, that an administrative law judge, in denying its motions to require USDA to answer certain interrogatories, deprived it of its right to pre-hearing discovery under the United States Constitution and certain statutes and regulations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">We hold that Beef Nebraska\u2019s use of checks drawn on the distant bank delayed the collection of funds in violation of the unambiguous proscription of \u00a7 228b(c). We further hold that the administrative law judge did not deprive Beef Nebraska of its right to obtain answers to its interrogatories, to whatever extent such right exists. We deny the petition for review and affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Beef Nebraska conceded at oral argument before us that, if the judicial officer interpreted \u00a7 228b(c) correctly, the record before him contained sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Beef Nebraska violated the Act. Beef Nebraska thus does not dispute the facts, but rather disputes the judicial officer\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 228b(c). We summarize only those facts believed necessary to an understanding of the issues raised in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Beef Nebraska is engaged in the business of buying livestock in commerce for slaughter and sale. Hence it is a \u201cpacker\u201d subject to the provisions of the Act. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 191 (1982). Its sole processing plant is in Omaha, Nebraska. Its daily purchases of livestock average $305,000. They are from livestock sellers located throughout the midwestern United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">The acts leading to the instant petition began in July 1982. At that time Beef Nebraska\u2019s use of a new checking account to pay livestock sellers often increased the period of time between the point at which it tendered a check to a seller and the point at which the seller had unconditional access to the funds pursuant to the check. Prior to July 1982, Beef Nebraska paid livestock sellers with checks drawn on its ordinary corporate account at the Omaha National Bank (\u201cONB\u201d). In view of ONB\u2019s location in Omaha, the Federal Reserve System classifies it as a \u201ccity\u201d bank. Livestock sellers paid with checks drawn on Beef Nebraska\u2019s ONB account would deposit such checks in their own banks. These banks often granted the sellers provisional credit. Provisional credit became final only after the checks cleared Beef Nebraska\u2019s ONB account. When a check drawn on that account was presented to the Federal Reserve Bank in Omaha (\u201cthe Federal Reserve Bank\u201d), the check cleared at a time determined under Federal Reserve System schedules applicable to city banks. At that time the funds became available to the depositing bank. In general, under these schedules a check drawn on Beef Nebraska\u2019s ONB ordinary corporate account cleared on the same day that the check was presented to the Federal Reserve Bank. When the checks were presented to commercial clearinghouse associations \u2014 private collection systems with which ONB maintained agreements for such purposes \u2014 the checks cleared at least as quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Presentments of checks drawn on the accounts of ONB\u2019s customers are made throughout the day at the Federal Reserve Bank. The same is true of checks presented to several commercial clearinghouse associations and by other banks directly to ONB. These numerous presentments prevent ONB from predicting accurately the value of checks which will clear against its customers\u2019 ordinary checking accounts on any given day. As a result, Beef Nebraska either had to maintain large idle balances in its checking account or had to pay overdraft charges on checks drawn on insufficient funds. To avoid this dilemma, Beef Nebraska opened a \u201ccontrolled disbursement\u201d checking account (\u201ccontrolled account\u201d) at ONB on June 28, 1982. A check drawn on the controlled account appeared on its face to have been drawn on the State Bank of Palmer (\u201cthe Palmer Bank\u201d), a small bank located in Palmer, Nebraska, 125 miles west of Omaha. In fact, however, pursuant to an agreement between ONB and the Palmer Bank, ONB would intercept the check at the Federal Reserve Bank, process the check, and debit its customer\u2019s controlled account. The Palmer Bank never received or processed the check. In view of its remote geographic location, the Palmer Bank is classified by the Federal Reserve System as a \u201ccountry\u201d bank. Under Federal Reserve System schedules applicable to country banks, a check drawn on the Palmer Bank generally cleared the day <em>after </em>it was presented to the Federal Reserve Bank. It therefore generally cleared one day later than did a check drawn on ONB, a city bank. The Palmer Bank was not a member of any commerical clearinghouse association. In view of its size and remote location, it did not receive direct presentments from other banks. ONB therefore could take advantage of the additional day between presentment and clearing to predict accurately the value of the checks that would clear the next day against its customers\u2019 controlled accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">On July 12, 1982 Beef Nebraska began paying livestock sellers with checks drawn on its ONB controlled account. Since those checks appeared to have been drawn on the Palmer Bank, Beef Nebraska gained an extra day in the check-clearing process. Concurrently, livestock sellers often faced a delay of one day between the time of deposit and the time they had final credit. During this period they could not collect the funds to which they were entitled pursuant to Beef Nebraska\u2019s checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">On January 27, 1983 the Secretary of USDA (\u201cthe Secretary\u201d) served an administrative complaint on Beef Nebraska. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 193 (1982). The complaint charged that its use of checks drawn on the Palmer Bank constituted an unfair practice under \u00a7 202(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 192(a) (1982), in that such use violated \u00a7 228b(c). Section 228b(c) provides that \u201c[a]ny delay ... by a ... packer purchasing livestock, [in] the collection of funds as herein provided ... shall be considered an \u2018unfair practice\u2019 in violation of this chapter____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">A hearing on the complaint took place before an administrative law judge (\u201cthe AU\u201d) on September 27 and 28, 1983. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 193. Prior to the hearing the AU denied motions by Beef Nebraska to require USDA to answer certain interrogatories. The AU\u2019s denial of these motions serves as the basis for Beef Nebraska\u2019s claim before us that its right to prehearing discovery was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">On April 3, 1985 the AU filed his decision and order requiring Beef Nebraska to cease and desist from paying livestock sellers with checks drawn on the Palmer Bank. On May 8, 1985 Beef Nebraska filed an appeal from the decision and order of the AU to the judicial officer. The Secretary had delegated authority to the judicial officer to make final decisions of the USDA. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.35 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">In a decision and order filed November 26, 1985, the judicial officer, after a comprehensive analysis of the language and legislative history of \u00a7 228b(c), concluded that Beef Nebraska\u2019s use of the controlled account delayed the collection of funds and hence constituted an unfair practice under the Act. The judicial officer also concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>that the AU did not deprive Beef Nebraska of its right to discovery. He ordered that Beef Nebraska, \u201cin connection with its operations as a packer, shall cease and desist from issuing checks in payment for livestock drawn on remote, distant, or country accounts including any accounts with [the Palmer Bank]____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">On December 31, 1985, Beef Nebraska petitioned this court to set aside the order of the judicial officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">We deny the petition for review and affirm the decision and order of the USDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">We turn first to the issue whether Beef Nebraska\u2019s use of checks drawn on the Palmer Bank resulted in a delay in the collection of funds within the meaning of \u00a7 228b(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Between 1958 and early 1975, 167 meat-packers went bankrupt, leaving sellers unpaid to the extent of more than $43 million worth of livestock. S.Rep. No. 932, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4-5, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2267, 2271. This prompted Congress in 1976 to amend the Act to add, among other things, the \u201cprompt payment\u201d provisions of \u00a7 228b. Pub.L. No. 94-410, \u00a7 7, 90 Stat. 1250 (1976). Section 228b(a) sets forth methods and time limits for payment. A packer may pay a livestock seller in cash, by wire transfer, or by check. If payment is made by check, absent unusual circumstances the packer physically must deliver the check to the seller before the close of the business day following transfer of possession of the livestock. Section 228b(c), the subsection which we must interpret, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-10\">\u201cAny delay or attempt to delay by a ... packer purchasing livestock, the collection of funds as herein provided, or otherwise for the purpose of or resulting in extending the normal period of payment for such livestock shall be considered an \u2018unfair practice\u2019 in violation of this chapter____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 228b(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">The judicial officer concluded that the extra day of \u201cfloat\u201d resulting from Beef Nebraska\u2019s use of cheeks drawn on the Palmer Bank constituted \u201c[a]ny delay ... by a ... packer purchasing livestock, [in] the collection of funds as herein provided\u201d. \u201cFloat\u201d means the time between the point at which Beef Nebraska tenders a check to a seller and the point at which the seller has unconditional access to the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-15\">As a general rule, we review the Secretary\u2019s determinations on questions of law under a <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>Rice v. Wilcox, </em>630 F.2d 586, 589 (8th Cir.1980); <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1982). When our review is of an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that it administers, however, the agency\u2019s determination often is entitled to some deference. <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). Beef Nebraska argues that, for a variety of reasons, the judicial officer\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 228b(c) is entitled to no deference. We need express no opinion as to the merits of that argument, for, regardless of any deference given the judicial officer\u2019s interpretation, Beef Nebraska\u2019s conduct comes so squarely within the unambiguous proscription of \u00a7 228b(c) that the order under review must be affirmed and the petition must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-17\">The Act does not define \u201ccollection of funds\u201d. \u201cA fundamental canon of statutory construction is that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\u201d <em>Perrin v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979); <em>accord, Escondido Mutual Water Co. v. La Jolla Bank of Mission Indians, </em>466 U.S. 765, 772 (1984) (\u201c[I]t should be generally assumed that Congress expresses its purposes through the ordinary meaning of the words it uses\u201d.). In Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 921 (1963), \u201cfund\u201d used as a noun in its plural form is defined as \u201cmoney on deposit which is held at a specified place and on which checks or drafts can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>drawn\u201d. The same dictionary defines \u201ccollection\u201d as, among other things, \u201cthe securing of payment of a check ... by presentation to the payer for cash\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 444. <em>See also </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 4-105(d) (defining \u201cCollecting bank\u201d as \u201cany bank handling the item for collection except the payor bank\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Thus, the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201ccollection of funds\u201d is the securing of payment of a check from money on deposit on which the check is drawn. By drawing checks on the Palmer Bank \u2014 located 125 miles from its sole processing plant \u2014 Beef Nebraska prolonged the time it took for a livestock seller to secure payment of Beef Nebraska\u2019s check from the account on which the check was drawn. The words of \u00a7 228b(c), therefore, when interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning, compel the conclusion that Beef Nebraska\u2019s use of the Palmer Bank \u201cdelay[edj\u201d the \u201ccollection of funds\u201d. Further, since the statute prohibits \u201cany\u201d delay, it is of no consequence that Beef Nebraska\u2019s use of the Palmer Bank resulted in a delay of only one day or that the delay did not always occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In the light of this unambiguous language, Beef Nebraska makes the rather remarkable assertion that \u00a7 228b(c) has \u201cnothing to do with banking practices\u201d. It argues that, since \u201ccollection of funds\u201d is followed by \u201cas herein provided\u201d, \u201ccollection of funds\u201d must be interpreted to be synonomous with \u201cpayment\u201d as that word is used in \u00a7 228b(a). Under this interpretation, Beef Nebraska argues, actual delivery of a check within the time requirements of \u00a7 228b(a) is by definition \u201cprompt payment\u201d and hence cannot be characterized as a \u201cdelay\u201d under \u00a7 228b(c) even if the check is drawn on a geographically-remote bank. This argument ignores well-established rules of statutory construction. We reject it. It is noteworthy that the phrase \u201ccollection of funds\u201d appears only once in \u00a7 228b. By contrast, the word \u201cpayment\u201d is used five times. We must \u201cpresume that the use of different terminology within a statute indicates that Congress intended to establish a different meaning.\u201d <em>National Insulation Transportation Committee v. ICC, </em>683 F.2d 533, 537 (D.C.Cir. 1982). <em>Accord, United States v. Rice, </em>671 F. 2d 455, 460 (11th Cir.1982) (Congress\u2019 use of different verb forms is \u201cproperly take[n] as evidence of an intentional differentiation\u201d); <em>Lankford v. Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, </em>620 F.2d 35, 36 (4th Cir.1980) (same). Moreover, were we to adopt Beef Nebraska\u2019s construction of \u00a7 228b(c), the redrafted version which follows at best would create a redundancy, and at worst would make no sense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-9\">\u201cAny delay ... by a packer purchasing livestock, <em>payment, </em>or otherwise for the purpose of or resulting in extending the normal period of payment ... shall be an \u2018unfair practice\u2019____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">Where, as here, a \u201cstatute admits a reasonable construction which gives effect to all of its provisions\u201d, we decline to \u201cadopt a strained reading which renders one part a mere redundancy.\u201d <em>Jarecki v. G. D. Searle &amp; Co., </em>367 U.S. 303, 307-08 (1961). <em>Accord, State of New York v. Shore Realty Co., </em>759 F.2d 1032, 1044 (2d Cir.1985). Under a reasonable construction, we hold that the phrase \u201cas herein provided\u201d does not change the ordinary meaning of \u201ccollection of funds\u201d, but rather directs that the delays in the \u201ccollection of funds\u201d prohibited by \u00a7 228b(c) are those that occur with respect to checks delivered in accordance with \u00a7 228b(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">We have considered carefully Beef Nebraska\u2019s other arguments based on the language and structure of \u00a7 228b. To accept them likewise would require us to adopt a strained reading of the statute contrary to its unambiguous language. We conclude that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">Beef Nebraska argues that the legislative history of \u00a7 228b demonstrates that the judicial officer misinterpreted the statute. Ordinarily, when confronted with a statute such as \u00a7 228b(c) that is clear and unambiguous, we need not look to legislative history to ascertain its meaning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number><em>Maine v. Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 6 n. 4 (1980). Nevertheless, we have examined the legislative history cited by Beef Nebraska and conclude that it provides ample support for the judicial officer\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Moreover, the legislative history of \u00a7 228b is rife with expressions of concern regarding the dangers caused by packers paying for livestock with checks drawn on remote banks. <em>E.g., </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1043, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1976) (noting complaints by livestock sellers of delays in payment resulting from \u201cuse of ... checks drawn on distant banks\u201d); 122 Cong.Rec. 18,834 (1976) (statement of Sen. Dole) (\u201cmanipulation by using distant banks, coupled with other particular circumstances surrounding [bankruptcy of a packer] caused nearly 1,000 farmers to hold worthless checks amounting to over $20 million last year.\u201d); 122 Cong.Rec. 12,884 (1976) (statement of Rep. Harkin) (\u201cThe transgressions of [a bankrupt packer] have indicated that the packers can bend the law to serve their own interest at the expense ... of the producer. For example, [the bankrupt packer] maintained bank accounts in Seattle, Wash., and Salem, N.C., to increase the float time for clearing checks. Obviously this float ... resulted in the magnitude of the loss to producers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The unambiguous language of \u00a7 228b(c), coupled with its legislative history, makes clear that Congress intended to prohibit packers from extending float by drawing checks on banks located far from the packers\u2019 places of operation. Accordingly, we hold that Beef Nebraska\u2019s use of checks drawn on the Palmer Bank to pay livestock sellers resulted in a \u201cdelay\u201d in the \u201ccollection of funds\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 228b(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Beef Nebraska claims that the AU, in violation of the United States Constitution and certain statutes and regulations, deprived it of its right to pre-hearing discovery in denying its motions to require USDA to answer interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Beef Nebraska made four motions to require answers to interrogatories. The AU denied all four motions, each of which related to the same interrogatories. In denying the third motion, the AU stated that, although \u201c[t]he record does not show relevancy or materiality at this time\u201d, and although \u201ca search even to the outer limits of my imagination has failed in this respect\u201d, Beef Nebraska \u201cwill have further opportunity to present argument, offers of proof or evidence to show why the myriad aspects they raise are relevant and material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Beef Nebraska argues that the AU\u2019s <em>\u201cper se </em>denial of discovery\u201d deprived Beef Nebraska of its rights. This argument need not detain us long. First, as the judicial officer stated in his decision, Beef Nebraska does <em>not </em>contend that it did not have pre-hearing access to all exhibits to be offered by USDA, lists of its witnesses and summaries of the witness\u2019 expected testimony. To label the AU\u2019s refusal to require USDA to answer interrogatories as a <em>\u201cper se\u2019\u2019 </em>denial of discovery strikes us as a mischaracterization of the events that occurred before the AU. Second, an examination of Beef Nebraska\u2019s interrogatories shows that the AU was correct in his assessment of their relevance. The majority of the interrogatories appear to be designed to elicit information more relevant to enabling Beef Nebraska to choose sellers with whom to conduct future business or to determining why USDA was enforcing \u00a7 228b(c) than to allowing Beef Nebraska to prepare its defense. For example, one interrogatory asked USDA to \u201c[s]tate the name of any ... company ... which has ... complained ... about Beef Nebraska\u2019s banking practices.\u201d Whatever may be Beef Nebraska\u2019s right to pre-hearing discovery, nothing required the AU to sift through the far-reaching motions in the hope of finding an interrogatory relevant to the preparation of Beef Nebraska\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">In light of Beef Nebraska\u2019s prehearing access to exhibits and witness lists and the irrelevance of its interrogatories, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>we need not decide the extent to which the statutes and regulations on which it relies require an AU to compel answers to interrogatories that <em>are </em>material to a packer\u2019s preparation of its defense. In passing, however, it is noteworthy that the statutes and regulations relied on by Beef Nebraska have no such requirement. <em>See Fairbank v. Hardin, </em>429 F.2d 264, 268 (9th Cir.) (\u201cThe Packers &amp; Stockyards Act makes no provision for pre-trial discovery and the rules of practice governing proceedings under the act do not provide for discovery.\u201d) (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 943 (1970). Similarly, we need not decide the extent to which the Constitution protects packers\u2019 right to answers to their interrogatories. <em>Compare Withrow v. Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 46 (1975) (due process requirement of fair trial in a fair tribunal applies to administrative agencies which adjudicate) <em>and McClelland v. Andrus, </em>606 F.2d 1278, 1286 (D.C.Cir.1979) (before administrative agency, \u201cdiscovery must be granted if in the particular situation a refusal to do so would so prejudice a party as to deny him due process.\u201d) <em>with Silverman v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, </em>549 F.2d 28, 33 (7th Cir.1977) (\u201cThere is no basic constitutional right to pretrial discovery in administrative proceedings____ Nevertheless the due process clause does require the fundamental fairness of the administrative hearing.\u201d) <em>and NLRB v. Interboro Contractors, Inc., </em>432 F.2d 854, 857-58 (2d Cir.1970) (\u201cIt is well settled that parties to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings are not entitled to pre-trial discovery as a matter of constitutional right.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 915 (1971). To whatever extent such a right exists, it clearly was not violated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the AU did not deprive Beef Nebraska of its right to obtain answers to its interrogatories, to whatever extent such right exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">To summarize:</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">Section 228b(c) makes \u201c[a]ny delay ... by a ... packer purchasing livestock, [in] the collection of funds as herein provided\u201d an unfair practice under the Act. When interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning, the words of the statute proscribe acts by packers which extend the \u201cfloat\u201d on checks used to pay livestock sellers. Beef Nebraska\u2019s use of a geographically remote bank had just that effect. We therefore hold that its use of checks drawn on the Palmer Bank to pay livestock sellers resulted in a \u201cdelay\u201d in the \u201ccollection of funds\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 228b(c). We hold also that the AU did not deprive Beef Nebraska of its right to answers to its interrogatories, to whatever extent such right exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">Petition for review denied; order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\">. Beef Nebraska also claims that the judicial officer erred in taking notice of certain documents and that the order of the judicial officer was \"overly broad\u201d in that it purported to restrict the actions of Beef Nebraska\u2019s officers, directors, agents, and employees, who were not named in USDA\u2019s complaint. We hold that these claims are without merit. The judicial officer's order was not overly broad since it reached activities only \"in connection with [Beef Nebraska\u2019s] operations as a packer\u201d. <em>Cf. Bruhn's Freezer Meats v. USDA, </em>438 F.2d 1332, 1343 (8th Cir.1971). Even if the judicial officer erred in taking notice of the documents, Beef Nebraska has failed to show that the error was prejudicial. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
