The trial began on January 6, 1986. At that time, Clark entered a plea of guilty, reserving his right to urge on appeal the protection of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">There was a lapse of 165 days between the indictment and commencement of trial. The Speedy Trial Act requires trial within 70 days, not counting the excludable delays countenanced by the statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h). The issue presented on this appeal is straightforward: Do the excludable delays reduce the countable days between indictment and trial to less than 70? We find that they do, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">On August 16, 1985, Clark moved under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241 for a judicial determination of his competency to stand trial. On August 22, 1985 the district court ordered that Clark be taken to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri, for a competency evaluation. On October 16,1985 a member of the psychiatric staff at the Medical Center notified the court that the psychiatric evaluation was complete. On October 23, 1985 Clark was returned to Texas. The Speedy Trial Act specifically excludes \u201cdelay resulting from any proceeding, including any examination, to determine the mental competency ... of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(A). Thus the 61-day period from August 16 to October 16, was excludable.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-17\">The statute also excludes certain periods of time for ruling on motions, once all necessary documents are before the court. As the Supreme Court noted recently in <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>476 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 1871, 90 L.Ed.2d 299 (1986), the effect of pretrial motions on the time limits of the Speedy Trial Act is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F). That section on its face dictates the time exclusion applicable to motions requiring a hearing. While the section also speaks generally to motions which do not require a hearing, the Supreme Court in <em>Henderson </em>stated that the particular rule governing motions which do not require a hearing is \u00a7 3161(h)(l)(J). 476 U.S. at -, 106 S.Ct. at 1876, 90 L.Ed.2d at 308. While a motion for a judicial determination of competency may involve a hearing, one is not always required.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the case at bar no hearing was held, and no ruling was made on the motion other than the ruling implicit in the court\u2019s proceeding to trial on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-22\">Section 3161(h)(l)(J) excludes \u201cdelay reasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty days, during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court.\u201d Applying this provision to the factual scenario in Clark\u2019s case results in the exclusion of at least 30 days after October 16.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-23\">After deducting the 91 days attributable to the competency motion, the indictment-to-trial interval is reduced to 74 days. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Examination of the record reflects other filings which occasion excludable delays, including a motion to dismiss the indictment filed by Clark\u2019s counsel on December 18, 1985, and a <em>pro se </em>motion by Clark on that day entitled \u201cMotion to Revoke PreTrial Detention Order.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial began on January 6, 1986,19 days later. Without deciding whether all 19 days should be excluded, in the setting presented it cannot be gainsaid that at least four days should. With that allowance, it is apparent that the trial began within 70 countable days after the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The judgment of the district court denying the requested dismissal under the Speedy Trial Act is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241 provides in pertinent part: \"The court shall grant the motion, or shall order such a hearing on its own motion, if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect____\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"a0i-dedup-0\">. We assume without deciding that the competency \u00a1ssue was under advisement by the court from and after October 16, 1985, the date on which the court was advised of the completion of appellant\u2019s competency testing. The parties have not informed us, nor does the record reflect whether the court had at that date received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>all of the documents needed to determine competency. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1871, 90 L.Ed.2d 299 (1986). If more time had been required for receipt of additional filings, or if the court had found a hearing necessary, that additional time also would have been excludable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"ANcQ\">. Although handwritten, this motion was artfully drawn and consisted of a three-page motion, a three-page memorandum of authorities, including pertinent statutory citations, and a proposed order for the court. We therefore do not here decide what effect, if any, is to be given under the Speedy Trial Act to meaningless <em>pro se </em>filings sometimes made in criminal cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
