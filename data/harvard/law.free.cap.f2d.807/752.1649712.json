Ulrich and Department of Health &amp; Human Services Regional Attorney Paul Cacioppo appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for summary judgment in a <em>Bivens </em>-type constitutional tort action brought against them by Billie Jo McAlister. <em>See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">McAlister\u2019s present action arises from a complaint, which he is now pursuing administratively, of handicap discrimination against him by his former employer, the Social Security Administration. McAlister contends Ulrich and Cacioppo\u2019s failure to investigate his discrimination claim, to meet with him, or to answer his questions, violated his rights to due process and access to the courts. Ulrich and Cacioppo moved for summary judgment on the ground they were protected from suit by either absolute or qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We agree with the district court that McAlister\u2019s complaint is difficult to comprehend, but as we read his pleadings, the complaint is cast as a <em>Bivens </em>-type constitutional tort claim. The United States Supreme Court, however, has refused to extend <em>Bivens </em>to encompass claims brought by federal employees for constitutional violations arising out of their employment relationship. <em>See Bush v. Lucas, </em>462 U.S. 367, 390, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 2417, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983). <em>Cf. Premachandra v. United States, </em>739 F.2d 392, 394 (8th Cir.1984) (civil service remedies exclusive redress for wrongfully discharged federal employees) (relying on <em>Bush). </em>Thus, McAlister has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment and remand with directions to dismiss McAlis-ter\u2019s complaint. Because we dismiss for failure to state a claim, we do not reach the issue of immunity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
