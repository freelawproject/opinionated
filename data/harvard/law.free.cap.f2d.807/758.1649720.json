For reversal, he submits that he was denied a fair trial because his defense counsel improperly was prevented from making certain remarks at the conclusion of his opening statement. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Defendant\u2019s attorney attempted to conclude his opening remarks by requesting the jury to \u201ckeep an open mind\u201d with respect to the evidence, and to avoid reaching a decision until all the evidence had been presented. The United States Attorney objected, claiming that the statements constituted improper argument to the jury, and the District Court sustained the objection. Defendant\u2019s attorney again attempted to make the same statement, and a similar objection was also sustained. Defendant\u2019s attorney concluded by asking that the jury \u201c[j]ust hear all the evidence in this case, and after you have heard it all, then make up your mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">A district court has discretion to regulate the content of opening statements. <em>United States v. Zielie, </em>734 F.2d 1447, 1455 (11th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied sub nom., </em>469 U.S. 1189, 105 S.Ct. 957, 83 L.Ed.2d 964 (1985) <em>and </em>469 U.S. 1216, 105 S.Ct. 1192, 84 L.Ed.2d 338 (1985). Although we perceive nothing improper about the statement defendant\u2019s attorney wished to make, we do not believe that the ruling of the District Court amounted to an abuse of discretion. The District Court previously had instructed the jury that defendant was entitled to the presumption of innocence, and informed the jurors of their duty to \u201c[k]eep an open mind\u201d about the charges until they had heard all the evidence. Moreover, defendant\u2019s attorney ultimately was successful in making the desired statement to the jury, as is evident from the above-quoted portion of the transcript. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
