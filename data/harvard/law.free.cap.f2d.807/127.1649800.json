We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Jackson, who suffers from a seizure disorder, filed for disability benefits. His claim denied, Jackson sought judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s denial. Following Jackson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which the Secretary did not oppose, the district court granted him disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Jackson\u2019s attorney subsequently filed a petition for attorney\u2019s fees, which the Secretary did not oppose. Although no specific statute was cited as authority for a fee award, the language of the petition paralleled the language contained in the EAJA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court entered two orders, one allowing fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1) (1982), and the other disallowing fees under the EAJA. The district court denied Jackson\u2019s attorney\u2019s motion for a rehearing on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b200-18\">Under the EAJA, a prevailing party shall be awarded attorney\u2019s fees if the government\u2019s position is not substantially justified, unless special circumstances make the award unjust.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (West Supp.1986).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Secretary bears the burden of proving that its position in the administrative and judicial proceedings below was substantially justified. <em>Keasler v. United States, </em>766 F.2d 1227, 1231 (8th Cir.1985) (in Eighth Circuit, \u201cgovernment\u2019s position\u201d includes positions at both prelitigation and litigation stages). Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s judgment denying an award under the EAJA is not to be disturbed on appeal unless it constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. Derickson Co. v. NLRB, </em>774 F.2d 229, 232 (8th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-19\">For the Secretary\u2019s position to be substantially justified, the Secretary must show that the position was \u201cclearly reasonable, well founded in law and fact, solid though not necessarily correct.\u201d <em>United States v. 1,378.65 Acres of Land, </em>794 F.2d 1313,1318 (8th Cir.1986) (footnote omitted). <em>See Iowa Express Distributors, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>739 F.2d 1305, 1308 (8th Cir.) (government must show a reasonable basis in facts alleged and legal theory advanced and a reasonable connection between facts and legal theory), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1088, 105 S.Ct. 595, 83 L.Ed.2d 704 (1984). A finding that there was no substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision to deny an application does not necessarily mean an award of attorney\u2019s fees is appropriate. <em>United States v. 1,378.65 Acres of Land, </em>794 F.2d at 1318 n. 3 (substantial justification standard is a lesser standard than substantial evidence standard) (citing 131 Cong.Rec. H4763 (daily ed. June 24, 1985) (statement of Congressman Kindness)); <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Herron v. Bowen, </em>788 F.2d 1127, 1130 (5th Cir.1986). <em>Cf. Keasler, </em>766 F.2d at 1231 (fact that Secretary lost case before district court does not mean the Secretary\u2019s position was without substantial justification).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The Secretary\u2019s failure to oppose the petition for fees does not preclude a denial of a fee award under the EAJA. <em>Campbell v. Bowen, </em>800 F.2d 1247, 1249 (4th Cir.1986). On the other hand, cases in which summary judgment are granted are ones for which it seems Congress envisioned the fee award could be justified; they raise the possibility that the government\u2019s position was unreasonable. <em>Keasler, </em>766 F.2d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The Secretary urges that its position was justified in the light of the inconsistent evidence Jackson presented. Although the subjective testimony suggested more frequent seizure episodes, the progress notes from the Veterans Administration and the medical opinion of one physician, who had evaluated Jackson on referral by the Secretary, indicated that Jackson experienced approximately one major motor seizure per month. Consequently, the Secretary maintains that it was reasonable to conclude that the requirements for a seizure disability \u2014 that major motor seizures occur more frequently than once a month \u2014 had not been met. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 at \u00a7 11.02 (1986) (major motor seizure requirement for epilepsy).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The reasonableness of the Secretary\u2019s position is a close question. One view of the subjective evidence and other medical record suggests that Jackson suffered from fifteen to eighteen or more seizures a year. Unless someone is with Jackson constantly, it is impossible for any person, including a physician, to state definitely how many seizures Jackson suffers. Consequently, it would appear unreasonable for the Secretary to have relied only on the two medical documents to conclude that Jackson did not suffer a disabling seizure disorder. <em>See Cornella v. Schweiker, </em>728 F.2d 978, 984 (8th Cir.1984) (government\u2019s position unreasonable in fact when relied on isolated part of evidence and ignored other overwhelming evidence of disability); <em>Wheat v. Heckler, </em>763 F.2d 1025, 1031 (8th Cir.1985) (Secretary disregarded overwhelming weight of evidence); <em>Weakley v. Bowen, </em>803 F.2d 575, 578-79 (10th Cir. 1986) (Secretary\u2019s reliance on only one physician\u2019s testimony not substantially justified when the testimony conflicted with other medical opinions, testimony at hearing, and history of patient\u2019s illness).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Another view of the evidence, however, focuses on the fact that the other medical records only restated Jackson\u2019s statement to the reporting physicians on the frequency of his seizures and did not reveal the physicians\u2019 independent judgments on the frequency. Therefore, all the evidence pointing to a more disabling seizure disorder was subjective, and it appears reasonable for the Secretary to have relied on the only objective medical evidence stating a medical opinion to conclude that Jackson did not meet the disability requirements. <em>Cf. Campbell, </em>800 F.2d at 1250 (treating physician\u2019s and consulting physician\u2019s conflicting opinions made on the basis of same data, but Secretary can reasonably reject treating physician\u2019s opinion in deference to conflict). <em>See Donovan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>v. DialAmerica Marketing, Inc., </em>757 F.2d 1376, 1389 (3d Cir.) (closeness of case is evidence of substantial justification), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 246, 88 L.Ed.2d 255 (1985). Furthermore, this is not a case in which the Secretary rejected undisputed evidence which showed a <em>per se </em>entitlement to benefits, <em>see Herron, </em>788 F.2d at 1132 (Secretary\u2019s position therefore without substantial justification); denied Jackson\u2019s claim without researching the issue, <em>see Granville House, Inc. v. Department of Health, Educ. &amp; Welfare, </em>796 F.2d 1046, 1049 (8th Cir.1986); substituted its judgment for that of the physicians, <em>see Dennis v. Heckler, </em>756 F.2d 971, 976 (3d Cir.1985) (Secretary\u2019s position therefore without substantial justification); or erred in applying the guidelines to Jackson\u2019s disability, <em>see Washington v. Heckler, </em>756 F.2d 959, 966-68 (3d Cir.1985) (Secretary\u2019s position therefore without substantial justification).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Because at least one permissible view of the evidence leads to the conclusion that the government has shown a reasonable basis in fact and law for its position, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not awarding attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-12\">. The Honorable Garnett Thomas Eisele, Chief Judge for the United States District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-13\">. Additionally, the motion for summary judgment had contained a prayer for attorney\u2019s fees and cited the EAJA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b200-14\">. The special circumstances exception helps to ensure that the government can advance in good faith novel but credible interpretations of law. <em>Keasler v. United States, </em>766 F.2d 1227, 1231 n. 8 (8th Cir.1985) (citing H.R.Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 11, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4953, 4990). The Secretary has not argued this ground on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b200-21\">. The court has discretionary authority to award fees to a prevailing party under 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2412(b) (West Supp.1986). This section does not require the showing of substantial justification. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\">. Congressman Kindness also referred to a specific sentence in the committee\u2019s report which states: \"Agency action found to be arbitrary and capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence is virtually certain not to have been substantially justified under the [EAJA].\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 120, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 9-10, <em>reprinted in </em>1985 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 132, 138. He stated that this sentence was not meant to confuse the distinction between the substantial evidence rule and the substantial justification standard which is novel to the EAJA. 131 Cong. Rec. H4763 (daily ed. June 2d, 1985) (statement of Congressman Kindness).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
