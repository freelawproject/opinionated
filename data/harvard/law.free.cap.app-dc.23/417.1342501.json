In a suit on a written instrument, which purports to embody the entire transaction and contains no such ambiguity as would warrant the introduction of parol evidence under any established exception to the rule that excludes such evidence in explanation or contradiction of the terms of a written instrument, an affidavit of defense is insufficient which does not deny its execution but seeks to explain its recitals.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b433-10\">2. An agreement between borrower and lender which provides that upon the sale of certain tax certificates delivered by the former to the latter as security for the loan, the lender shall share in profits that may be made upon the sale of the certificates, which profits are expressly promised in addition to the repayment of the loan and interest thereon, does not make the lender a partner of the borrower.</syllabus>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b433-12\">No. 1385.</docketnumber>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"A7Ms\">Submitted March 17, 1904.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AD5\">Decided April 5, 1904.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-13\">Hearing on an appeal by the defendants from a summary judgment of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia rendered under the 73d rule of that court, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense in an action upon a written contract</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A2K\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-15\">The Court in the opinion stated the case as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-16\">This is an appeal from a summary judgment rendered upon motion under rule 73 of the supreme court of the District of Columbia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-17\">The action was upon the following instrument:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-18\">This agreement made this 8th day of April, 1901, by and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>tween Robert Y.

Deponents further say that the contract entered into between the plaintiffs and them is truly set out in Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 of said declaration.

The facts stated in the affidavit of defense are not inconsistent with the contract, are not an enlargement of its terms, but are merely explanatory of its provisions. Without this explanation, or some explanation of its provisions, the contract is incapable of interpretation because of uncertainty. <em>Stoop </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>100 Mass. 63; <em>Whelan </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>4 App. D.

The court will look beyond the terms of the instrument itself to the real transaction; and when it is shown, as the parties have a right to show, that the instrument was intended as a partnership transaction, and not a loan or a sale, but an agreement to repay out of the proceeds of the venture, then the court will give effect to the actual contract of the parties. <em>Pugh </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>96 U.
