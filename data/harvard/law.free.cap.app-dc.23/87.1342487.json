The provision of \u00a7 966, D. C. Code, that \u201clegal separation from bed and board may be granted for drunkenness, cruelty, and desertion,\u201d read in connection with the other sections of the Code relating to divorce, and their index or headlines, which plainly contemplate and provide for the two kinds of divorce known to the law before the adaption of the Code, namely, divorce <em>a vinculo </em>and divorce <em>a mensa et thoro, </em>has no application to voluntary deeds of separation, nor does it apply to divorce <em>a vinculo, </em>but moans that a divorce <em>a mensa et thoro </em>may be granted for the canses mentioned; the prefixing of the adjective 'Regal\u201d to the words \u201cseparation from bed and board\u201d being only an inartificial mode of expressing the meaning of what would have been better expressed by the use of the word \u201cdivorce\u201d instead of the term \u201clegal separation.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b103-11\">2. That portion of \u00a7 966, D. C.

The husband answered the petition, and set up former adjudication of the cause alleged as to part of the time covered by the petition, and denied the allegation of cruel treatment as to the residue of the time embraced by the allegations of the petition; and he also denies that the court has jurisdiction to grant the relief prayed, because, as he alleges, there is no statute or law that gives the court jurisdiction in such case as that presented by the petitioner.

The Code of the District of Columbia only authorizes the court to grant a divorce from the bond of marriage, and such a divorce can only be granted where one of the parties has committed adultery during the marriage. There is no other provision in the Code for granting a divorce (\u00a7 966), except where the bill of complaint prays for a divorce from the bond of marriage, and in such case the court is given authority \u201cto decree a <em>divorce </em>from bed and board if the causes prove to be sufficient,\u201d etc. (\u00a7 968). The validity and effect of the provision contained in \u00a7 968 is commented on hereafter in this brief. The term \u201cdivorce\u201d usually imporis a dissolution of marriage <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>33 Cal. 353), and, while it is sometimes used in a general way as including also a partial separation of the marriage relation, such as a decree of separation, a decree <em>a mensa et thoro, </em>or a judicial separation, yet, unless the word \u201cdivorce\u201d is qualified, it is understood as importing a dissolution of the marriage. It is clear from the wording of \u00a7 966 that the legislature did not intend, under the provisions contained in that section, to grant jurisdiction to the court to decree a <em>divorce </em>from bed and board. \"By using the word \u201cdivorce\u201d in one part of the section last referred to, and in another part of the same section the words \u201clegal separation,\u201d it is plain that the legislature intended to make a distinction between the two kinds of relief to be granted to the parties litigant. The language used in \u00a7 966 cannot in any way be changed by the heading of that section, for the reason that the language of the section is unambiguous and susceptible of but one construction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Popp, </em>45 Md. 432. Section 966 is headed \u201ccauses for divorce <em>a vinculo, </em>and for divorce <em>a mensa et thoro \u201d </em>and yet under this same heading provisions for declaring marriage contracts void are made, as well as for the legal separation and for divorce. The headings of sections to the Code are no more a part of the Code than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>marginal notes to any legislative enactments. If we review briefly the history of the enactments of the Code of the District of Columbia, it is easily understood how the particular heading of \u00a7 966 was made. It will be remembered under the Revised Statutes of the United States relating to the District of Columbia there were provisions for two kinds of divorces, namely: A <em>divorce </em>from the bond of marriage (\u00a7 738, Rev. Stat. D. C.), and a <em>divorce </em>from bed and board (\u00a7 739, Rev. Stat. D. C.). These sections <em>were </em>(originally) almost literally incorporated in the Code of the District of Columbia as it passed the House and Senate, and after it had passed these two bodies of Congress a vote to reconsider in the hurry of the last hours of the Congress was moved and adopted in the Senate, and the provisions in the Code allowing a <em>divorce </em>from bed and board were stricken out, and \u00a7 966 of the Code was adopted in lieu thereof, but leaving the heading to that section without amendment. As the Code was originally introduced and adopted by Congress that heading was appropriate, but after the amendment had been adopted it was entirely inappropriate to that section. Congressional Record, vol. 34, part 4, 56th Cong. Sess. pp. 3496, 3497. It is claimed by counsel for the appellant that the language of \u00a7 970 of the Code, where the words \u201cand divorce from bed and board\u201d are used, \u201cpresupposes that provision had already been made for divorce <em>a mensa et </em>thoro, and fixes the purpose of Congress in amending \u00a7 966,\u201d but such is not the inference to- be drawn from such words, but it is either a fair inference that the words used in \u00a7 970 refer, or originally referred, to the same words, namely: \u201cDivorce from bed and board\u201d used in \u00a7 968, where such a decree is authorized, or was originally authorized, in a bill or proceeding in which an absolute divorce or divorce from the bond of marriage is prayed; or the language used in \u00a7 970, namely, the words \u201cdivorce <em>a mensa et thoro \u201d </em>could with all propriety refer to any divorce <em>a mensa et thoro </em>granted prior to the adoption of the Code, when the law authorized a divorce <em>a mensa et thoro.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-6\">2. But it is submitted that the provision of \u00a7 966, contained in the second <em>proviso, </em>if it were intended thereby to <em>confer </em>upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the supreme court of the District of Columbia <em>authority </em>to grant a <em>divorce </em>from bed and board, is void for uncertainty in its terms, and certainly the court could not give the language used in the second proviso of \u00a7 966 effect without additional legislation. The <em>degree </em>or the <em>extent </em>of neither the term \u201cdrunkenness,\u201d nor \u201ccruelty,\u201d nor \u201cdivorce,\u201d on which a legal separation could be granted, is set forth in that section, or any part of the Code. If it were intended to be an enactment of a new power conferred upon the court, it would be necessary, it would seem, to define the meaning of the term and the extent or degree of \u201cdrunkenness,\u201d \u201ccruelty,\u201d or \u201cdesertion.\u201d This is not done, and it is respectfully submitted that it ivas the intention of Congress, by said second proviso, only to reserve to the supreme court of the District of Columbia the power and jurisdiction which it had previously, \u2014 and prior to the year 1860, before any divorce laws existed in the District of Columbia, \u2014 to grant \u201clegal separation\u201d between husband and wife. \u201cBefore the passage of the act of Congress of the 19th of June, 1860 (see 12 Stat. at L. p. 50), no court in this District possessed jurisdiction over the subject of divorce. At common law neither a court of law nor a court of equity have power to grant a divorce (see Willard, Eq. Jut. p. 655).\u201d <em>Hatfield </em>v. <em>Hatfield, </em>6 D. C. 81. But while prior to the year 1860 <em>no </em>court had jurisdiction to grant a <em>divorce, </em>yet, as was decided in the case of <em>Cheever </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>6 D. C. 154, \u201cin a proper case the court had power to decree a <em>separation \u201d </em>It must be recognized that there is a strong sentiment against any legislation conferring power and jurisdiction on courts to grant divorces for any ground except adultery, and certainly this sentiment was sufficiently potent to prevent Congress from passing such a law, under the conditions surrounding the enactment of the Code of law of this District.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-5\">It is therefore respectfully submitted that it was not intended by the second proviso in \u00a7 966, Code, now under discussion, to confer upon the supreme court of the District of Columbia any further additional power than it had prior to the year 1860 and thereafter, but it was intended by said second proviso only to reserve to the court that power which it before had, and not to ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>elude or take away that power by the principal enacting clause of said \u00a7 966. \u201cThe office of a proviso generally\"\u2019 said Mr. Justice Story, in <em>Minis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>40 U. S., 14 Pet. 423, 445, 10 L. ed. 791, 799, \u201cis either to exclude or except something from the enacting clause, or to qualify or restrain its generalities, or to exclude some possible ground of misinterpretation of it, as extending to clauses not intended by the legislature to be brought within its purview.\u201d Cited with approval in <em>Austin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>155 U. S. 417, 431, 39 L. ed. 206, 312.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-5\">The bill or petition in this case does not pray for an absolute divorce, so that no relief could be granted to the petitioner under \u00a7 968 of the Code, and the effect and authority of that section are not, therefore, under discussion. If they were, it would be contended that that section (968) is absolutely void and incapable .of execution, and the language of this last-mentioned section may be touched upon more at length in the oral argument of this cause.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b103-14\"><em> Divorce. </em>\u2014 As to drunkenness as ground for divorce, see the presentation of authorities in editorial note to <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>34 <em>L. </em>R.

Causes arising after divorce <em>a mensa et </em>thoro.\u2014 Where a divorce from bed and board has been decreed the court may afterwards decree an absolute divorce between the parties for any cause arising since the first decree and sufficient to entitle the complaining party to such decree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">These sections are all arranged under the title Divorce, and they plainly contemplate and provide for the two kinds of divorce that were known to the law before the adoption of the Code, that is, divorce <em>a vinculo </em>and divorce- <em>a mema et thoro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">But it is contended that there is such ambiguity and uncertainty introduced into \u00a7 966 by the employment of the terms <em>legal separation </em>from bed and board, that it is impossible to determine to what kind of divorce or separation those terms refer, \u2014whether to divorce <em>a mensa et thoro, </em>or to some other kind of separation. It is argued here, and the opinion has been expressed by the court below, that \u201cthe expression <em>\u2018legal </em>separation\u2019 was unknown to our law before it found its place in the Code; and, in the absence of some definition in the statute, is of a very uncertain significance; for separation by decree <em>a mensa et thoro, </em>or by voluntary separation of the parties, executed in legal form, may be equally comprehended by the phrase legal separation,\u2019 as would be the result of a divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii.\u201d </em>And further, it is said that \u201cthere can be no decree for divorce in the absence of an amendment of the law which shall state distinctly (according to what may be the wish of Congress) whether the courts are to be empowered to decree on these cases at all, and if so, whether they are to grant the divorce according to the provisions of the old law, or according to those of the Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>It may well be conceded that the provisions contained in \u00a7 966 are net, in all respects, very happily expressed, and the phraseology employed is not the most appropriate that conld have been selected. But we think there is no&gt; real difficulty in arriving at the intention of the legislature, from the language employed. We cannot suppose for a moment that the terms \u201clegal separation from bed and board,\u201d as employed in the Code, can have any application to voluntary deeds of separation, for in respect to them the courts are not required to make decrees to give them legal effect; and it is equally plain, we think, that those terms do not apply to or describe the divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii, </em>as that divorce is final and does more than separate from bed and board. The term, \u201clegal separation from bed and board,\u201d expresses substantially the same meaning as the term, divorce <em>a mensa et thoro. </em>The prefixing the adjective <em>legal </em>to the words, \u201cseparation from bed and board\u201d is only an inartificial mode of expressing the meaning of what would have been better expressed by the use of the word \u201cdivorce\u201d instead of the term \u201clegal separation.\u201d But reading the several sections of the Code, to which we have referred, in the light of and by the aid furnished by the index or headlines of these sections, we think no doubt can exist as to the real meaning of the authors of the Code; and that \u201clegal separation from bed and board\u201d is a synonymous term with divorce <em>a mensa et thoro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The meaning of the word \u201cdivorce\u201d is separation; and, as defined by the best text writers upon the subject, \u201ca divorce is a lawful separation of husband and wife, made before a competent judge on due cognizance had of the cause, and sufficient proof made thereof.\u201d And according to another definition, \u201cit is a sentence pronounced by an ecclesiastical judge, whereby a man and woman formerly married to each other are separated and parted, according to law.\u201d Godolphin, Abr. 493; Shelford, Marr. &amp; Div. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The separation from bed and board is only a partial divorce, and does not dissolve the bond of marriage. Such divorce, by judicial decree, gives legal effect to actual separation of husband and wife; but retains power and jurisdiction over the parties and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the matter of separation. The distinction between divorce from bed and board, and from the bond of marriage, is not mentioned in Scripture, and was unknown to the ancient church. It was devised by the Canonists and schoolmen, to avoid the dissolution of the sacred bond of marriage, and was first established by the decrees of the Council of Trent in 1563. Shelford, Harr. &amp; Div. 365. The writers of the highest authority speak of this partial divorce as judicial separation. Chancellor Kent, in his Commentaries, Vol. 2, p. 125, says: \u201cThe court may decree a separation from bed and board forever, or for a limited time, in its discretion, and the decree may be revoked at any time by the same court by which it was pronounced,\u201d etc. And again, in speaking of this partial divorce, the author says [p. 128] : \u201cAnd on these separations from bed and board, tlie courts intrusted with tbe jurisdiction of tbe subject will make suitable provision for the support of the wife and children out of the husband\u2019s estate, and enforce the decree by sequestration.\u201d That is, beyond doubt, the kind of divorce contemplated by the section of .the Code, and which the terms \u201clegal separation from bed and board\u201d are used to describe.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">But it is argued that because there is no limitation of time affixed to these causes for which this partial divorce or separation may he decreed, therefore the provision of the Code in relation to it is too indefinite and uncertain to he carried into operation, and that there is no power in the courts to grant such divorce for separation from bed and hoard, until there shall have been an amendment by act of Congress procured, defining with greater certainty the causes for which such partial divorces may be granted. But we fail to perceive the force of tbis objection. There are three causes mentioned hv <em>the Code </em>for which such partial divorces may be granted, that is to say, drunkenness, cruelty, and desertion. The statute does not declare for what length of time drunkenness shall continue, or what degree of cruelly shall exist, or for what time actual desertion shall continue; but these causes are all well known to and defined in the divorce law of the country, and there can he no difficulty in arriving at the legal definition of the terms employed. In some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>States where these causes are made grounds for divorce, there is no limitation of time prescribed for the continuance of drunkenness, or desertion, any more than for cruelty. This is so in New York, North Carolina, and other States. The meaning of the terms employed is left to the settled construction placed upon them by the courts, in the administration of the divorce law of the country. In many of the States, as was the case in this District prior to the adoption of the Code, periods of limitation are prescribed for the continuance of desertion and also of drunkenness, before the right- to relief accrues. But the law in that respect has been changed in this District by the adoption of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">We think there was error committed by the court below in holding that there was no jurisdiction to entertain the petition for divorce <em>a mensa et thoro, </em>and in refusing the order to allow the taking of testimony in support of the allegations of the petition filed by the appellant. We must, therefore, reverse the order appealed from and remand the cause, that further proceedings may be had not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Order <em>reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
