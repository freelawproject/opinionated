The Irrigation Companies claim that Vincent's water right has been partially forfeited and partially abandoned. The district court granted summary judgment to Vincent. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 The Irrigation Companies are nonprofit Utah corporations that distribute water to their shareholders for irrigation of agricultural land in Millard County. They filed a complaint in district court alleging that Vincent's water right had been partially forfeited and partially abandoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 The water right in question was awarded to the Samuel McIntyre Investment Company (McIntyre) in 1936 during a general adjudication of the Sevier River system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Leading up to the general adjudication, the state engineer catalogued all water usage in the Sevier River system and prepared a proposed determination of water rights. The state engineer proposed to award McIntyre 5,000 acre feet of water annually to irrigate 1,051.5 acres of land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 The district court heard and addressed objections to the proposed determination and then issued a final decree, referred to as the \"Cox Decree.\" The Cox Decree awarded McIntyre twenty-two cubic feet of water per second from March 1 through October 1 of each year. This water included a storage component from April 16 to October 1, permitting McIntyre to store 90% of its allocation in the Sevier Bridge Reservoir for future use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Vincent purchased this water right in 1998, when it also purchased the McIntyre farm. Vincent has used the farm and water right to grow crops, such as corn, hay, and alfalfa, and to run a commercial bird-hunting operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Irrigation Companies allege that during the twenty-year limitations period preceding the filing of their complaint in 2008,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vincent and its predecessor forfeited and abandoned a portion of the water right. They allege that from 1988 to 1998, McIntyre irrigated only 830 of its 1,051.5 acres, and that after 1998, Vincent cultivated fewer than 900 of the 1,051.5 acres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Vincent contends that it was unable to cultivate all 1,051.5 acres because in times of water shortages, the Sevier River Commissioner reduced its diversion right. Vincent further argues that it should not be faulted for failing to use water between March 1 and April 15 because water could not be beneficially used while the ground was unprepared and sometimes frozen, and there was no storage right during this period. Vincent also defends on the grounds that it irrigated many acres of natural habitat for commercial bird hunting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 The parties also disagree on the purely legal question of whether partial forfeiture and partial abandonment were available in\n   Utah before 2002. In 2002, the legislature amended Utah Code section 73-1-4 (the Forfeiture Statute) to clarify that partial forfeiture was an available remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20Utah%20Laws%20120\">\n    2002 Utah Laws 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As amended, the Forfeiture Statute provided that \"the water right\n   <em>\n    or the unused portion of that water right\n   </em>\n   \" could be forfeited. UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-1-4(3)(a) (subsequent to 2002 amendments) (emphasis added). Before the amendment, the code stated only that \"the water right\" could be forfeited. UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-1-4(1)(a) (prior to 2002 amendments).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 The district court held that Utah law did not provide for partial forfeiture or partial abandonment before 2002, and that Vincent was protected from partial forfeiture and partial abandonment after 2002 by an exception located in Utah Code section 73-1-4(3)(f)(i) (subsequent to 2002 amendments).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20Utah%20Laws%20120\">\n    2002 Utah Laws 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This exception stated that \"[t]he provisions of this section shall not apply ... to those periods of time when a surface water source fails to yield sufficient water to satisfy the water right, or when groundwater is not available because of a sustained drought.\" The court held that because Vincent did not receive an uninterrupted flow of twenty-two cubic feet of water per second during any years between 2002 and the filing of the complaint, the Irrigation Companies were \"precluded from claiming either a partial forfeiture, or a partial abandonment.\" The court granted summary judgment to Vincent, and the Irrigation Companies appealed. We have jurisdiction under Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 \"We review a district court's grant of summary judgment for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Basic Research, LLC v.

We determine that the pre-2002 Forfeiture Statute unambiguously permitted partial forfeiture. We next conclude that the exception located in Utah Code section 73-1-4(3)(f)(i) (subsequent to 2002 amendments) is a codification of the physical-causes exception-not a rule that forfeiture can never occur when a water right is not fully satisfied. We also clarify that abandonment is a common-law cause of action that requires a showing of intent to relinquish. Finally, we clarify the proper measure of Vincent's water right and address other issues likely to arise on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I.

We declared that \"if there were a five year continuous period during which [the appropriator] failed to use material amounts of available water, we should hold\n   that a forfeiture\n   <em>\n    of at least part of its right\n   </em>\n   has occurred by virtue of this nonuse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112 (emphasis added). We then applied this standard to the facts of the case and determined that no forfeiture had occurred because the appropriator had fully used its water right in one relevant year and was protected by the \"physical causes\" exception\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in other years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 More recently, in\n   <em>\n    Eskelsen,\n   </em>\n   we noted that \"all of the policy reasons that support forfeiture as a general principle would be furthered by, and hindered without, partial forfeiture.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12119238\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/819/770/\">\n    819 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   775 n. 9. Finally, in 1997, we said that \"[t]he extent of anyone's right to use water ... is limited to that amount which can be put to beneficial use.

The statute could be reasonably interpreted to mean that when an appropriator ceases to use any portion of a water right, that portion of the water right ceases. But it could also be reasonably interpreted to mean that only when an appropriator ceases entirely to use water from a previous appropriation does that right cease.

The district court interpreted this exemption to mean that no forfeiture of any amount can occur during periods when a water right is not fully satisfied.

Even during a shortage, if an appropriator fails to beneficially use material amounts of available water, the amount of available but unused water may be forfeited. The district court's contrary view would create a safe harbor for waste and non-use during times of shortage, which is precisely when efficiency and conservation are most imperative. We therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment as to the post-2002 partial-forfeiture claim and remand for the claim to be reconsidered in a manner consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   III. ABANDONMENT OF A WATER RIGHT IS A COMMON-LAW CLAIM, NOT A STATUTORY CLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 33 The Irrigation Companies also allege that Vincent abandoned part of its water right. The district court treated the abandonment claim as a claim under the Forfeiture Statute, which states that forfeiture occurs when an appropriator\n   <em>\n    \"abandons\n   </em>\n   or ceases to use\" a water right. UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-1-4(3)(a) (2002) (emphasis added.) The district court granted Vincent summary judgment on the abandonment claim based on Utah Code section 73-1-4(3)(f)(i) (subsequent to 2002 amendments)-the exemption that we hold to be a codification of the physical-causes exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Summary judgment on that basis was improper for two reasons. First, the district court erred in interpreting this exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-32. Second, abandonment of a water right is not a statutory claim. Although a form of the word \"abandon\" has been present in the Forfeiture Statute since it was originally promulgated in 1903, our jurisprudence has treated abandonment as a common-law claim, independent of the Forfeiture Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 34 In 1943, we observed,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Abandonment is a separate and distinct concept from that of forfeiture.... While upon the one hand, abandonment is the relinquishment of the right by the owner with the intention to forsake and desert it, forfeiture upon the other hand, is the involuntary or forced loss of the right, caused by the failure of the appropriator or owner to do or perform some act required by the statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Wellsville E.

The abandonment of a water right to the public the same as the abandonment of any other property or right requires that a prior appropriator intentionally release or surrender such right to the public. To thus lose a water right does not necessarily depend on this statute nor require nonuse of such right for any particular length of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Rich County-Otter Creek Irrigation Co. v.

PROPER MEASURE OF VINCENT'S WATER RIGHT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 36 Water rights can be measured in several ways. A flow allowance is the maximum rate at which water may be diverted and can be measured in cubic feet per second or in miner's inches (approximately 500-700 milliliters per second). A volume allowance is the maximum quantity of water that may be diverted during a given irrigation season and is measured in acre feet (the amount of water needed to cover one acre to a depth of one foot) or in cubic feet. Water \"duty\" is the amount of water needed to irrigate an acre in a given geographic region and is generally expressed in acre feet per acre. The Utah legislature has directed courts to measure water in cubic feet per second and in acre feet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-1-2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 37 Here, the authoritative description of Vincent's water right is found in the Cox Decree,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   issued in 1936 at the conclusion of a general adjudication of the Sevier River system. The Cox Decree specifies only the flow component of Vincent's water right: twenty-two cubic feet per second (c.f.s.). As the California Supreme Court explained in 1935, water rights are often expressed in terms of flow when river levels are unpredictable and appropriators \"ha[ve] to take the water when, as[,] and if it [is] in the stream.\"\n   <em>\n    Tulare Irrigation Dist. v. Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation Dist.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2242026\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/3/489/\">\n    3 Cal.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20P.2d%20972\">\n    45 P.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 996 (1935). In such situations, flow awards cannot be thought of as \"continuous awards\" but are limited to the amount of water the appropriator has put and continues to put to beneficial use.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20P.2d%20972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20P.2d%20972\">\n    at 996-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 38 Here, we do not interpret Vincent's water right as a continuous award. If Vincent were to constantly divert twenty-two c.f.s. during an irrigation season, it would draw more than 9,000 acre feet of water, which is far more than Vincent or its predecessors have ever used. The proposed determination drawn up in preparation for the 1936 general adjudication of the Sevier River system indicated that Vincent's predecessor annually used 5,000 acre feet of water. Because the Cox Decree does not indicate that this amount was disputed or altered, we agree with the district court that it is reasonable\n   to infer that the volume component of Vincent's water right is 5,000 acre feet. Thus, Vincent's water right consists of a maximum rate of diversion of twenty-two c.f.s. and a total volume allowance of 5,000 acre feet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   IV. ISSUES LIKELY TO ARISE ON REMAND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    A. Proper Forfeiture Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 39 Forfeiture occurs when an appropriator fails to use material amounts of a water allowance during five or seven consecutive years\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   without securing an extension of time from the state engineer.\n   <em>\n    Rocky Ford Irrigation Co. v. Kents Lake Reservoir Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8868069\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/104/202/\">\n    104 Utah 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8868069\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/104/202/\">\n    135 P.2d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112 (1943) ; UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-1-4(2)(a). Because most flow allowances are not \"continuous awards,\"\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37, appropriators do not forfeit any part of their right by failing to divert water at the maximum flow allowance. A forfeiture analysis should instead focus on volume. If during five consecutive irrigation seasons, an appropriator has failed to use material amounts of its volume allowance, a forfeiture has occurred. The volume component of the water right should be reduced by the unused amount. The flow component may be reduced in proportion to the volume reduction, at the district court's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 40 Materiality, or substantiality, is another important component of a forfeiture analysis. UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-1-4(3)(f)(iii) (2002) (stating that forfeiture does not occur \"when a water user has beneficially used substantially all of a water right within a five-year period\");\n   <em>\n    Rocky Ford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8868069\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/104/202/\">\n    135 P.2d at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the beginning of each growing season, farmers plant their fields according to predictions of how much water will be available that year. If snow levels and other indicators suggest a dry summer, a farmer may reasonably choose to not plant all of her fields. If, in fact, shortages turn out to be less severe than predicted, the farmer in retrospect may have been able to plant slightly more. However, a small amount of non-use, especially when resulting from a reasonable prognostication of how much water would be available, will generally not support a forfeiture. We cannot expect farmers to predict the weather with more certainty than climatologists, and the materiality exemption protects them when they fail to do so. The materiality exemption also serves to deter forfeiture claims premised on de minimis non-use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 41 Finally, the number of acres irrigated is not determinative in a forfeiture analysis, though it may be relevant insofar as it indicates the volume of water used or whether water usage is beneficial. Farmers may reduce the total acres irrigated to grow a more water-intensive crop so long as they beneficially use their full entitlement. The central question in any forfeiture proceeding is whether the appropriator used all of its water allowance in a reasonable manner and for a beneficial purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    B. Early Water\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 42 The parties dispute whether the water available to Vincent and its predecessor between March 1 and April 15 should be counted as available water for purposes of forfeiture analysis. The Cox Decree states that the water right runs from March 1 through October 1. It further states that Vincent's predecessor,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   the Samuel McIntyre Investment Company[,] shall have the right to the use of the water allocated ... as above set forth, to be used by direct diversion from March 1\n   to April 15, both dates inclusive. From April 16 to October 1 in each and every year [it] shall have the right to store and impound in the Sevier Bridge Reservoir 90% of all the water yielded by said river for satisfying [its] rights from April 16 to October 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 43 As discussed in the previous section, the focus of a forfeiture analysis should be on volume. Thus, if Vincent and its predecessor used substantially all of their allotment of 5,000 acre feet, they have not forfeited their water right, even if they did not use any water between March 1 and April 15. Distinguishing the pre-irrigation season would be significant only in a drought year, when the physical-causes exception applies. Under the physical-causes exception, unavailable water cannot be forfeited, but water that is available but not beneficially used can.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. We are not persuaded that the Cox Decree, the proposed determination, or any other authority supports a categorical exclusion of early water from this physical-causes exception analysis. However, on remand, Vincent may seek to persuade the district court that under the physical causes exception, this early water was not available for use because the ground was not ready to receive it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    C. Irrigation of Natural Habitats\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 44 The district court held that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment on the questions of (1) how much water Vincent used on its bird hunting grounds and (2) whether such use was beneficial. We do not disturb this ruling but wish to reiterate that \"watering indigenous vegetation generally is not a beneficial use.\"\n   <em>\n    Butler, Crockett &amp; Walsh Dev. Corp. v.
