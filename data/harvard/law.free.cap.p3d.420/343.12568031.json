These court documents and records were sealed, and have remained sealed, by a series of circuit court orders. The petition also seeks an order prohibiting the circuit court judge from requiring Grube to retain an attorney in order to assert a constitutional right of access to judicial records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon our review of the procedures employed by the circuit court, we conclude that the court did not provide adequate notice and opportunity for interested persons objecting to the sealing to be heard prior to issuing its order and failed to sufficiently articulate the reasoning supporting the order in its findings. In addition, upon reviewing the sealed records and documents, we hold that the substantive requirements for sealing were not met in this case because the record fails to demonstrate a compelling need sufficient to overcome the public's constitutional right of access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We further hold that, because the constitutional right of access inheres in every member of the public and Grube asserted this interest as an individual, Grube had a right to represent himself in the unsealing proceedings. The circuit court therefore also erred by refusing to allow Grube to appear pro se and requiring him to obtain counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Accordingly, we grant the petition and order that the circuit court unseal the documents-provided, however, that the effective date of our directive shall be ten days after the filing of this opinion, unless within the ten days the State requests a hearing to\n   provide additional evidence to demonstrate that the documents or some portion thereof must remain sealed to serve a governmental interest of sufficient gravity to overcome the public's constitutional right of access. Following any such hearing, the circuit court shall promptly prepare specific findings in conformance with the substantive requirements set forth in this opinion if these requirements have been met; otherwise our order shall take immediate effect. We further order that Grube be permitted to represent himself in any further proceedings on this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Criminal Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Alan Ahn, a Honolulu police officer, and Tiffany Masunaga, his girlfriend, were charged by indictment in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) with multiple drug-related offenses on August 26, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ahn has since pleaded no contest and been sentenced to a sixty-day jail term as a condition of a four-year probationary term. By contrast, the public record indicates that Masunaga's case is still pending as of this filing, and no disposition of the charges is reflected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Sealing of Records, Files, and Proceedings Relating to the September 9, 2016 Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On Friday, September 9, 2016, the circuit court held a hearing scheduled to begin at 4:00 p.m., the nature and scope of which is not discernible from the public record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the proceeding, the circuit court entered an order sealing the entire legal file in the case. On September 16, the court filed a second order superseding its September 9 sealing order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Then, on October 11, 2016, the circuit court issued a third order setting aside its September 9 and September 16 sealing orders. The court concluded that \"[u]pon further review ... the prior orders were overly broad in that they resulted in the sealing of the entire legal file pertaining to both Defendants.\" The court redefined the scope of the previous order to seal \"those documents, court minutes, transcripts and other information relating to the September 9, 2016 proceeding,\" including the two previous orders that it had set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its October 11 order, the circuit court stated that it had been advised that the proceedings in this case related to potentially one or more ongoing investigations. Without providing further details, the court concluded that public disclosure of the September 9, 2016 proceeding was substantially likely to interfere with these ongoing investigations and that less drastic alternatives to partially sealing the record were not viable to maintain the integrity of the law enforcement operations. The court thus held that the \"the public's right of access must yield to the compelling investigatory needs of law enforcement.\" The court further directed the State and Masunaga to timely inform it when circumstances change such that rescinding the order would be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a result of the court's order, all documents and information relating to the September 9, 2016 hearing remained fully sealed and inaccessible to the public, including the two previous sealing orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Motion to Unseal Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 29, 2017, Grube, a reporter for Honolulu Civil Beat, Inc. (Civil Beat), filed a motion to unseal \"whatever documents were sealed\" by the October 11, 2016 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The motion was based on the \"constitutional right of access provided by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and article I, section 4 of the Hawai'i Constitution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    a. October 31, 2017 Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A hearing on the motion to unseal was held on October 31, 2017. At the opening of the hearing, Grube identified himself as \"Nick Grube, Honolulu Civil Beat.\" When the court then asked if he was representing Civil Beat's interest in the matter, Grube responded \"Uh-huh.\" The court explained to Grube that under Hawai'i law, business entities must be represented by an attorney. Grube objected, stating that he made the motion on his own and would like to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Citing the manner in which the motion had been captioned,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court declined to allow Grube to represent himself: \"[A]lthough you, yourself, may be partially making this request, it was filed under the caption you, as representing Civil Beat.\" The court continued the hearing to November 7, 2016, instructed Grube to make inquiries as to whether Civil Beat would retain an attorney, and ordered the State and the defendants to file responses to Grube's motion to unseal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Responses to Motion to Unseal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Masunaga and Ahn filed statements of no opposition to Grube's motion. Masunaga indicated that she had not been fully advised by her prior counsel regarding the motion to seal and had not given prior counsel permission to make representations regarding the motion on her behalf. She also stated that she believes the sealing request was made to protect certain individuals related to the prosecutor then assigned to the case, whom her prior counsel was also representing in a separate criminal matter in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The State filed an opposition to Grube's motion, arguing that the circuit court properly identified the State's compelling interest in preserving the integrity of investigations and sufficiently tailored its order to serve that interest. The opposition included a declaration by a deputy prosecuting attorney averring that the investigations identified in the sealing order remained ongoing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    c. November 7, 2017 Hearing on the Motion to Unseal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 7, 2017, the court held the continued hearing on the motion to unseal. At the outset of the hearing, Grube, through his counsel, again objected to the circuit court requiring him to retain counsel. Counsel clarified that he was representing Grube in his personal capacity and not Civil Beat, and he further stated that Grube was asserting his personal constitutional right of access. The court responded that the contents of the motion and the manner in which it was captioned led the court to believe Grube was representing Civil Beat's interests, which only a licensed attorney was permitted to do under relevant Hawai'i law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Regarding the unsealing motion, the court engaged the deputy prosecuting attorney appearing for the State in the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: ... [F]irst of all, is the-is-are there one or more investigations that are currently active and ongoing that relate to the instant case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Yes, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: And the information and documents that were previously sealed by virtue of the Court's October 11, 2016 order, do these materials and information, do they relate to these one or more investigations?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Yes, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: All right. And in your view, would disclosure of those sealed materials substantially interfere with or have\n   an adverse impact on any of these investigations?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Potentially very serious and adverse, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: All right. And I'm going to ask you: In what way or how? I'm not asking you right now for the specifics as far as that goes, but I need to understand a little bit more in terms of how you believe-if you can explain how disclosure would detrimentally impact those investigations. And, basically, without getting into the specifics, for example, I think Mr. Grube's filing and the case authority is fairly clear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ... [D]o you have any concerns about potential targets of these-this or these investigations becoming informed about this information?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Yes, your Honor. Generally, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: And how would that pose a problem? I don't want to presume anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, they could either flee or destroy evidence. We would also be concerned about safety of witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   THE COURT: And do you have any-any sense for how much longer these investigations or an investigation is anticipated to take, if you know?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: I do not know, your Honor. All I can say is that it is ongoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Grube then argued through his attorney that the mere assertion of an ongoing investigation is not sufficient to override the public's constitutional right of access to judicial records and proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, Grube explained, the State must provide evidence demonstrating an active investigation to which disclosure would pose clear potential harm, which the court may then verify through in-camera review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Grube urged the court to examine more carefully the State's justification for sealing in this case, pointing to Masunaga's statement of no opposition in which she disclaimed any interest in sealing the documents and stated her belief that the motion was intended to protect individuals associated with the previously assigned prosecutor. Given Masunaga's personal indifference to the disclosure, Grube argued, the safety of witnesses in the case was not a valid concern. Grube also requested that the court take judicial notice of the federal criminal case against the prior prosecutor, in which the U.S. Attorney had argued that the prosecutor and Masunaga's prior counsel had a history of improperly exchanging confidential investigatory information. Grube contended that, in light of this alleged history of misused confidential information, the court should not accept at face value the State's general assertions that secrecy is needed to protect an investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Lastly, Grube argued that sealing the entirety of the sealed documents and their corresponding docket entries was not narrowly tailored inasmuch as any information deemed to be a threat to ongoing investigations could be redacted, preserving the public's right of access to the remainder of the documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court orally denied the motion to unseal, stating that it \"accept[ed] the prosecutor's representations\" and was not going \"to attempt to inject the Court's nose into the investigations that are ongoing.\" The court emphasized that the State and Masunaga were required to inform the court should circumstances change such that the sealing order was no longer needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying the Motion to Unseal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On November 24, 2017, the circuit court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order denying the motion to unseal. The court found that there were legitimate concerns that disclosure of the documents would adversely impact one or more ongoing investigations and the safety of individuals. The court then reaffirmed all the prior rulings made in the sealing order, stating that \"the public's qualified right to access must defer to the State's compelling and substantial interest in sealing the subject records\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   because the sealing was \"essential to preserve higher values\" and narrowly tailored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Proceedings Before this Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Grube's Petition for Writ of Prohibition and Writ of Mandamus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On December 29, 2017, Grube filed a petition with this court seeking a writ of prohibition (1) prohibiting the circuit court from enforcing any order to seal records and (2) prohibiting the circuit court from requiring him to retain an attorney in order to assert his public access claim. Grube also sought a writ of mandamus directing the circuit court to comply with the standards for sealing set forth in\n   <em>\n    Oahu Publications Inc. v. Ahn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12284650\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/133/482/\">\n    133 Hawai'i 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12284650\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/133/482/\">\n    331 P.3d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Grube argues that, under\n   <em>\n    Ahn\n   </em>\n   , vague statements that records in a criminal case may interfere with a separate law enforcement investigation are not sufficient to overcome the strong constitutional presumption that criminal proceedings and judicial records are open to the public. (Citing\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12284650\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/133/482/\">\n    133 Hawai'i at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12284650\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/133/482/\">\n    331 P.3d at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) While Grube acknowledges that, under the right circumstances, harm to an active criminal investigation may overcome the public's constitutional right of access, he maintains that proof of such a compelling interest requires more than an unsubstantiated assertion by the State. The circuit court therefore erred, Grube argues, by deferring to the State's asserted justifications and failing to insist on evidence to support specifically identified threats to the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Grube also contends that the scope of the circuit court's order was excessive because the court did not attempt to learn the nature of the ongoing investigation in order to assess whether redaction would sufficiently serve law enforcement's compelling interest. The sealing order was therefore not narrowly tailored, Grube argues, and erasing all references to the scope and nature of the September 9, 2016 proceeding deprived the public of any meaningful opportunity to contest the sealing or suggest viable alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Lastly, Grube contends that he had asserted his personal constitutional right of access and thus should have been permitted to represent himself under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 605-2 (1993).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Grube explains that \"Civil Beat\" was included in the caption of his motion in order to comply with Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 2.2(d)(1) (2012),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   which requires a litigant to list an office address on all filings. The circuit court therefore erred, Grube contends, by requiring him to retain an attorney in order to object to the sealing of judicial records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Responses to Grube's Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   By order entered on January 25, 2018, this court directed an answer to the petition. Judge Trader notified the court of his intent not to submit a response. Ahn and Masunaga each filed a response of no position. Masunaga's answer reiterates that she was never fully advised by her prior counsel regarding the motion to seal and did not authorize any representations regarding the motion. Masunaga further restates her belief that the sealing request was made to protect the attorney prosecuting her, whom her prior counsel was simultaneously representing in a separate proceeding, and that her prior counsel did\n   not properly consider whether the sealing would be in her best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The State filed an answer opposing Grube's petition in which it argues that Grube's contentions amount to assertions that the circuit court erred. Mere error, the State contends, does not constitute a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion such that issuance of a writ of mandamus or prohibition is appropriate. The State also argues that the circuit court's October 11, 2016 order properly identified the State's compelling interest in preserving the integrity of ongoing investigations. The order was also narrowly tailored to serve that interest, the State maintains, because it was limited to one day of proceedings rather than the entire file. The State further contends that the court rightly declined to allow Grube, a non-attorney, to appear in a representative capacity for Civil Beat because HRS \u00a7 605-14\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   prohibits the unauthorized practice of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Attached to the State's answer is the declaration of a deputy prosecuting attorney. The prosecutor avers that he has reviewed the records and files relating to this case. Substantively, the prosecutor's declaration states only that \"[i]nvestigations into matters related to information presented at the September 9, 2016 proceeding are still ongoing. Because the investigation is ongoing, the Circuit Court's order to seal the proceedings remains valid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court erred in denying Grube's motion to unseal. We also hold that, because the constitutional right of access inheres in all members of the public and Grube asserted this interest as an individual, the circuit court erred in refusing to allow Grube to appear pro se and requiring him to obtain counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Accordingly, we grant Grube's petition for a writ of mandamus and order that the circuit court unseal the documents. The effective date of our directive shall be ten calendar days after the filing of this opinion, unless within the ten days the State requests a hearing to provide additional evidence to demonstrate that the documents or some portion thereof must remain sealed to serve a governmental interest of sufficient gravity to overcome the public's constitutional right of access. Upon such request, the circuit court shall promptly set, docket, and hold a hearing, then expeditiously prepare specific findings in conformance with the substantive requirements set forth in this opinion if these requirements have been met; otherwise, our order shall take immediate effect. We further grant Grube's petition for a writ of prohibition in part and order that Grube be permitted to represent his own interests in all further matters related to this proceeding.
