Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case concerns whether an injury suffered by Kimberly A. Pasco (\"Pasco\") that arose while she worked as a Public Health Educator IV for the Department of Health of the State of Hawai'i (\"DOH\") is a covered injury under Hawai'i Revised Statutes (\"HRS\") \u00a7 88-336 (Supp. 2007),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides service-connected disability retirement benefits under the Employees' Retirement System's (\"ERS['s]\") Hybrid Plan to Class H public officers and employees, such as Pasco. At issue is whether the Intermediate Court of Appeals (\"ICA\") erred in ruling that Pasco's injury resulted from an \"accident,\" i.e., an unlooked for mishap or untoward event which is not expected or designed\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"occurring while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We hold that Pasco's permanent incapacitating injuries to her elbow, arm, and hand, which manifested on April 17, 2007 while Pasco was in the actual performance of duty as a public health educator, were the result of an \"accident occurring while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place.\" We therefore affirm the ICA's July 14, 2016 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its June 17, 2016 Memorandum Opinion, which vacated the September 17, 2013 \"Decision and Order Affirming the Final Decision of Respondent-Appellee Board of Trustees of the Employees' Retirement System of the State of Hawaii and Dismissing Petitioner-Appellant Kimberly Pasco's Appeal\" and the September 17, 2013 \"Final Judgment,\" and we remand this matter to the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (\"circuit court\") for further proceedings consistent with the ICA's Memorandum Opinion and this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2006, Pasco worked for the DOH as a public health educator who helped start a nutrition program on Kaua'i, and later expanded it to Maui and the Big Island. As she\n   did not have a permanent desk, Pasco typed voluminous program reports on a laptop at vacant desk spaces in various DOH departments, as well as the lunchroom and conference room, based on availability. By March 2007, Pasco was provided an old metal desk at the Kapa'a Neighborhood Center, as well as a desktop computer to supplement her laptop. Pasco typically typed two to three hours a day at work, but those hours increased when project deadlines neared. Specifically, as a program report for a federally funded project was due in mid-April 2007, Pasco's typing increased in the weeks leading up to the deadline to the point that she typed seven hours per day from April 12 to April 17 in an effort to timely complete the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to an April 25, 2007 workers' compensation report completed by a supervisor, on April 17, 2007 at 4:15 p.m. during Pasco's workshift, she was injured when she used her computer keyboard and mouse. That injury, as described by Pasco, was an \"instant\" \"severe throbbing, aching kind of pain,\" that was located in her right inner elbow and led down to her fourth and fifth fingers, as well as an aching and burning sensation in her fingers. Pasco's right arm, wrist, and hand became so fatigued and painful that she had difficulty using her right arm and hand to do work, and she could not sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This was the first time Pasco had experienced pain in this area of her body, despite extensively typing for three weeks leading up to April 17, 2007, and carrying binders, training materials, and a laptop when traveling interisland bi-weekly in January 2007 to conduct training sessions. Also, prior to April 17, 2007, Pasco did not have any pre-existing injuries to her hands, arms, or elbows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following April 17, 2007, Pasco began seeking medical treatment for her injury from physicians and physical or occupational therapists on Kaua'i, O'ahu, and the mainland, as the pain would not cease. After briefly returning to work on May 2, 2007, by May 14, 2007, Pasco reported that her left arm began to bother her. She suspected it was because she used voice-activated software to type at work following her injury; however, the software made frequent errors and she used her left hand to manually correct them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Several of Pasco's treating physicians diagnosed Pasco with medial epicondylitis, also referred to as tendinitis along the medial epicondyle. In a March 31, 2008 independent medical evaluation, however, Dr. Daniel I. Singer concluded Pasco suffered from non-work-related myofascial pain syndrome, which is pain in the soft tissue that is unrelated to tendons or the ulnar or median nerves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When conservative treatment for medial epicondylitis proved unsuccessful, Pasco underwent left ulnar nerve decompression surgeries at the Mayo Clinic on August 27, 2008 and October 9, 2008. After her surgeries, Pasco began to experience a new type of burning pain in her left arm, and was diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome, left upper extremity greater than right upper extremity. Pasco continued to experience pain in her un-operated right arm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Pasco's Application for Benefits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 13, 2009, Pasco submitted an application for service-connected disability retirement. In describing her April 17, 2007 accident, Pasco stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   During April 2007 I was required to do extensive and unreasonable amounts of typing up to 7 hrs a day to meet project deadlines. A support staff including a clerk was not given so I injured bi-lateral elbow, arm, hand. Also materials to train DOH/DOE staff were carried inter-island and this contributed to extensive injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In a statement attached to her application, her employer described Pasco's work conditions as: \"New office for new program. Clerk not yet hired, full computers not yet purchased. Extensive typing on a laptop computer.\" Additionally, the employer's account of the accident stated: \"Extensive typing on a laptop without assistance of a clerk typist put stress and strain on right arm, wrist, and hand.\" The employer also indicated the accident occurred at 4:15 p.m. on April 17, 2007 at the Kapa'a Neighborhood Center while Pasco was \"on duty\"; the accident was not the result of Pasco's own willful negligence; Pasco appeared to have suffered a disability\n   as the actual and proximate result of the accident; and that because Pasco was incapable of continued work in the position, her appointment was not extended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its report to the Board of Trustees of the Employees' Retirement System (\"ERS Board\") dated August 19, 2009, the ERS Medical Board (\"Medical Board\") concluded that Pasco's incapacitating diagnosis was non-work-related myofascial pain syndrome of the arms, and not the medial epicondylitis that had been diagnosed by several of Pasco's treating physicians. Thus, although there was no dispute that Pasco was permanently incapacitated for the further performance of duty through no \"wilful negligence on [her] part,\" the Medical Board determined that Pasco's incapacity was not the result of an \"accident,\" i.e., \"an unlooked for mishap or an untoward event,\" nor was it the result of an \"occupational hazard,\" i.e., \"the cumulative result of a danger or risk inherent in and concomitant to [her] occupation.\" Accordingly, the Medical Board recommended to the ERS Board that Pasco be denied service-connected disability retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   By letter dated December 29, 2009, notice was issued to Pasco that the ERS Board proposed to deny Pasco's application based on the Medical Board's report. In a statement dated February 16, 2010, Pasco, pro se, timely filed an appeal with the ERS Board. A hearing officer was assigned on March 2, 2010, and shortly thereafter, Pasco obtained counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A contested case hearing was held on September 12, 2011. A member of the Medical Board, Dr. Patricia Chinn, testified that in her expert opinion, Dr. Singer's diagnosis of non-work-related myofascial pain syndrome was correct. Dr. Chinn also clarified that the Medical Board determined that Pasco's condition was not the result of an \"accident\" only because it did not occur at any definite place and time, as the injury was described in the medical record as a \"cumulative or repetitive injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The hearing officer issued a Recommended Decision dated April 23, 2012. As an initial matter, the hearing officer found that Pasco did not have pre-existing injuries to her elbow, arm, and hands prior to April 17, 2007, and that typing was part of Pasco's normal and routine job duties. The hearing officer disagreed with the Medical Board and concluded that Pasco's incapacitating diagnosis was not myofascial pain syndrome. Rather, the hearing officer found Pasco's testimony credible when she testified \"that the unnatural positioning of elbows ... while typing for extended periods of time ... result[ed] in elbow pain.\" Further, as Pasco's pain was specific and not diffused, and as several of Pasco's treating physicians with various specializations from Kaua'i, Honolulu, and Minnesota consistently diagnosed Pasco with medial epicondylitis, the hearing officer found Pasco initially had medial epicondylitis due to extensive typing, which led to complex regional pain syndrome, ultimately incapacitating her. Additionally, the hearing officer found that Pasco was not a malingerer as she diligently pursued many courses of treatment, including surgery as a last resort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Nevertheless, the hearing officer concluded that the \"overuse of Petitioner's arms over a period of time did not constitute an 'accident' and there was no occupational hazard.\" The hearing officer opined that as the overuse of Pasco's arms took place over a period of time, it did not occur at a \"specific time and place\" and thus did not constitute an \"accident.\" Furthermore, in her opinion the hardships faced by Pasco, such as lacking a permanent desk, typing long hours, or transporting heavy materials were not hazards unique to Pasco's job, and therefore did not constitute an occupational hazard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to the issue of whether an \"accident\" occurred, the hearing officer distinguished Pasco's circumstances from those in\n   <em>\n    Myers v. Board of Trustees, Employees' Retirement System\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8829569\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/68/94/\">\n    68 Haw. 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=704%20P.2d%20902\">\n    704 P.2d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985), a case in which this court affirmed the award of service-connected disability benefits to an employee who hurt his back when lifting a coffee pot, by noting that the employee in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   suffered his injury from a single lifting, and not from multiple liftings or overuse over a period of time. The hearing officer also appeared to reject the notion that any \"accident\" could occur due to overuse over a period of time by noting that the Supreme Court had determined in\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1429366\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/66/127/\">\n    66 Haw. 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=657%20P.2d%201040\">\n    657 P.2d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that \"an accident did not occur when [an] employee's incapacitation was due to work pressures and stresses over a period of time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ultimately, the hearing officer recommended that the ERS Board reject the Medical Board's finding that Pasco's incapacitating diagnosis was myofascial pain syndrome, and concluded instead that Pasco suffered from medial epicondylitis, leading to complex regional pain syndrome. In all other respects, the hearing officer recommended the findings and certification of the Medical Board dated August 19, 2009 be affirmed, and Pasco be denied service-connected disability retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The ERS Board adopted the hearing officer's Recommended Decision as its Proposed Decision dated June 22, 2012. Upon consideration of Pasco's exceptions, the Medical Board's opposition to those exceptions, Pasco's supplemental memorandum, and the parties' oral argument regarding the exceptions at a hearing on November 13, 2012, the ERS Board issued its Final Decision on December 19, 2012. The Final Decision affirmed the Proposed Decision, adopted the Recommended Decision, and denied Pasco's application for service-connected disability retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Circuit Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Pasco timely filed an appeal with the circuit court\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on December 26, 2012. In her opening brief filed on April 12, 2013, Pasco's points of error were solely based on whether the ERS Board erred in denying Pasco service-connected disability retirement benefits \"on the basis that Petitioner had failed to prove by the preponderance of the evidence that her permanent incapacitation was the natural and proximate result of an accident at some definite time and place.\" Oral argument was held on August 15, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On September 17, 2013, the circuit court issued its \"Decision and Order Affirming the Final Decision of Respondent-Appellee Board of Trustees of the Employees' Retirement System of the State of Hawaii and Dismissing Petitioner-Appellant Kimberly Pasco's Appeal.\" The circuit court concluded that Pasco's excessive keyboarding, whether over weeks or months, does not describe or constitute an accident occurring while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 88-336. Final Judgment was entered on September 17, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    D. ICA Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Pasco timely filed a notice of appeal on September 27, 2013. In its June 17, 2016 Memorandum Opinion, the ICA noted that HRS \u00a7 88-336 uses analogous and identical language to that used in HRS \u00a7 88-79,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that, as clarified by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Panado v.

In\n   <em>\n    Panado\n   </em>\n   , the employee had satisfied the statutory requirement that an accident had occurred \"while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place\" by establishing that she was injured some time during her October 8-9, 2004 work shift.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311081\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/134/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Based on\n   <em>\n    Panado\n   </em>\n   , the ICA concluded here that Pasco was able to identify a \"definite\" time and place of her work-related injury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Pasco described her injury as resulting from extensive keyboarding that was required at her job as the cause of her disability. She could point to the period of\n   time, \"April 2007\" when this activity intensified, leading up to the point, on April 17, 2007, that the pain from her injury was so severe that it caused her to seek medical attention. Her employer, DOH, did not contest these assertions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Pasco\n   </em>\n   , mem. op. at 9. Accordingly, the ICA vacated the circuit court's September 17, 2013 \"Decision and Order...\" and \"Final Judgment,\" and remanded the case to the circuit court with directions to vacate the ERS Board's denial of disability retirement to Pasco and for further proceedings consistent with its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Issues on Certiorari\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The ERS Board raises two questions on certiorari:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. Did the First Circuit Court and ERS Board err in concluding that Pasco's overuse of her arms in typing and transporting training materials over weeks and months did not constitute an \"accident occurring while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place\" within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 88-336(a) and [Hawai'i Administrative Rules (\"HAR\") ] \u00a7 6-22-2 ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   B. Was the First Circuit Court right or wrong in determining that the ERS Board was not clearly erroneous in finding that Pasco had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that her permanent incapacity was the \"natural and proximate result\" of an accident as required by HRS \u00a7 88-336(a) ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The ERS Board argues that it did not agree or stipulate that Pasco was injured on April 17, 2007. Rather, the ERS Board argues that Dr. Chinn and the Medical Board had agreed with Dr. Singer that Pasco suffered from a pain syndrome not directly related to work. As such, the ERS Board distinguishes Pasco's case from\n   <em>\n    Panado\n   </em>\n   because the parties in\n   <em>\n    Panado\n   </em>\n   had stipulated that the applicant-employee had been injured during a specific workshift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The ERS Board also argues that because Pasco's injury \"developed over weeks and months,\" it was not the result of a discrete event that occurred at a fixed time and place, which is required under the statute. The ERS further argues that because Pasco claims to have been injured while performing her regular work duties, \"[t]he only thing that was unexpected or unforeseen was that Pasco began to have pain symptoms\" while working, which does not amount to an \"accident\" for service-related disability retirement. The ERS Board also asserts that because the ERS Board did not stipulate that Pasco's permanent incapacity was the natural and proximate result of her \"claimed accident,\" the ICA erred in concluding otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Pasco asserts in her opposition brief that the ICA was correct to apply\n   <em>\n    Panado\n   </em>\n   to Pasco's case. Pasco also appears to suggest that various workers' compensation cases, such as\n   <em>\n    Van Ness v.

Accordingly, any assertions by the ERS Board on this appeal that Pasco's injury was due to non-work-related myofascial pain syndrome, or that her incapacity was not the natural and proximate result of extensive typing, are contrary to its Final Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Therefore, the remaining questions are those contained in the first issue on certiorari: whether Pasco suffered an \"accident occurring while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In concluding that the engineer's job pressures and stresses did not constitute an \"accident,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   this court noted: \"[T]here was no unexpected event or unforeseen occurrence which resulted in the appellant's present incapacity. It is not enough, under the retirement law, that work pressures and stresses over a period of time were contributory causes of his mental infirmity.\" 66 Haw. at 131, 657 P.2d at 1043. The ERS Board focused on this holding from\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   and took it to mean that the etiology of an \"accident\" could not develop over a period of time. However, the\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning shows that the court's focus was on the fact that no \"unexpected event\" or \"unforeseen occurrence\" had caused the employee's incapacitation. In\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , the claimed \"accident\" was the result of general job stresses and pressures occurring over several years, but there simply was no \"mishap\" or \"event.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In contrast, the manifestation of Pasco's pain on April 17, 2007 was an \"unlooked for mishap or untoward event which [was] not expected or designed.\" Whether an event is not expected or designed is viewed from the perspective of the employee, as illustrated by\n   <em>\n    Kikuta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1429278\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/66/111/\">\n    66 Haw. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=657%20P.2d%201030\">\n    657 P.2d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Kikuta\n   </em>\n   , the ERS Board had denied benefits to an employee who was on working time when he was stabbed by his brother-in-law and consequently died. The circuit court affirmed the decision. On appeal to this court, the ERS Board argued the stabbing was not an \"accident,\" as the employee should have anticipated the attack because he was previously warned that his brother-in-law was \"out to get him.\" 66 Haw. at 113, 657 P.2d at 1032. This court reversed, first noting that the common and accepted definition of \"accident\" is \"an unexpected happening\n   <em>\n    to which the claimant did not culpably contribute\n   </em>\n   .\" 66 Haw. at 114, 657 P.2d at 1033 (emphasis added). This court went on to observe that the \"warning\" had been given by the assailant's sister five months prior to the incident, that the employee and the assailant had friendly interactions prior to and since that time, and none of the witnesses on the date of the stabbing had seen or heard anything to indicate the assailant \"was looking for trouble\" when he first arrived at the employee's workplace. 66 Haw. at 116, 657 P.2d at 1034. Further, there was nothing in the record to indicate that the employee had provoked the assailant. Thus, from the point of view of the employee, the assault was unexpected, and therefore an \"accident.\" 66 Haw. at 117, 657 P.2d at 1034.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Similar to the injury in\n   <em>\n    Kikuta,\n   </em>\n   Pasco's pain, which manifested on April 17, 2007, was not \"expected or designed.\" As in\n   <em>\n    Kikuta\n   </em>\n   , it was \"an unexpected happening to which\" Pasco \"did not culpably contribute.\" The Dissent, however, suggests that although the Board found that \"Pasco had no pre-existing injuries to her hands, wrists, and arms prior to April 17, 2007,\" because Pasco's sub-optimal work conditions existed since Pasco began the job, her deteriorating physical conditions began far earlier than April 12, 2007 and therefore her severe elbow injury could not have been unexpected. The record does not demonstrate that Pasco should have expected the level of pain she began experiencing on April 17, 2007, later diagnosed as medial epicondylitis, that would require surgeries and later lead to complex regional pain syndrome. In any event, the ERS Board specifically found that Pasco did not have pre-existing injuries to her elbow, arm, and hands prior to April 17, 2007. Even if she did have a preexisting condition, however, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   discussed below, an \"accident\" occurs when an unlooked for mishap or unexpected event causes a preexisting condition to become symptomatic. In addition,\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   also stands for the proposition that an unexpected result of a routine performance of duty, without any evidence of external force, or unusual stress or strain, is an \"unlooked for untoward event\" that constitutes an \"accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In this regard, the ERS Board appears to argue that the manifestation of pain in the course of performing regular work duties cannot constitute an \"accident.\" However, this court already rejected such an argument in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8829569\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/68/94/\">\n    68 Haw. 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=704%20P.2d%20902\">\n    704 P.2d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , a state employee who injured his back on July 25, 1977 when setting down a thirty-five-pound half-full coffee pot as part of his normal and routine preparation for conducting a management training class, and thereafter became disabled due to back pain, was denied service-connected disability retirement by the ERS Board. The circuit court later reversed the ERS Board's denial of benefits, and the ERS Board appealed, contending that the incident involving the coffee pot was not an \"accident\" within the meaning of the service-connected disability retirement statute.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8829569\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/68/94/\">\n    68 Haw. at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=704%20P.2d%20902\">\n    704 P.2d at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the ERS Board argued that an unexpected result of a routine performance of duty, without any evidence of external force, or unusual stress or strain, did not amount to an \"unlooked for untoward event\" and therefore did not constitute an \"accident.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , No. 10033, ERS Board's Opening Br., at 13, 19 (filed Nov. 9, 1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In affirming the circuit court, this court rejected the ERS Board's argument, stating, \"Since the July 25, 1977 incident was,\n   <em>\n    beyond question\n   </em>\n   , an unlooked for mishap which was not expected or designed, it was an 'accident[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8829569\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/68/94/\">\n    68 Haw. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   96 &amp; n.1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=704%20P.2d%20902\">\n    704 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   904 &amp; n.1 (emphasis added). The weight of the coffee pot or the employee's pre-existing spondylolisthesis and degenerative disks did not affect this court's analysis as to whether an \"accident\" had occurred.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   thus dispels the notion that an external force or unusual strain is required to show that an \"accident\" befell an employee; rather, an unexpected result of a routine performance of duty may comprise an \"accident.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , the \"routine performance of duty\" was the employee's routine preparation of coffee for the training meetings he conducted; his \"unlooked for mishap\" was the \"sharp pains across his left lower back into the hollow of his buttocks, and ... pulsating pain radiating down his right leg\" that he experienced when setting down the coffee pot.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8829569\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/68/94/\">\n    68 Haw. at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=704%20P.2d%20902\">\n    704 P.2d at 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Just as lifting the coffee pot was part of the employee's routine in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , here, typing\n   was a normal and routine part of Pasco's job. Pasco also did not expect the onset of pain on April 17, 2007 while she typed, just as the employee in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   did not expect to suffer severe back pain from lifting a coffee pot when, prior to the accident, he could lift sixty-five-pound bags of coral sand and ninety-five-pound bags of mortar mix without discomfort of any kind.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Myers v. Bd. of Trs. of the Emps.' Ret. Sys.\n   </em>\n   , Civil No. 79302, Findings of Fact &amp; Conclusions of Law &amp; Order, at 2 (filed May 17, 1984),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8829569\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/68/94/\">\n    68 Haw. 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=704%20P.2d%20902\">\n    704 P.2d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Nevertheless, in this case, the ERS Board ruled that Myers was distinguishable because the injury in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   was caused by a single lifting of a coffee pot, as opposed to multiple liftings. To draw such an adverse conclusion from this distinction, however, does not comport with this court's rejection of the ERS Board's argument in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   that there must be a showing of some unusual strain or exertion for an \"accident\" to occur in the routine performance of duty. In sum, routinely performed duties are, by definition, performed regularly and repeatedly; and this court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   that an \"accident\" may occur in the course of such regular and repeated performance of duties. Thus, the onset of Pasco's medial epicondylitis in the course of her regular and repeated performance of her extensive typing duties was an unexpected event constituting an \"accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Pasco's \"accident\" occurred \"while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The second issue in determining Pasco's eligibility for service-connected disability retirement under HRS \u00a7 88-336 is whether her injury occurred \"while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place.\" In contrast with the Dissent, we agree with the ICA that Pasco's circumstances are analogous to the relevant facts in\n   <em>\n    Panado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311081\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/134/1/\">\n    134 Hawai'i 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311081\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/134/1/\">\n    332 P.3d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where we held that an applicant had shown her injury was the result of an \"accident\" occurring at \"some definite time and place\" even though the employee could not identify the exact moment of injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Panado\n   </em>\n   , Eden Panado (\"Panado\"), a computer operator with the City and County of Honolulu, was assigned to print voter registration forms during her October 8 to October 9, 2004 work shift, and she was therefore required to lift between ten and fifteen boxes of paper, and load and unload printers. During the task, which Panado described as her alleged accident, Panado felt pain in her lower back, upper back, shoulder, neck, and right arm. She experienced pain the day after her shift, and on October 10, she was admitted to a hospital emergency room, treated for neck and low back pain, and was subsequently unable to return to work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311081\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/134/1/\">\n    134 Hawai'i at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311081\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/134/1/\">\n    332 P.3d at 146-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Majority at 374, 420 P.3d at 305.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   I respectfully disagree. I believe that the carefully worded language of the statute, our case law, and the facts of this case indicate that Pasco's manifestation of pain was not an \"accident\" within the meaning of the disability retirement statute. This leads me to conclude that Pasco cannot meet the statutory requirements for service-connected disability retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   On April 13, 2009, Pasco, a public health educator employed by the State Department of Health (DOH), submitted an application for service-connected disability retirement. In her application, she claimed that during April 2007, she injured her elbow, arm, and hand due to \"extensive and unreasonable amounts of typing up to 7 hours a day to meet project deadlines.\" Similarly, Pasco also claimed that \"materials to train DOH/[Department of Education] staff were carried inter-island and this contributed to extensive injury.\" On December 29, 2009, the Board of Trustees of the Employees' Retirement System (ERS Board) preliminarily denied Pasco's application. The ERS Board received Pasco's statement of appeal on February 16, 2010, and a hearing officer was assigned to her case on March 2, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   A hearing took place on September 12, 2011. At the hearing, Pasco testified that she was provided workers' compensation benefits for about a year after her injury in April 2007. Several subsequent findings of the hearing officer were either stipulated to or undisputed by both parties. First, the parties stipulated that Pasco was permanently incapacitated for further duty as a public health educator, and that her incapacitation was not the result of wilful negligence on her part. Second, the parties do not dispute the hearing officer's determination that Pasco had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that her permanent incapacitation was medial epicondylitis (an overuse injury) which led to complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Third, the parties do not dispute the hearing officer's conclusion that \"it [was] credible that the unnatural positioning of elbows asserted by [Pasco] while typing for extended periods of time could result in elbow pain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   However, the hearing officer also concluded that even if Pasco's medial epicondylitis permanently incapacitated her, Pasco \"would not be entitled to service-connected disability retirement because her incapacity was not the result of an 'accident' or 'occupational hazard.' \" Specifically, the hearing officer determined that \"[o]veruse of [Pasco's] arm in typing long hours and transporting heavy materials does not constitute an unlooked for mishap or untoward event occurring at some definite time and place,\" and therefore, \"[t]here was no accident as defined under [Hawai'i Administrative Rules (HAR) ] \u00a7 6-22-2\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   that resulted in [Pasco's] injury.\" The hearing officer then recommended that the ERS Board deny service-connected retirement benefits to Pasco. The ERS Board adopted the hearing officer's recommended decision and rendered a final decision on December 19, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Pasco appealed the ERS Board's decision to the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court), where she argued that the ERS Board erred when it adopted the hearing officer's recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law determining that she failed to prove \"that her permanent incapacitation was the natural and proximate result of an accident at some definite time and place under HRS Section 88-336.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a written\n   decision and order filed on September 17, 2013, the circuit court affirmed the ERS Board's decision, but on June 17, 2016, the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) vacated the circuit court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As discussed above, several determinations made by the hearing officer are undisputed or stipulated to. For purposes of evaluating Pasco's claim under HRS \u00a7 88-336(a), it is undisputed that Pasco was permanently incapacitated for duty as a public health educator and that her permanent incapacity was not the result of wilful negligence on her part. Furthermore, it appears that the hearing officer also concluded that Pasco's overtyping at work was the actual and proximate cause of her incapacity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The remaining issue is whether Pasco \"suffered an 'accident occurring while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place.' \" Majority at 379-80, 420 P.3d at 314. This issue involves two different but interrelated inquiries. First, Pasco must prove that her injury was a result of an \"accident\" as we have previously construed that term under HRS \u00a7 88-336(a). Second, Pasco must also demonstrate that the accident occurred at a \"definite time and place.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   On both of these inquiries, my conclusion differs from that of the Majority. I believe that the plain language of HRS \u00a7 88-336(a) and our precedent indicate that Pasco's injury was not an \"accident,\" because it was not an \"unlooked for mishap or untoward event which is not expected or designed,\" and did not occur at \"some definite time and place.\" Therefore, I conclude that Pasco is ineligible for service-connected disability retirement under HRS \u00a7 88-336(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Therefore, the Majority concludes that \"the onset of Pasco's medial epicondylitis... was an unexpected event constituting an 'accident.' \" Majority at 382, 420 P.3d at 313. However, as I read the record, it is far from clear that Pasco could not have expected that she would develop a severe elbow, arm, and hand injury from overtyping at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In fact, the record in this case contains multiple instances where Pasco herself reported that new work conditions put tremendous stress on her elbow, arm, and hand months before she manifested pain on April 17, 2007. First, while Pasco's application for disability retirement described her accident as occurring \"[d]uring [the month of] April 2007 [when she] was required to do extensive and unreasonable amounts of typing up to 7 hours a day,\" in Pasco's clinical documents, she reported experiencing elbow pain much earlier:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   [Pasco] reports that [her elbow pain] essentially started at work back in December 2006 when she took on a new job piloting and designing a very expensive program for the islands of Hawaii in her field of nutrition. She was doing an extensive amount of typing and carrying materials from place to place and on December 6, 2006, she started having significant elbow pain on her right side.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Second, Pasco stated in a written \"work description and account of injuries\" report that her job responsibilities became considerably more difficult in February 2007, when she was required to plan nutrition projects for multiple islands. At that time, Pasco noted that she \"attempted again to hire staff,\" but no help was given. Pasco also stated that she did not have a permanent office, making it impossible to have an ergonomic setup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Third, Pasco's employer stated that without a clerk, Pasco was forced to spend more time keyboarding, and that \"working extensively on a laptop from Feb.-April 2007 due to her office not being operational put further strain and stress on her right arm, wrist, and hand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Fourth, Pasco further reported that in March 2007, her desk setup was \"not ideal\" because the L-shaped desk was uneven, and the right portion sat several inches lower than the rest of the desk. Therefore, Pasco stated that when she typed, her right elbow was on the lower part of the desk, while presumably her left elbow was elevated on the higher part of the desk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   While the hearing officer determined that \"Pasco had no pre-existing injuries to her hands, wrists, and arms prior to April 17, 2017, and was asymptomatic until that time,\" as the Majority states, \"[w]hether an event is not expected or designed is viewed from the perspective of the employee.\" Majority at 380, 420 P.3d at 311. Based on the numerous instances where Pasco indicated that she suffered arm and elbow strain in the months prior to manifesting extreme pain on April 17, 2007, and the several reports indicating that Pasco's sub-optimal work conditions existed as early as February 2007, I cannot conclude that Pasco proved that her injury was unexpected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Therefore, unlike the unforeseen or unexpected incidents that occurred in\n   <em>\n    Kikuta\n   </em>\n   and Myers, Pasco's injury was the culmination of repetitive stress, which may have began as early as December 2006. This indicates to me that Pasco's injury is more akin to the claimant's injury in\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   . Under the disability retirement statute, it unfortunately \"is not enough ... that work pressures and stresses over a period of time\" contributed to Pasco's injury.\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , 66 Haw. at 131, 657 P.2d at 1043. Those pressures and stresses are simply not \"an unforeseen or unexpected event\" that the disability retirement statute requires in order to receive benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The injury did not occur at some definite time and place.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   I therefore cannot agree with the Majority that Pasco proved that her injury was \"not expected or designed\" as required by HRS \u00a7 88-336(a). But even if I did agree, the record indicates that Pasco did not prove that her injury occurred at a definite time and place, which also makes her ineligible for disability retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In order to be retired by the ERS Board for service-connected disability, a claimant must also prove that his or her accident occurred while in the actual performance of duty \"at some definite time and place.\" HRS \u00a7 88-336(a).

First, as previously noted in Section II.A, the record suggests that Pasco's elbow pain began as early as February 2007 or December 2006. Therefore, Pasco's medial epicondylitis could conceivably have occurred months before she manifested debilitating pain from that injury on April 17, 2007. This is a substantially longer period of time than in\n   <em>\n    Panado\n   </em>\n   , where the claimant manifested pain from her neck and back injuries a day after she lifted the heavy boxes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311081\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/134/1/\">\n    134 Hawai'i at 1-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311081\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/134/1/\">\n    332 P.3d at 157-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Pasco's injury occurred due to \"cumulative or repetitive stress.\" Majority at 383, 420 P.3d at 314. This makes Pasco's injury distinguishable from the claimant's injury in\n   <em>\n    Panado\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Panado\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that the claimant there was entitled to disability retirement because it was undisputed that she had suffered a back injury by lifting, at most, ten to fifteen paper boxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311081\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/134/1/\">\n    332 P.3d at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is so because by its nature, a cumulative injury is not caused by a single action (or several actions, any one of which could have caused the injury), but is one in which multiple stresses over a period of time, together, caused the injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, notwithstanding the difficulty in placing when Pasco's injury actually occurred, her cumulative stress injury from the overuse of her arm and hand could not have occurred at any \"definite time and place.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1429366\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/66/127/\">\n    66 Haw. at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657 P.2d at 1043 (\"It is not enough, under the retirement law, that work pressures and stresses over a period time were contributory causes of [a permanent incapacity].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Pasco was overworked in her position as a public health educator in the months preceding her permanent incapacity. In December 2006, she took on new job responsibilities piloting and designing a nutrition program for multiple islands. In February 2007, she lost her clerk, was forced to take on more typing responsibilities, and was not given any assistance. In March 2007, she spent long hours typing on an uneven desk that forced one of her arms to be elevated over the other. Through no fault of her own, the injury she sustained, and the onset of pain that followed on April 17, 2007, permanently incapacitated her for duty as a public health educator. At that time, Pasco was entitled to, and received, workers' compensation benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Unfortunately, even if a claimant becomes permanently incapacitated for duty through no fault of his or her own, qualifying for disability retirement under our statute requires more. The claimant must prove that his or her injury was a result of \"an accident occurring while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In my view, Pasco's manifestation of pain on April 17, 2007 is not such an accident. Consequently, Pasco has not demonstrated that she qualifies for service-connected disability retirement under HRS \u00a7 88-336.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Therefore, I would reverse the ICA's July 14, 2016 Judgment on Appeal entered pursuant to its June 17, 2016 Memorandum Opinion, and affirm the circuit court's September 17, 2013 \"Decision and Order Affirming the Final Decision of Respondent-Appellee Board of Trustees of the Employees' Retirement System of the State of Hawaii and Dismissing Petitioner-Appellant Kimberly Pasco's Appeal.\" Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    <strong>\n     Service-connected disability retirement.\n    </strong>\n    (a) Upon application of a class H member, or the person appointed by the family court as guardian of an incapacitated member, any class H member who has been permanently incapacitated for duty as the natural and proximate result of an accident occurring while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place, or as the cumulative result of some occupational hazard, through no wilful negligence on the member's part, may be retired by the board for service-connected disability....\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    HRS \u00a7 88-336.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lopez v.
