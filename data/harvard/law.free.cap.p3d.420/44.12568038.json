The district court did not abuse its discretion in enforcing the settlement where the parties executed a Memorandum of Understanding (the MOU) during mediation, the terms of which were sufficiently definite to be enforced. Further, the district court's factual finding that there was no misrepresentation or mutual mistake of fact that would render the agreement null and void was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the enforcement of the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 The parties entered into a lease agreement concerning the use of \"custom built trailer-mounted nitrogen generators\" that are typically utilized in the oil and gas drilling industry. ACC sued Ace West Foam Inc. (Ace West), claiming that Ace West had breached the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment, which the district court denied. The court determined that there were several \"material fact disputes concerning [Ace West's] defenses and the amount of damages that may be owing to [ACC].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 After the court denied the summary judgment motions, the parties participated in court-ordered mediation. At the mediation session, the parties executed the MOU. The district court found that the MOU outlined the following terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ACC will inspect and pick two of [Ace West's] foam compressor units, obtain possession of them, and then sell them with the two previously leased trailer-mounted nitrogen generators that were in the possession of [ACC].... [The MOU] sets out a minimum sales price of $1,425,000 for the four items (two generators with two compressors), along with a schedule of what further consideration will be exchanged, depending on the ultimate sales price achieved.... If the units do not sell at the minimum price \"then [Ace West] will pay ACC $125,000,\" which \"is intended as damages if Ace West does not sell the four units.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The last provision of the agreement stated that the parties \"will work in good faith and make reasonable efforts to bring about this resolution and settlement, including the preparation and execution of a more formal settlement agreement and release of all claims, as well as stipulation and order for dismissal with prejudice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 After the mediation session, the parties exchanged correspondence to create a \"more formal settlement agreement,\" as directed in the MOU. Ultimately, these negotiations broke down, and ACC sent a letter to Ace West purporting to withdraw its settlement offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Ace West subsequently filed a motion to enforce the MOU. The district court determined that the MOU was an enforceable settlement agreement, containing \"proper legal consideration because performance or a return promise was bargained for by each of the parties.\" Furthermore, there was mutuality of agreement because \"[b]oth parties executed the agreement,\" as well as mutuality of obligation because \"ACC agreed to dismiss its claims in return for payment and performance on behalf of Ace West.\" The court concluded that the MOU contained \"all of the material terms agreed to between the parties\" and was \"fully enforceable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The court also rejected ACC's alternative argument that the MOU \"should be set aside due to mistake, misrepresentation, or fraud\" regarding the value of the foam compressors. The court made a specific factual finding that it did \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   find credible any assertion by ACC that Ace West warranted that the foam compressors were worth any particular value.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 ACC now appeals the district court's order granting the motion to enforce as well as its prior order denying summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 ACC contends that the district court erred by enforcing the MOU and dismissing the case because (1) the MOU was not intended to be a final and enforceable agreement and (2) even if it was, the agreement was based on false statements or mutual mistake concerning the value of the foam compressors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 \"The existence of a contract is a question of law, to be reviewed for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    McKelvey v.

The MOU Constituted an Enforceable Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 ACC contends that the district court abused its discretion by enforcing the MOU because that instrument was never intended to be a final settlement agreement. \"An agreement of compromise and settlement constitutes an executory accord. Since an executory accord constitutes a valid enforceable contract, basic contract principles affect the determination of when a settlement agreement should be so enforced.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodmansen v.

The district court correctly determined that the MOU showed both that there was a meeting of the minds and that the terms of the agreement were sufficiently definite and capable of being enforced. First, the district court observed that both parties had signed the MOU, evidencing \"a mutuality of agreement.\" Second, the court concluded that the terms of the agreement were sufficiently definite as to be capable of being enforced, where the MOU contained \"a detailed settlement structure\" concerning the foam compressors, minimum sales prices for these items, as well as further consideration to be exchanged between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 ACC does not dispute that it signed the MOU, nor does it take issue with the district court's conclusion that the terms of that agreement are sufficiently definite as to be capable of being enforced. Instead, ACC argues that both extrinsic evidence and language in the MOU itself demonstrate that ACC did not intend to enter into a binding agreement. Neither argument convinces us that the district court erred in concluding otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Extrinsic Evidence Cannot Overcome the Parties' Intent Reflected in an Unambiguous Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 ACC argues that the district court's finding of mutual agreement was clearly erroneous because the facts surrounding the\n   mediation established that ACC did not intend to be bound by the MOU. Specifically, ACC points to its \"undisputed refusal to sign a final agreement and insistence that a final agreement be deferred to a later time\" as well as \"the parties' post-mediation conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 The district court correctly ruled that the MOU was binding based on its unambiguous language.

After hearing that evidence, the court ruled that the settlement was binding based on the MOU's unambiguous language, which contained \"all the elements necessary to establish a written contract.\" The district court correctly limited its ruling to the face of the MOU because the extrinsic evidence did not support a plausible claim of ambiguity in light of the contractual language. Specifically, the signed MOU states that the parties \"have now settled and compromised their claims and negotiated a resolution of their dispute ... through the following terms.\" Extrinsic evidence that ACC did not want to enter into a final settlement agreement at mediation \"may not be used to contradict the plain language of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992513\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/234/1156/\">\n    2010 UT App 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992513\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/234/1156/\">\n    234 P.3d 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Language Contemplating a More Formal Agreement Does Not Preclude the Enforcement of a Settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 ACC argues that \"the MOU itself shows that it was never intended to be a final agreement\" because it stated that the parties would \"prepare and execute a final agreement in the future.\" To be precise, the MOU does not refer to a future \"final\" agreement but to a future \"more formal\" agreement. The last paragraph of the MOU states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The parties and their counsel will work in good faith and make reasonable efforts to bring about this resolution and settlement, including the preparation and execution of a more formal settlement agreement and release of all claims, as well as stipulation and order for dismissal with prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b621 This court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.

In\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   , this court held that a settlement agreement was final and enforceable even though it anticipated \"the negotiation and execution of further agreements, which never happened.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. This court held that the mere fact that the parties \"contemplated the later execution of formal settlement agreement documents\" did not render the agreement reached in mediation unenforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.

The district court concluded that the parties reached agreement on the essential terms of the settlement and that those terms were set forth in sufficient detail to be enforceable. Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   , we uphold the district court's determination that \"the fact that the parties anticipated preparing other more detailed documents does not prevent the existing [MOU] from being enforceable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II. The District Court's Factual Finding that the MOU Was Not Based on a Misrepresentation Regarding the Value of the Foam Compressors Is Not Clearly Erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b623 Alternatively, ACC contends that, even if the MOU was a final and enforceable agreement, it was based on Ace West's false statement regarding the value of the foam compressors.

The mediator shared Ace West's valuation with ACC but did not \"communicate any guarantee that the foam compressors were worth a particular value.\" The district court specifically found that \"no one communicated at the mediation a guarantee or warranty about the value of the [foam compressors], and no one believed that Ace West had provided such a guarantee or warranty.\" To the contrary, \"both sides recognized that the\n   foam compressors could be worth a wide range of values.\" Therefore, the court concluded that \"there are no credible facts supporting the claim that the [MOU] should be set aside due to mistake, misrepresentation, or fraud.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 ACC argues that the district court's findings regarding the value of the foam compressors were not supported by the evidence.

Barrani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6916873\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/334/994/\">\n    2014 UT App 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6916873\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/334/994/\">\n    334 P.3d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b628 Here, there is a reasonable basis in the record to support the district court's rejection of the value calculated by ACC's expert. Ace West's valuation of the foam compressors was based, in part, on an appraisal conducted more than a year before the mediation, which placed the value of one of the units at $250,000. During the evidentiary hearing, the court heard expert testimony offered by both parties as to whether that appraised value was adversely impacted by a drop in oil and gas prices prior to the mediation. ACC offered expert testimony that there had been a significant decline in the demand for oil field equipment and that the fair market value of the foam compressors at the time of mediation was between $125,000 and $165,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b629 But the court credited the testimony of Ace West's expert, who \"persuasively explained that the values for foam compressor units do not decline in a down oil/gas market as much as values for oil exploration and drilling equipment.\" This expert explained that because the \"foam compressor units are used for keeping gas wells clean and efficient, which is just as important when the prices of oil and gas are dropping, ... there is a demand for services involving foam compressors even when oil and gas prices are low.\" The district court found that ACC's expert \"failed to take this critical factor into account when he opined that foam compressors dropped in value.\" It was well within the district court's prerogative as fact-finder to weigh the conflicting evidence and credit the testimony of Ace West's expert over that of ACC's expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b630 More importantly, the district court's factual finding that Ace West's valuation was reasonable was unnecessary to support the ultimate conclusion that the value of the foam compressors was not a term or condition of the settlement agreement. As ACC acknowledges, the record supports the district court's finding that Ace West's belief regarding the value of the foam compressors was communicated to ACC but that Ace West never guaranteed or warranted the value of the compressors. While ACC argues that there is \"no legal distinction between a warranty of value and representation of value in this context,\" it fails to address the district court's finding that the settlement agreement was not induced by Ace West's representation. The record supports the district court's finding that \"the parties all recognized that there was uncertainty about the value of the foam compressors\" at the time of mediation. This finding is supported by the MOU itself, which anticipated that the foam compressors could be sold at various prices and made the payment of damages dependent upon the ultimate sale price. In addition, the MOU was \"silent as to the appraised or other value of the foam compressors\" and there is no evidence that the parties ever discussed \"making the value of the foam compressors a\n   term or condition of the agreement.\" Based on this record, ACC cannot establish that the district court clearly erred in finding that the settlement agreement was not dependent on Ace West's valuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b631 The record supports the district court's finding that there was no misrepresentation or mutual mistake that would void the otherwise enforceable settlement agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the district court acted within its discretion in enforcing the settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b632 The district court acted within its discretion in enforcing the settlement agreement reached during mediation. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    \"When ambiguity exists, the intent of the parties becomes a question of fact,\" and we would review the district court's findings about such intent for clear error.\n    <em>\n     WebBank v.
