Lisa appeals, asserting that the trial court erred by imputing any income to her at all, and contending that the alimony award therefore should have been larger. Because the trial court's findings regarding imputation of income were supported by competent evidence, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Lisa and Mark married in 1989. In 1995, Lisa was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). Despite this diagnosis, Lisa continued to work-sometimes part-time, sometimes full-time-as a travel agent until approximately 2012. At that time, Mark and Lisa made a mutual decision that Lisa should quit her job. At trial, Mark testified that, around that time, Lisa was experiencing stress at work, and that this stress was related to both office-specific conflicts as well as the general difficulties inherent in working while afflicted with MS. During her testimony, Lisa clarified that, around that time, she had made some errors at work, that these errors caused her stress, and that the stress made her MS symptoms worse. Mark and Lisa were also aware that Lisa would likely qualify for Social Security disability benefits. For all of these reasons, Mark and Lisa agreed that Lisa should stop working and instead apply for Social Security benefits. For the remainder of their marriage, Lisa did not work outside the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Lisa petitioned for divorce in July 2014, and the case went to trial in early 2016. The main issue at trial was whether, and to what extent, Lisa should be awarded alimony. The parties disagreed about many of the specific factors relevant to the alimony analysis, including whether Lisa was physically able to be gainfully employed and, accordingly, whether any income should be imputed to her. For her part, Lisa testified that, due to her MS diagnosis, she was physically unable to engage in gainful employment at all. Lisa also presented testimony from her treating provider (Nurse Practitioner), a nurse practitioner who worked in the MS clinic at the University of Utah and who had been treating Lisa for her MS since 2003. Nurse Practitioner testified that patients with MS often struggle to maintain employment, and that MS can make it so that they \"just cannot function\" in the workplace. Nurse Practitioner offered her opinion that Lisa was in this category, and was physically unable to return to the workforce in any capacity due to her MS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Nurse Practitioner conceded on cross-examination that Lisa was capable of operating a computer and a telephone, capable of driving a car and traveling, and was generally able to complete basic activities of daily living.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 During his case-in-chief, Mark presented the testimony of a vocational rehabilitation counselor (Expert) to testify about Lisa's ability to work. Expert testified that she had significant experience evaluating individuals with disabilities generally, and evaluating individuals with MS specifically. Expert offered her opinion that, despite Lisa's disabilities, Lisa would be able to work on a part-time basis in a \"sedentary occupation\" so long as her employer made \"reasonable accommodations.\" Expert offered three specific examples of jobs that she believed Lisa could perform-a reception information clerk, a hotel\n   desk clerk, or a reservation and ticket agent-and testified that wages in these types of jobs ranged from $9.61 to $12.87 per hour. On cross-examination, Expert conceded that Lisa would have difficulty working a normal eight-hour work shift, and that her recommendation was that Lisa work only \"part-time.\" Expert did not further define \"part-time,\" but conceded that Lisa would \"perhaps\" need to limit herself to working \"three to four hours a day.\" Further, in describing the sort of \"reasonable accommodations\" that Lisa would need her employer to make, Expert noted that Lisa would need \"an employer that understands [her] disability and is willing to break down tasks in smaller pieces and give [her] longer breaks.\" Although neither Expert nor any other witness was able to identify any current job openings with specific employers that would satisfy these criteria, Expert testified generally that \"there are many employers that are willing to do that and understand the nature of disability and are willing to help ... manage those tasks for individuals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 After trial, the court found that Lisa was capable of at least part-time employment, and imputed $600 per month in income to her. This calculation was based on a finding that Lisa was capable of working at least three hours per day, for a total of fifteen hours per week, at an hourly wage of $9.61, for fifty weeks per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On appeal, Lisa challenges the trial court's decision to impute income to her, and argues that the evidence introduced at trial did not support the trial court's finding that she was capable of working for three hours per day at an hourly wage of $9.61. \"A challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence concerns the trial court's findings of fact. Those findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Kimball v.

Expert considered Lisa's MS diagnosis in forming her opinion. Expert also identified three examples of the type of \"sedentary occupation\" that she thought Lisa could perform, and testified that such jobs pay wages ranging from $9.61 to $12.87 per hour. Based largely on Expert's testimony, the trial court found that Lisa was capable of working for three hours per day, for a total of fifteen hours per week, at $9.61 per hour, for fifty weeks per year, and imputed $600 per month in income to Lisa based on those findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Although both Lisa and Nurse Practitioner testified that Lisa was incapable of working at all, the trial court was not required to credit that evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kimball v.

It could conceivably have found that Lisa was physically incapable of gainful employment and, had it done so, we would have been in no position to take issue with that finding. In this instance, however, the trial court chose to generally credit Expert's testimony regarding Lisa's employability over Lisa's and Nurse Practitioner's testimony-something it was entitled to do. The trial court based its findings on Expert's testimony, and those findings were well within the ranges laid out by Expert. Indeed, the trial court selected the lowest of the three hourly wages that Expert presented ($9.61),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and selected a per-day hours figure (three) that was toward the low end of the range that Expert presented. Because the trial court's factual findings are clearly supported by Expert's testimony, we cannot conclude that they lack general evidentiary support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kimball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996210\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/217/733/\">\n    2009 UT App 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996210\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/217/733/\">\n    217 P.3d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Lisa contends, however, that the trial court's findings are nevertheless unsupported by competent evidence, and she makes two specific arguments in support of this contention. First, Lisa argues that the trial court's findings lack support because neither Expert nor any other witness identified a specific job with a specific employer that met Expert's criteria. This argument misperceives the specificity requirements that vocational testimony must meet. Courts may impute income \"based upon employment\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    probable\n   </em>\n   earnings.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-12-203(8)(b) (emphasis added). Neither the statute nor any case law of which we are aware requires trial witnesses to identify a position with a specific employer that meets a spouse's employment needs. A trial court may ground its imputation findings on more general evidence, including testimony that jobs exist in the relevant marketplace that could theoretically meet a spouse's employment qualifications and medical needs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Busche v. Busche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984314\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/272/748/\">\n    2012 UT App 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984314\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/272/748/\">\n    272 P.3d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that imputation decisions \"necessarily depend[ ] on whether there are jobs available in the relevant market for a person with the party's qualifications and experience\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6991206\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/242/787/\">\n    2010 UT App 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 5, 16-17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6991206\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/242/787/\">\n    242 P.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding an imputation\n   decision where a vocational specialist testified there \"were a significant number of local jobs available\" for which the spouse was qualified). Here, Expert identified several categories of employment that would theoretically meet Lisa's medical and physical needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Second, Lisa argues that no witness offered any testimony that jobs exist in the current marketplace that meet Lisa's specific need for reasonable accommodations, such as shorter shifts and frequent breaks. On this point, Lisa is simply incorrect; Expert testified that \"there are many employers that are willing to [accommodate employees' disabilities] and understand the nature of disability and are willing to help ... manage those tasks for individuals.\" Expert's testimony in this regard is not rendered incompetent simply because Expert did not identify any specific employer willing to hire part-time employees on those terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 The trial court's findings regarding imputation of income to Lisa were supported by competent evidence, and were therefore not clearly erroneous.
