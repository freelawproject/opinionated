In the first case, Erika Johnson filed a petition in district court, requesting authorization to file a citizen's\n  complaint. After the district court denied Johnson's petition, Barnes Michael Ware filed a petition to summon a grand jury in superior court, based on the same set of facts underlying Johnson's petition. The superior court similarly denied Ware's petition. In these consolidated appeals, the appellants argue that the lower courts erred in finding that granting their petitions would unconstitutionally violate the separation of powers. Johnson also argues that the superior court, on review of the district court's decision, erred in finding that the prosecutorial standards did not warrant the filing of criminal charges through her petition.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-12\">\n  \u00b6 2 We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Johnson's petition. We also hold that the superior court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ware's petition. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's dismissal of Johnson's petition for issuance of a citizen's complaint, and we affirm the superior court's dismissal of Ware's petition to summon a grand jury.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A. THE INCIDENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 On April 28, 2016, the Centralia Police Department responded to a report of animal abuse at a Centralia apartment complex. The reporting party, Samantha Riggen, told officers that her neighbors had tortured and killed her mother's cat by throwing a rock at the cat and stabbing the cat with a knife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Officer William D. Phipps of the Centralia Police Department arrived on scene and was met by a large group of residents from the apartment complex. Officer Phipps interviewed four witnesses to the incident-one adult and three children. The adult, Alicia Schroeder, told Officer Phipps that her daughter had come to her and told her that two men \"were going to stab the cat.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 29. Schroeder then ran to the back of the apartment complex and saw a man she identified as Kyle Burke stab the cat in the neck and attempt to push the cat under a chain link fence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 The three juvenile witnesses who witnessed the incident told Officer Phipps that Emily Miller, another juvenile who lived in the apartment complex, had squeezed the cat, refused to let go, and twice threw the cat up toward her mother, who was standing on a second floor balcony. The girls informed Officer Phipps that at some point Burke threw a rock at the cat. After the cat fell to the ground, the girls reported seeing Burke and a man identified as Richard Allshouse running toward the cat with a knife. According to the girls, the two men were arguing about who would get to kill the cat first. The girls told Officer Phipps that Burke stabbed the cat and then shoved its body under a fence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Based on this information, Officer Phipps determined that there was probable cause to arrest Burke for first degree animal cruelty. Officer Phipps placed Burke under arrest and had him transported to Lewis County Jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Officer Phipps then went to the back of the apartment building and discovered that the cat's body had been removed from the fence and placed in a plastic garbage bag. Officer Phipps removed the cat's body from the bag and photographed its remains. Officer Phipps reported that \"[t]he only injury to the cat appeared to be to its head due to bleeding from the mouth and ears,\" and \"[b]ecause of the blood I could not tell if there was a stab wound in its ears or not.\" CP at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 Officer Phipps filled out an incident report detailing the facts set out above. His report requested that this case be forwarded to the Lewis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B. PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE DECLINES TO FILE CHARGES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 On April 29, the Lewis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office sent a letter to the Centralia Police Department, informing them that the prosecutor's office was declining to file charges in this case. In the letter, the prosecutor's office explained that Burke's \"actions related to the animal's death are unclear, at best, and he denied even causing the death.\" CP at 62. The letter further explained that, \"One account is that Mr. Burke stabbed the cat in the neck; however,\n   when Officer Phipps examined the cat's body, he was not able to locate any stab wounds.\" CP at 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 The letter also stated that the prosecutor's office found the accounts of the three juvenile witnesses to be the most credible and unbiased. However, those witness accounts \"related that another juvenile female caused the cat a substantial amount of suffering prior to Mr. Burke ever becoming involved.\" CP at 62. Specifically, the three juvenile witnesses stated that before Burke arrived on scene, \"the cat had been brutally squeezed, had been thrown or dropped from a second story balcony at least twice, and had a stone dropped upon or thrown against its head.\" CP at 62. The prosecutor's office stated that given these facts, it did not believe it would be possible to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Burke committed first degree animal cruelty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 The prosecutor's office also cited the evidentiary issues in the case; namely, that the cat's body was not collected at the scene. Without the body, the prosecutor's office would be unable to show how the cat died. The letter explained that any effort to recover the cat's body at this point in the investigation would be fruitless because the cat's body could have been tampered with since the incident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 The letter concluded, \"What happened to this animal was deplorable, inhumane, and without justification. Nevertheless, I cannot charge Mr. Burke with causing these harms without solid evidence that he is the individual who caused them.\" CP at 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C. SUBSEQUENT INVOLVEMENT OF PRIVATE PARTIES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1. Barnes Michael Ware\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13 Barnes Michael Ware is a retired police officer. His wife, Mary Ware,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   followed the incident involving the cat on Lewis County Sirens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Mary discovered that the cat's body had not been taken into evidence, she offered to take the cat and have him cremated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 14 On April 29, Ware and Mary went to the apartment complex to retrieve the cat's body. There, the two discovered that the cat's body had already been removed from the trash and placed into a garbage bag inside a cardboard box.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither opened the box, but Ware had Schroeder initial and date the box to show when he took charge of the box. Ware and Mary returned to their residence and placed the box inside a spare refrigerator in their garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 The next day, Ware met with Erika Johnson of Thurston County Animal Services at an animal hospital in Olympia. Ware signed and dated the box when he released it into Johnson's custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   2. Erika Johnson\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16 Johnson is a former police officer and deputy sheriff in the State of Oregon. At the time of this incident, Johnson worked as an animal services officer with Thurston County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 17 After Ware gave Johnson the box containing the cat's body, Johnson took the box and turned it over to an animal hospital to conduct a necropsy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The report following necropsy stated, \"To summarize the injuries, the cat suffered severe head and neck trauma. The exact cause of death is either skull fracture, penetrating brain trauma, cervical spinal fracture or possibly choking, due to the deep contusions and hemorr[h]age within the wall of the trachea and cervical deep tissues.\" CP at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 On June 28, Johnson met with the prosecutor's office and the Centralia Police Chief. The purpose of the meeting was to\n   discuss the prior charging decision in the case. At the meeting, the prosecutor's office told Johnson that it did not believe there was sufficient evidence to prove Burke's intent. The prosecutor's office also informed Johnson that it had referred Miller to the Juvenile Division. The prosecutor's office reiterated that it would not be filing charges in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   3. Animal Legal Defense Fund\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 On November 22, the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   sent a letter to the prosecutor's office, urging the prosecutor's office to bring charges against Burke. In the letter, the ALDF outlined charging theories that it believed the prosecutor's office could pursue. The letter then explained how the necropsy report supported those charging theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20 The prosecutor's office responded to the letter, explaining that it had again reviewed the results of the necropsy, but was still declining to file charges. The prosecutor's office explained that \"[n]othing in the report leads to any reliable, admissible evidence that Mr. Burke's actions constitute a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. What he did is, frankly, horrific. However, the report itself cannot pinpoint, with certainty, what caused the death in this case.\" CP at 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21 The prosecutor's office informed the ALDF that it takes animal cruelty cases very seriously, but also \"must be mindful of the admissible evidence, the mandates imposed by statutes and the burden of proof.\" CP at 70. The prosecutor's office reiterated that it was declining to file charges in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   D. PRIVATE CITIZEN PETITIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   1. Johnson's Petition\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   a. Filing in District Court\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 22 On December 20, Johnson filed a petition for issuance of a citizen's complaint under CrRLJ 2.1 (c). Under CrRLJ 2.1(c) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Any person wishing to institute a criminal action alleging a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor shall appear before a judge empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the State, other than a judge pro tem.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition to probable cause, the court may consider:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (1) Whether an unsuccessful prosecution will subject the State to costs or damage claims under RCW 9A.16.110, or other civil proceedings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (2) Whether the complainant has adequate recourse under laws governing small claims suits, anti-harassment petitions or other civil actions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (3) Whether a criminal investigation is pending;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (4) Whether other criminal charges could be disrupted by allowing the citizen complaint to be filed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (5) The availability of witnesses at trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (6) The criminal record of the complainant, potential defendant and potential witnesses, and whether any have been convicted of crimes of dishonesty as defined by ER 609 ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (7) Prosecution standards under RCW 9.94A.440.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   If the judge is satisfied that probable cause exists, and factors (1) through (7) justify filing charges ... the judge may authorize the citizen to sign and file a complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 23 Johnson argued that probable cause existed for filing charges of second degree animal cruelty,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   taking, concealing, injuring, and killing of a pet animal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   third degree\n   malicious mischief,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and criminal conspiracy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Johnson sought to have criminal charges filed against Allshouse, Burke, Miller, and Miller's mother, Tina Miller.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 24 In support of her petition, Johnson filed several declarations of witnesses to the event. Johnson also filed a personal declaration in which she detailed her background in investigating animal abuse cases and declared that probable cause existed for the criminal charges she proposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 25 The State filed a response in which it explained that the Lewis County Juvenile Court had exclusive jurisdiction over Miller because she was under 12 years old at the time of the incident. As to the other proposed defendants, the State argued that there was not enough evidence to prove criminal activity beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 26 On December 27, the district court entered an oral ruling denying Johnson's petition to issue a citizen's complaint. The district court ruled, \"I don't need to hear from any witnesses ... the matters were briefed very well by both sides.\" CP at 141. The court stated, \"I have looked at the rule, I have read all the briefing, made an evaluation of probable cause for all the suggested crimes put forth by [Johnson's trial counsel] and Ms. Johnson, weighed the petition against any prosecutorial standards under 9.94A.411, both to prosecute and not to prosecute.\" CP at 141.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 27 The district court further explained that it had \"entertained other equitable considerations such as the motivation of the complaining party\" and \"taken into consideration the professional determination of the Lewis County Prosecutor's Office.\" CP at 141. The district court found that there was \"no willful disregard on behalf of the state of their oath or their duties, that this matter was fully investigated both by the government and the assistance of private citizens.\" CP at 142. As a result, the district court ruled that it was \"not going to allow the petition to proceed or sign the complaint.\" CP at 142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   b. Appeal to Superior Court\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 28 Johnson appealed the district court's denial of her petition for issuance of a citizen's complaint to the superior court under RALJ 2.2 and RALJ 2.6. In her appeal, Johnson stated the assigned errors \"include, but are not limited to, the court's undifferentiated and nonspecific conclusion denying Ms. Johnson the right to file any charge against any of the potential defendants under any of those statutes.\" CP at 265-66. Johnson argued that \"[w]hile the superior court conducts\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, Ms. Johnson nonetheless alleges that Judge Buzzard committed clear error and abused his discretion.\" CP at 266. Johnson also argued that \"nothing presented by Ms. Johnson or [the prosecutor's office] warranted denial of the petition.\" CP at 285. She further argued that prosecutorial standards under RCW 9.94A.411(2)(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    mandated\n   </em>\n   filing in this instance.\" CP at 286.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 29 In response, the State filed a motion to dismiss Johnson's RALJ appeal, arguing that there was no appealable order because the district court ruling was made orally. The State also argued that Johnson was not the party in interest and could not appeal the decision because she was not an aggrieved party under RALJ 2.1(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the State\n   raised for the first time a constitutional challenge to CrRLJ 2.1(c). Specifically, the State argued that if the superior court were to overturn the district court's ruling, then it would be \"overstepping into the exclusive authority vested by the Washington State Constitution in the county prosecutor\" and violate the separation of powers. CP at 292-93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 30 The superior court found that the district court's order denying Johnson's complaint was a final order because the decision terminated the case. The superior court further held that Johnson was an aggrieved party and, therefore, had standing to proceed under RALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 31 The superior court then applied de novo review to the district court's ruling, finding that there was probable cause to believe that the individuals Johnson named had committed second degree animal cruelty, taking, concealing, injuring or killing a pet, and third degree malicious mischief. In considering the other factors enumerated in CrRLJ 2.1(5)(c), the superior court held that nothing in the record suggested that an unsuccessful prosecution would subject the State to costs or damage claims and that Johnson may or may not have alternative recourse under the laws. The superior court also found that it did not appear that other criminal charges would be disrupted by allowing a citizen's complaint to be filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 32 However, the superior court held that the most persuasive factor was consideration of the prosecution standards under RCW 9.94A.411, which provides that crimes \"will be filed if the admissible evidence is of such convincing force as to make it probable that a reasonable and objective fact finder would convict after hearing all the admissible evidence and the most plausible defense that could be raised.\" The superior court agreed that \"considering the multiple persons who inflicted injury to the animal, the varying witness statements which a competent defense attorney could discredit, and the inexact determination of which wound or wounds contributed to the suffering and death of the cat,\" the evidence was not of such convincing force to make it probable that a reasonable and objective fact finder would convict. CP at 322.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 33 The superior court also ruled, \"Additionally, in that CrRLJ 2.1(c) allows the District Court to authorize the filing of criminal charges by a party other than the prosecuting attorney, it unconstitutionally violates the separation of powers doctrine.\" CP at 322. The superior court relied on\n   <em>\n    State v. Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022234\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/884/\">\n    174 Wash.2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20P.3d%20849\">\n    279 P.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) to hold that another branch of government \"cannot interfere with the core function that essentially defines a prosecuting attorney: the exercise of broad charging discretion on behalf of the local community.\" CP at 322. Accordingly, the superior court affirmed the district court's denial of Johnson's petition for issuance of a citizen's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   2. Ware's Petition\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 34 The same day the district court denied Johnson's petition for issuance of a citizen complaint, Ware filed a petition to summon a grand jury under RCW 10.27.030. Ware's petition contained the identical 10 pages of factual background as Johnson's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 35 Under RCW 10.27.030 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   No grand jury shall be summoned to attend at the superior court of any county except upon an order signed by a majority of the judges thereof. A grand jury shall be summoned by the court, where the public interest so demands, whenever in its opinion there is sufficient evidence of criminal activity or corruption within the county or whenever so requested by a public attorney, corporation counsel or city attorney upon a showing of good cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 36 In his petition, Ware argued that \"the public interest demands convening of a grand jury\" and that \"[t]he Lewis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office's decision not to charge Kyle Bobby Burke raises a question of grave public concern.\" CP at 2. Ware further argued that there was sufficient evidence of criminal activity to warrant submission to a grand jury. Specifically, Ware argued that there was sufficient evidence that Burke\n   committed first degree animal cruelty\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   because there was evidence that Burke inflicted substantial pain and caused physical injury to the cat. In support, Ware attached declarations of the five witnesses to the incident, which showed that Burke stabbed the cat and that the cat was seen moving following the stabbing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 37 The State filed a response, arguing that the superior court should not convene a grand jury and should dismiss Ware's petition. The State noted that Ware filed his petition within an hour of the district court's ruling dismissing Johnson's petition for the issuance of a citizen's complaint. The State also argued that Ware's petition was contrary to the purpose of grand juries, which are \"to serve law enforcement in combating crime and corruption.\" CP at 85 (quoting RCW 10.27.010 ). The State reiterated that it did not believe that there was sufficient admissible evidence in this case to sustain a criminal conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 38 The State also argued that Ware did not have standing to bring the petition because there was no evidence he owned the cat or that he lived in Lewis County. Though Johnson was not a petitioner in this case, the State also challenged Johnson's standing to bring a petition to summon a grand jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 39 In reply to the State's response, Ware asserted that he had standing to bring the claim because he \"has paid local sales tax.\" CP at 106. He further argued that RCW 10.27.030 does not require he show residency in the county he seeks to file charges. CP at 106-07. Ware further argued that \"[t]he use of the phrase 'public interest' in RCW 10.27.030 contemplates that any member of the general public may petition the court.\" CP at 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 40 Two days after Ware filed his reply to the State's response, the State filed a supplemental brief in opposition to a grand jury. There, the State argued that RCW 10.27.030 does not allow private citizens or private attorneys to petition the court to convene a grand jury. The State then asserted, for the first time, a constitutional challenge to Ware's petition. The State argued that Ware's petition \"constitute[ed] an unauthorized intrusion into the constitutional powers of the elected prosecutor.\" CP at 113. The State further argued that convening a grand jury by the superior court at the request of a private citizen, without involvement of the county prosecutor, was \"an improper encroachment of the judicial branch on the executive branch.\" CP at 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 41 Ware filed a surreply, and, in addition to addressing the State's arguments, asserted that the State was not a party to this action and, therefore, had no right to file either its responsive brief or its supplemental brief in superior court. Ware asked the court to disregard both of the State's responsive briefings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 42 On April 21, 2017, the superior court entered an order denying Ware's petition to summon a grand jury. The superior court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Ware does not specifically allege corruption within the county, but rather focuses on the criminal activity of one particular individual: Kyle Bobby Burke. Thus, we focus our inquiry on whether Burke was involved in criminal activity within the county, and whether the public interest demands that a grand jury be summoned to investigate this criminal activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   CP at 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 43 The superior court acknowledged that \"the death of [the cat] involved criminal conduct is not disputed.\" CP at 129. The superior court then considered the involvement of the prosecutor's office in investigating case and its reasons for declining to file charges. The superior court ruled that \"Ware ... asks us to summon a grand jury, with the obvious objective of indicting Burke on criminal charges. We decline this invitation because doing so would invade the Prosecuting Attorney's Office's discretion, vested by the Washington State Constitution.\" CP at 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 44 The superior court further ruled, \"Mindful that our Supreme Court continues to recognize the unique and exclusive power vested in the prosecuting attorney to exercise discretion as to which individuals are charged and with which offenses, we hereby determine that to usurp this executive power does not serve the public.\" CP at 131. The superior court concluded that its ruling did not shield the elected prosecutor from public review because \"prosecuting attorneys are accountable to the voting public-a bedrock of Democracy, as is the fundamental principal of separation of powers, which underlies our decision.\" CP at 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   E. APPELLATE HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 45 Ware filed a notice of appeal to this court, seeking review of the superior court's denial of his petition to summon a grand jury. Johnson filed a petition for review with the Washington Supreme Court, seeking review of the district court's order denying her petition and the superior court's order affirming the district court's denial of her petition for the issuance of a citizen's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 46 The State filed a motion in the Supreme Court to consolidate Johnson's appeal with Ware's appeal under RAP 3.3(b). The court granted the motion to consolidate and ordered this court to consider both appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   A.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 53 Johnson's reliance on the prosecutorial standards of RCW 9.94A.411(2)(a) is misplaced, as nothing in CrRLJ 2.1(c) mandates that the district court allow a citizen complaint to proceed if the court finds that RCW 9.94A.411(2)(a) justifies filing charges. Instead, CrRLJ 2.1(c) states that the judge reviewing the petition \"may\" consider the prosecution standards. Even if the reviewing judge determines that criminal charges are warranted, CrRLJ 2.1(c) still does not compel the court to allow the citizen's complaint. Instead, the rule provides that the judge \"may\" then allow the citizen to sign and file a complaint. CrRLJ 2.1(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the superior\n   court was not required to grant Johnson's petition based on RCW 9.94A.411(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 54 Here, the district court applied the standard outlined in CrRLJ 2.1(c) and considered the evidence presented in support of Johnson's petition. The district court looked at the rule, read the briefing, evaluated probable cause for all the suggested crimes in Johnson's petition, and weighed the petition against the prosecutorial standards under RCW 9.94A.411. The district court also \"entertained other equitable considerations\" required by the rule, including the motivation of the complaining party and whether anyone had been held accountable for any culpable acts in this case. CP at 141. The district court then concluded that \"there [was] no willful disregard on behalf of the state\" and that \"this matter was fully investigated.\" CP at 142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 55 Based on these considerations, the district court ruled that prosecution was not in the best interest in this particular case and dismissed Johnson's petition.

WARE'S PETITION TO CONVENE A GRAND JURY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 56 Ware asserts that the superior court ruled that allowing his petition to continue was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers. In support, Ware quotes the portion of the superior court's ruling finding that petitioning a grand jury in this case would \"usurp [the prosecuting attorney's] executive power\" and that \"the fundamental principal of separation of powers\" underlies its ruling. Br. of Appellant at 34. Though inartfully worded, we hold that the superior court never ruled that allowing private citizens to convene grand juries was unconstitutional. Thus, we reject Ware's challenge on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   1. The Superior Court's Ruling\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 57 Ware filed a petition to convene a grand jury under RCW 10.27.030. This statute governs the summoning of grand juries and provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   No grand jury shall be summoned to attend at the superior court of any county except upon an order signed by a majority of the judges thereof. A grand jury shall be summoned by the court, where the public interest so demands, whenever in its opinion there is sufficient evidence of criminal activity or corruption within the county or whenever so requested by a public attorney, corporation counsel or city attorney upon showing of good cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 58 Here, in its ruling, the superior court specifically stated that its inquiry under\n   RCW 10.27.030 focused on \"whether Burke was involved in criminal activity within the county, and whether the public interest demands that a grand jury be summoned to investigate this criminal activity.\" CP at 135. In considering these statutory requirements, the superior court found that it was undisputed that the death of the cat was the result of criminal conduct. However, in further assessing evidence of criminal activity, the superior court considered the Lewis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office's decision to decline to file charges. Specifically, the superior court considered that the prosecutor's office had twice declined to file criminal charges against Burke, even in light of new evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 59 After outlining the evidence of criminal activity in this case, the superior court then weighed the public interest in summoning a grand jury, as required by RCW 10.27.030. In assessing the public interest in summoning a grand jury in this particular case, the superior court noted the authority vested in the prosecuting attorney's office to make charging decisions and the doctrine of separation of powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 60 The superior court denied Ware's petition, finding that it would not serve the public interest to second guess the prosecutor's charging decision in this case, especially in light of the prosecutor's inherent charging discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In denying Ware's petition, the superior court ruled, \"Mindful that our Supreme Court continues to recognize the unique and exclusive power vested in the prosecuting attorney to exercise discretion as to which individuals are charged and with which offenses, we hereby determine that to usurp this executive power does not serve the public.\" CP at 137.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 61 The superior court never declared RCW 10.27.030 unconstitutional either facially or as applied to this case. Instead, the superior court considered Ware's petitions on the merits. The superior court's references to the principle of separation of powers and the inherent charging discretion of the prosecutor's office are not equivalent to ruling that a statute unconstitutionally violates separation of powers as applied to private citizens. Thus, we hold that the superior court never declared RCW 10.27.030 unconstitutional as to private citizens and reject Ware's challenge on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   2. Ware's Petition Decided on the Merits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 62 Ware primarily challenges the superior court's ruling that allowing a private citizen to convene a grand jury unconstitutionally violates the separation of powers. As explained above, Ware's challenge on this basis fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 63 However, on appeal, Ware also erroneously argues that the superior court \"never reached the merits\" of his petition. Br. of Appellant at 38. Ware further argues that \"[n]o legitimate authority exists to deny Mr. Ware or Ms. Johnson\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   the right to petition the court.\" Br. of Appellant at 38. We hold that Ware's argument fails because the superior court did decide Ware's petition on the merits and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   a. Standard of review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 64 To address whether the superior court erred in dismissing Ware's petition on its merits, we must first determine the appropriate standard of review. No court has yet determined the applicable standard in reviewing a superior court's denial of a petition to summon a grand jury under\n   RCW 10.27.030. We adopt an abuse of discretion standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 65 An abuse of discretion standard is appropriate\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   when (1) the trial court is generally in a better position than the appellate court to make a given determination; (2) a determination is fact intensive and involves numerous factors to be weighed on a case-by-case basis; (3) the trial court has more experience making a given type of determination and a greater understanding of the issues involved; (4) the determination is one for which \"no rule of general applicability could be effectively construed,\"; and/or (5) there is a strong interest in finality and avoiding appeals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Superior Court did not abuse its discretion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 69 Ware contends that the superior court never addressed his petition on the merits because the court never addressed whether Burke could be found guilty of first degree animal cruelty. Specifically, Ware argues that the evidence showed that Burke, \"without authorization of law, intentionally caused physical injury to [the cat].\" Br. of Appellant at 38. We hold that, while it may have been inartfully worded, the superior court did address Ware's petition on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 70 In its ruling, the superior court specifically discussed the evidence of criminal activity in this case, as required by RCW 10.27.030. The superior court found that it was \"not disputed\" that the cat's death involved criminal activity. CP at 135. The superior court did not determine whether the evidence supported a first degree animal cruelty charge. But nothing in RCW 10.27.030 requires the court to state in its opinion what particular criminal activity was present in this particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 71 After detailing the evidence of criminal activity, the superior court analyzed whether the public interest demanded summoning a grand jury, which it was required to find by RCW 10.27.030. The superior court ruled that based on the facts of this case, the considerable investigation conducted by the prosecutor's office, and the unique and exclusive power vested in the prosecuting attorney to exercise charging discretion, the public interest did not demand summoning a grand jury in this particular case. Thus, the record shows that the superior court considered Ware's petition on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 72 Also, the superior court's decision was not based on untenable reasons or grounds. The superior court properly considered the standard for convening a grand jury under RCW 10.27.030 and ruled that the public interest did not demand convening a grand jury in this particular situation. This ruling was not untenable because the prosecutor's office had already reviewed the evidence twice and found that the evidence was insufficient to prove charges against Burke beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 73 The superior court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the public interest did not demand summoning a grand jury in a case where the prosecuting attorney had investigated the case, repeatedly assessed the evidence, and decided to not file charges because it determined that it would not be able to convict Burke of first degree animal cruelty beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we affirm the superior court's dismissal of Ware's petition to summon a grand jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 74 We hold that the district court's denial of Johnson's petition was not based on untenable grounds or for untenable reasons, and therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion.
