The Colorado Independent contends that the federal and state constitutions grant a presumptive right of access to documents filed in criminal cases. While presumptive access\n   to judicial\n   <em>\n    proceedings\n   </em>\n   is a right recognized under both the state and federal constitutions, neither the United States Supreme Court nor this court has ever held that\n   <em>\n    records\n   </em>\n   filed with a court are treated the same way. We decline to conclude here that such unfettered access to criminal justice records is guaranteed by either the First Amendment or Article II, section 10 of the Colorado Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Defendant Sir Mario Owens was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in 2008. In 2017, the trial court denied Mr. Owens's motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Crim. P. 32.2, as well as his related motion to disqualify the District Attorney's Office for the 18th Judicial District and to appoint a special prosecutor. The basis for the motion to disqualify was an allegation that the District Attorney had failed to disclose evidence that would have been favorable to Mr. Owens's defense. Over Mr. Owens's objection, the trial court issued a protective order, which remains in place today, sealing portions of the post-conviction motions practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 2017, The Colorado Independent (\"Petitioner\") filed a motion with the district court, asking the court to unseal the records, arguing that public access to the records was required by the First Amendment, Article II, section 10 of the Colorado Constitution, common law, and the Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act. The district court denied that motion, and Petitioner filed for relief under C.A.R. 21, limiting its request for relief to the argument that presumptive access to judicial records is a constitutional guarantee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Relief under C.A.R. 21 is an extraordinary remedy limited in purpose and availability.

We have previously exercised our original jurisdiction to address public access to court documents.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    People v.

Petitioner cites none. The Tenth Circuit has more than once declined to recognize a First Amendment right of access to court records.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lanphere &amp; Urbaniak v. Colorado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329112\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/21/1508/#p1512\">\n    21 F.3d 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1512 (10th Cir. 1994) (\"[T]here is no general First Amendment right in the public to access criminal justice records.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hickey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"349236\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/767/705/#p709\">\n    767 F.2d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 709 (10th Cir. 1985) (distinguishing between the acknowledged right of the public and press to attend trial proceedings and a claimed of right to access court files).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Moreover, we have never recognized any such constitutional right-whether under the First Amendment or Article II, section 10 of the Colorado Constitution. Petitioner's near-exclusive reliance on this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Wingfield\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Wingfield\n   </em>\n   , we analyzed a statutory prohibition against the inspection of court records in pending cases\n   by non-parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5317871\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/159/172/\">\n    410 P.2d at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that while no \"absolute right to examine\" court records exists, inspection may be permitted \"at the discretion of the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 513. Contrary to Petitioner's assertion, this court did not hold in\n   <em>\n    Wingfield\n   </em>\n   that limiting access to court records violates the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   We decline to do so now in the absence of any indication from the nation's high court that access to all criminal justice records is a constitutionally guaranteed right belonging to the public at large.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 We also see no compelling reason to interpret our state constitution as guaranteeing such a sweeping-and previously unrecognized-right of unfettered access to criminal justice records. On the contrary, such a ruling would do violence to the comprehensive open records laws and administrative procedures currently in place-including, but not limited to, the Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act, \u00a7\u00a7 24-72-301 to - 309, C.R.S. (2017)-that are predicated upon the absence of a constitutionally guaranteed right of access to criminal justice records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 We affirm the denial of The Colorado Independent's motion to unseal the subject records and, consequently, discharge the rule.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Mr. Owens filed a C.A.R. 21 petition with this court in March 2017 seeking to have the protective order vacated. We declined to issue a rule to show cause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Order of Court,\n    <em>\n     In re People v. Owens\n    </em>\n    , No. 17SA59 (Colo.
