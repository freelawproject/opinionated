The City of Golden opposed this application, arguing that Coors could not proceed by amendment but must adjudicate a new water right to reuse or make successive use of the return flows. On competing motions for determinations of questions of law, the water court ruled that (1) any amount of water not beneficially used by Coors for the uses specified in its decreed augmentation plans must be returned to the stream; (2) Coors's decreed augmentation plans did not authorize the reuse or successive use of such water; and (3) Coors may not obtain the right to reuse or make successive use of such water by way of amendment to its augmentation plans but could only obtain such rights by adjudicating a new water right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 2 Coors appeals, arguing that the water court erred in (1) holding that Coors may not proceed by amendment but must adjudicate a new water right; (2) concluding that water unconsumed by Coors's initial use must be returned to the stream and is subject to appropriation by other water users; and (3) interpreting Coors's augmentation plan decrees to require permanent dedication of return flows to the stream.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 3 We now affirm. Like the water court, we conclude that in order to obtain the right to reuse and make successive use of the return flows at issue, Coors must adjudicate a new water right and may not circumvent this requirement by amending its decreed augmentation plans. We further conclude that the diversion of native, tributary water under an augmentation plan does not change its character. Accordingly, the general rule, which provides that return flows belong to the stream, applies. Finally, we conclude that the water court correctly construed Coors's augmentation plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 4 Between 1977 and 2007, Coors sought and obtained three augmentation plan decrees. These decrees allowed Coors to divert water from Clear Creek out of priority for use within Coors's Golden brewery and industrial complex, conditioned on Coors's releasing enough replacement water to avoid injury to senior rights. Much of the water that Coors diverts pursuant to the decreed augmentation plans is consumed by Coors's brewery operations. Water not consumed by\n   the brewery is run through Coors's wastewater treatment plant and is then delivered to Clear Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 5 Beginning in the 1970s, Coors, with the approval and oversight of the State and Division Engineers, maintained a program to lease the water delivered to Clear Creek (the \"return flows\") to other water users. Coors apparently operated this program with the understanding that once it fully replaced its out-of-priority diversions, it had no further obligation under its augmentation decrees because Clear Creek would have been made whole (i.e., Clear Creek would then have contained the same amount of water at the replacement water delivery point as it would have had without Coors's diversions). Coors further understood that at this point, any \"excess\" water released from Coors's wastewater treatment plant would have served only to overcompensate the stream, and Coors believed that it could reuse or lease such water to other users downstream.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 6 In 2014, however, the State Engineer chose not to approve a new lease of Coors's return flows to Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., effectively terminating Coors's long-time leasing practice. Coors and Martin Marietta challenged the Engineer's decision before the water court, arguing that the return flows at issue could be reused or successively used by Coors, as it had done for many years. The Engineer disagreed, arguing that Coors's augmentation plans did not specify that Coors could reuse or successively use its return flows. The parties then filed cross-motions for determinations of questions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 7 The water court ultimately agreed with the State Engineer. The court began by noting that Coors's decreed augmentation plans allowed only a single use of the water diverted by Coors, and this use was limited to the purposes specified in the decrees. Because the plans did not authorize the reuse or successive use of such water, the court found that Coors was required to return unconsumed native water from Coors's initial use back to the stream and could not lease the return flows absent a subsequent decree authorizing the reuse or successive use of that water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 8 In reaching this conclusion, the court rejected Coors's contention that native water withdrawn from a stream that is fully replaced under an augmentation plan is like developed, foreign, or non-tributary water and thus could be fully consumed, reused, or successively used. The court observed that the fact that Coors diverts native, tributary water out of priority by adding replacement water to the stream under its decreed augmentation plans does not change the character of the water that is diverted from native water to something akin to foreign, developed, or non-tributary water. In the court's view, Coors therefore could not apply the water at issue to uses beyond those specified in its decrees, and the reuse or successive use that Coors sought was not so specified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9 The court further rejected Coors's argument that other users had no expectation of return flows from fully augmented diversions and therefore the one-use rule need not apply. The water court opined that this court had addressed and rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Water Supply and Storage Co. v. Curtis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409177,10409057\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/733/680/\">\n    733 P.2d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo. 1987). There, the applicant argued that an original appropriator should be recognized to have the right to reuse and make successive uses of water if the further use of the water was initiated immediately after the first beneficial use so that other users had no expectations regarding, and did not come to rely on, the return flows.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409177,10409057\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/733/680/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409177,10409057\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/733/680/\">\n    at 682-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court disagreed, observing first that once the beneficial use on which a water right is based has taken place, any unconsumed waters remain waters of the state and were subject to appropriation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409177,10409057\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/733/680/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409177,10409057\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/733/680/\">\n    at 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We then noted that the proper inquiry was whether the applicant had established by appropriation a right in the return flows.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409177,10409057\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/733/680/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the facts there before us, we concluded that the applicant had not done so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409177,10409057\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/733/680/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 10 The water court in the present case determined that the same principles apply here. Coors's augmentation plan decrees provide that after Coors's initial use, any unconsumed water must be returned to the stream. The decrees do not authorize reuse or successive use. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Water Supply\n   </em>\n   , the unconsumed water remains waters of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11 Upon receiving the water court's ruling, Coors filed a motion for leave to amend its existing augmentation plan decrees to allow the reuse or successive use of the return flows at issue. Golden moved to dismiss Coors's application, and the parties filed cross-motions for determinations of questions of law. The water court ultimately sided with Golden, concluding, \"Coors may not obtain the right to reuse return flows through an amendment to its decreed augmentation plans, but instead may only obtain the right to reuse return flows by adjudicating a new water right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 12 In reaching this conclusion, the court reiterated the fundamental rule that water native to the stream system is limited to one use and that any return flows belong to the stream, subject to appropriation and administration. In the court's view, any reuse of return flows without a decree authorizing such use would amount to an unlawful enlargement of an appropriation by Coors. The court thus determined that to reuse return flows from a decreed use of native water, an appropriator must establish all of the elements of an independent appropriation and obtain a decree as a separate water right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 Turning to the facts before it, the court found that none of Coors's decreed augmentation plans authorize the reuse or successive use of return flows. To the contrary, each decree provides that any amount of water not consumed during Coors's initial use of the water must be returned to the stream. Because Coors had neither claimed nor proved when it originally litigated its augmentation plan decrees that it would place return flows to beneficial use, the court concluded that Coors could not proceed by way of an amendment to its augmentation plan. To allow Coors to do so, the court observed, would result in return flows that had historically accumulated and belonged to the stream being \"precipitously\" removed from the priority system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 After receiving this order from the water court, Coors advised the court that it would not seek a new appropriation but rather would pursue its effort to amend its augmentation decrees. The court then certified its order as final pursuant to C.R.C.P. 54(b), and Coors now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15 Coors raises three issues in this appeal. First, it contends that the water court erred in concluding that Coors may not obtain rights of reuse or successive use by amending its augmentation plan decrees but rather must adjudicate a new water right. Second, it argues that the water court erred in concluding that the return flows at issue are subject to appropriation by other water users. In Coors's view, the return flows at issue are akin to foreign or developed water and thus Coors has an implied right of reuse. Finally, Coors argues that the water court erred in interpreting Coors's augmentation plan decrees to require permanent dedication of return flows to the stream, regardless of whether such return flows are needed to replace Coors's fully augmented depletions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16 After briefly summarizing the pertinent principles of water law at issue, we address and reject each of Coors's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Prior Appropriation and Augmentation Plans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 17 The prior appropriation doctrine is embedded in the Colorado Constitution and forms the foundation of Colorado water law.\n   <em>\n    City of Boulder v. Boulder &amp; Weld Cty. Ditch Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822916\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/367/1179/\">\n    2016 CO 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822916\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/367/1179/\">\n    367 P.3d 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1186. In accordance with the prior appropriation doctrine, Colorado water law reflects a property rights-based allocation and administration system that promotes multiple use of a finite resource for beneficial purposes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822916\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/367/1179/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under this system, \"[t]he first user to place previously unappropriated water to beneficial use enjoy[s] a vested water right in the beneficial use of that water, thus giving that senior appropriator priority in use over all subsequent (and therefore junior) appropriators.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallegos v.

In this system, water rights are created by appropriation, confirmed and assigned priority dates through adjudication, and enforced according to those priority dates through\n   administration.\n   <em>\n    City of Boulder\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822916\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/367/1179/\">\n    367 P.3d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 18 Notably, a water right is a usufructuary right that gives its holder \"the right to use and enjoy the property of another without impairing its substance.\"\n   <em>\n    Navajo Dev.

Accordingly, it is not at all clear that the statute authorizes amendments of the type that Coors is pursuing in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 27 Second, a long line of case law from this court makes clear that \"[i]n order to reuse or make successive use of return flows, all of the elements of an independent appropriation must be established and decreed as a separate water right.\"\n   <em>\n    Santa Fe Trail Ranches Prop.

Thus, Coors has not yet adjudicated the rights of reuse and successive use that it seeks here, and settled case law requires such an adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 29 In this regard, we are unpersuaded by Coors's contention that it need not adjudicate a right to reuse or make successive use of the return flows at issue because it diverted the water under an augmentation plan. As the water court observed, diverting water out of priority from the public stream system and replacing water under a decreed augmentation plan does not allow a junior water user to circumvent the established rule that an appropriation is limited to the amount of water the appropriator puts to beneficial use, with the beneficial uses being those set forth in the decreed augmentation plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington Ditch Reservoir &amp; Land Co. v. Metro Wastewater Reclamation Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987610\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/256/645/#p663\">\n    256 P.3d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 663 (Colo. 2011) (\"Water native to the stream system is limited to one use in that system and return flows belong to the stream system as part of the public's resource, subject to appropriation and administration.\");\n   <em>\n    Water Supply &amp; Storage Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409177,10409057\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/733/680/\">\n    733 P.2d at 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he proper inquiry is whether the applicant has established a right in the return flow by appropriation, for that is the basis, if there is any, upon which its claim to that return flow must be founded.\"). Coors cites no applicable authority to support its view that different principles apply to\n   augmentation plan decrees than apply to other decreed water rights, and we have seen no such authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 30 Third, what Coors construes as a \"limited\" amendment to its decreed augmentation plans would effectively add new uses to its decreed water rights while avoiding the procedural hurdles that normally accompany such changes. Specifically, Coors contends that the water court\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   approve the amendment allowing reuse and leasing after a showing of non-injury. As Golden noted at oral argument, however, such an abbreviated proceeding would seem to preclude a party opposing such an amendment from challenging the amendment under, among other things, the anti-speculation doctrine, which the party could indisputably do if Coors were to seek a new appropriation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Front Range Res., LLC v. Colo. Ground Water Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20CO%2025\">\n    2018 CO 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566682\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/415/807/#p812\">\n    415 P.3d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812 (noting that the anti-speculation doctrine applied to the replacement plan there at issue because that plan involved new appropriations or changes of water rights of designated groundwater).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 31 Finally, we disagree that the State Engineer's prior approval of Coors's practice of leasing return flows has any bearing on our decision today. \"Administrative action, forbearance of enforcement, or State Engineer acquiescence in water use practices does not substitute for judicial determination of use rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Empire Lodge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9400138\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/39/1139/#p1150\">\n    39 P.3d at 1156-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether or not the State Engineer's decision in 2014 effected a change in policy, Coors's historical practice of leasing return flows does not justify a continuation or, indeed, expansion of that practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 32 For these reasons, we agree with the water court that Coors must establish all of the elements of an independent appropriation to obtain the right to reuse or make successive use of return flows generated after its initial use of the water at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 33 In reaching this conclusion, we are unpersuaded by Coors's contention that requiring it to establish the elements of an independent appropriation defeats the purpose of the statutory scheme. Although augmentation plans implement the General Assembly's policy of \"maximum flexibility\" for water users, they do so by protecting, not subverting, the prior appropriation doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9400138\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/39/1139/#p1150\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9400138\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/39/1139/#p1150\">\n    at 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, each of Coors's three augmentation plans appears to have sought and achieved the legislature's intended flexibility by allowing Coors to divert water out of priority for use within its brewery and industrial complex, when Coors's junior water rights might otherwise have been curtailed. We perceive nothing in the statutory scheme that contemplates, much less sanctions, a water user's diverting water out of priority, overcompensating the stream for the depletions caused by its out-of-priority diversions, applying the diverted water to a beneficial use, and then seeking to lease any excess water to users downstream. To the contrary, such a practice conflicts with the fundamental principle that appropriators are limited to a single beneficial use and that return flows belong to the stream system as part of the public's resources, subject to appropriation and administration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington Ditch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987610\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/256/645/#p663\">\n    256 P.3d at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Return Flows Subject to Appropriation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 34 Coors next contends that the water court erred in concluding that its return flows are subject to appropriation by other water users. In Coors's view, water that it diverts and fully replaces under its decreed augmentation plans is akin to foreign and developed water. This is so, Coors argues, because the act of delivering replacement water to compensate (and sometimes overcompensate) the stream for its depletions maintains or even increases the supply of water available for beneficial use in the stream. Thus, Coors suggests that it should have an implied right to reuse and make successive use of such water, which should not be available for appropriation by other users. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 35 Notwithstanding Coors's suggestion to the contrary, water that Coors diverts from Clear Creek is native, tributary water, that is, \"waters of the state.\" \u00a7 37-92-103(12) (\" 'Waters of the state' means all surface and underground water in or tributary to all natural streams within the state of Colorado,\n   except waters referred to in section 37-90-103(6).\"). Foreign and developed waters, in contrast, are not native, tributary waters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Aurora ex rel. Util. Enter. v. Colo.

(2017) (\"Whenever an appropriator has lawfully introduced foreign water into a stream system from an unconnected stream system, such appropriator may make a succession of uses of such water by exchange or otherwise....\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Midway Ranches Prop. Owners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11972254\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/938/515/#p523\">\n    938 P.2d 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 523 (Colo. 1997) (\"In contrast to developed or imported water which is foreign to the tributary supply and typically can be utilized to extinction, an appropriation of tributary water cannot serve an enlarged duty, in the absence of noticed intent to appropriate for reuse or successive uses.\") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 37 In contrast, Coors, which diverts native, tributary water pursuant to a decreed augmentation plan, has not imported new water from an unconnected source into the stream system. And contrary to Coors's suggestion, the mere act of diverting and fully replacing water under an augmentation plan does not effectively change the character of the diverted water as native, tributary water. Accordingly, the diversion and replacement of water under an augmentation plan does not confer on Coors an automatic right of reuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10309842\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/926/1/#p65\">\n    926 P.2d at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Appropriators of water native to a public stream have no automatic right to capture and reuse this water after the initial application to beneficial use.\");\n   <em>\n    Water Supply &amp; Storage Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409177,10409057\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/733/680/\">\n    733 P.2d at 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that once the beneficial use on which a water right is based has taken place, any unconsumed waters remain waters of the state and are therefore subject to appropriation). Rather, like all native, tributary water, absent decreed rights of reuse or successive use, the water that Coors diverts may be used once, and unconsumed water must be returned to the stream, where it is subject to appropriation by other users.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 38 In reaching this conclusion, we are not persuaded by Coors's contention that our conclusion undermines augmentation plans' statutory purposes. Specifically, Coors contends that requiring it both to replace depletions under its augmentation plans and to relinquish the return flows at issue would deter the use of augmentation plans, destabilize the value of augmentation decrees, and undermine the maximum beneficial use of water. For two reasons, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 39 First, we note that Coors's augmentation plan decrees allow Coors to reduce its replacement obligations by the amount of return flows generated and returned to Clear Creek at specified points. Thus, Coors need not overcompensate the stream, and it does not do so when it uses its return flows to offset depletions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 40 Second, the fact that Coors's replacement of depletions and relinquishment of return flows may sometimes result in overcompensation and a net gain to the stream is simply part of the normal functioning of augmentation plans. As this court has observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [A]ugmentation plans are often fashioned, or operate by default, to supply more augmentation water to the stream than proves to be necessary. Supplying excess augmentation water to the stream under a decree certainly benefits other water users in order of their priorities, but there is no entitlement to continuation of such a gratuity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Wolfe v. Sedalia Water &amp; Sanitation Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882848\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/343/16/\">\n    2015 CO 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882848\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/343/16/\">\n    343 P.3d 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 41 In sum, Coors need not overcompensate the stream, and the fact that it may sometimes do so does not undermine either the purpose of augmentation plans or the maximum beneficial use of water. Rather,\n   occasional overcompensation appears to be a by-product of the legislature's policy of maximizing flexibility while, at the same time, protecting the prior appropriation doctrine by ensuring that out-of-priority diverters deliver at least enough replacement water to compensate the stream.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Empire Lodge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9400138\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/39/1139/#p1150\">\n    39 P.3d at 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Interpretation of Coors's Augmentation Plans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 42 Finally, Coors contends that the water court erred in concluding that Coors's decrees require it to dedicate return flows to the stream, regardless of whether such return flows were needed to replace depletions caused by Coors's out-of-priority diversions. Again, we are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 43 Each of the three decrees at issue expressly provides that Coors will return all unconsumed water back to the stream. Specifically, two of the decrees provide, \"[A]fter use, the portion of the water not consumed within [Coors's] industrial complex is measured ... and returned to the Clear Creek-South Platte stream systems at various of [specified] locations.\" The third decree likewise provides, \"[A]fter use, the portion of the water not consumed is measured ... and returned to the Clear Creek-South Platte stream systems at various of [specified] locations.\" Although Coors appears to assert that these provisions serve only to indicate where it may release return flows, in our view, such an interpretation reads out of the decrees the express requirement that unconsumed water be returned to the stream system. Accordingly, the water court's findings are supported by the plain language of the decreed augmentation plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 44 Moreover, as noted above, in concluding that return flows from Coors's initial use of water belong to the stream, the water court relied on \"the established\n   <em>\n    legal principle\n   </em>\n   that native water is limited to a single use and all unused water must be returned to the stream, where it then becomes available for appropriation by other water users.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the water court's conclusion is also supported by long-settled law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 45 We therefore conclude that the water court did not err in its construction of Coors's augmentation plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 46 For these reasons, we conclude that (1) in order to obtain the right to reuse or make successive use of the return flows at issue, Coors must adjudicate a new water right and may not proceed by way of an amendment to its decreed augmentation plans; (2) water unconsumed by Coors's initial use must be returned to the stream and is subject to appropriation by other water users; and (3) the water court correctly interpreted Coors's decreed augmentation plans. Accordingly, we affirm the water court's judgment and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   JUSTICE BOATRIGHT does not participate.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    This court has had few opportunities to consider the standards applicable to amending an augmentation plan, although we have observed that the legislature has recognized \"the complex nature of a plan for augmentation and the necessity of allowing the water court to adjust such a plan upon reconsideration.\"\n    <em>\n     Crystal Lakes Water &amp; Sewer Ass'n v.

We need not attempt to delineate any applicable standards here, however, because we conclude that the procedure for amending an augmentation plan must, at a minimum, comply with the requirements of both subsections 37-92-305(3), (5), and (8) and our case precedents. As more fully discussed below, Coors has not established such compliance here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
