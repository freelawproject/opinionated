Based upon the findings of fact and the respondent's admissions in his answer to the amended formal complaint, the hearing panel concludes as a matter of law that the respondent violated KRPC 1.1, KRPC 1.3, KRPC 1.4, KRPC 1.8, KRPC 1.16, KRPC 8.4, Rule 203, and Rule 211, as detailed below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   \" KRPC 1.1\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   \"107. Lawyers must provide competent representation to their clients. KRPC 1.1. 'Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.' The respondent failed to competently represent J.L.P.-O. The respondent failed to timely file appellate docketing documents that were required to perfect his client's appeal[.] Further, the respondent failed to respond to the 10th Circuit Court's notifications that action was required. Moreover, the 10th Circuit Court explicitly stated that the respondent did not have an appreciation of his obligations to a criminal defendant with an appeal pending in the 10th Circuit Court. The respondent's failure to understand those obligations and the rules of the court for counsel who are filing a notice of appeal, even if they intend to withdraw, demonstrates that he lacked the legal knowledge and preparation necessary to provide competent representation to J.L.P.-O. before the 10th Circuit Court. Because the respondent failed to demonstrate the necessary legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation of J.L.P.-O. before the 10th Circuit Court, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   \" KRPC 1.3\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   \"108.

The respondent failed to diligently and promptly represent J.L.P.-O. In representing J.L.P.-O., the respondent failed to timely perfect the appeal and respond to the court's orders. Because the respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing his client, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   \" KRPC 1.4\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   \"109. KRPC 1.4(a) provides that '[a] lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.' In DA12034, the respondent violated KRPC 1.4(a) when he failed to properly communicate with R.Y. and his mother, D.Y. When the respondent was admitted into inpatient substance abuse treatment, R.Y. was incarcerated awaiting trial on serious felon[y] charges. The respondent failed to inform his client that he was in inpatient treatment, that his license to practice law had been suspended, and he would be unable to defend him at trial. D.Y. went to great measures to contact the respondent. Further, when D.Y. called the respondent's office, the respondent's receptionist told D.Y. that the respondent was out of the office and she would give him the message that she called, leading D.Y. to conclude that the respondent remained available to represent her son. Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.4(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   \" KRPC 1.8(f)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   \"110.

In this case, the respondent accepted compensation from R.B. to represent N.W. However, the respondent failed to obtain consent from N.W. prior to the representation. Because the respondent failed to comply with the precondition required by KRPC 1.8(f), the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.8(f).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   \" KRPC 1.16\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   \"111.

In his letter to the 10th Circuit Court Clerk, the respondent explained that he discontinued medications for mental health conditions. The respondent continued that, as a result, he experienced mania in late 2012 which affected his ability to organize his thoughts and to sleep. Additionally, during that same time period, the respondent was actively using methamphetamine and other substances. Because of his mental health difficulties and his drug abuse, under KRPC 1.16(a)(2) the respondent was required to withdraw from the representation of J.L.P.-O. Further, KRPC 1.16(a)(2) prohibited the respondent from accepting the representation of R.Y. Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.16(a)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   \"112.

In this case, the respondent repeatedly engaged in criminal conduct by possessing illegal substances. The respondent was convicted of many of the crimes. Additionally, in Texas, the respondent received a deferred adjudication on two felony offenses. The crimes which the respondent was convicted of and placed on deferred adjudication for adversely reflect on the respondent's fitness as a lawyer.

Additionally, the respondent's criminal conduct and temporary suspension interfered with and caused delay in D.P., R.Y., N.W., and B.F.'s cases.

The respondent did not file exceptions to the panel's final hearing report. As such, the findings of fact are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule 212(c), (d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 255). Furthermore, the evidence before the panel establishes by clear and convincing evidence the charged misconduct violated KRPC 1.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 289) (competence); 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.4(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (communication); 1.8(f) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 309) (accepting compensation for representation of client from one other than client); 1.16(a)(2) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (declining and terminating representation); 1.16(d) (terminating representation); 8.4(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 381) (commission of a criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer); 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice); Kansas Supreme Court Rule 203(c)(1) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 234) (failure to timely report felony charges to the Disciplinary Administrator); and Kansas Supreme Court Rule 211(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 251) (failure to file a timely answer in disciplinary proceeding), and it supports the panel's conclusions of law. We therefore adopt the panel's conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The only remaining issue before us is the appropriate discipline for respondent's violations. At the panel hearing, Deputy Disciplinary Administrator Deborah L. Hughes recommended disbarment; or if the panel determined suspension was the appropriate discipline, she recommended indefinite suspension\n   from the practice of law. The respondent requested suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The panel unanimously recommended indefinite suspension. In addition, the panel recommended that if the respondent petitions for reinstatement, he must establish before a reinstatement panel, by clear and convincing evidence, that he: Is then fit to practice law, has participated in mental health treatment as directed by treatment professionals, has returned all unearned fees, has reimbursed the Client Protection Fund for any claims paid to his clients on his behalf, has been discharged from criminal probation in all jurisdictions, and has obtained a level of rehabilitation such that recurrence of the misconduct is unlikely (hereinafter referred to as Additional Reinstatement Conditions). Finally, the panel suggested that the respondent assist other attorneys with overcoming addiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   At the hearing before this court, Deputy Disciplinary Administrator Matthew J. Vogelsberg recommended that the court adopt the hearing panel's recommendation of indefinite suspension. Further, in addition to the factors the respondent is required to establish at the reinstatement hearing under Supreme Court Rule 219(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 264), the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator recommended the court require the respondent to establish the panel's recommended Additional Reinstatement Conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The Deputy Disciplinary Administrator explained that the office of the Disciplinary Administrator had changed its recommendation from disbarment to indefinite suspension, relying in part on Standard 5.12 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, which relates circumstances when suspension is generally appropriate for violations of a lawyer's duty to the public for failure to maintain personal integrity. Furthermore, the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator noted additional factors supporting suspension, rather than disbarment, to-wit: Respondent's candor at his disciplinary hearing; his continuing compliance with the conditions of his community supervision in Texas; and his continuing efforts to maintain his sobriety. But given Respondent's repeated criminal conduct, the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator recommended that the indefinite suspension commence on the date this court files its opinion. See Supreme Court Rule 219(a)(2) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 264) (\"An attorney indefinitely suspended by the Supreme Court is not eligible to petition for reinstatement for a minimum of 3 years from the date of suspension.\"). Respondent asked this court to impose indefinite suspension and did not dispute the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator's rationale for beginning the minimum 3-year suspension period on the date this opinion is filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   This court agrees with the recommendations of the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator. Respondent's license to practice law in the state of Kansas should be indefinitely suspended; he will not be eligible for reinstatement for a minimum of 3 years from the date this opinion is filed; upon petitioning for reinstatement, he must establish the conditions set forth in Supreme Court Rule 219(d), as well as the Additional Reinstatement Conditions set forth above. For clarification, those conditions do not include the aspirational goal that the respondent assist other attorneys with overcoming addiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   CONCLUSION AND DISCIPLINE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that John Bernard Sullivan be and is hereby disciplined by indefinite suspension in accordance with Supreme Court Rule 203(a)(2) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 234), effective on the date of the filing of this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in the event the respondent seeks reinstatement, he shall be subject to a reinstatement hearing under Supreme Court Rule 219. At the reinstatement hearing, in addition to the factors he must establish under Supreme Court Rule 219(d), he will be required to establish the following additional conditions by clear and convincing evidence: That he is then fit to practice law; that he has participated in mental health treatment as directed by treatment professionals; that he has returned all unearned fees; that he has reimbursed the Client Protection Fund for any claims paid to his clients on his behalf; that he has been discharged from criminal probation in all jurisdictions;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   and that he has obtained a level of rehabilitation such that recurrence of the misconduct is unlikely. See Supreme Court Rule 203(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the costs of these proceedings be assessed to the respondent and that this opinion be published in the official Kansas Reports.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
