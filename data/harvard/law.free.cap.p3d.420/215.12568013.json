Barbara Bradley, then 76 years old and suffering from terminal cancer, signed a will that disposed of her property upon her death to her boyfriend, Billy Walker, and her stepdaughters, Bussberg and Sandra Estrada. Walker and Tamara Adamovich, who is a notary public, were present in Bradley's home when Bradley signed the will. Before Bradley signed the will, Adamovich asked Walker to leave the room so that she could speak privately to Bradley. After Adamovich concluded that Bradley was competent and under no duress, Walker returned, and both Adamovich and Walker watched Bradley sign the will. Walker then signed the will, followed by Adamovich, who executed an acknowledgement and stamped it with her notary seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The signatures appear on the will as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Barbara J. Bradley agrees to the conditions of the directives or wishes prior to her death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    /s/\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Billy R.

When Bussberg petitioned to probate the will, Bradley's estranged son, Timothy Everson, objected, arguing neither Adamovich nor Walker was a valid witness under A.R.S. \u00a7 14-2502(A)(3). Everson claimed that he and Bradley's estranged daughter were Bradley's legal heirs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 5 At an evidentiary hearing, Everson conceded that Bradley had the necessary testamentary intent when she executed the will. Walker and Adamovich both testified they were present and watched Bradley sign the will before they signed it. Nevertheless, the superior court ruled the will invalid under \u00a7 14-2502(A)(3), reasoning it was not signed by two valid witnesses. According to the court, Adamovich was not a valid witness because she had signed \"as a notary public,\" not as a witness; Walker did not qualify because he had signed to indicate he agreed to Bradley's directives, not \"as a witness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 6 The superior court entered final judgment pursuant to Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) invalidating the will, and Bussberg timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1), (9) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 7 \"Statutory interpretation is a question of law, which we review de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Jung\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648470\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/202/#p204\">\n    210 Ariz. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204, \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648470\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/202/#p204\">\n    109 P.3d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (App. 2005).

Everson argues, and the superior court agreed, that although Adamovich signed the will, she cannot serve as a witness under \u00a7 14-2502(A)(3) because she signed as a notary public, not as a witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 10 The text of \u00a7 14-2502(A)(3) requires only that one who signs the will first have \"witnessed\" the testator signing or acknowledging the signature or the will.

We disagree and instead construe \u00a7 14-2505(A) only as a broad allowance that one need not have any particular qualifications (unrelated to powers of observation or perception) to \"witness\" a will.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Evid. 601 (\"Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules or an applicable statute provides otherwise.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 12 Everson also cites the official comment to \u00a7 2-502 of the Uniform Probate Code, upon which \u00a7 14-2502(A)(3) is based.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jung\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648470\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/202/#p204\">\n    210 Ariz. at 206, \u00b6 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648470\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/202/#p204\">\n    109 P.3d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He argues that the comment, which states that \"witnesses must sign as witnesses,\" shows that the drafters of the uniform act intended that witnesses must sign\n   <em>\n    in the capacity\n   </em>\n   of witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Unif. Probate Code \u00a7 2-502, cmt. a. We do not agree that the comment means that one who signs a will must be designated as a witness or the signature will be of no avail. The case the comment cites concerns a relative who printed her name in a line of the will identifying the executor-she did not\n   <em>\n    sign\n   </em>\n   the will in any capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mossler v.

App. 1978). Moreover, because the relative printed her name\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the testator signed, her mark did not in any way signify that she had witnessed the testator's\n   signing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9956934\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/565/952/#p957\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 956 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGurrin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4409144\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/113/341/\">\n    743 P.2d at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The official comment to section 2-502... conveys, albeit rather awkwardly, the idea that witnessing is an active function, directed toward certain observable conduct of the testator\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 13 Contrary to Everson's argument, a notary who properly acknowledges a will necessarily qualifies as a witness under the terms of \u00a7 14-2502(A)(3). An \"acknowledgment\" is \"a notarial act in which a notary certifies that a signer, whose identity is proven by satisfactory evidence, appeared before the notary and acknowledged that the signer signed the document.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 41-311(1) (2018);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 33-503 (2018) (person \"taking an acknowledgment\" must ascertain identity of the person and \"certify that ... [t]he person acknowledging appeared before him and acknowledged he executed the instrument\"). Thus, as recited in the acknowledgment, when Adamovich signed the acknowledgment, she certified that Bradley (1) appeared before her and (2) acknowledged that she (Bradley) had signed the will. By acknowledging the document as a notary, Adamovich thereby satisfied the second of the alternative ways in which a witness may qualify under \u00a7 14-2502(A)(3) (will must be signed by two persons who \"\n   <em>\n    witnessed\n   </em>\n   either the signing of the will ... or\n   <em>\n    the testator's acknowledgement of that signature\n   </em>\n   or acknowledgment of the will\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 14 Adamovich's executed acknowledgment of the will, by itself, was sufficient to qualify her as a witness under the statute. But at the hearing in the superior court, Adamovich also testified without contradiction that she saw Bradley sign the will before she herself signed the notarial acknowledgment. Adamovich thereby also qualified as a witness under \u00a7 14-2502(A)(3) by signing after having \"witnessed ... the signing of the will\" by the testator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 15 The additional acts not required by \u00a7 14-2502(A)(3) that Adamovich performed-stamping the document with an official seal and recording the notarial act in her log book-do not negate the fact that she satisfied the requirements of a witness under \u00a7 14-2502(A)(3).
