The Uzelacs submitted several claims to their insurer, Appellee Fire Insurance Exchange (FIE), and FIE made payments to cover most of the necessary repairs. Nevertheless, believing they were entitled to more, the Uzelacs filed suit against FIE to obtain additional compensation. The parties proceeded to litigate, and ultimately the district court entered summary judgment in favor of FIE. The Uzelacs now appeal. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the district court's decision in part and reverse it in part, and we remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In February 2008, having received word that the construction and interior decoration of their new vacation home had finally been concluded, the Uzelacs set out to view the completed home for the first time. The home, set in the mountains above Fruitland, was large and luxurious, with lavish, custom-designed furnishings. Upon arriving, they were horrified to find that their expensive new home was in shambles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Vandals had forced their way into the home; torn apart the walls and ceiling; smashed exterior windows; and ripped the plumbing from the framework, flooding the structure with hot water. Combined with the frigid winter temperatures, the water continued to wreak havoc upon the home even after the vandals departed. Hardly a square foot of the home was left undamaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The Uzelacs immediately filed a homeowner's insurance claim with FIE, claiming extensive damage to the home and its contents. Soon after, an FIE representative visited the scene to inspect the home and inventory the damaged personal property. FIE arranged for a third party, ServiceMaster, to conduct mitigation and remediation services, the bulk of which consisted of drying out the home and its contents and boxing up and storing the Uzelacs' furniture and belongings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   FIE never took the position that the Uzelacs' policy was not in effect when the vandalism occurred or that vandalism did not fall within the scope of the policy's coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 FIE received and processed numerous claims from the Uzelacs in connection with the vandalism. Nearly all of the claims were approved, some on the same day they were received. Indeed, altogether, FIE disbursed over $900,000 to cover repairs to the home and over $100,000 to cover damage to the Uzelacs' personal property. But FIE did reject some of the Uzelacs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 In particular, the Uzelacs assert they made three requests that FIE wrongfully\n   rejected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first request involved an attempt to recoup certain unanticipated financing expenses that arose as a consequence of the vandalism. Although the Uzelacs had found a lender willing to provide permanent mortgage financing for their new home before construction was completed, closing was contingent on the Uzelacs' first obtaining a certificate of occupancy for the home. As a result of the extensive vandalism, the Uzelacs were unable to obtain the certificate, and they therefore had no choice but to secure a \"bridge loan\" during the interim reconstruction period. In response to the Uzelacs' inquiry, FIE informed them that the additional expenses flowing from the bridge loan's higher interest rate were not recoverable under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The second request involved the question of whether and on what terms the Uzelacs' policy would cover the expense of substitute accommodations. In a declaration attached to the Uzelacs' opposition to FIE's motion for summary judgment, Mr. Uzelac averred that shortly after the vandalism occurred, he contacted FIE to inquire whether his policy would cover the expense of renting a substitute vacation home while theirs was being rebuilt. According to him, an FIE representative informed him that it would not. For its part, FIE has conceded that the policy would have covered the expense of renting a second home, but only if the Uzelacs had actually incurred that expense. In turn, Mr. Uzelac stated in his declaration that the only reason he and his wife did not rent a second home is that FIE led them to believe the expense would not be covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Finally, the third request involved the malfeasance of ServiceMaster. In November 2009, as the repairs to the home neared completion, ServiceMaster retrieved the Uzelacs' salvaged personal property from storage and delivered the items back to the home. To the Uzelacs' dismay, many of the items were returned in a ruined condition. For example, mattresses were rotten and mildewed, and the pages of books and photograph albums were stuck together in brittle clumps. The property apparently had not been properly dried out before being placed in storage, and as a result much of it was beyond repair. The Uzelacs submitted a claim for this damage, but FIE denied it, explaining that the Uzelacs would need to pursue their claim against ServiceMaster directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Early in 2011, the Uzelacs filed suit against FIE and ServiceMaster, asserting breaches of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In support, they alleged that FIE had \"failed and refused ... to pay [the Uzelacs] the moneys owing to them, despite demand therefor,\" and that FIE had \"engaged ... in a course of conduct to further its own economic interest ... in violation of its obligations to [the Uzelacs].\" Yet the complaint contained few specifics, and the Uzelacs' initial disclosures did not clarify matters much. In their disclosures, under the heading \"Computation of Damages,\" the Uzelacs claimed they were seeking \"[t]he amounts that would be owing under the policy as set forth in the complaint\" in addition to \"[g]eneral and consequential damages,\" \"[e]xemplary and punitive damages,\" and costs and attorney fees. The Uzelacs' \"computation\" did not make direct reference to any itemized list of expenses or specific dollar figures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Somewhat perplexed by the Uzelacs' reluctance to state their damages with specificity, FIE asked Mr. Uzelac at his deposition just what it was that he wanted FIE to cover that had not already been paid:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q. Okay. Before we get into this I want to make sure I understand a couple of things. First, this list of damaged items [of personal property that you provided to us,\n   which I have marked Exhibit 6], is this the extent of your damages in this case? I understand that there's on page 4 of Exhibit 1 also a list of some items .... So the list that you made in Exhibit 6 and the final page of Exhibit 1, is that the sum total of everything ... that you think [FIE] ought to cover?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q. Okay. What else are we talking about?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. ... [T]he bridge loan that we had to get.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The two deposition exhibits to which FIE's counsel directed Mr. Uzelac's attention each contained a list of expenses that the Uzelacs had submitted to FIE for reimbursement. The first, Exhibit 6, identified certain items of personal property that had been damaged during the vandalism, and the second, Exhibit 1, itemized reconstruction services, including snow-removal services, the costs for which exceeded $50,000. Notably, during his deposition Mr. Uzelac did not indicate that he and his wife intended to pursue a claim relating to the costs of substitute vacation accommodations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b611 Shortly after the Uzelacs settled their claims against ServiceMaster, resulting in its dismissal from this action, FIE moved for summary judgment. In its supporting memorandum, FIE explained that Mr. Uzelac had \"identified in his deposition only two issues as the basis for his litigation against FIE. First, [the Uzelacs] believed that FIE did not compensate [them] for certain personal property items that were damaged during the vandalism of their cabin.\" FIE explained that the items in question were the items listed in Exhibit 6 and other items that were allegedly mishandled by ServiceMaster. \"Next, [the Uzelacs] believed FIE should have to pay for the interest on a 'bridge loan' [they] obtained.\" FIE then devoted the bulk of its motion to arguing that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on these two issues, without mentioning the reconstruction expenses identified in Exhibit 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612 In their opposition, the Uzelacs began by defending the validity of the claims Mr. Uzelac raised in his deposition and then identified a number of additional factual issues they believed should preclude summary judgment. Chief among these was their claim that FIE made misrepresentations regarding the scope of their policy coverage, thereby leading them to believe, incorrectly, that the expense of renting a substitute vacation home would not be covered. In connection with that claim, the Uzelacs asserted-for the first time during the proceedings before the district court-that they would be seeking the reasonable value of the expenses they would have incurred in renting a comparable vacation home if they had been properly informed about the policy's coverage for this expense. In addition, the Uzelacs maintained that summary judgment was inappropriate because a factual issue remained as to whether FIE should be held vicariously liable for the property damage caused by ServiceMaster-to the extent, presumably, that these losses remained unpaid after the Uzelacs' settlement with ServiceMaster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 After hearing oral arguments on FIE's motion, the district court orally entered its ruling, granting the motion in part and denying it in part. With respect to the Uzelacs' claim for the damaged items of personal property, the court concluded that judgment should be rendered in FIE's favor because there was no genuine dispute that the Uzelacs had been adequately reimbursed for those expenses, albeit in a somewhat smaller amount than they had hoped for. The court further concluded that FIE was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Uzelacs' claims for the additional bridge loan expenses and the substitute accommodations expenses, as the former expense category was not recoverable under the terms of their policy and the latter was recoverable only if the expenses had actually been incurred. The court did, however, determine that a genuine issue of fact remained as to whether a principal-agent relationship existed between FIE and ServiceMaster, such that FIE might be vicariously liable for certain losses attributable to ServiceMaster that remained unpaid after the Uzelacs' settlement with ServiceMaster. The court directed counsel for FIE to prepare a proposed order based on its oral ruling, which counsel filed on March 7, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 The Uzelacs filed an objection to FIE's proposed summary judgment order on March 17, 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that it improperly purported to dispose of all the Uzelacs' direct claims against FIE when in fact one remained: their claim to recoup the expenses identified in Exhibit 1. The Uzelacs maintained that, by omitting any reference to the Exhibit 1 expenses in its initial motion, FIE had effectively excluded them from the scope of the summary judgment proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, however, was not persuaded. In a note to the parties delivered on the same day that it entered its final order, the court stated that it had \"reviewed and considered [the Uzelacs'] objections to the proposed [o]rder\" and \"conclude[d] that FIE's [o]rder accurately reflect[ed its] ruling.\" Accordingly, the court adopted FIE's proposed order without change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 Thereafter, the Uzelacs and FIE settled the claims on which the court had specifically denied summary judgment, but the Uzelacs reserved their right to appeal the court's summary judgment decision. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 The Uzelacs ascribe four errors to the district court's summary judgment decision. First, they maintain that the district court erred by concluding that the additional expenses they incurred as a consequence of the bridge loan were not recoverable under their policy. Second, they maintain that the court should have determined that there remained a triable issue of fact as to whether FIE should be liable to them for the fair rental value of their home during the period it was being reconstructed, as a reasonable measure of the value of the substitute vacation accommodations to which they were entitled under the policy. Third, they argue that the court should not have dismissed their claims relating to the expenses identified in Exhibit 1. And finally, the Uzelacs maintain that the court erred by dismissing their claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 \"Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The relevant provision of the policy states that \"[i]f a covered property loss makes the resident premises unfit to live in, we cover the necessary increase in living expense incurred by you so that your household can maintain its normal standard of living.\" Significantly, this language is nearly identical to the language of other ALE provisions that courts in this and several other states have had occasion to interpret.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Error v.

They maintain that the additional interest on the temporary loan should be considered a \"necessary increase in living expense\" because, \"without the private money bridge loan, [they] would have potentially lost their mountain home to foreclosure.\" But the Uzelacs do not direct our attention to any language in the policy providing that the loss of their home in foreclosure proceedings would be a covered loss. Furthermore, while an abundance of case law construes the scope of ALE coverage, the Uzelacs do not point to a single decision from any jurisdiction holding or even suggesting that home-financing charges qualify as an additional living expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b624 We recognize that the Uzelacs have dedicated several pages of their opening brief to arguing this issue. But as our Supreme Court has recently stated, when it comes to meeting the burden of persuasion on appeal, \"it is not the size of an argument that matters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Here, while the Uzelacs have cited cases and offered arguments, their cases are inapposite, and their arguments are unfocused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b625 The Uzelacs' treatment of our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Error v.

In that case, the Court held that an ALE award was proper to allow an insured to maintain her normal standard of living while her house was being rebuilt following a fire.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10398505\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/762/1077/#p1082\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10398505\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/762/1077/#p1082\">\n    at 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case did not involve any request to recover expenses related to the financing of the home. Nevertheless, the Uzelacs maintain that the case is relevant here because it stands for the proposition that \"the primary objective of property insurance\" is \"to put the insured back in the position he or she occupied prior to the loss.\" Therefore, their argument goes, FIE \"owes the Uzelacs the duty of putting them back in the same place they were prior to\" the vandalism, which included having access to a more favorable mortgage interest rate. But the principle they extract from\n   <em>\n    Error\n   </em>\n   is stated with such generality that it might well have been culled from\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   case involving the interpretation of an insurance policy. It sheds no light on the unique nature of ALE coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b626 For these reasons, we conclude that the Uzelacs have failed to carry their burden of persuasion on appeal. Accordingly, we hold that their bridge loan interest claim was properly dismissed on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   II. The Rental Value of a Comparable Vacation Home\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b627 The Uzelacs contend that the district court erred in dismissing their claim for the reasonable value of renting a comparable vacation home during the time theirs was being rebuilt. We conclude that the claim was properly dismissed on summary judgment because the Uzelacs did not produce evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b628 In response to FIE's summary judgment motion, the Uzelacs maintained that a genuine factual dispute remained as to whether FIE breached the contract by affirmatively misrepresenting the scope of the policy's ALE coverage. They supported their argument by filing a declaration from Mr. Uzelac, in which he stated that an unidentified FIE representative orally informed him that the costs of renting substitute accommodations while the home was being rebuilt were not reimbursable under the policy. On appeal, FIE concedes that, in fact, such costs would have been covered under the policy's ALE provision. Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the claim should be dismissed, regardless of the truth of Mr. Uzelac's statement, as no expenses could be reimbursed under the ALE provision unless they were actually incurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b629 By not addressing Mr. Uzelac's allegation of misrepresentation head on, the district court improperly discounted the possibility that such a misrepresentation could indeed have constituted breach of contract under these circumstances. Clearly, it would be unacceptable for insurers to avoid paying ALE claims simply by misrepresenting the scope of coverage in response to inquiries from their insureds. Nevertheless, we affirm the court's decision because the Uzelacs failed to support their argument with specific facts demonstrating the existence of a triable factual issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b630 \"When a moving party makes and supports a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party 'may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the pleadings, but the response ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Advanced Forming Techs., LLC v.Permacast, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892764\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/342/808/\">\n    2015 UT App 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892764\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/342/808/\">\n    342 P.3d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (omission in original) (quoting Utah R.

The Court reasoned that, because the party originally moving for summary judgment had \"made no express reference to the counterclaim or the issues raised by it in [its] motion,\" the summary judgment order did not dispose of the counterclaim issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10374127\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/851/1178/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, \"in accordance with the policy that the procedure for summary judgment should be strictly observed,\" the Court concluded that the claim \"remain[ed] unaffected in the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10374127\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/851/1178/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b636 Likewise, here, the scope of the summary judgment proceedings was determined by FIE's original motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   By failing to expressly include the Uzelacs' claim to recover the Exhibit 1 expenses in its summary judgment motion, FIE effectively excluded the issue from the district court's consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the express conclusions in the district court's summary judgment order are not inconsistent with the claim's survival. The court granted FIE's motion only as to the Uzelacs' claims for personal property losses, the additional bridge loan expenses, and the substitute accommodations expenses that they did not actually incur. The issue of whether FIE should be held liable for reimbursing the Uzelacs for the reconstruction services identified in Exhibit 1 is wholly independent of those claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b637 Finally, we turn to the snow-removal expense. We recognize that if one were to imagine all the different types of expenses that might arise in the ordinary course of repairing a vandalized home, snow-removal services would not readily come to mind. Still, it does not necessarily follow that the Uzelacs' claim for such expenses was illegitimate in this case. It is possible, for instance, that during the winter months the task of removing debris and beginning the extensive repairs could not be accomplished without first clearing a path to the home through the snow. We therefore leave it to the district court to determine the legitimacy of this expense, as a factual matter, on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b638 For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the issue of whether FIE is obligated to reimburse the Uzelacs for the expenses listed in Exhibit 1, including the expense of snow-removal, was not effectively placed before the court during summary judgment proceedings. It therefore \"remains unaffected in the trial court\" and can be properly resolved on remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Timm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10374127\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/851/1178/\">\n    851 P.2d at 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   IV. The Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b639 The Uzelacs' final contention is that the district court erred in dismissing their claim that FIE breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \"As a general rule, every contract is subject to an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, under which both parties to a contract promise not to intentionally or purposely do anything which will destroy or injure the other party's right to receive the fruits of a contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Malibu Inv.

As to the first claim, we have already concluded that the Uzelacs failed to show that the bridge loan expenses were recoverable under the policy's ALE provision. Thus, FIE's decision to reject this claim has been fully vindicated. As to the second claim, we concluded above that the Uzelacs failed to properly establish any disputes of material fact bearing on their claimed entitlement to recover substitute accommodation expenses without having actually incurred them. Accordingly, because it is undisputed that the Uzelacs never incurred any expense for FIE to reimburse, the plain terms of the policy permitted it to deny this claim as well. Finally, as to the third claim, the Uzelacs have not argued that FIE had a duty\n   <em>\n    under the policy\n   </em>\n   to compensate them for ServiceMaster's misfeasance. Because we will not \"construe the covenant to establish new, independent rights or duties not agreed upon by the parties,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11455375\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/996/1043/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), we conclude that the district court properly dismissed this claim on summary judgment, too.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b641 For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's decision in part, and we reverse it in part.

The Uzelacs respond that FIE should not be permitted to raise this as a defense because the only reason the Uzelacs never submitted a formal claim is that an FIE agent orally informed them that the policy would not cover their requests. We conclude that, because FIE has not pointed to anything in the policy clearly stating that an insured's request will not be considered absent a formal, written claim, the Uzelacs' failure to submit a claim in such a manner is not dispositive, and we need not consider the point further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    As FIE correctly observes, the Uzelacs filed their objection three days after the deadline for doing so had passed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah R.

To begin with, the Uzelacs included the list of expenses among the documents they provided in their initial disclosures. And lest FIE complain that its failure to take notice of the list was attributable to the vague and conclusory nature of the Uzelacs' allegations and damages computation, we observe that, at least as of the date of Mr. Uzelac's deposition, these deficiencies were obviously not so severe as to prevent FIE from learning of the expenses.
