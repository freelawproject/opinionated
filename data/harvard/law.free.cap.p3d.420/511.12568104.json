As Trooper Muri approached the vehicle he noticed an odor of marijuana coming from inside the vehicle. Trooper Muri asked Buckles for identification, registration, and insurance. Buckles acknowledged he did not have his driver's license at that time, but handed over registration and insurance. Trooper Muri questioned Buckles regarding the odor. Trooper Muri asked Buckles to step out of the vehicle and patted him down. The pat down did not reveal a weapon. Trooper Muri then asked Buckles to stand in front of his patrol car while he identified Buckles. As Trooper Muri and Buckles approached the patrol car, Trooper Muri saw Buckles throw something to the side of the road. Trooper Muri put Buckles in handcuffs and retrieved\n   the item that was thrown. The item recovered was a small glass jar containing marijuana. Trooper Muri then searched Buckles and discovered a methamphetamine pipe and $740 in cash bound with a rubber band.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Once Trooper Muri identified Buckles, he asked where Buckles was headed. Buckles stated he was headed to Billings. Buckles was then given his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Buckles admitted to Officer Muri he is an addict and uses drugs on a regular basis. Buckles refused to allow Trooper Muri to search his vehicle. Trooper Muri proceeded to impound the car to obtain a search warrant. Two days later a search of the car revealed a second methamphetamine pipe, two cell phones, a GPS, and a bank bag containing an additional $20,400 in cash, bound with rubber bands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 On October 8, 2015, Buckles was charged by Information with four counts: use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture, a\n   felony; criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony; possession of dangerous drugs, a misdemeanor; and possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor. Prior to trial, the State indicated it intended to introduce Buckles's subsequent drug charges filed in Utah (Utah drug charges). These charges occurred in February 2016, nine months after Buckles was stopped for speeding by Officer Muri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 The District Court held a jury trial on September 27-28, 2016. At the conclusion of the first day of trial, the State brought forth the issue of having Drug Task Force Agent Jeffrey Faycosh (Agent Faycosh) testify regarding Buckles's Utah drug charges. The State prepared a trial brief on the matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel objected to the admittance of such evidence, arguing relevance and prejudice. The District Court took the matter under advisement and stated it would make a ruling the following morning. The following morning, the District Court ruled from the bench, allowing Agent Faycosh to testify as to Buckles's Utah drug charges to prove intent. The District Court found that the Utah drug charges were relevant to the State's theory that Buckles intended to use the cash on his person and in his vehicle to commit an illegal drug transaction. However, the District Court ordered such testimony be elicited on rebuttal, not in the State's case-in-chief, and that if elicited, a limiting instruction be provided to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 During the State's case-in-chief, the State presented evidence regarding its theory that Buckles was traveling west to engage in a drug transaction with the $21,220.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Muri testified Buckles stated he was traveling from Poplar to Billings. Officer Muri also testified regarding Scott Cole's, Buckles's son-in-law, statement that Buckles was traveling to Miles City then continuing on to Billings. Officer Muri testified he did not believe Buckles when he related he was traveling to Billings to get his heater in his truck fixed. Officer Muri based his belief on the fact it was May and he assumed Buckles would not need his heater and also on Buckles relating he was a mechanic such that Officer Muri assumed Buckles could fix his own\n   heater. Both Officer Muri and Agent Faycosh testified regarding the items seized during the search of Buckles's vehicle. Officer Muri and Agent Faycosh testified to the manner in which the cash was packaged. Specifically, Officer Muri and Agent Faycosh stated, in their experience, carrying a large amount of cash banded together by rubber bands is usually indicative of a drug transaction. Agent Faycosh further testified Buckles appeared to have created a \"cockpit\" by having a GPS and two cellphones in his front seat indicative of long drives. However, Buckles presented two witnesses who testified in contradiction to Officer Muri and Agent Faycosh's testimony offering a legitimate basis for possessing the money and a\n   legitimate purpose for which it was intended to be used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The State then recalled Agent Faycosh as a rebuttal witness to testify regarding Buckles's Utah drug charges. Agent Faycosh testified that in February 2016, nine months after the charges herein, Buckles was arrested in Utah with a co-defendant. Agent Faycosh testified Buckles was charged in Utah with possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, possession of marijuana, and possession of paraphernalia. Agent Faycosh further testified where Buckles was arrested in Utah was southwest of Custer County. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all four counts. Buckles timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 District courts have broad discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Furthermore, Buckles contends admitting the Utah drug charges was highly prejudicial and outweighed any probative value. Accordingly, Buckles argues admitting his Utah drug charges impaired his right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 The State contends the District Court did not err in admitting the Utah drug charges. The State asserts the District Court properly admitted the Utah drug charges under M. R. Evid. 404(b) and M. R. Evid. 403. Further, the State maintains the District Court carefully limited the scope of the evidence and provided a limiting instruction to mitigate any undue prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Even where Rule 404(b) evidence is relevant to an issue other than character or the defendant's propensity to commit the charged offense, the evidence is still subject to balancing under Rule 403.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the District Court determined Buckles's Utah drug charges were relevant to intent under Rule 404(b). Even though the District Court concluded the Utah drug charges were admissible under Rule 404(b), the evidence was still subject to the balancing test under Rule 403. The record reflects the District Court failed to weigh the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice.

Evidence\n   rises to the level of being unfairly prejudicial only if it arouses the jury's hostility or sympathy for one side without regard to its probative cause, if it confuses or misleads the trier of fact, or if it unduly distracts from the main issues.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Croteau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5317585\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/248/403/#p407\">\n    248 Mont. 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 407-08,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5317585\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/248/403/#p407\">\n    812 P.2d 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1253 (1991). The evidence of Buckles's Utah drug charges created a substantial risk the jury would penalize Buckles for his character of bad behavior. The prejudicial nature was exacerbated by Agent Faycosh testifying regarding Buckles's multiple Utah drug charges-possession with the intent to distribute, possession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia. Providing the jury with Buckles's possession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia charges in Utah had no relevance other than to show Buckles's character and mislead the jury. The record reflects the State elected not to admit Buckles's prior charges-possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of methamphetamine-because it \"risk[ed] confusing the issues and complicating this particular issue.\" Therefore, the State recognized the risk of misleading the jury if it sought admitting any drug charges other than the Utah intent to distribute charge. Despite this statement, the State elicited testimony regarding Buckles's similar drug charges from Agent Faycosh. Furthermore, during closing arguments, the prosecutor stated, \"Ladies and gentlemen, the State of Montana is not here today to argue about whether the Defendant was a good drug dealer or a bad drug dealer.\" The prosecution used the evidence to portray Buckles as a career drug dealer to mislead the jury. We determine Buckles's Utah drug charges prejudicial nature substantially outweighed the probative value. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to conclude that the cautionary instruction given by the District Court was sufficient to mitigate the prejudicial impact of the Utah drug charges. Therefore, we conclude the District Court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of Buckles's Utah drug charges because the probative value was outweighed by the unfairly prejudicial nature of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b617 We now turn to whether admitting the evidence of Buckles's Utah\n   drug charges was harmless error. We have adopted a two-step analysis to determine whether an error \"prejudiced the criminal defendant's right to a fair trial and is therefore reversible.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The first step in conducting harmless-error analysis is to determine whether the error is structural error or trial error.\n   <em>\n    Van Kirk\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37. A structural error affects the framework within which the trial proceeds, while trial error typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury.\n   <em>\n    Van Kirk\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40. Trial error can be reviewed qualitatively for prejudice relative to other evidence introduced at trial; thus, the error is subject to harmless-error review.\n   <em>\n    Van Kirk\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 40. Here, the admission of the Rule 404(b) evidence was a trial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 The second step in the analysis is to determine under the \"cumulative evidence\" test whether the trial error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    Van Kirk\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.

The State has failed to direct us to any admissible evidence proving the same facts as the tainted evidence that would demonstrate there was no reasonable possibility the tainted evidence might have contributed to Buckles's conviction. The record does not reflect any admissible evidence of intent other than Officer Muri's and Agent Faycosh's speculations the money was to be used for illegal drug activity.

The State was entitled to rebut the defense witnesses' assertions that the money seized from Buckles' vehicle originated from legitimate sources and was used for legitimate purposes.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b623 Near the end of the first day of trial, the District Court held a conference with the parties outside the presence of the jury. The State indicated it intended to present evidence that while Buckles awaited trial in this case, he was arrested in Utah and charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. The District Court observed that Buckles was \"not required to present any proof,\" but inquired whether the\n   defense intended to introduce evidence that he had legitimate sources and purposes for the $21,200 found in Buckles' vehicle, and defense counsel indicated they would account for the\n   money. The District Court concluded that \"under relevance, under the State's use of this evidence for the purposes of intent ... to use this money to purchase drugs\" the Utah drug charges would be admissible to rebut the expected assertions by the defense that there was a \"legitimate purpose\" and \"intent with regard to the $21,000.\" The District Court noted that \"there is a relevance link\" between the events charged but not proven in Utah and the events charged but not proven in Montana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the District Court barred the State from discussing the subsequent charges during its case-in-chief, but ruled that if the defense presented evidence that there was legitimate purposes and sources for the money, the State was entitled to rebut the assertion with testimony pertaining to the charges. The District Court advised it would limit \"the scope of what will be allowed by the Utah charges\" and the court testimony to only the existence of the charges, and solicited proposed cautionary instructions from the parties. The District Court advised defense counsel it was \"free to challenge the\n   weight the jury is to give to that evidence. You are free to point out that these are unproven charges. That he is presumed innocent of the Utah charges ... and that the weight of that evidence should not sway the jury from the presumption of innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salvagni\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 55 (finding there is no \"quantum of proof\" to admit other-acts evidence and the credibility of witnesses \"go to the weight of the evidence\" and \"evidence is not inadmissible just because [the defendant] believes the witnesses are not credible[,]\" thus the defendant is free to cross-examine the witness to attempt to discredit their testimony).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 The State began by eliciting testimony from Sergeant Troy Muri of the Montana Highway Patrol, who initiated the traffic stop for speeding. Muri testified that, during questioning, Buckles stated he was driving to Billings \"to try to find a dealership to work on his pickup\" because the \"heater wasn't working correctly.\" Muri testified that the explanation was odd since it was \"the middle of May\" and because, earlier in their conversation, Buckles had stated he was a car mechanic, but Buckles contended he just \"couldn't get it to work.\" Muri testified that, during the stop, Buckles' father-in-law Scott Cole saw Buckles being detained and pulled over to inquire. Muri testified that Cole stated he was headed to Miles City to get a Mother's Day present for his grandma, and that Buckles \"was also going to Miles City\n   and then he was going to continue on to Billings.\" Muri testified that after Buckles' arrest, an inventory search revealed some cell phones, two meth pipes, and $21,200 in \"thousand-dollar increments wrapped in rubber bands\" in a \"bank bag.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b625 As planned, defense counsel then sought to establish Buckles' intended purpose for the cash. The Court credits Buckles' proffered story, stating his two witnesses offered a \"\n   <em>\n    legitimate\n   </em>\n   basis for possessing the money and\n   <em>\n    legitimate\n   </em>\n   purpose for which it was intended to be used.\" Opinion, \u00b6 7. (Emphasis added.) However, review of the record demonstrates a rational jury was fully entitled to reject the \"legitimate\" basis of the questionable testimony from Buckles' witnesses, the totality of which led to the District Court admonishing the defense for potentially suborning perjury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b626 Because Buckles was pulled over by police on May 10, 2015, defense counsel sought to incorporate all possible cash Buckles might have received prior to that date as an explanation for the $21,200 in cash found in the vehicle. To this end, Buckles called his niece, Adrianne Browning, to testify. Browning testified that, on May 9, 2015, she purchased Buckles' truck and paid him $10,000 in cash. Browning testified she didn't \"remember what year\" the truck was but she knew\n   it was a \"Chevy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Browning stated that she believed there was a bill of sale that could verify the purchase, but she didn't know where it was, and it wasn't in her possession. Browning further testified that, the day after she bought Buckles' truck, Buckles borrowed the same truck she had just purchased from him:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : [Buckles] didn't give you any reason for why he needed this vehicle?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Browning\n   </strong>\n   : No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : So you had owned the vehicle for all of-less than 24 hours?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Browning\n   </strong>\n   : Uh-huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : And [Buckles] takes this vehicle and leaves?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Browning\n   </strong>\n   : Uh-huh. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b627 Defense counsel asked Browning about Buckles' plan to purchase a building to start a business. Browning believed that Buckles intended to start a business in Poplar, and asserted he was going to look at a building to purchase:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Defense\n   </strong>\n   : Did you have any discussions with [Buckles] prior to his trip to Billings that resulted in the stop?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Browning\n   </strong>\n   : He said he was going to look at a building or ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Defense\n   </strong>\n   : And then you received the call that the car was impounded?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    Browning\n   </strong>\n   : Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   However, on cross-examination, Browning stated several times that she didn't know where Buckles was going:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : So [Buckles] didn't ask you or didn't tell you where he was going or why he needed your vehicle?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    Browning\n   </strong>\n   : No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : But your testimony on direct was that he was going to Billings to look at a building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    Browning\n   </strong>\n   : No, I didn't-no. He had talked about it but he didn't say that's where he was going. I didn't even ask.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b628 The State asked Browning if, when discussing return of the impounded vehicle with police after Buckles' arrest, she had indicated the vehicle was stolen, and Browning said she had not. Browning testified several times that she was certain that the total price of the vehicle was $10,000 and that she gave Buckles the money in \"loose\" bills that were not bound in any way. Browning also alleged that\n   Buckles may have had additional cash from an insurance settlement earlier in 2015, because she was involved in the accident while driving Buckles' car. Browning stated that Buckles received a cash settlement of $3000 but she was not sure when it was paid out to him. As part of the settlement, Browning also received money in July 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b629 Marilee Buckles (Marilee), Buckles' sister, testified that she had a power of attorney\n   for Buckles and shared a bank account with him. Marilee testified she would give Buckles money whenever he asked for it, and that she knew \"for sure\" she gave him $3,000, and she may have given him up to $6,000 sometime in April or May of 2015. Marilee testified that Buckles intended to start a \"garage business\" in Poplar. In addition to money drawn from their shared bank account, Marilee testified she personally saw their mother give Buckles $12,000 in cash in December 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b630 Immediately after Marilee's testimony, the District Court dismissed the jury to the jury room and held a conference with counsel. The District Court indicated that the case was \"very close to mistrial\" and that it had \"real concerns that [defense] witnesses have committed perjury\" and hoped that defense counsel had \"talked to [defense] witnesses about the importance of being candid, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth[.]\" The District Court recalled that, at a September 6, 2016 Pretrial Motions Hearing, Marilee testified that her mother and her had only discussed that money was given to Buckles, not that she\n   <em>\n    witnessed\n   </em>\n   the mother giving Buckles the money, and that Buckles himself testified that Browning paid him $8,500 for the truck, not $10,000:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [I]t is concerning to see the amount of the truck went from $8,500 to $10,000. The-when we were at the prior hearing, the $12,000 was-I believe it was Marilee saying that this-the witness with the dialysis had told her that she gave Morris $12,000. Not that she had witnessed it, but then today she testified she witnessed it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b631 After this conference, testimony continued. On rebuttal, the State called Muri. The prosecutor asked Muri under what circumstances Browning retrieved her vehicle after it was impounded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : And did [Browning] claim ownership of the 1999 pickup truck?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    Muri\n   </strong>\n   : She said she had bought it, and then she said that Mr. Buckles had stole it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : Did she relay to you the circumstances under which he stole it from her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    Muri\n   </strong>\n   : She had said on Saturday that he had stole[n] the vehicle from her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : Did she tell you what she was doing when he stole it from her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Muri\n   </strong>\n   : She said she had been passed out on the floor when he stole it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b632 The State called Agent Jeffrey Faycosh. Faycosh read Buckles' testimony from the prior hearing that Browning \"purchased the truck and paid me $8,500 in cash for the truck.\" The State then informed the District Court it was about to elicit testimony about the subsequent charges, and the Court read aloud a cautionary jury instruction. The State then inquired:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : What happened after the Defendant was released from custody?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    Faycosh\n   </strong>\n   : In February of 2016, two months after his release or thereabouts, then the arrest in Weber County, Utah, of him and a co-defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : And what was the result of that arrest?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    Faycosh\n   </strong>\n   : Charges were filed in Weber County, Utah, for Possession with Intent to Distribute Methamphetamine, Possession of Marijuana and Possession of Paraphernalia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : And where exactly is Weber County, Utah, in relation to Custer County?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    Faycosh\n   </strong>\n   : It would be southwest of Custer County\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   : You stated that he was charged with two crimes. What exactly did that mean, sir?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    Faycosh\n   </strong>\n   : It means he's not been convicted. It means there was at least probable cause to commence legal proceeding, but it has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed those crimes, and a co-defendant, as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b633 The State ended its questioning. Before closing arguments, the District Court gave another cautionary instruction about proper use of the evidence concerning the Utah charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b634 The District Court did not err by admitting testimony to rebut the defense's witnesses. Defense witness testimony was inconsistent and largely unverified by the documentary evidence, and, despite it being, in the District Court's view, perjury, provided a story about the purpose of the cash. As to\n   the forfeiture charge, questions existed regarding the amount of money Browning stated she paid Buckles and Buckles stated that he received-putting into question the amount of money involved in the car transaction-or whether Buckles may have\n   stolen the vehicle from Browning. Browning's testimony also offered the possibility that Buckles had money from an insurance settlement, but did not establish the timing of when Buckles received the settlement. Finally, Marilee could not recall the exact amount of money she gave Buckles, somewhere between $3000-$6,000, and sometime in April or May of 2015. Marilee changed her story about whether she witnessed or merely discussed that her mother gave money to Buckles. Therefore, the existence, amount and timing all the sources of cash, and its intended purpose, were all put into question by the defense's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Any prejudice resulting from the drug charges does not substantially outweigh the probative value. The District Court carefully limited testimony and provided multiple limiting instructions to cure any prejudice.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b635 Probative evidence is usually prejudicial, but rises to the level of being unfairly prejudicial only \"if it arouses the jury's hostility or sympathy for one side without regard to its probative value, if it confuses or misleads the trier of fact, or if it unduly distracts from the main issues.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Opinion notes that \"[t]he record reflects the State elected not to admit Buckles' prior charges-possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of methamphetamine-because it 'risk[ed] confusing the issues and complicating this particular issue.' \" The Court thus offers that because the State \"recognized the risk\" of the jury being able to draw the inference of bad character from prior acts, the State should have also recognized the risk of subsequent acts impinging character. Opinion, \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b637 However, the record shows both that the defense put prior acts at issue, and, substantively, that prior acts have a different effect on the\n   issue of a defendant's character than subsequent acts. During pre-trial, the State indicated it would not present any evidence of Buckles' past convictions, but defense counsel-not the State-discussed prior drug charges during opening statement, noting that \"one of the things that is unfortunate about the Defendant is he has been convicted in the past for drug charges\" but \"it isn't as though he's actively in the habit of buying and selling large quantities of drugs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, although the opinion notes that prior convictions may pose a risk the jury will impinge character references on the defendant, at the time of trial, Buckles had not been convicted of the drug charges in Utah, only charged, unlike the prior drug offenses. Therefore, the State, likely out of caution, omitted reference to prior convictions which likely\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   have the danger of impinging his character, with the improper reference that he was in fact dealing drugs to conform with past behavior from past convictions.\n   We apply the rule barring proof of other crimes to ensure a that a defendant is not convicted \"\n   <em>\n    because he committed a crime in the past\n   </em>\n   , he has a defect of character that makes him more likely than people generally to have committed the charged offense.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The District Court carefully limited the scope of the evidence presented, and gave appropriate limiting instructions to mitigate any prejudice. The District Court discussed at length with counsel how the testimony should be presented, how the cautionary instruction should be crafted, how Buckles would be mentioned to the jury as only a co-defendant in the Utah charges, and that his guilt was not to be presumed. Before Faycosh's testimony the District Court gave a limiting instruction, as well as provided the following instruction for the jury to aid its deliberations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Morris Buckles is on trial only for the offenses charged in this case. Evidence of other acts alleged to have been committed in Utah (and other locations) by Mr. Buckles that have not been charged in this case may not be considered in your deliberations, except as I authorize you to do so. In other words, you may not infer that because the Defendant may have engaged in other acts, that he is guilty of any of the offenses charged in this case. Along with all other evidence in this case, evidence of other actions attributed to the Defendant may be considered only for the limited purpose of aiding the jury to discern motive or intent as to the acts charged in this case. You, the jury, are instructed to determine the credibility and weight, if any, to assign to any evidence of any other criminal charge or alleged act. Mr. Buckles is not being tried for that other charge. He may not be convicted for any other actions except those charged in this case.

We noted that the criminal forfeiture offense had a mental state, thus the State had to prove that Hegg \"knowingly possessed\" those items to facilitate illegal drug activity.\n   <em>\n    Hegg\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. Thus, we declined to \"affirm a criminal forfeiture conviction based on what amounts to no more than a justifiable suspicion.\" We reasoned that the presence of cash in a home, with nothing more, was not sufficient circumstantial evidence from which a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the property was subject to criminal forfeiture, and that the State had failed to show that \"the cash that was confiscated ... was traceable to illegal drug sales,\" therefore the evidence was insufficient.\n   <em>\n    Hegg\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b642 Here, equally, while it might be tempting to make the inference that $21,200 in cash bound in rubber bands in a bank bag along with the other circumstantial evidence of the gps, burner phones, and drugs could be sufficient evidence from which a jury could convict on the forfeiture charge, the State recognized that it still needed to prove\n   intent to use the money for illegal activity, i.e. that Buckles possessed cash that could be \"traceable\" to \"illegal drug sales.\"\n   <em>\n    Hegg\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. To that end, the State offered probative evidence to supplement the circumstantial evidence that the cash was intended to be used for a drug transaction. Now that the State has presented evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict by providing a logical nexus from the traceability of the cash to an illegal drug transaction, this Court reasons that the evidence violates Rule 403. To the contrary, the evidence is clearly consequential to a determination of an element of the crime, whether Buckles possessed the intent for the crime charged. A thorough review of the record does not demonstrate that the State's theory of admissibility was in any way tied to the inference of bad character, and indeed, the character reference based on past crimes was from Buckles' own counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b643 The Utah drug charges were highly probative of intent as well as to rebut the defense witnesses' assertions of legitimate sources of the money.

However, the discussions between counsel and the District Court were concerning apparent violations of Rule 404(b), not Rule 403. Similarly, the arguments in the appellate briefs address Rule 404(b). This Court cannot fault the District Court for not considering issues that were not raised by the parties on the trial level, nor does this Court typically consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    In his appellate arguments, within the context that the evidence proffered by the State is other crimes evidence under Rule 404(b), Buckles cites the Modified Just Rule, a Rule 404(b) analytical framework that incorporated Rule 403 considerations.\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

However, this Court overruled the Modified Just Rule in\n    <em>\n     Salvagni\n    </em>\n    , explaining that the rule was \"no longer the correct analytical approach\" and \"rather, when presented with a claim that evidence is being offered for an impermissible propensity inference, the court should simply apply Rules 402 and 404 (and if requested, Rules 403 and 105).\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

For these reasons, it is incorrect for the Court to state that Buckles argues the District Court erred in not considering Rule 403, because Buckles never expressly made a 403 argument, but, rather, erroneously made a discarded argument under Rule 404(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Nonetheless, the record reveals that the District Court in fact weighed and considered Rule 403's effect of the state's intended evidence. The District Court believed that allowing the State to rebut the defense's evidence was not unduly prejudicial, and ruled that if the defense declined to offer evidence on admissible purposes for the money, the court would \"evaluate at that point whether there is an undue prejudice\" in allowing the State to present evidence as to the Utah drug charges. The District Court also considered the \"similarity\" and \"remoteness\" criteria, which are appropriate considerations under Rule 403,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Salvagni\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 56, and concluded that the charges were \"relevant because of the similarity of the conduct\" and the \"proximity in time.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Buckles made representations in pleadings filed to the District Court that the vehicle sold was a 1999 Chevrolet pickup truck.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The Court states that a highly prejudicial statement by the State occurred during closing statements, where the State observed \"the State of Montana is not here today to argue about whether the Defendant was a good drug dealer or a bad drug dealer.\" Opinion, \u00b6 16.
