In response, he invoked his right to counsel. Afterwards, the arresting officer asked defendant 28 DUII interview questions and then asked if he would consent to a breath test. Defendant moved to suppress his answers to the 28 questions and all derivative evidence, which he argued included his decision to take the breath test and the test results. The state, for its part, conceded that asking defendant the 28 DUII interview questions after he had invoked his right to counsel violated Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution. The state took the position, however, that suppressing the officer's questions and defendant's answers was sufficient to vindicate that right. The Court of Appeals agreed and also observed that asking defendant for consent to take a breath test did not constitute prohibited \"interrogation\" under Article I, section 12.\n   <em>\n    State v.

With that background in mind, we turn to the facts in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At approximately 3:00 a.m., Officer Enz received a report of a traffic accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When he arrived at the scene of the accident, he saw a Dodge truck abandoned in the middle of an intersection and a Subaru Outback nearby. Defendant was sitting in the driver's seat of the Subaru. The officer noticed that defendant's \"eyes [were] closed and his head kept bobbing forward.\" When the officer knocked on the window to get defendant's attention, defendant tried to roll the window down. After \"several failed attempts at finding the window lever,\" defendant opened the door. After speaking with defendant, the officer determined that defendant appeared to be intoxicated \"based on his slurred speech, an odor of an alcoholic beverage that was emanating from him, and [the fact that] his eyes were watery and bloodshot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on those observations, the officer told defendant that he believed it was likely that defendant was impaired, and he asked defendant if he would perform field sobriety\n   tests. In response, defendant asked for \"an opportunity to speak with his attorney.\" Officer Enz said that, \"if [defendant] had a cell phone *** he could call the attorney from the car.\" Defendant \"started dialing a phone, so [the officer] closed the car door and went to go take measurements of the scene.\" Approximately 11 minutes later, the officer went back to defendant and asked if \"would like to perform the voluntary field sobriety tests.\" Defendant asked, \"What exactly are you asking me to do?\" The officer described the tests, and defendant repeated everything that the officer said into his phone. Defendant then said to the officer, \"Yes. Yes, I will.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant did not do well on the field sobriety tests, and Officer Enz told him that he was under arrest for DUII and advised him of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Among other things, Enz told defendant that \"[h]e ha[d] the right to have an\n   attorney with him while he's being questioned.\" After being advised of those rights, defendant's \"first response was that he wanted to talk to his attorney.\" The officer explained that defendant would have \"another opportunity to consult with somebody privately when [they] got back to the precinct.\" Defendant responded, \" 'Yes. *** Yes, I understand my rights.' \" The officer did not ask defendant any questions between the second time defendant invoked his right to counsel and the time they arrived at the precinct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When they got to the precinct, the officer provided defendant with his cell phone, a landline, a phone book, and a copy of the Implied Consent Combined Report. He told defendant that \"he could make as many calls as he'd like to whomever he'd like and that [the officer would] be closing the cell door to provide him privacy while he was on the phone.\" After explaining the procedure for the breath test, the officer closed the cell door at 3:47 a.m. Twenty minutes later, the officer returned and found defendant still on the phone. The officer told defendant that he would \"give him another minute or so to complete his phone call, closed the cell, and again checked on him at 4:10 a.m. and found that he was finishing his phone call.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The officer took defendant to another room, began the 15-minute observation period required before administration of a breath test, \"conducted the DUII Interview Report[,] and read him the Implied Consent Combined Report in its entirety verbatim.\" In conducting the DUII interview report, the officer asked defendant \"28 questions in multiparts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither the officer's questions nor defendant's answers are included in the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, a copy of the Implied Consent Combined Report is not included in\n   the record, although Enz testified at the hearing regarding three warnings included in the report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Having gone through that procedure, Enz asked defendant if \"he'd take a breath test.\" Defendant did not answer but \"just stared at [the officer] and started reading the Implied Consent Combined Report.\" Enz told him that he would \"give him a moment to think about it and that [he would] be asking him\n   again when he started [the breathalyzer machine].\" At that point, defendant said that he \"would like to speak with his attorney before he answered that question,\" and Enz \"explained to [defendant] that he'd already been given ample time to consult with someone for legal advice, both at the scene and at the precinct.\" \"At that point, [Enz asked defendant] if he would take a breath test, to which he said, 'Yes.' \" The breath test showed that defendant's blood alcohol content (BAC) was .18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Trial and Appellate Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The state charged defendant with DUII and reckless driving. Before trial, defendant filed two motions to suppress the statements that he made to Officer Enz in response to the questions on the DUII interview report and any derivative evidence. The first motion contended that Enz had violated Article I, sections 11 and 12, by asking defendant questions from the DUII interview report after he had invoked his right to counsel. Defendant's second motion claimed that defendant's statements were involuntary because Enz repeatedly had disregarded defendant's invocation of his right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response to defendant's motions, the state conceded that asking defendant the questions from the DUII\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   interview report after he invoked his right to counsel violated Article I, section 12. It explained that, as a result, it would not ask Enz at the suppression hearing about either the questions he asked or the answers defendant gave to those questions. Apparently, in the state's view, no more was needed to remedy the Article I, section 12, violation. Additionally, the state argued that it had complied with Article I, section 11, by giving defendant the opportunity to consult with his attorney before deciding whether to take the breath test. The state did not address whether defendant's decision to take the breath test and the resulting test results derived from the conceded Article I, section 12, violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In considering the parties' arguments, the trial court focused on defendant's Article I, section 11, right to counsel. It concluded that, because Enz had provided defendant with a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel before deciding whether to take the breath test, defendant's decision to take the test and the test results were admissible. The court accordingly denied defendant's motions to suppress. Given the trial court's ruling on his suppression motions, defendant agreed to a stipulated facts trial based on the evidence brought out at the suppression hearing. After considering that evidence, the trial court convicted defendant of DUII and reckless driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal, defendant challenged the trial court's ruling denying his suppression motions, although his appellate arguments were narrower than his arguments at trial. On appeal, defendant expressly abandoned his argument that Enz had violated his Article I, section 11, right to counsel. He limited his arguments instead to Article I, section 12. Specifically, defendant argued that Enz had violated Article I, section 12, by eliciting his answers to the 28 DUII interview questions after he had invoked his right to counsel and that his consent to take the breath test and the test results should be suppressed because they derived from his answers to those questions. Defendant did not argue on appeal that, once he invoked his Article I, section 12, right to counsel, Enz could not ask him whether he would take a breath test; that is, defendant did not argue that asking\n   whether he would take a breath test constituted \"interrogation\" in violation of his Article I, section 12, right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In analyzing defendant's arguments, the Court of Appeals began by noting that it had \"unequivocally rejected the proposition that asking a person to take a breath test is 'interrogation' \" for the purposes of Article I, section 12.\n   <em>\n    Swan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775745\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/276/192/\">\n    276 Or.App. at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775745\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/276/192/\">\n    366 P.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing Court of Appeals decisions). The Court of Appeals then turned to defendant's claim that the results of that test derived from his answers to the DUII interview report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Applying a series of factors identified in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Court of Appeals reasoned, however, that the violation in this case was not as flagrant as a violation in an earlier case, that reading defendant the Implied Consent Combined Form provided a \"short, yet significant break\" between the violation and his decision to take the breath test, and that the officer's request to take the breath test had not been prompted by defendant's answers to the interview questions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775745\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/276/192/\">\n    276 Or.App. at 203-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775745\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/276/192/\">\n    366 P.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ISSUES ON REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On review, defendant argues that his breath test results should be suppressed for two reasons. He argues initially that, once he invoked his right to counsel, no further interrogation could occur without his counsel present and that asking whether he would take a breath test constituted \"interrogation\" prohibited by Article I, section 12. Additionally, he argues that, even if asking him to take a breath test did not constitute interrogation, his decision to take the breath test and the results of that test were the product of the officer's earlier Article I, section 12, violation and should be suppressed for that reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant did not raise the first issue-whether asking if he would take a breath test constituted interrogation-in either the trial court or the Court of Appeals, and it is questionable whether he can raise that issue for the first time in this court. However, we need not answer that procedural question to decide this case. Even if the first issue were properly before us and even if Article I, section 12, did not preclude Enz from asking defendant if he would take a breath test, as the Court of Appeals has held, we conclude that defendant's decision to take the breath test and the subsequent test results were the product of the preceding constitutional violation and should have been suppressed for that reason. It follows that any resolution of the first issue that defendant raises on review, even if preserved, would not change the result in this case. We accordingly turn to the single issue that defendant has raised throughout this litigation: whether his decision to take the breath test derived from the immediately preceding Article I, section 12, violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In response to that issue, the state advances two separate arguments why the breath test results did not derive from the conceded Article I, section 12, violation. The state's first argument starts from the proposition that \"a person lawfully arrested for DUII has no legal right to refuse a breath test administered pursuant to the implied-consent law.\" It follows, the state concludes, that Enz's administration of the breath test resulted from the operation of the implied-consent law rather than his violation of defendant's Article I, section 12, right to counsel. The state's second argument tracks, in large part, the Court of Appeals' reasoning. Relying on our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Delong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363798\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/365/\">\n    357 Or. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363798\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/365/\">\n    350 P.3d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), the state contends that \"defendant's decision to submit to the breath test was an act of voluntary consent,\" which broke the causal chain between the Article I, section 12, violation and the breath test results.

Although those actions mitigated the effect of Enz's violation, Enz's repeated disregard for defendant's expressed right to counsel \"place[d defendant] in a more disadvantaged position, making it easier and more likely for [Enz] to exploit that illegality to obtain consent.\"\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338402\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/356/59/#p74\">\n    356 Or. at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338402\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/356/59/#p74\">\n    333 P.3d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On balance, the nature of the violation cuts against the state's argument that defendant's decision to take the breath test was independent of the immediately preceding violation of defendant's request for counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The remaining factor noted in\n   <em>\n    Jarnagin\n   </em>\n   is whether subsequent events dissipated the taint of the earlier violation. On that issue, we note that defendant had an opportunity to\n   speak with his lawyer\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Enz questioned him in violation of his rights. After questioning defendant in violation of Article I, section 12, Enz then asked defendant if he would consent to take the breath test. At that point, defendant asked to speak to his lawyer, and Enz denied his request. Far from dissipating the taint of the preceding Article I, section 12, violation, the officer's subsequent denial reinforced it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It is true, as the state argues, that Enz read defendant the Implied Consent Combined Report \"in its entirety verbatim\" after defendant answered the questions on the DUII interview report. As noted above, however, the Implied Consent Combined Report is not part of this record. We do not know what the report in its entirety said, although Enz did testify regarding three admonitions contained in the report. Enz testified at the suppression hearing that he warned defendant that, if he refused to take a breath test, he would lose his license to drive, he would be subject to a $650 fine, and \"evidence of [his] refusal would be used against him in court.\" That advice parallels some of the consequences that Oregon statutes require officers to read DUII suspects before asking them to take a breath test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ordinarily, it would seem that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   would lead to the same result in this case, where defendant's decision to submit to the breath test was the product of a violation of his Article I, section 12, right to counsel. However, the state argues we can affirm the trial court's judgment on an alternative ground. It contends that, even if defendant's decision to take the breath test was the product of an Article I, section 12, violation, his breath test results derived from an independent source: the implied-consent statutes.

It contends that, as a result of that implied consent, defendant had no legal right to refuse to take a breath test when, at a later point, he was arrested for DUII. In the state's view, defendant had only a physical right to refuse to submit to the test. The state reasons that, because defendant had no legal right to refuse a breath test, it is immaterial whether his decision to submit to a breath test was the product of an earlier Article I, section 12, violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The state adds that, in making its implied-consent argument, it is not relying on defendant's consent to take a breath test to justify its warrantless seizure and search of his breath. It reasons that that it could seize and search defendant's breath to determine his BAC either as a search incident to arrest under the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield v.

In asserting that proposition, the state relies on statements taken from our decisions that, in context, may have less significance than the state perceives. In analyzing the state's implied-consent argument, we begin with the text of the implied-consent statutes and explain why the text of those statutes does not support the state's argument. We then turn to the statements from our decisions on which the state relies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The relevant text of the implied-consent statutes is fairly straightforward. ORS 813.100(1) provides that \"[a]ny person who operates a motor vehicle upon *** the highways of this state shall be deemed to have given consent, subject to the implied consent law, to a chemical test of the person's breath\" to determine the person's BAC if the person is arrested for DUII. ORS 813.100(2) then provides that, if a person who is arrested for DUII \"refuses the request of a police officer to submit to the chemical test after the person has been informed of consequences and rights as described in ORS 813.130,\" \"[n]o chemical test of the person's breath *** shall be given under subsection (1) of this section.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As we read those two subsections, the fact that a person impliedly consented to a breath test by driving on the public highways does not foreclose that person from later refusing to take a breath test if and when the person is arrested for DUII. Rather, ORS 813.100(2) expressly recognizes that a person arrested for DUII may decide, at the point of arrest, to refuse to submit to a breath test and that the person's refusal limits the state's ability to determine his or her BAC under the implied-consent statutes. Specifically, ORS 813.100(2) provides that, if a person arrested for DUII refuses to submit to a breath test, \"[n]o chemical test of the person's breath *** shall be given\" under the implied-consent statutes, although the state can always apply for a warrant to determine a suspect's BAC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Ritz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415027\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/781/#p796\">\n    361 Or. 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 796,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415027\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/781/#p796\">\n    399 P.3d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (stating that proposition).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The implied-consent statutes thus provide that, notwithstanding the consent implied by driving on the public highways, a DUII suspect retains a statutory right to refuse to take a breath test at the point of arrest. Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   confirms that reading of the statutory text. In interpreting the implied-consent statutes,\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   explained that, having impliedly consented to take a breath test by driving on the public highways, a DUII suspect has no legal right to refuse to submit to a breath test.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2207169\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/305/59/#p74\">\n    305 Or. at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2207169\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/305/59/#p74\">\n    750 P.2d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However,\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   then held that a DUII suspect has an Article I, section 11, \"right upon request to a reasonable opportunity to obtain legal advice before deciding whether to submit to a breath test.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2207169\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/305/59/#p74\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2207169\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/305/59/#p74\">\n    at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2207169\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/305/59/#p74\">\n    750 P.2d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, the court recognized that, despite having impliedly consented to take a breath test, a DUII suspect has a statutory right under ORS 813.100(2) to decide, at the point of arrest, whether to submit to the test and a state constitutional right to seek legal advice before making that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, this court held in\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   that, when a suspect's decision to submit to a breath test derives from a violation of his or her Article I, section 11, right to counsel, both the decision and the test results are subject to suppression.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2207169\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/305/59/#p74\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2207169\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/305/59/#p74\">\n    at 75-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2207169\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/305/59/#p74\">\n    750 P.2d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Durbin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"175909\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/335/183/\">\n    335 Or. at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"175909\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/335/183/\">\n    63 P.3d 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same). The state advances no reason why we should reach a different conclusion when, in this case, defendant's decision to take the breath test derived from a violation of his\n   Article I, section 12, right to counsel rather than a violation of his Article I, section 11, right to counsel. Given the text of the implied-consent statutes and our decision in\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , we do not agree with the state that, in light of the consent implied as a result of driving on the public highways, it is immaterial that defendant's later decision to take a breath test was the product of an Article I, section 12, violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The state, however, presses its argument that our decisions interpreting the implied-consents statutes lead to a different conclusion, and we address that argument briefly.

Specifically, if \"a driver may not legally refuse\" to take a breath test, then the state's argument that defendant's submission to the breath test was required by operation of law appears to have some force. However, we hesitate to read too much into that one sentence for three reasons. First, that sentence summarizes in an\n   epigrammatic way the gist of the implied-consent statutes. It does not purport to be a complete explanation of the terms or operation of those statutes. The second reason is related to the first; it is difficult to reconcile\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   's quick summary of the implied-consent statutes with the actual text of those statutes. As explained above, the text of the implied-consent statutes recognizes that a driver retains a right to decide, at the point of arrest, whether to take a breath test and also that a driver's decision to refuse to take the test limits the state's options under the implied-consent statutes. Finally,\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   's one-sentence description of the implied-consent statutes cannot fairly be reconciled with its holding that, if a driver's decision to take the breath test is the product of an Article I, section 11, violation, then the test results are subject to suppression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For those reasons, we decline to put too much weight on\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   's one-sentence summary of the implied-consent statutes. Rather, we recognize, as both the text of the implied-consent statutes states and the holding in\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   establishes, that a DUII suspect's decision to submit to a breath test is a necessary statutory predicate to obtaining a breath test under the implied-consent statutes and that a driver retains a statutorily recognized right to decide, at the point of arrest, whether to cooperate with the state and take a breath test. In short,\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Newton\n   </em>\n   , properly understood, do not support the state's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   That leaves this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cabanilla\n   </em>\n   , on which the state primarily relies.

Specifically, the question in\n   <em>\n    Cabanilla\n   </em>\n   was whether, as a matter of statute, a defendant's refusal to take the breath test could be offered against him in a criminal proceeding when the defendant had not been fully \"informed\" of the adverse consequences of a refusal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675339\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/622/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Invoking the interpretation of the implied-consent statutes in the plurality decision in\n   <em>\n    Newton\n   </em>\n   and the majority decision in\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   the court explained that the point of informing a DUII suspect of the adverse consequences of refusing to take breath test is not to ensure that the suspect's decision to refuse is knowing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675339\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/622/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675339\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/622/\">\n    at 633-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675339\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/622/\">\n    273 P.3d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, it is to persuade a suspect to submit to the test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675339\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/622/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, as a statutory matter, the fact that the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Cabanilla\n   </em>\n   did not fully understand the adverse consequences of his refusal did not preclude its admission against him in a criminal proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675339\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/622/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The question that the court answered in\n   <em>\n    Cabanilla\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   whether, as a statutory matter, a suspect's decision to refuse a breath test is admissible in a criminal proceeding only if it is informed-is different from the question presented here-whether a decision to submit to a breath test that is the product of a constitutional violation should be suppressed. We recognize that some of the statements in\n   <em>\n    Cabanilla\n   </em>\n   , viewed in isolation, could be interpreted as supporting the position that the state takes here. However, reading those statements in light of the statutory question that the court decided in\n   <em>\n    Cabanilla\n   </em>\n   and also in light of this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the implied-consent statutes do not require the admission of the breath test results when a DUII suspect's decision to take the breath test is the product of a violation of his or her Article I, section 12, right to counsel. The premise of the state's alternative argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The state raises one other issue in support of its implied-consent argument that requires a response. It argues that excluding the results of a breath test overcorrects for the Article I, section 12, violation. The state reasons\n   that \"[a] defendant has no legal right, constitutional or otherwise, to withhold compliance with a breath test administered under the implied-consent law. Thus, exclusion of the implied-consent breath test evidence would not preserve rights 'to the same extent as if the government's officers had stayed within the law.' \" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Vondehn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671854\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/348/462/#p475\">\n    348 Or. at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671854\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/348/462/#p475\">\n    236 P.3d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In our view, the difficulty with the state's argument is its premise. As explained above, a DUII suspect does have a statutory right to decide whether to submit or refuse to submit to a breath test. When a suspect's decision to submit to a breath test is the product of a constitutional violation,\n   excluding the results restores the suspect to the position he or she would have been in if the state had not violated the suspect's rights in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Perhaps the state is arguing that the implied-consent statutes put a DUII suspect to a choice (submit to a breath test or have evidence of your refusal be admitted against you in a DUII prosecution) and that excluding a suspect's breath test results overcorrects for that violation by excusing the suspect from having to make that statutory choice. To the extent that is the state's point, it assumes that the state constitutionally can put a defendant to that choice, a question that this court has not yet answered. Beyond that, even if the implied-consent statutes can put a defendant to that choice consistent with the constitution, the state does not explain how its loss of a statutory benefit somehow out-weighs the vindication of a defendant's constitutional right. If our only choice in fashioning a remedy for the violation of a defendant's Article I, section 12, right is either to undercorrect for the violation of the defendant's constitutional right or to overcorrect for that violation by denying the state a statutorily created benefit,\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   makes clear that the state's loss of a statutory benefit is a necessary consequence of remedying the state's violation of the defendant's constitutional right. Following\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Durbin\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the breath test results should have been suppressed as a product of the violation of defendant's Article I, section 12, right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the reasons explained above, defendant's motion to suppress the breath test results as a product of the officer's Article I, section 12, violation should have been granted. Additionally, defendant plausibly argues on review that the admission of those test results affected both his DUII conviction and his reckless driving conviction, and the state does not argue otherwise. We accordingly reverse the judgment as to both convictions and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

In concluding that that advice was not unlawful and thus did not render the defendant's consent involuntary, we noted that the advice stated only that a refusal \"may be offered against him,\" not that evidence of a refusal would be admitted against him.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759004\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/493/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759004\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/493/\">\n     at 504-05\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759004\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/493/\">\n     318 P.3d 1133\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Presumably for that reason, the state notes that its warrantless seizure and search of defendant's breath can be justified either as a search incident to an arrest or under the exigent circumstances doctrine. The state does not appear to argue that it is relying on either of those exceptions to the warrant requirement as a basis for obtaining defendant's BAC independently of his implied consent to take a breath test.
