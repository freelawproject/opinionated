The district court determined that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion to extend the detention. However, it denied the motion to suppress because the length of McLeod's detention did not exceed the amount of time reasonably necessary to complete an ordinary traffic stop. On appeal, the State concedes that the \"denial of the suppression motion appears to have been based on an\n   incorrect understanding of the law\" but urges us to affirm on the alternative ground that the officers had reasonable suspicion to prolong the stop. We agree with the district court that the officer lacked reasonable suspicion. As a result, we decline to affirm on the alternative ground, and we reverse the district court's denial of the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 A police officer was patrolling\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=200%20So.%20500\">\n    200 South 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   West in Salt Lake City when he noticed a vehicle parked in the median of the street. The officer watched as McLeod exited the vehicle and jaywalked across the street. McLeod approached three people, who pointed out that the officer was nearby. McLeod then walked around the corner, out of the officer's sight. The officer waited for McLeod to return to his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 When McLeod returned, he got into his vehicle and pulled away from the median without signaling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that point, the officer initiated a traffic stop. The officer approached McLeod's vehicle and requested his driver license, proof of insurance, and vehicle registration. When McLeod was unable to produce those documents, the officer asked for his name and other identifying information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The officer returned to his patrol car to complete a records check while a backup officer, who had arrived on the scene, watched McLeod. During the records check, McLeod continued \"moving around quite a bit in his front seat.\" The backup officer told McLeod to stop moving around, and he complied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The records check confirmed that McLeod had a valid driver license and that he did not have any outstanding warrants. The officer later testified that nothing in McLeod's record \"raised concerns of violence\" or suggested that the officer \"should detain him further on ... any other matters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The officer also acknowledged that, \"at that point, it was either write the citation or give him a warning [for the traffic violation].\" But the officer did not write McLeod a citation, give him a warning for any offense, or tell him that he was free to leave. Instead, the officer returned to McLeod's vehicle and asked whether \"he had anything illegal in the car.\" When McLeod said \"No,\" the officer asked if he could search the vehicle, and McLeod responded, \"Sure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 As he prepared to step out of the car, McLeod reached underneath a pile of clothes on the passenger seat. Concerned that McLeod was reaching for a weapon, the officers ordered McLeod out of the vehicle and frisked him, which confirmed that McLeod did not have any weapons on his person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The officer then asked McLeod a second time whether there was anything illegal in the vehicle. This time, McLeod admitted that he had a syringe in a shoe inside the car. Approximately ten minutes had elapsed from the beginning of the traffic stop to the time that McLeod indicated that he had a syringe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 During the ensuing search of McLeod's vehicle, the officer discovered a heroin-filled syringe and a black twist\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the shoe and two more black twists in the center console. The officer believed that the twists contained heroin because, based on his training and experience, that was \"the way [heroin] was packaged.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 McLeod was arrested and subsequently charged with possession or use of a controlled substance, a third degree felony, and possession of drug paraphernalia, a class B misdemeanor. Before trial, McLeod moved to suppress the evidence, contending that the\n   officer had violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, McLeod argued that because \"there [was] no reasonable basis to extend the stop[,] ... [the officer's] request to search the vehicle constituted an illegal detention and the evidence should be suppressed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 In denying the motion to suppress, the district court rejected the State's argument that McLeod's \"furtive movements\" and \"suspicious acts\" prior to the traffic stop constituted reasonable suspicion to extend the detention. Instead, the court concluded that the officer \"did not unconstitutionally extend the scope of the traffic stop,\" because his \"activities that were not directed toward the traffic investigation took substantially less time than would have been required to complete the traffic investigation and issue a citation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 McLeod pled guilty to possession of a controlled substance, a class A misdemeanor, preserving his right to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R.

Garrity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996866\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/216/944/\">\n    2009 UT 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996866\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/216/944/\">\n    216 P.3d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Stating the [party's] assertion without ruling on the validity of the assertion does not constitute a finding of fact.\"). In his testimony, the officer acknowledged it is not unusual for drivers who could not produce a license and registration to continue looking for those items. The fact that the district court specifically considered the alleged furtive movements and still concluded that there was no reasonable suspicion to prolong the stop persuades us that McLeod's behavior was not inherently suspicious or strongly indicative of criminal behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b626 Finally, we recognize that a location's reputation for being a \"high crime area\" is a relevant factor for courts to consider as part of the reasonable suspicion analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p124\">\n    528 U.S. at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p124\">\n    120 S.Ct. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the district court did not make specific findings of fact regarding the character of the neighborhood in this case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the officer testified that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=200%20So.%20500\">\n    200 South 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   West is a high-crime area known for drug trafficking and aggravated crimes. This undisputed testimony weighs in favor of the State's argument, but \"[a]n individual's presence in an area of expected criminal activity, standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable, particularized suspicion that the person is committing a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=200%20So.%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b627 Taken together, the totality of the circumstances were insufficient for the officer to form a particularized and objective basis to suspect that McLeod was involved in criminal activity beyond the observed traffic violation. Because the purpose of the stop was completed, McLeod's further detention without reasonable suspicion of additional criminal activity violated the Fourth Amendment thereby tainting McLeod's consent to search the vehicle. Accordingly, we decline to affirm McLeod's conviction on the State's proposed alternative ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b628 We accept the State's concessions that the officer prolonged McLeod's detention beyond the time necessary to complete the traffic stop and that reasonable suspicion was required to further detain him and ask questions unrelated to the purpose of the stop. While we disagree with the district court that the traffic stop was not unlawfully extended, we do agree with the district court that the officer lacked reasonable suspicion to believe McLeod was engaged in other criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As a result, we conclude that McLeod's Fourth Amendment rights were violated and that he is entitled to suppression of the evidence discovered during the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b629 We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    \"In reviewing the [district] court's ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, we recite the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the [district] court's findings.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
