We affirm on alternate grounds and address the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Does Montana's Preferred Provider Agreements Act violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 This is the second appeal in this case and we previously set forth a detailed factual background in\n   <em>\n    Gazelka v. St. Peter's Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261952\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/379/142/\">\n    2015 MT 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261952\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/379/142/\">\n    379 Mont. 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261952\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/379/142/\">\n    347 P.3d 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pertinent to this appeal, in 2010 and 2011, Gazelka sought and received treatment from the Hospital for various injuries and symptoms. The Hospital billed Gazelka directly because she did not have health insurance when she received the treatments at issue. However, almost all of Gazelka's treatment costs were either covered by another party's insurance or\n   significantly discounted by the Hospital's 50% financial-need discount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Gazelka filed suit in District Court, arguing that the statutes authorizing the Hospital's billing practices violate the Equal Protection Clause of Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution. The Montana Preferred Provider Agreements Act (MPPAA), \u00a7\u00a7 33-22-1701 to -1707, MCA, permits Preferred Provider Agreements (PPAs) in Montana. A PPA is an agreement between an insurer and a healthcare provider reducing\n   the amount of money a provider will accept as satisfaction for an insured person's treatment. Thus, two patients may ultimately pay different amounts for treatment depending on whether the patient is insured or uninsured and, if insured, depending on the terms of a particular PPA. If a patient is uninsured, she pays the amount the provider charged, less any discount she may receive through a provider's financial assistance program. Uninsured persons are not parties to and do not benefit from PPAs. If a patient is insured, she or her insurer pays the amount the provider agreed to accept as satisfaction for that treatment pursuant to the negotiated PPA. Providers frequently have PPAs with multiple insurers, and therefore one insurer's PPA may be more favorable to a patient, requiring her or her insurer to pay less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Gazelka contended that the MPPAA unconstitutionally discriminates against uninsured patients and patients insured by the insurers that did not negotiate the most favorable PPA. She noted that the patients insured by the insurer that negotiated the most favorable PPA pay less for the same treatment than all other patients. Thus, Gazelka asked the District Court to find that the MPPAA violates the Equal Protection Clause of Article II, Section 4, and moved for partial summary judgment. The Hospital responded with its own motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that the MPPAA is constitutional. The District Court agreed with the Hospital, concluded that the MPPAA creates similarly situated classes but does not violate Gazelka's right to equal protection, and granted the Hospital's motion for partial summary judgment. Gazelka appeals. We affirm the District Court's decision on alternate grounds, as we determine that Gazelka failed to identify similarly situated classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Goble v.

Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The dignity of the human being is inviolable. No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws. Neither the state nor any person, firm, corporation, or institution shall discriminate against any person in the exercise of his civil or political rights on account of race, color, sex, culture, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 4. By its own terms, Article II, Section 4, protects against two\n   distinct types of unequal treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, it generally provides that \"[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.\" Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 4. The provision then more specifically provides that \"[n]either the state nor any person,\n   firm, corporation, or institution shall discriminate against any person in the exercise of his civil or political rights on account of race, color, sex, culture, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas.\" Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 4. The second, more specific guarantee clearly applies to both public and private action; neither the state nor a private party may discriminate against a person in the exercise of his civil or political rights based on an included class. The first, more general guarantee, however, does not name a specific actor. We have never before directly considered whether state action is required for a plaintiff's Article II, Section 4, general equal protection claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 The 1972 Constitutional Convention's Bill of Rights Committee intended Article II, Section 4, to eradicate \"public and private discriminations based on race, color, sex, culture, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas.\" Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, February 22, 1972, p. 628; Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1642.

Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, February 22, 1972, p. 628; Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1642. The second, more specific equal protection guarantee of Article II, Section 4, effectuates those intentions, and our precedent consistently recognizes that Article II, Section 4, provides even more protection than the federal Equal Protection Clause.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Snetsinger v.

The MPPAA's purpose is to allow insurers to \"negotiate and contract\" with providers to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) provide health care services to its insureds or subscribers at a reduction in the fees customarily charged by the provider; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) enter into agreements in which the participating providers accept negotiated fees as payment in full for health care services the health care insurer is obligated to provide or pay for under the health benefit plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 33-22-1702, MCA. To accomplish its stated purpose, the MPPAA provides that insurers may enter into PPAs with healthcare\n   providers relating to health care services. Section 33-22-1704(1), MCA. These PPAs may include terms relating to \"the amounts an insured may be charged for services rendered\" and \"the amount and manner of payment to the provider.\" Section 33-22-1704(1)(a)(i)-(ii), MCA. The MPPAA thus permits insurers, on behalf of their insureds or subscribers, to negotiate and contract with healthcare providers for reduced fees. In exchange for accepting reduced fees, a healthcare provider may receive an exclusive agreement that encourages insured patients to use the provider. The provider benefits from the agreement because it is assured substantial patient volume. The benefits a patient receives based on her insurer's PPA with a provider is a function of varying conditions and factors, including the terms of the PPA, the premiums paid by the patient, and the different volumes of patients who are insured by an insurer.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Vincent Hosp. &amp; Health Ctr. v.

Gazelka broadly states that statutes such as the MPPAA are state actions subject to the Equal Protection Clause. The Hospital does not contest that statement and does not raise lack of state action as an issue to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the MPPAA, the amount a provider agrees to accept as payment from an insurer depends on the terms of a specific PPA, which is a contract negotiated by private entities; any cost-benefit an insured patient receives based on the PPA is attenuated from the MPPAA. Thus, the fact that some patients are uninsured or insured by companies that do not negotiate the most favorable PPA may not be a product of state\n   action. Here, Gazelka still has a claim pending before the District Court, as she also alleged that the MPPAA permits insurers and healthcare providers to unlawfully restrain trade in violation of \u00a7 30-14-205, MCA. Gazelka's unlawful restraint of trade claim is premised, in part, upon the state's action in enacting the MPPAA. In\n   <em>\n    Montana Cannabis Industry Association v. State\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 15-18, we analyzed a statute authorizing the private production and sale of medical marijuana as state action subject to a general equal protection analysis. In that case, the state was a named party to the action, whereas, here, the Hospital is the only named defendant. Accordingly, because the parties did not brief the issue and because the question is not appropriately before this Court, we decline to determine whether the Hospital entering into PPAs with insurers pursuant to the MPPAA constitutes state action. We do not want to rule on the state action issue, which is not before us, and unintentionally disturb the remaining pending litigation. Instead, we proceed to evaluate Gazelka's equal protection claim based on her proposed classes upon which the District Court conducted its analysis, without addressing whether the MPPAA constitutes state action. We hold, however, that the general equal protection guarantee of Article II, Section 4, which provides, \"No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws,\" requires state action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 The general equal protection guarantee of Article II, Section 4, requires that \"persons similarly situated with respect to a legitimate governmental purpose of the law must receive like treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Goble\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rausch v.

Finally, the law may contain no classification, or a neutral classification, and be applied evenhandedly.

Gazelka notes that those in the first class pay the lowest rate for treatment, while those in the second class do not benefit from the most favorable PPA and therefore pay higher rates for the same treatment. Gazelka further separates the second class into two alternative classes: (1) all patients, insured and uninsured, who are not insured by the insurer that negotiated the most favorable PPA, and (2) uninsured patients, who never benefit from PPAs. The Hospital responds that the classes are not similarly situated because of the many fundamental differences between the groups of patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b622 The District Court determined that Gazelka properly alleged similarly situated classes, concluding that (1) patients insured by the insurer that negotiated the most favorable PPA were similarly situated to (2) uninsured patients and patients insured by the insurers that did not negotiate the most favorable PPA. The court determined that the distinguishing factor between the two groups was the cost-benefit of the most favorable PPA. The District Court's determination was based on its recognition that patients without the most favorable PPA pay more for the same treatment. We disagree. We conclude instead that the MPPAA does not create two separate classes because the identified classes are fundamentally different and therefore sufficiently distinguishable for purposes of an equal protection analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b623 Gazelka fails to identify similarly situated classes. \"[D]iscrimination cannot exist in a vacuum; it can be found only in the unequal treatment of people in similar circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Goble\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 29 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Freeman v.

Here, Gazelka's proposed similarly situated classes face circumstances that are far from similar. The classes include patients who have different insurers, have different PPAs with varying terms and conditions, pay different premiums, have different negotiated payments, and are insured by companies that have different volumes of insured patients. More fundamentally, the classes are not similarly situated because insured patients who have contracts with insurers and pay insurance premiums are in completely different positions than\n   uninsured patients who do not have contracts with insurers or pay for the benefits of negotiated, reduced fees. Further, Gazelka's alleged class of uninsured patients who never benefit from PPAs includes patients, like Gazelka, who may benefit from the Hospital's 50% financial-need discount, which provides even more favorable fees than the PPA negotiated by the insurer with the most favorable PPA. Indeed, if the Court were to accept that Gazelka, as an uninsured, was similarly situated to those who pay for insurance benefits, any contract facilitated by a statute could become the basis for an equal protection challenge by those who have not received the benefit of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b624 The circumstances here are so diverse as to render the proposed classes fundamentally dissimilar for purposes of an equal protection analysis. Whether a patient has to pay more, less, or the same as another patient is attributable to numerous and varying circumstances; including, to highlight only a few, different insurers, different PPAs, different premiums, and different provider financial-need discounts. We conclude that Gazelka's proposed classes are not similarly situated and that she has not satisfied the first step of the equal protection analysis. Therefore, our inquiry ends and Gazelka's equal protection claim fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mont. Cannabis Indus.

We hold that the MPPAA does not deny Gazelka equal protection of the laws because the classes are not similarly situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b625 Finally, we address Gazelka's allegation that the Hospital unconstitutionally discriminates against her based on her social condition as an uninsured person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 4 (\"Neither the state nor any person, firm, corporation, or institution shall discriminate against any person ... on account of ... social origin or condition ....\"). Gazelka contends that uninsured persons are members of an economically disadvantaged class, as those who are uninsured frequently lack income, education, and employment. The Hospital argues that one's uninsured status is not a social condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b626 We agree with the Hospital and determine that whether one has health insurance is not a social condition for purposes of equal protection analysis. The Constitutional Convention Delegates included the phrase social origin or condition \"to cover discriminations based on status of income and standard of living.\" Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1642;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McClanathan v.

A social condition \"relates to one's economic status or rank in society\" and the constitutional provision seeks to prohibit \"discrimination which results solely because one is poor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    McClanathan\n   </em>\n   , 186 Mont. at 69, 606 P.2d at 514. In\n   <em>\n    McClanathan v. Smith\n   </em>\n   , we determined that one's status as \"a parent and totally disabled person\" was not a social condition within the meaning of Article II, Section 4.\n   <em>\n    McClanathan\n   </em>\n   , 186 Mont. at 69, 606 P.2d at 514. Similarly, we conclude that having no health insurance is not a social condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b627 We are unable to conclude that having health insurance results solely from a person's social condition. Gazelka offered considerable evidence from experts opining that the uninsured in America are members of an economically disadvantaged class: poor, unhealthy, less educated, and financially vulnerable. This may be true. But a correlation between financial disadvantage and lack of health insurance does not prove that the Hospital's entry into PPAs with certain insurers discriminates against individuals because they are poor. A person's uninsured status may be related to his or her economic\n   status, but it is not exclusively related to the social condition of being poor. Bearing some relation to economic status is not the same as discrimination based on economic status itself. And there is nothing in the MPPAA that establishes differential health care pricing against the poor. Accordingly, we reject Gazelka's broad construction of \"social condition\" as including those who do not have health insurance. The MPPAA authorizes contractual arrangements that\n   <em>\n    reduce\n   </em>\n   treatment costs and therefore makes healthcare more affordable. Section 33-22-1702, MCA. The MPPAA does not create impermissible classifications based on one's social condition, income, or economic status, and the Hospital does not discriminate by entering into agreements the Act authorizes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b628 The general equal protection guarantee of Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution, which provides, \"No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws,\" requires state action. The MPPAA does not create classes of similarly situated individuals and therefore does not deny uninsured patients and patients insured by the insurers that did not negotiate the most favorable PPA equal protection. Further, one's uninsured status is not a social condition for purposes of Article II, Section 4, analysis. Therefore, the MPPAA, which authorizes the Hospital's billing practices, does not deprive Gazelka of her right to equal protection of the laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   JIM RICE, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   DIRK M.
