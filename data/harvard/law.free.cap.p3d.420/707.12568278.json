Tishawn Winborne challenges his two convictions for attempting to elude a police officer on the ground that the trial court failed to remove the juror and seat an alternate. Winborne also claims error to the trial court's allowance of police officers to use the words \"reckless\" and \"eluding\" in their testimony. We accept Winborne's assignments of error and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 This prosecution arises from Tishawn Winborne's defying of traffic stops and fleeing the presence of law enforcement officer patrol cars on adjoining days. On Friday, August 5, 2016, Spokane Police Officer Juan Rodriguez learned of Winborne while investigating a crime unrelated to charges brought against Winborne. On August 5, Officer Rodriguez viewed surveillance footage from a Motel 6 parking lot, which footage showed a male loading boxes into a red Mercury. The motel clerk identified the male as Winborne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 When Officer Juan Rodriguez later left the Motel 6, he glimpsed Tishawn Winborne standing in the motel parking lot. A suspicious Rodriguez trailed Winborne momentarily before Winborne entered the Mercury, which car Rodriguez recognized from the surveillance footage. A records search of the Mercury's license plate number identified the vehicle as stolen. Rodriguez called for assistance and followed Winborne, in an undercover car, as Winborne drove the Mercury. A chase ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20A.%2010\">\n    4 At 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :30 a.m., on August 5, Tishawn Winborne sped through Spokane residential streets at forty miles per hour with Police Officer Juan Rodriguez tailing him. Winborne did not stop at one stop sign. Spokane Police Officer Daniel Cole responded to Officer Rodriguez's request for assistance, pulled his marked squad car behind Winborne's Mercury, and activated his emergency lights, which activity provoked Winborne to accelerate. Rodriguez ended his pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Tishawn Winborne drove hastily westbound on Frederick Street and crossed a controlled intersection with Monroe Street without stopping but traveling at thirty miles per hour. Officer Cole continued in pursuit a block and a half behind Winborne. After crossing Monroe Street, Winborne reached forty-five miles per hour with a posted limit of twenty-five miles per hour. A block and a quarter after Monroe Street, Officer Cole ceased his pursuit because Winborne did not slow and in the interest of public safety. Winborne turned southbound at a \"T\" intersection, and Cole thereafter lost sight of the Mercury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Later on August 5, Spokane Police Sergeant Kurt Vigesaa discovered the Mercury parked near the intersection of Hemlock and York Streets. Sergeant Vigesaa attached a global positioning system device to the automobile, and, on Sunday, August 6, Vigesaa saw from his computer that the Mercury had journeyed to the town of Wellpinit, forty-four miles northwest of Spokane. When the Mercury commenced its return trip to Spokane on August 6, Sergeant Vigesaa positioned his squad car to intercept the car along Nine Mile Road north of Spokane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 As Sergeant Kurt Vigesaa reposed in his Dodge Charger patrol car, he espied Tishawn Winborne driving the Mercury pass Vigessa. Sergeant Vigesaa activated his emergency lights, which prompted Winborne to accelerate the Mercury to seventy miles per hour despite Nine Mile Road's limit of fifty-miles per hour. Vigesaa, while traveling at seventy-eight miles per hour, deployed a Star Chase device, which attached to the rear of the Mercury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Sergeant Kurt Vigesaa retreated and monitored the Mercury's movement from his squad car computer. The Mercury traveled wildly for thirteen minutes across Spokane, while Vigesaa observed the car speeding past other cars and weaving through a medium flow of traffic. The Star Chase system recorded the Mercury traveling as fast as ninety-eight miles per hour. The Mercury traveled on Spokane's busy Francis Street at eighty-four miles per hour without any officer in immediate pursuit. Winborne continued to wind through a succession of side streets with twenty-five and thirty mile per hour speed limits, while traveling around sixty miles per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 During Tishawn Winborne's hurried drive from west to east across Spokane, he temporarily drove south in the northbound lane of a street. He corrected onto the right side of the road, but then returned to driving in England and nearly struck an intercepting patrol car. At the last second, he corrected his lane of travel and narrowly avoided striking the police car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Tishawn Winborne eventually parked his automobile on North Crestline Street. Sergeant Kurt Vigesaa, with aid from dispatch, located the Mercury and witnessed Winborne exit the vehicle. Vigesaa identified himself as a law enforcement officer and directed Winborne to stop. Winborne saw Vigesaa in his police garb and fled. Winborne ran upstairs, followed by Sergeant Vigesaa. Vigesaa again identified himself as a police officer and ordered Winborne to stop. Winborne turned to run before being detained, after a physical struggle, with Vigesaa and other officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 Spokane Police Officer Stephanie Kennedy asked Tishawn Winborne, after his arrest, about stealing the car. Winborne responded: \"it doesn't matter; she knows better than to press charges.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) at 338. When questioned about the pursuit, he replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   You guys just couldn't catch up. Who drives the Charger? He's slow. I should have taken that-I should have-I should take that thing and teach him how to drive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   RP at 339.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   PROCEDURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 The State of Washington charged Tishawn Winborne with theft of a motor vehicle, two counts of attempting to elude a police vehicle, one count of second degree assault, and one count of third degree assault. The assault charges arise from his resisting of police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 At the start of trial, Tishawn Winborne moved in limine to preclude the State's witnesses from testifying regarding ultimate factual issues such as whether Winborne \"eluded\" or drove \"recklessly.\" The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 At the beginning of voir dire, the court inquired of the jury panel as a whole:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The second set of questions have to do with your qualifications to sit on a jury in this-or as a juror in this case. Has anyone here heard anything about this case before? Anyone express to you an opinion concerning this case? Do you know either the defendant or any of the lawyers on either side?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   RP at 83. No juror answered that he or she knew the defendant or had heard any information\n   about the prosecution. Neither the court nor counsel directly asked jury veniremen and venirewomen as to whether they witnessed any of the fast driving of Tishawn Winborne or of the police pursuit of Winborne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 During trial, State witnesses repeatedly testified to Tishawn Winborne's driving \"recklessly\" or \"eluding\" law enforcement. One officer testified, \"[o]bviously he [Winborne] was eluding me.\" RP at 252. At the close of the State's case, the trial court dismissed the theft of a motor vehicle charge because of insufficient evidence. Winborne did not testify on his behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 During summation, defense counsel argued that Tishawn Winborne, on August 5, did not drive as fast as to what Officers Juan Rodriguez and Daniel Cole testified. Counsel argued that Officer Cole, with emergency lights flashing, only pursued Winborne for one and one-half blocks. According to Winborne's counsel, during this short distance, Winborne would not necessarily know that the officer sought to stop him, particularly since Winborne drove one and a quarter block forward of Cole. Based on these assumed facts, counsel claimed his client did not willfully refuse to stop on August 5. Defense counsel also argued to the jury that Tishawn Winborne did not drive recklessly on August 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 During deliberations, the trial court received a note from the jury, which read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A juror now realizes he was witness to some of the events of August 5th. Does this disqualify him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 146. We hereafter refer to the juror who witnessed events as \"juror W.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 August 5, the date noted in the juror message, was the day of the first pursuit. As a result of the jury message, Tishawn Winborne expressed concern regarding the one juror's ability to separate personal observations from evidence presented during trial. Winborne moved for the juror to be excused and an alternate seated. In the alternative, Winborne asked the court to remind the jury that it must base its decision only on evidence heard during trial. The State suggested that the trial court respond to the juror question by questioning the juror about what he witnessed. The trial court denied Winborne's motion to dismiss the juror and rejected the State's suggestion. The trial court instructed the jury to review each of the jury instructions provided by the court. One such instruction read, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   It is your duty to decide the facts in this case based upon the evidence presented to you during this trial. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The evidence that you are to consider during your deliberations consists of the testimony that you have heard from witnesses, and the exhibits that I have admitted, during the trial. If evidence was not admitted or was stricken from the record, then you are not to consider it in reaching your verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   CP at 119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19 The jury found Tishawn Winborne guilty of both counts of attempting to elude a police vehicle, but acquitted Winborne of both assault charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Witness as Juror\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Issue 1: Did the trial court err by allowing the juror who witnessed events on August 5 to remain seated on the jury?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Answer 1: Yes.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 20 Tishawn Winborne assigns error to the trial court's failure to excuse juror W, who observed events on August 5. Winborne contends that refusal to unseat the juror violated his due process rights and his constitutional right to an impartial jury. He further asserts that the presence of a factual witness on the jury constitutes one of the rare circumstances in which an appellate court can presume bias, which requires reversal even without a showing of actual prejudice. Winborne adds that, at the least, the trial court should have questioned juror W about his or her ability to continue to serve. Although Winborne does not assert the right to confrontation of witnesses, we note that his challenge of juror W implicates the confrontation clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 21 The State responds by contending that simply witnessing events does not render a juror inherently biased. The State insists that the juror hid nothing from the court, did not prejudge the prosecution, and lacked an interest in the outcome. The State further argues that juror W witnessed such a tangential part of the crime that he did not realize his sighting until after completion of evidence. According to the State, in all likelihood, juror W only saw Tishawn Winborne or a police officer drive past. Therefore, the State contends that Winborne fails to establish an implied bias to support a challenge for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 22 Washington Constitution art. I, \u00a7 21 affords an accused the right to a jury of twelve persons. Washington Constitution art. I, \u00a7 22 lists additional rights of an accused as including the right \"to meet the witnesses against him face to face ... [and] to have a speedy public trial by an impartial jury.\" The right to trial by jury requires a trial by an unbiased and unprejudiced jury.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

RCW 2.36.110 declares:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   It shall be the duty of a judge to excuse from further jury service any juror, who in the opinion of the judge, has manifested unfitness as a juror by reason of bias, prejudice, indifference, inattention or any physical or mental defect or by reason of conduct or practices incompatible with proper and efficient jury service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   RCW 4.44.170 states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 24 Particular causes of challenge are of three kinds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (1) For such a bias as when the existence of the facts is ascertained, in judgment of law disqualifies the juror, and which is known in this code as implied bias.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (2) For the existence of a state of mind on the part of the juror in reference to the action, or to either party, which satisfies the court that the challenged person cannot try the issue impartially and without prejudice to the substantial rights of the party challenging, and which is known in this code as actual bias.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (3) For the existence of a defect in the functions or organs of the body which satisfies the court that the challenged person is incapable of performing the duties of a juror in the particular action without prejudice to the substantial rights of the party challenging.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   RCW 4.44.190 addresses \"actual bias:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A challenge for actual bias may be taken for the cause mentioned in RCW 4.44.170(2). But on the trial of such challenge, although it should appear that the juror challenged has formed or expressed an opinion upon what he or she may have heard or read, such opinion shall not of itself be sufficient to sustain the challenge, but the court must be satisfied, from all the circumstances, that the juror cannot disregard such opinion and try the issue impartially.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   RCW 4.44.180 defines \"implied bias\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A challenge for implied bias may be taken for any or all of the following causes, and not otherwise:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (1) Consanguinity or affinity within the fourth degree to either party.(2) Standing in the relation of guardian and ward, attorney and client, master and servant or landlord and tenant, to a party; or being a member of the family of, or a partner in business with, or in the employment for wages, of a party, or being surety or bail in the action called for trial, or otherwise, for a party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (3) Having served as a juror on a previous trial in the same action, or in another action between the same parties for the same cause of action, or in a criminal action by the state against either party, upon substantially the same facts or transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (4) Interest on the part of the juror in the event of the action, or the principal question involved therein, excepting always, the interest of the juror as a member or citizen of the county or municipal corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 25 A juror's witness to some of the litigated events implicates actual bias, not implied bias. The juror holds no special relationship to a party that creates implied bias. Instead, the juror presumably begins service in a particular state of mind resulting from having observed events. Because no one questioned juror W whether his recall, during the course of the trial, of events on August 5 might impact his verdict, the trial court never resolved whether the juror could disregard any opinion based on his remembrance of his observations. Therefore, under Washington's statutory scheme, juror W's observation of a portion of the alleged crime implicates actual, not implied, bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 26 Finally, a sentence within CrR 6.5 expresses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   If at any time before submission of the case to the jury a juror is found unable to perform the duties the court shall order the juror discharged, and the clerk shall draw the name of an alternate who shall take the juror's place on the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 27 Remarkably no current Washington statute or court rule expressly addresses the situation when a potential juror witnesses some of the events that form the substance of the case. Washington previously maintained a statute that read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A juror may be examined by either party as a witness, if he be otherwise competent. If he be not so examined, he shall not communicate any private knowledge or information that he may have of the matter in controversy to his fellow jurors, nor be governed by the same in giving his verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   BALLINGER'S Code \u00a7 5001 (later codified at RCW 5.60.010 and repealed by Laws of 1985, ch. 68, \u00a7 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 28 We review some general principles of juror qualification before directly addressing a witness to events as a jury member. A juror may be excused for cause if his views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his or her instructions and his or her oath.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The seating of a juror with percipient knowledge of facts comprising the criminal charges compromises this right. Due process means a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it, and a trial judge must ever be watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the effect of such occurrences when they happen.\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Phillips,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304618\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/209/\">\n    455 U.S. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304618\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/209/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304618\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/209/\">\n    71 L.Ed. 2d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982).

We also ask if a party could have removed juror W for cause if the juror had disclosed being a witness during voir dire. We assume that some testimony during the trial prompted juror W's memory to recall some events occurring on August 5, rather than the juror purposely misleading the court and the parties during voir dire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 31 The record shows that juror W \"was witness to some of the events of August 5.\" CP at 146. The State writes that the juror simply saw Tishawn Winborne or a police officer drive past. According to the State, the juror witnessed such a tangential part of the crime that he did not even realize being a witness until after the completion of all the\n   evidence. We worry, however, that the juror observed more than a tangential part of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 32 The first pursuit transpired on Friday, August 5. The parties assume that juror W witnessed the chase but remember that Officer Juan Rodriguez spoke to a Motel 6 clerk about Tishawn Winborne, when Rodriguez investigated an unrelated crime. The clerk identified Winborne. At the beginning of voir dire, the court asked potential jurors of knowledge of Winborne. We assume juror W was not the hotel clerk because he likely would have disclosed on questioning that he knew the defendant. Still, we recognize a remote possibility that juror W could have been the clerk but did not remember Winborne at the time of voir dire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 33 Juror W more likely saw a segment of the police pursuit on August 5. He saw a speeding Mercury, a patrol car with stimulated emergency lights, or both. We can reasonably conclude that the juror saw the speeding Mercury or the chase for less than three blocks, since the juror probably could not see beyond three blocks. Officer Daniel Cole likely used his emergency lights for less than three blocks. We do not know if juror W then drove or rode inside a car or observed the chase from another perspective. We hold concern that the juror, particularly if driving, may have needed to take steps to avoid being struck by either the Mercury or the patrol car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 34 At common law, a witness in the case could serve as a juror.\n   <em>\n    Underwood v.

Chadbourn rev. ed. 1976) (1940). In the mid-1600s, a new rule emerged that required jurors with personal knowledge of a case to state publicly in court on oath any such information and not to give the information in private to his companions. 6 JOHN HENRY WIGMORE, EVIDENCE IN TRIALS AT COMMON LAW \u00a7 1800 (James H.

By 1902, Washington State had entered the modern era of juror bias law. The State of Washington charged Frank Stentz with manslaughter. Stentz drove a team of horses over the person of M.W. Orton, who died from his injuries. The State argued that Stentz drove the team in a manner likely to endanger the lives of others. The manslaughter charge put at issue whether Stentz drove the team of horses wantonly, negligently, recklessly, and willfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 40 In the Frank Stentz prosecution, the State of Washington listed R.M. Sperry on its list of witnesses. Coincidentally R.M. Sperry also appeared for jury duty. On questioning, Sperry testified that he knew Stentz, but had formed no opinion as to his innocence or guilt. He insisted he would give Stentz a fair trial. Frank Stentz requested that the trial court remove Sperry for cause from the jury. The trial court told the State that he would remove Sperry for cause only if the State intended to call Sperry to testify. The State responded that it would call Sperry to testify only if Sperry did not serve on the jury. The trial court denied the motion to remove. Stentz exercised his last preemptory challenge to remove Sperry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 41 Because R.M. Sperry never sat on the jury, the State called him to testify. Sperry testified that Frank Stentz and companions in the wagon drawn by horses passed him two miles before the scene of the death. According to Sperry, the men acted jolly and hallooed and yelled at him. Sperry testified that Stentz drove fast and increased the speed of the horses when approaching him. The State presented testimony that the men had imbibed alcohol and that Stentz drove the team of horses too fast for conditions. Stentz lost control of the horses, who then ran over a bicycling M.W. Orton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 42 The Washington Supreme Court reversed the conviction of Frank Stentz, since Stentz needed to use a preemptory challenge to a juror who held knowledge of incriminating facts that bore on the essence of the offense. Sperry knew of the reckless driving\n   of Stentz on a public way a short distance before the offense. The prospective juror knew controverted facts that would from necessity bias and influence his judgment as a juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 43 The Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Stentz,\n   </em>\n   noted that a party may challenge a juror for actual bias. The law defines \"actual bias\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   the existence of a state of mind on the part of the juror in reference to the action, or to either party, which satisfies the trier, in the exercise of a sound discretion, that the juror cannot try the issue impartially and without prejudice to the substantial rights of the party challenging.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The current RCW 4.44.170 echoes this definition. Under this definition, according to the Supreme Court, the trial court abused its discretion when denying removal of R.M. Sperry from the jury panel. The discretion of the trial court to determine partiality or impartiality in a jury is subject to review by the appellate court under the constitutional guaranty to the accused of a trial by an impartial jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 44 The Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Stentz,\n   </em>\n   declared that the jury must decide the case only on the evidence before it. Under the constitutional provisions defining the rights of accused persons, Frank Stentz had the right, not only to be tried by an impartial jury, but to meet the witnesses against him face to face. Thus, the Supreme Court also noted a violation of the confrontation clause. The court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   This means that the examination of such a witness shall be in open court, in the presence of the accused, with the right of the accused to cross-examine such witness as to facts testified to by him-not that the witness may carry into the jury room, in the recesses of his own mind, knowledge of material, controverted facts which of necessity must bias his judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court stated that such a juror should be removed even if he declares that he will not allow his knowledge to influence him but will reach a verdict solely on the evidence presented during trial.

Stentz\n   </em>\n   possesses the remarkable similarity to Tishawn Winborne's appeal in that the Frank Stenz's juror likely saw Stentz drive recklessly before the homicidal accident. Winborne's juror W presumably saw Winborne drive at a high speed at the same location and during the same time for which the State charges Winborne with felony eluding, a crime that requires proof of reckless driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 46 In our appendix, we discuss two Texas decisions,\n   <em>\n    Wyle v.

The Grand Canyon State charged Floyd Thornton with two counts of first degree murder and a host of other crimes, including escape from a prison where authorities housed him after the first murder, but before the second murder. Potential juror Charlotte Nucci listened to Thornton's escape and capture on a scanner set on a police frequency. Nucci heard of the death of the second victim and police claiming the culprit to be Thornton. She heard the details of the capture of Thornton as relayed to a dispatcher. An Arizona statute directed the trial court to disqualify as a juror any \"witness in the action.\" ARIZ. REV. STAT. \u00a7 21-211(1). The trial court found that Nucci could be a fair and impartial juror and denied Thornton's challenge for cause. The Arizona Supreme Court construed the statute to exclude as a juror not only one who testifies in the case but those who witnessed the crime. The court then needed to determine if Charlotte Nucci\n   witnessed any of the charged crimes when listening on the scanner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 48 The Arizona court, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Thornton,\n   </em>\n   held Nucci not to be a witness within the meaning of the statute. In so ruling, the court applied the following rules. A witness to the offense should be limited to persons with personal knowledge of a material, disputed aspect of the case. Moreover, disqualification under the statute only comes with persons who have knowledge that is unique to the case. Mere general knowledge, such as familiarity with the geographic location at which an event occurred, will normally not result in mandatory disqualification. The reviewing court reviewed the trial record and concluded that Nucci listened to only facts that Thornton never disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 49\n   <em>\n    Hawkins v.

Texas prosecuted Nathaniel Hawkins for sexual assault. During the testimony, a juror disclosed that he had learned from the testimony that law enforcement recovered a hammer and mask from his backyard. He added that police had never informed him of the fact and he learned of the fact for the first time during an officer's testimony. The trial court denied Hawkins' motion for a mistrial primarily on the basis that the juror never saw the tool and mask in his yard. Thus, the juror was not a witness. The appellate court affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 50 Tishawn Winborne's juror W held percipient knowledge of the events, about which the State prosecuted him. Winborne challenged the speed at which law enforcement officers testified he traveled, and he denied that he drove recklessly. Whether the accused drove \"recklessly\" is an element of attempting to elude a police vehicle. RCW 46.61.024(1). Thus, Winborne's juror had knowledge relating to disputed facts. The State asserts that Winborne drove recklessly at the very time and place that the juror probably saw Winborne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 51 We note that, unlike the Washington Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nevertheless, this uncertainty in the reviewing court shows the need to have, at the very least, questioned juror W before allowing him to continue to serve and to ensure that juror W did not share his knowledge with other jurors.

The teaching of\n   <em>\n    Stentz\n   </em>\n   conflicts with this determination of our dissenting sister. To repeat, the\n   <em>\n    Stentz\n   </em>\n   court stated that such a juror should be removed even if he declares that he will not allow his knowledge to influence him but will reach a verdict solely on the evidence presented during trial.

Neither party discusses the ramifications of juror W's participation in determining guilt for the events of August 6, which he did not witness. Perhaps the parties assume that, if we must reverse the conviction for felony eluding conviction\n   for August 5, we must also reverse for the conviction of the same crime on August 6. Without any briefing on the question, we so conclude. If juror W based his vote to convict on the first count of felony eluding in part on his observations of August 5, those observations could impact his vote on the August 6 charge. The juror could reasonably conclude based on his personal observations that, if Winborne drove recklessly while being chased by law enforcement officer on August 5, he also drove recklessly on August 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Opinion Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 74 Tishawn Winborne next challenges the trial court's denial of his motion in limine to prohibit any witness from testifying that Winborne drove \"recklessly\" or \"eluded\" police.

Farr-Lenzini\n   </em>\n   , held the trooper's opinion, either as an expert or as a lay person, unhelpful to the jury. We reasoned that a lay jury holds the capability to decide whether a driver attempted to elude by relying on its common experience and without the aid of an expert.

Crim. App. 1989), the state of Texas charged James Wyle with capital murder. The reviewing court reversed a conviction because the trial court refused to remove a witness named Shotwell from the jury pool. Shotwell owned the only funeral home in the county. Shotwell testified at a venue hearing that he handled the funeral services for the alleged victim of the homicide. During the trial's voir dire, Shotwell testified that the sheriff's office called him to the gas station, the scene of the purported crime, where he removed the body. He remained inside the gas station building for two hours and spoke to officers during his visit. Shotwell observed blood on the floor. Despite this background, Shotwell averred that he could be a fair juror that he would accord Wyle a presumption of innocence, and he would reach a verdict on the evidence presented at trial. When the trial court refused to remove Shotwell for cause, Wyle exercised a preemptory challenge to remove him. During the State's case, it called Shotwell to testify of collecting the body and transporting the corpus to the medical examiner's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 84 Texas maintained a statute that allowed either party to challenge a juror for cause if the person was a witness in the case. The trial court, in\n   <em>\n    Wyle v. State,\n   </em>\n   apparently deemed the statute to apply only if the juror testified at trial and the court assumed the State would not call Shotwell as a witness if Shotwell served as a juror. The Court of Appeals disagreed with this reading of the statute. The court extended the coverage of the statute to anyone who saw the commission of the offense or its incidents. The court reversed because Wyle could not otherwise use all of the preemptory challenges to which he was entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 85\n   <em>\n    Siller v.

App. 2008), like Tishawn Winborne's appeal, concerns a juror remembering events after the commencement of testimony. One of the disputed facts at trial was whether the county clerk posted notice on a public bulletin board of the subject foreclosure sale. The landowner challenged the sale, in part, on the ground that the clerk failed to post notice. The clerk testified to the contrary. One juror, when asked during voir dire if she knew anything about the case, responded negatively. After the close of testimony, the juror informed the court and the attorneys that she had been present during the foreclosure sale and saw the posted notice. The juror explained that testimony during trial refreshed her memory. The landowner moved to remove the juror and for a mistrial. The trial court denied both requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Court of Appeals reversed based on the Texas statute precluding a witness from serving as a juror. The court emphasized that the juror possessed personal knowledge of a disputed fact.

Because additional information is necessary to determine whether juror W's extra-judicial observations impacted his ability to serve as an impartial juror, I would deny Tishawn Winborne's request for relief from conviction at this time.

It is possible juror W was frightened by what he witnessed and desired retribution. Or it could be juror W thought very little of what he saw, given that our lives are filled with exposure to police sirens and pursuits. The latter scenario would seem quite plausible, given that juror W did not remember seeing anything on August 5 until late in the trial and that two of juror W's four verdicts were for acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6 89 Contrary to the majority's analysis,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The structural\n   error analysis follows the usual rule of assigning the defendant the burden to prove the existence of error.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Koss,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355808\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/181/493/#p503\">\n    181 Wash.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%201042\">\n    334 P.3d 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (defendant's responsibility to show a courtroom closure occurred). It is only once a defendant establishes error that structural error's strong remedy kicks in and entitles the defendant to reversal.
