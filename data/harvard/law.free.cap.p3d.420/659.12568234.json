Claimant's primary work site was St. Charles Hospital, and he was injured when he slipped and fell on ice in the hospital parking lot while on his way to work. Employer and SAIF seek judicial review of an order of the Workers' Compensation Board upholding the compensability of claimant's injury. We review the board's order for substantial evidence and errors of law, ORS 656.298(7) ; ORS 183.482, conclude that the board did not err, and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We take our summary of the facts from the board's order. Employer Bend Memorial Clinic contracted to provide medical services to St. Charles Hospital, and employed claimant to work at St. Charles Hospital as a hospitalist. Claimant's job required him to make rounds at the hospital, complete charts, and, when he was not at the hospital during his shift, to be available on short notice via pager. Claimant does not have an office at\n   the hospital or at Bend Memorial Clinic but he has an office in his home, where he works when he is not required to be at the hospital, answering calls and responding to pages from nurses regarding patient care. Employer provides claimant with a computer and access to medical records and research tools for his use in his home office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to claimant's testimony, on the day of his injury, claimant's shift began at 7:00 a.m. He turned on his pager while still at home at 7:00 a.m. and left for the hospital at 7:15 a.m. He slipped on ice and fell in the hospital parking, fracturing his right leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Claimant sought workers' compensation benefits, and SAIF denied the claim, asserting that the injury did not arise out of and within the course and scope of employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 656.005(7)(a) (\"A compensable injury is an accidental injury *** arising out of and in the course of employment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Claimant requested a hearing. An administrative law judge (ALJ) overturned SAIF's denial, and the board affirmed the ALJ's order. Before the board, SAIF did not\n   dispute that claimant's injury arose out of his employment, but contended that compensability was precluded by the \"going and coming\" rule, because, at the time of his injury, claimant was going to work and therefore was not in the course of his employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Krushwitz v. McDonald's Restaurants\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2215870\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/323/520/#p526\">\n    323 Or. 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2215870\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/323/520/#p526\">\n    919 P.2d 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) (\"The general rule in Oregon-the 'going and coming rule'-is that injuries sustained while an employee is traveling to or from work do not occur in the course of employment and, consequently, are not compensable.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In upholding the compensability of the claim, the board reasoned that the \"going and coming\" rule did not preclude compensability, because claimant was in the course of his employment at the time of his injury. The board explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[T]his case involves a claimant who was injured during a regular period of employment, at a place where he reasonably would be expected to be at that time, and doing something reasonably incidental to the fulfillment of his duties. Such circumstances establish that claimant was 'on duty' and 'subject to the employer's direction and control,' and his employment was not 'suspended,' when he was injured.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   One board member dissented, agreeing with SAIF that claimant's injury did not occur in the course of employment. Although claimant's shift had begun, the dissenting board member reasoned, the going and coming rule applied, because claimant had not worked before leaving the house and, therefore, there was no \"time, place, and circumstances\" connection between the employment and the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On judicial review, SAIF disputes the board's conclusion that claimant was in the course of his employment while travelling to the hospital. As asserted by the board member, SAIF contends that, because claimant had not performed any work in his home office in the morning before he left for work and had not been paged, he was not travelling between work sites when he was injured, but was simply going to work. Because claimant was simply going to work, SAIF asserts, the \"going and coming\" rule precludes compensability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In determining whether an injury occurs in the course of employment, we look at the time, place, and circumstances of the injury.\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.
