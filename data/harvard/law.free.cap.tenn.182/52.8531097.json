In fact, such was not done but the motion for a new trial was merely filed in the lower court.'</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">It seems that after the transcript had been made up and filed in this Court, the clerk of the lower court without authority inserted in the transcript which- had been filed in this Court a copy of the motion for a new trial as a part of the bill of exceptions. In support of the motion, the State filed the affidavit of the clerk of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">This being the case, there is nothing capable of review at the hands of this Court. <em>Chattanooga Iron &amp; Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Hanssard, </em>143 Tenn. 553, 226 S. W. 1045; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>American Glanzstoff Corp., </em>163 Tenn. 206, 42 S. W. (2d) 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The motion suggesting a diminution of the record is sustained and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
