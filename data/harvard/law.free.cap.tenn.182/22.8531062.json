His motion for new trial being overruled, he has assigned errors and perfected his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-14\">The facts are not disputed and may be briefly stated. A highway patrolman swore out a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d warrant to search the premises known as the Star Dust Cafe in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Anderson County, Tennessee. Armed with this warrant, the affiant and another patrolman searched the premises named and found a case containing 24 pints of whisky. The defendant was not on the premises at the time the search was made. After the confiscation of the whisky, a warrant .was sworn for the arrest of the defendant, and at the time of the service of the last warrant defendant admitted ownership of the confiscated whisky.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\">The only assignment of error which need be considered on the appeal, is directed at the sufficiency of the allegations in the search warrant to make out \u201cprobable cause\u201d and justify its issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The affidavit for the warrant is on a printed form, in four sections or counts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cState of Tennessee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGg\">\u201cAnderson County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cBefore <em>E.

R. West, Justice of the Peace.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-18\">(Script in italics, and the rest of the affidavit is on a printed form.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Since this is a John Doe affidavit and warrant, it has no value and information about any person whatever, and its evidence is confined to the <em>location </em>of intoxicating liquor of unknown ownership. Attack is made on the omission of the month in section 2, where it appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-3\">\u201cAffiant further states that said informant, (who is anonymous) advised him on the 23 day of-, 1943.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">In the case of <em>Welchance </em>v. State, 173 Tenn. 26, 28, 114 S. W. (2d) 781, which seems practically identical with the case before us, the rule was stated to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201cIn a case such as the one on trial, it is essential that the date on which the alleged offense was committed be stated in the affidavit in order that the magistrate may determine whether probable cause exists for the issuance of the warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">This statement of the law is supported by a wealth of authority from other states, and these decisions are set out and discussed at some length in the <em>Welchance Case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">From the affidavit for the warrant before us, the liquor might have been seen by the officer\u2019s informant on the premises to be searched on the 23rd day of any month of the year 1943, between January and September, a period of eight months. The fact that whisky was bought on April 15th, afforded no probable cause for issuing a warrant on the succeeding 21st of June, a little more than two months after the purchase. <em>People </em>v. <em>Chippewa Circuit Judge, 226 </em>Mich. 326, 197 N. W. 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\"><em>\u201c </em>The supporting\u2019 affidavit must relate to facts which tend to show an unlawful situation actually or probably existing <em>at the </em>moment\u201d (of the issuance of the warrant). <em>Sgro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>287 U. S. 206, 215-216, 53 S. Ct. 138, 142, 77 L. Ed. 260, 85 A. L. R. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em> </em>It is, however, insisted by the State that the warrant is to be viewed as a whole and that so viewed and taking all its allegations into consideration, the question of whether probable cause was or was not shown was one on which the minds of reasonable men might differ. That the magistrate issuing the warrant was in the performance of a judicial function, <em>(Seals v. State, </em>157 Tenn. 538, 11 S. W. (2d) 879) and that this Court will review his issuance of the warrant only if it appears that such action was unsupported by material evidence. <em>Gallimore </em>v. <em>State, </em>173 Tenn. 178, 181, 116 S. W. (2d) 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\">We reaffirm the statement of the limited function of this Court set out in the <em>Gallimore Case, supra, </em>but hold under the rules stated in the <em>Welchance Case, supra, </em>that a statement of the date of the observation of the offense committed is essential, and if no such date is stated in the affidavit for the search warrant, that in that event the issuance of such warrant by the magistrate was unsupported by an essential element of material evidence, and this Court will review his actions and nullify the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">It is also the St\u00e1te\u2019s contention that the officers did not know that the place searched belonged to the defendant as owner or tenant; that if he had no proprietary interest in the place, no constitutional right of his was violated by the search, and the conviction should be affirmed on (1) the finding of the liquor, and (2) defendant\u2019s subsequent admission of ownership. We cannot agree with this contention because both officers who made the search, testified that although they did not know positively, they had been informed and had reason to believe that the place searched was \u201cthe place of business of the defendant.\u201d They knew, therefore, or should have known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>as officers, that an affidavit and warrant in regular form was necessary for a legal search.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\">The use of printed forms has made the procurement of a search warrant the merest formality, considering the fundamental constitutional right which the search invades. Certainly, this Court can do no less than to require that the few blank spaces be filled in, and the other details of the formality Jbe carried out with care and precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
