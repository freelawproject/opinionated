That Memorandum and Order affirmed the final decision of the Montana State Auditor and Commissioner of Insurance (Commissioner) that had disapproved the language in a number of insurance forms that BCBS had submitted for approval. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"As4\">\u00b62 BCBS presents a number of issues for review which we summarize as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u00b63 Issue One: Whether the District Court correctly determined that the Commissioner had the authority to withdraw a prior approval of BCBS forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Whether the District Court correctly determined that the Commissioner properly disapproved of BCBS forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">\u00b65 BCBS is a licensed not for profit health service corporation in Montana. In 2001 BCBS submitted forms to the Commissioner for approval as required by \u00a733-1-501(1), MCA. Those forms contained coverage exclusions under which BCBS would not pay for health care costs of its injured beneficiaries if the beneficiaries received, or were entitled to receive, benefits from any automobile or premises liability policy. The Commissioner disapproved the forms containing the exclusions and BCBS requested an administrative hearing. The Commissioner appointed a hearing examiner and opened a contested case proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">\u00b66 In March, 2002, the Commissioner and BCBS reached an agreement allowing BCBS to use exclusion language in its forms. The agreement was contained in correspondence between their attorneys; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>no formal settlement agreement was executed, no order was issued, and the administrative proceeding was not dismissed. Through 2006 the Commissioner approved BCBS forms containing the agreed-to exclusion language. In October and November, 2006, BCBS submitted 97 forms for approval. The Commissioner disapproved the forms in May, 2007 on the ground that the exclusion language conflicted with \u00a7 33-30-1101 and -1102, MCA, and \u201cdeceptively affect the risk purported to be assumed in the general coverage of the contract.\u201d BCBS requested a contested case hearing, which was conducted by a hearing examiner in July, 2007. In October, 2007, the hearing examiner issued Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order upholding the decision to disapprove the forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">\u00b67 In March, 2008, John Morrison, Montana State Auditor and Commissioner of Insurance, issued an order adopting the hearing examiner\u2019s proposed decision. BCBS sought judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision in the Montana First Judicial District Court. On December 18,2008, Judge Tom Honzel issued a Memorandum and Order upholding the Commissioner\u2019s decision to disapprove the BCBS forms. This appeal was taken from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b68 The exclusions at issue provide that BCBS will not pay health care benefits to its beneficiaries for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">Services, supplies, and medications provided to treat any injury to the extent the member receives, or would be entitled to receive where liability is reasonably clear, benefits under an automobile insurance policy. Such benefits received by the member shall be used first to satisfy any remaining coinsurance, copayments and deductibles related to the injury for which claims are submitted to the plan. The injury related claims must be submitted to the plan to apply any applicable credit to coinsurance, copayments and/or deductibles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">Services, supplies, and medications provided to treat any injury to the extent the member receives, or would be entitled to receive where liability is reasonably clear, benefits from a premises liability policy. Examples of such policies are a homeowners or business liability policy. Such benefits received by the member shall be used first to satisfy any remaining coinsurance, copayments and deductibles related to the injury for which claims are submitted to the plan. The injury related claims must be submitted to the plan to apply any applicable credit to coinsurance, copayments and/or deductibles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">All forms that the Commissioner disapproved in 2007 contained this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>language.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b69 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on judicial review of an agency decision to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous and whether the conclusions of law are correct. <em>O\u2019Neil v. Department of Revenue, </em>2002 MT 130, \u00b6 10, 310 Mont. 148, 49 P.3d 43; <em>Hofer v. Dept. Public Health and Human Services, </em>2005 MT 302, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 329 Mont. 368, 124 P.3d 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b6 10 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court correctly determined that the Commissioner had the authority to withdraw a prior approval of BCBS forms. </em>BCBS first contends that the Commissioner is bound by the 2002 agreement that approved the use of the exclusions at issue. It is undisputed that BCBS and the Commissioner did reach some kind of agreement in 2002 in the context of the contested case proceeding, and that BCBS employed the disputed exclusions for the next five years. BCBS contends that the 2002 agreement precludes the Commissioner from making a determination in 2007 to prohibit future use of the exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\u00b611 Montana law prohibits use of any insurance form unless it is filed with and approved by the Commissioner. Section 33-1-501(1), MCA. This is the provision under which BCBS sought approval of its forms in 2001 and 2007. The statute further provides that the Commissioner \u201cmay at any time, after notice and for cause shown withdraw any approval.\u201d Section 33-1-501(4), MCA. The insurer may request a hearing \u2018for unresolved disputes regarding disapproval or withdrawal of approval.\u201d Section 33-1-501(6), MCA. The Commissioner is required to disapprove any form or to withdraw any previous approval if the form is in violation of or does not comply with law, or if it contains any inconsistent, ambiguous or misleading terms that deceptively affect the risk purported to be assumed. Section 33-1-502, MCA. These statutory provisions requiring approval of forms and providing for the withdrawal of prior approvals were in effect at all the times relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\u00b612 Under \u00a733-1-501 and -502, MCA, the Commissioner\u2019s power and duty to withdraw previous form approval is clear. BCBS argues in effect that these statutes only allow withdrawal of approvals that were granted during the administrative process, and that the Commissioner has no power to withdraw an approval granted as the result of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>contested case proceeding. The statutes do not make any such distinction. Section 33-1-501(4), MCA, provides that the Commissioner \u201cmay <em>at any time, </em>after notice and for cause shown, <em>withdraw any approval.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The authority to withdraw \u201cany approval\u201d at \u201cany time\u201d is broad, and if the legislature had intended to except approvals given during a contested case proceeding, it could have easily done so. There is no reason to go beyond the plain words of the statute and to impose the limitation urged by BCBS. <em>Friends of the Wild Swan v. Mont. Dept. Nat. Res. &amp; Cons., </em>2005 MT 351, \u00b6 13, 330 Mont. 186, 127 P.3d 394. Sections 33-1-501 and -502, MCA, do not prohibit the Commissioner from withdrawing previous form approvals agreed to during contested case proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\">\u00b613 The Commissioner has broad statutory power over the content of insurance documents, and the statutes require that this power be exercised to protect the insured public and to further the goals of Montana\u2019s laws on insurance. Section 33-1-311, MCA. The position of BCBS here, and particularly its argument that the Commissioner waived any right to object to the exclusions by agreeing to them in 2002, would immortalize any provision of an insuring document approved in a similar manner. This would be true however onerous or deceptive the provision proved to be. The provision would survive even if there were statutory changes that caused it to conflict with express law. This would be contrary to public policy as expressed in the insurance codes in Title 33, MCA, and with the Commissioner\u2019s powers over insurers for the protection of the public. Application and enforcement of these statutes, enacted for the public benefit, cannot be waived. <em>Collection Bureau Services v. Morrow, </em>2004 MT 84, \u00b6 10, 320 Mont. 478, 87 P.3d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b6 14 The Commissioner was not barred by res judicata arising from the 2001 proceeding from withdrawing the previous approval of the exclusion language. Assuming, for purposes of this issue, that administrative res judicata could prohibit the Commissioner from withdrawing a prior form approval, that doctrine is not applicable to the 2001 proceeding. That administrative proceeding produced no decision, decree or order of any kind. It is undisputed that the Commissioner and BCBS did not execute an actual settlement document; that there was no order approving a settlement or incorporating the provisions of a settlement; and that the contested case proceeding was never closed. Res judicata does not apply. <em>Olson v. Daugenbraugh, </em>2001 MT 284, \u00b6 22, 307 Mont. 371, 38 P.3d 154.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap0\">\u00b615 BCBS also asserts that the Commissioner abused his discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>by adopting a number of conclusions of law adopted by the hearing examiner. We will not consider these issues because the decision of the hearing examiner is not part of the record on appeal and the specific conclusions or findings referred to do not appear in the record in any recognizable form. <em>See </em>M .R. App. P. 8(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b616 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court correctly determined that the Commissioner properly disapproved of the BCBS forms. </em>Since the Commissioner had the power to withdraw the previous approval of the BCBS exclusion provisions, the next issue is whether there were sufficient grounds to do so under \u00a733-1-502, MCA. The parties devote substantial argument to the issue of whether the BCBS exclusions represent attempts to exercise subrogation contrary to law. If the provisions do constitute impermissible subrogation by BCBS, then the Commissioner properly rejected them under \u00a733-1-502(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b617 The District Court held that the BCBS exclusions were subject to disapproval under \u00a733-1-502(1), MCA, because they violated Montana law on subrogation, as set out in \u00a7\u00a7 33-30-1101 and -1102, MCA. Section 33-30-1101, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">A hospital or medical service plan contract issued by a health service corporation may contain a provision providing that, to the extent necessary for reimbursement of benefits paid to or on behalf of the insured, the health service corporation is entitled to subrogation, as provided in 33-30-1102, against a judgment or recovery received by the insured from a third party found liable for a wrongful act or omission that caused the injury necessitating benefit payments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Section 33-30-1102, MCA, provides that a health service corporation\u2019s right of subrogation \u201cmay not be enforced until the injured insured has been fully compensated for his injuries.\u201d The District Court agreed with the Commissioner\u2019s determination that the BCBS exclusions allowed it to exclude, limit or offset health insurance benefits otherwise due to the insured before the insured was fully compensated for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\u00b618 Subrogation is an equitable doctrine designed to compel the ultimate payment of an obligation by the person \u201cwho injustice, equity and good conscience should pay it.\u201d <em>Skauge v. Mountain States T. &amp; T., </em>172 Mont. 521, 524, 565 P.2d 628, 630 (1977). Montana public policy requires that an insured must be totally reimbursed for all losses including costs and attorney fees incurred in recovering those losses, before the insurer can exercise any right of subrogation, whatever an insurance policy may provide to the contrary. <em>Swanson v. Hartford Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>Co., </em>2002 MT 81, \u00b6 28, 309 Mont. 269, 46 P.3d 584; <em>Oberson v. Federated Mutual Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 329, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 330 Mont. 1, 126 P.3d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\">\u00b619  The BCBS exclusions effectively allow it to exercise subrogation before paying anything to its insured, contrary to \u00a733-30-1101, MCA, which allows reimbursement \u2018for benefits paid.\u201d The exclusions allow BCBS to avoid any payment of benefits to its insured if the insured is \u201centitled to receive\u201d benefits from any other auto or premises liability policy, whether or not the insured actually receives any of those benefits, and whether or not the insured has been made whole. Only when the insured is made whole as defined in Montana law, and then only after BCBS has paid out benefits to its insured, could BCBS be e ntitled to claim subrogation. It is contrary to Montana law for BCBS to enjoy the benefits of subrogation in the circumstances allowed by the disputed exclusions. The BCBS exclusions therefore violate Montana statutory and case law on subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b620  The Commissioner was within his statutory power and duty to disapprove the BCBS exclusions. The disapproval was warranted under \u00a733-1-502(1), MCA, because the provisions were in violation of, or do not comply with the insurance code. The District Court therefore properly upheld the Commissioner\u2019s decision and we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"ACG\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"Alg\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A18\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b621 \u201c[A]n exclusion is not synonymous with the concept of subrogation ....\u201d <em>St. Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Walker, </em>505 S.E.2d 828, 830 (Ga. App. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b622 Although I concur with the Court\u2019s determination under the first issue that the Commissioner possessed the authority to withdraw a prior approval of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) policy forms, I dissent from the Court\u2019s resolution of the second issue because it fails to recognize the distinction between subrogation and insurance exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b623 This Court has previously acknowledged that it has confused subrogation with distinctly different concepts. In <em>Youngblood v. Am. Sts. Ins. Co., </em>262 Mont. 391, 866 P.2d 203 (1993), for example, the Court recognized its past failure to distinguish between subrogation and assignment. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">The \u2018blurring\u201d of the distinction between an assignment and subrogation, in our decisions <em>inReitler </em>and <em>Christenson, </em>and the misapplication of those concepts in those cases, was unfortunate. There is a definite, legal distinction between the two doctrines, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>and, in <em>Reitler </em>and <em>Christenson, </em>we erred in reasoning otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaR\"><em>Youngblood, </em>262 Mont. at 398, 866 P.2d at 207. Of course, merely because we have failed to properly apply subrogation concepts in the past does not mean we have failed to do so in this case, but our past confusion provides an appropriate backdrop here, as the Court has again confused the concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b624 We have explained that subrogation stems from the Latin root \u2018Subrogare,\u201d which means \u201cto pray under or through.\u201d <em>Swanson v. Champion Intern. Corp., </em>197 Mont. 509, 519, 646 P.2d 1166, 1171 (1982). Although the Court offers the cursory definition of subrogation as \u201can equitable doctrine designed to compel the ultimate payment of an obligation by the person \u2018who injustice, equity and good conscience should pay it,\u2019\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 18 (quoting <em>Skauge v. Mt. Sts. Tel. &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>172 Mont. 521, 524, 565 P.2d 628, 630 (1977)), subrogation involves more than this \u201cdo good\u201d objective. Subrogation is a substitutionary legal action, whereby one party acquires the legal rights of another in exchange for assuming that person\u2019s risk of loss. In the insurance context, it occurs \u201cso that the [insurer] will succeed to the rights of the [insured] in relation to the debt or claim ....\u201d <em>Youngblood, </em>262 Mont. at 395, 866 P.2d at 205. A key component to subrogation is consideration-the insured pays a premium in exchange for the insurer\u2019s assumption of his risk of loss. <em>Thayer v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>1999 MT 304, \u00b6 21, 297 Mont. 179, 991 P.2d 447.</p>\n<p id=\"A0Fa\">\u00b625 On the other hand, exclusions are \u2018insurance-policy provision[s] that except[] certain events or conditions from coverage.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>605 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 8th ed., West 2004). We have held that exclusions \u201cwill be narrowly and strictly construed because they are contrary to the fundamental protective purpose of an insurance policy.\u201d <em>Revelation Indus., Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>350 Mont. 184, 198, 206 P.3d 919, 929 (quoting <em>Wellcome v. Home Ins. Co., </em>257 Mont. 354, 356-57, 849 P.2d 190, 192 (1993)). However, despite the narrow interpretation given to exclusions, under no circumstances should the Court \u201cseize upon certain and definite covenants expressed in plain English with violent hands, and distort them so as to include a risk clearly excluded by the insurance contract.\u201d <em>Newbury v. St. Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. of Bloomington, Ill., </em>2008 MT 156, \u00b6 35, 343 Mont. 279, 184 P.3d 1021 (quoting Mont. <em>Petroleum Tank Release Compen. Bd. v. Crumley\u2019s, Inc., </em>2008 MT 2, \u00b6 35, 341 Mont. 33, 174 P.3d 948).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b626 To delineate the difference between subrogation and exclusions in this case, it is necessary to start with the applicable exclusionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>language in the BCBS policy. Although the Court includes a portion of this language, it does not include the prefatory language to the exclusions. Opinion, \u00b6 8. The complete language is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACHY\">\n<em>EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-3\">\n<em>All Benefits provided under this Contract are subject to the Exclusions and Limitations in this section and as stated under the Benefit Section. Except as otherwise provided in this Contract, The Plan will not pay for ...</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">3. Services, supplies, and medications provided to treat any injury to the extent the Member receives, or would be entitled to receive where liability is reasonably clear, benefits under an automobile insurance policy. Such benefits received by the Member shall be used first to satisfy any remaining Coinsurance, Copayments and Deductibles related to the injury for which claims are submitted to The Plan. The injury related claims must be submitted to The Plan to apply any applicable credit to Coinsurance, Copayments and/or Deductibles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">4. Services, supplies, and medications provided to treat any injury to the extent the Member receives, or would be entitled to receive where liability is reasonably clear, benefits from a premises liability policy. Examples of such policies are a homeowners or business liability policy. Such benefits received by the Member shall be used first to satisfy any remaining Coinsurance, Copayments, and Deductibles related to the injury for which claims are submitted to The Plan. The injury related claims must be submitted to The Plan to apply any applicable credit to Coinsurance, Copayments and/or Deductibles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b627 Nowhere within these exclusions does the word \u201csubrogation\u201d appear, which is why the Commissioner argues that the policy embodies \u201cde facto subrogation.\u201d However, more importantly, these provisions do not even include the <em>concept </em>of subrogation. Despite the Commissioner\u2019s effort to transform the exclusions into de facto subrogation by an \u2018if it looks like a duck\u201d analogy, subrogation arises only when there is a \u201csubstitution of one party for another whose debt the party pays, entitling the paying party to rights, remedies, or securities that would otherwise belong to the debtor.\u201d <em>Thayer, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1440 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999)). Here, subrogation never occurs because BCBS lacks any authority to substitute itself for the insured. BCBS has merely used the freedom of contract to exclude any coverage and thereby refuse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>assume a risk. The provisions are clear and unambiguous: under the proposed policy, BCBS would be contracting with a customer for a single recovery, and basing the customer\u2019s premium thereon. I find it disturbing that the Court, despite its own warning, recently expressed, has acted with \u2018Violent hands ... to include a risk clearly excluded by the insurance contract\u201d and for which BCBS would receive no payment. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 35 (quoting <em>Crumley\u2019s, </em>\u00b6 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b628 Although this Court has not specifically addressed the distinction between subrogation and exclusions, other courts have done so. Georgia law is similar to Montana law, particularly with respect to Georgia\u2019s \u201ccomplete compensation rule\u201d limiting the application of subrogation and reimbursement provisions, which is similar to Montana\u2019s \u201cmade whole\u201d rule. <em>Walker, </em>505 S.E.2d at 830; <em>see also Duncan v. Integon Gen. Ins. Corp., </em>482 S.E.2d 325 (Ga. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b629 In <em>Walker, </em>505 S.E.2d at 829, Demarcus Walker injured himself in an automobile accident, sustaining medical expenses amounting to $10,671.29. The State Farm policy covering Walker provided the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">If the injured person has been paid damages for the bodily injury by or on behalf of the liable party in an amount ... equal to or greater than the total reasonable and necessary medical expenses incurred by the injured person, <em>we owe nothing </em>under this coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\"><em>Walker, </em>505 S.E.2d at 830 (emphasis added). Because Walker settled with Southern General Insurance for $15,000.00, State Farm denied coverage. <em>Walker, </em>505 S.E.2d at 829-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\u00b630 State Farm argued that the coverage exclusion, and not subrogation, relieved it of an obligation to pay Walker. <em>Walker, </em>505 S.E.2d at 830. Walker argued application of the \u201ccomplete compensation rule.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>505 S.E.2d at 830. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\"><em>We agree with State Farm that an exclusion is not synonymous with the concept of subrogation', </em>the exclusion in this case defines or limits the circumstances under which an insurer must provide coverage, while the right of reimbursement is dependent on the existence of coverage and arises only if State Farm pays medical expenses under its coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-10\"><em>Walker, </em>505 S.E.2d at 830 (emphasis added). The Georgia court\u2019s logic is convincing, especially in light of the distinction between subrogation and exclusion already accommodated in Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">\u00b631 The next question is whether the exclusions in the BCBS policy violate Montana\u2019s public policy. Under our law, insurance contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>may include exclusions \u201cwithout violating public policy if the exclusion applies to optional, rather than mandatory, <em>coverage.\u201d Newbury, </em>\u00b6 36 (citing <em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>284 Mont. 372, 380-81, 945 P.2d 32, 37 (1997)). For example, Montana law mandates coverage for \u2018bodily injury of $25,000.00 per person and $50,000.00 per accident, and a liability limit of $10,000.00 for injury to or destruction of <em>property.\u201dNewbury, </em>\u00b6 36 (citing \u00a7\u00a761-6-103(2), 301(1), MCA). Medical payments coverage, however, is optional. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 36. The same is true of the health insurance BCBS offers; it is optional coverage under Montana law. Consequently, the inclusion of medical payments coverage \u2018in an insurance contract is at the sole discretion of the parties to the contract.\u201d <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 36. BCBS has exercised its discretion and right to contract in crafting the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\">\u00b632 Notwithstanding the line <em>Newbury </em>drew between mandatory and optional coverage, the Commissioner attempts to distinguishNezuirary from the case <em>subjudice </em>in two ways. First, the Commissioner argues <em>Newbury </em>only analyzed medical expenses, but BCBS seeks to \u201csubrogate against\u201d much more than medical expenses. Second, the Commissioner argues the health care subrogation statutes are unlike the statutes analyzed under <em>Newbury. </em>However, the Commissioner\u2019s arguments are unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b633 In <em>Newbury, </em>Gerald Newbury, an employee of Montana Highway Maintenance Department, stopped plowing a highway to aid a vehicle in the ditch. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 7. As Newbury approached the vehicle, the driver fled the scene, striking Newbury with the door of her car. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 7. Newbury sustained injuries on the left side of his body, which totaled $18,405.80 in medical expenses. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8. As a result of the injury, Newbury received $17,230.00 in medical expenses from the State Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund). <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 8. Newbury also filed a claim with his two automobile insurance policies, which provided medical payment of $5,000.00 per policy (for a total of $10,000.00) if struck as a pedestrian by a motor vehicle. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10. State Farm paid $1,175.80 in order to cover Newbury\u2019s medical expenses beyond the $17,230.00 provided by State Fund and up to $18,405.80. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 10. State Farm refused to pay the full $10,000.00 under the two policies because each policy stated \u201cthere is no coverage \u2018to the extent workers\u2019 compensation benefits are required to be <em>payable.\u2019\u201dNewbury, </em>\u00b6 9. The Court stated State Farm\u2019s exclusion did not violate public policy because it excluded optional coverage rather than mandatory coverage. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b634 The Commissioner\u2019s arguments for distinguishing <em>Newbury </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>necessarily presume BCBS is in fact engaging in subrogation. Under a proper understanding of subrogation, as articulated above, BCBS is not seeking a right of subrogation. It is of no moment that in <em>Newbury </em>State Farm excluded coverage when workers compensation applied and BCBS now seeks to exclude coverage when automobile insurance or premises liability insurance applies. The ability to exclude within the BCBS policy remains equally as valid as when it was done by State Farm in <em>Newbury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b635 I would reverse the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
