He was sentenced to 30 years in the Montana State Prison with 20 suspended. Berosik raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">\u00b62 Issue 1: Must the judgment be reversed because Berosik was excluded from individual voir dire?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">\u00b63 We conclude that the answer to the question posed by Issue 1 must be \u2018Ves.\u201d Thus, Berosik is entitled to a new trial. Athough we reverse Berosik\u2019s conviction, we deem it appropriate to address other issues, as they are almost certain to arise again upon retrial. <em>See State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, \u00b6 43, 342 Mont. 244, 180 P.3d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">\u00b64 Issue 2: Did the District Court err in determining a child abuse expert was qualified to testify concerning the concept of grooming in child sexual abuse cases?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">\u00b65 Issue 3: Did the District Court err in admitting evidence of prior acts by Berosik?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">\u00b66 Issue 4: Did the District Court err in denying Berosik\u2019s motion to suppress evidence which was gathered by his wife?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">\u00b67 In 1999, Berosik married and began living with Wanda Berosik and her three daughters, R.W., age 9, B.W., age 11, and M.W. age 15. The three girls often accompanied Berosik on his jobs as a truck driver. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>During these trips, Berosik would discuss puberty, make comments about the girls\u2019 bodies, and tell them they were beautiful. Over time, Berosik\u2019s comments became more sexually graphic.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b68 On his trips with B.W., Berosik would talk to her about prostitutes, inquire into her sexual activity, and promote pornography, specifically books dealing with family members having sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b69 When she was 14, B.W. incurred a telephone bill of $400. Berosik told B.W. she could help pay off her debt if she gave him oral sex. B.W. did not respond. When B.W. was 15, Berosik took her to Disneyland. During this trip, Berosik bought B.W. a vibrator and a pair of fuzzy handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b610 R.W. started riding with Berosik in his truck when she was 10. During trips he spoke to her about sex and promoted pornography. One time, Berosik attempted to grab R.W.\u2019s breast. When R.W. was 12, she told Berosik she was curious to see how a man masturbated. Berosik masturbated in front of her. During later trips, Berosik gave R.W. incest pornography. On a trip to Disneyland, R.W. and Berosik stopped at a convenience store where Berosik asked R.W. to get a prostitute for him. She did as she was asked and then went into the store. When she returned, Berosik asked her if she wanted a prostitute and offered to pay for the service. R.W. declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b611 Berosik bought R.W. several gifts. One was a tank top that Berosik told R.W. to wear without a bra. He also bought her a vibrator and a penis-shaped sucker. He later asked her if she used the vibrator.</p>\n<p id=\"AnW\">\u00b612 In March 2005 when she was 15, R.W. began dating a 26-year-old man named Wesley. Berosik began asking her about sexual activity with her boyfriend. While Wanda and Berosik were out of town, M.W. caught R.W. and Wesley together and told Berosik. Berosik told R.W. to go to his brother\u2019s house until he returned. When he picked R.W. up at his brother\u2019s, he told her he would not tell Wanda about Wesley but in return, R.W. would have to \u201cdo [him] a favor.\u201d R.W. testified at trial that she understood this to mean sexual favors because Berosik had requested them before. Berosik told R.W. that to prove she would adhere to the deal, she must take off her shirt and bra. R.W. initially told him no. Berosik then told R.W. that Wesley would have to go to jail if Wanda found out because R.W. was under 16 years old and Wanda would call the police. R.W. took off her shirt and Berosik fondled her breasts. Later that day, Berosik asked R.W. to perform oral sex on him. She said no. Berosik reminded her that Wesley could go to jail. Berosik then masturbated and had R.W. perform oral sex on him. Eventually, R.W. told her mother about Berosik\u2019s actions. Her mother told her that she would tell the police but would wait because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>needed Berosik\u2019s paycheck.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b613 In March 2005, when B.W. was 16, Berosik caught her sneaking out of the house to see her boyfriend. Berosik told B.W. to take off her shirt and bra or he would take the keys to her car. B.W. did as told, leaving her sweater on. Berosik fondled her breasts. Later, Berosik asked B.W. if she ever performed oral sex. She said yes and put Berosik\u2019s penis in her mouth. A couple of nights later, Berosik went into B.W.\u2019s room and fondled her breasts. The next day, Berosik told B.W. that while her mother was away, he wanted to \u2018jump [B.W.\u2019s] bones.\u201d B.W. went with her mother to run errands to avoid Berosik. When she returned, Berosik took her car away.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b614 When Wanda told B.W. about Berosik\u2019s actions with R.W., B.W. revealed Berosik\u2019s sexual contacts with her. Eventually, Wanda told the police Berosik had sexually assaulted her daughters. She also told the police she had searched their home where she found sex toys and books about incest in B.W. and R.W.\u2019s bedrooms. She boxed up these items and put them in storage. The police told Wanda to bring the box to the sheriffs office. Before she brought the items from the storage shed to the sheriffs department, she searched Berosik\u2019s truck and the house again, and found more sexually explicit materials. She delivered all of these items to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b615 In June 2005, the State filed an information charging Berosik with sexual intercourse without consent. The information was later amended to charge three counts of incest. Count I alleged Berosik had oral sex with B.W. Count II alleged he had oral sex with R.W. The offenses were alleged to have occurred in March 2005. Count III was severed and is not a part of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b616 The affidavit in support of the information contained the statements provided by R.W. and B.W. concerning the bargains Berosik had made with them about the alleged incest (that he would turn in R.W.\u2019s boyfriend and take away B.W.\u2019s car if they did not have oral sex with him) and the resulting sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b617 The charges against Berosik were first tried in June 2006. The trial resulted in a hung jury. A second trial was scheduled. Before the second trial, the State filed notice of its intent to introduce other acts evidence pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(b) and/or the transaction rule. The State gave notice that it would seek to introduce into evidence the incest pornography books, fuzzy handcuffs, and vibrators. The State also proposed to introduce the testimony of R.W. and B.W. concerning the prior sexual contacts and suggestive comments Berosik made to them. The State asserted this evidence was a part of the incest transactions as it proved that Berosik was grooming the girls so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>make it easier for him to later sexually assault them. The State also proposed to introduce expert testimony to assist the jury in understanding the concept of grooming, which the State avers is grounded in sound research.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b618 Berosik moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the physical and testimonial evidence of grooming as inadmissible character evidence because the acts were remote in time and did not fall within the exceptions of M. R. Evid. 404(b). He also moved to exclude the expert testimony, claiming the expert was not qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b619 Berosik also filed a motion to suppress the evidence gathered by his wife Wanda. Berosik argues that Wanda acted as an agent of the State when she searched his home and, because the police failed to obtain a search warrant, the items were illegally seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b620 The District Court denied all of Berosik\u2019s motions to exclude evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b621 A second jury trial was held in March 2007. The District Court determined it would conduct individual voir dire of venirepersons who had personal experience with child or sexual abuse. Berosik claims on appeal he was excluded from the individual voir dire conducted in the judge\u2019s chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b622 During the trial, before ruling on Berosik\u2019s motion to exclude grooming evidence, the court heard the testimony of the State\u2019s proposed child abuse specialist outside the presence of the jury. After hearing the witness\u2019s testimony, the District Court either admitted or excluded each part of the proposed prior acts evidence listed in the State\u2019s notification. The District Court based its decisions on whether the evidence went to show grooming, which the court considered as included as part of the transaction of the charged incest, or whether it fit under an exception to M. R. Evid. 404(b). In a few instances, the District Court concluded the evidence was admissible under both rules.</p>\n<p id=\"AiT\">\u00b623 The District Court allowed testimony regarding Berosik\u2019s prior comments about prostitutes; Berosik masturbating in front of R.W. in 2001; Berosik\u2019s discussions about puberty, the girls\u2019 bodies, their sexual activity, pornography and sex; his distribution of pornography; Berosik\u2019s proposition in 2003 that B.W. perform oral sex to pay off her debt for the phone bill; Berosik\u2019s statements that he would like to \u201cmake love to\u201d R.W. and that B.W. was to \u2018jump [his] bones\u201d; Berosik fondling B.W. and R.W.; Berosik\u2019s mandate that the doors to R.W. and B.W.\u2019s bedrooms not be locked; and Berosik\u2019s request to Wanda that their bedroom remain open while they had sexual intercourse while the girls were present in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u00b624 The District Court ruled that the physical evidence-incest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>pornography books, fuzzy handcuffs, and a vibrator-would not be admitted into evidence because it was too prejudicial. However, the District Court ruled that the girls could testify about what they got, what they saw, what they perceived, what their impression was, and how it affected them.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b625 The State\u2019s expert witness then testified before the jury on the general characteristics of grooming a child for sexual abuse. As a part of her testimony, she stated she did not express an opinion on Berosik\u2019s or any witnesses\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b626 The jury found Berosik guilty of both counts of incest. The District Court sentenced him as noted above, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b627 Whether a district court has violated a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at all critical stages of the defendant\u2019s trial is a constitutional matter, thus our review is plenary. <em>State v. Price, </em>2009 MT 129, \u00b6 19, 350 Mont. 272, 207 P.3d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u00b628 Rulings regarding the admissibility of evidence are left to the sound discretion of the trial court, and will not be overturned absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bar-Jonah, </em>2004 MT 344, \u00b6 97, 324 Mont. 278, 102 P.3d 1229; <em>State v. Ford, </em>278 Mont. 353, 361, 296 P.2d 245, 249-50. The abuse of discretion standard also applies in reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision whether to admit evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts. <em>See State v. Crosley, </em>2009 MT 126, \u00b6 26, 350 Mont. 223, 206 P.3d 932; <em>Bar-Jonah, </em>\u00b6 97; <em>State v. Aakre, </em>2002 MT 101, \u00b6 8, 309 Mont. 403, 46 P.3d 648 (concerning admission of evidence of other acts of a defendant under M. R. Evid. 404(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b629 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether the court correctly applied those facts as a matter of law. <em>State v. Hilgendorf, </em>2009 MT 158, \u00b6 11, 350 Mont. 412, 208 P.3d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">\u00b630 <em>Issue 1: Must the judgment be reversed because Berosik was excluded from individual voir dire?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">\u00b631 Berosik asserts on appeal that he was not present during the individual, in-chambers voir dire. The record does not reflect whether Berosik was present when the court examined potential jurors in chambers. The trial transcript shows that the district judge announced individual voir dire would be held in chambers and then said, \u2018We will meet with counsel in [chambers] one at a time.\u201d The minutes of the Clerk of Court do not indicate that Berosik was present. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>offers nothing to rebut Berosik\u2019s claim he was not present during the individual, in-chambers voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b632 A defendant\u2019s right to be present during all stages of a criminal prosecution is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Montana and United States Constitutions. <em>State v. Bird, </em>2001 MT 2, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 308 Mont. 75, 43 P.3d 266. A defendant has the right to be present during critical stages of the proceeding and at all times during the trial when something is done which affects his right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Reed, </em>65 Mont. 51, 56-57, 210 P. 756, 757 (1922). Conducting individual v\u00f3ir dire in chambers is a critical stage of the trial. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 28. Because errors involving jury selection affect the fairness of the trial, excluding a defendant from in-chambers voir dire absent an express waiver on the record is structural error, which requires reversal. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39-40.</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">\u00b633  The record does not show that Berosik was present during the in-chambers voir dire. The parties do not dispute that Berosik did not waive his presence. Applicable precedent instructs that Berosik\u2019s exclusion from chambers during individual voir dire constituted structural error. The conviction must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b634 <em>Issue 2: Did the District Court err in determining the child abuse expert was qualified to give her opinion ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b635 Berosik asserts that the District Court \u00aberred in allowing the State\u2019s child abuse expert to testify because she did not have extensive first hand experience with sexually and non-sexually abused children, did not have a thorough and up-to-date knowledge of the professional literature on child sexual abuse, and was not objective and neutral about this case. <em>See State v. Scheffelman, </em>250 Mont. 334, 342, 820 P.2d 1293, 1298 (1991); <em>State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, \u00b6 27, 327 Mont. 196, 113 P.3d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b636  The record reveals that the State\u2019s expert is a licensed marriage and family counselor with a Master\u2019s degree and she has commenced a dissertation on disclosure of child sexual abuse. She has extensive experience in working with those convicted of offenses involving sexual aggression, providing sex offender treatment to both adults and juveniles, and providing family and group counseling to those dealing with sex offenses as well as persons dealing with nonsexual child abuse. She has conducted thousands of forensic interviews and testified as an expert in several states, including Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u00b637 After examination of the record we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the expert to present her opinions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u00b638 <em>Issue 3: Did the District Court err in admitting evidence of prior acts by Berosik?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b639 The State\u2019s expert witness described the characteristics of what constitutes the grooming of potential child victims of sexual abuse. The District Court then allowed the complaining witnesses, B.W., R.W., and others, to testify about prior acts of Berosik, which occurred over the course of the several years of his relationship with the victims. The District Court ruled these prior acts were evidence that Berosik was grooming his intended child victims, and thus were a part of the transactions the State sought to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b640 On appeal, Berosik contends the expert testimony on grooming was improperly admitted as it is not relevant under M. R. Evid. 401, and is highly prejudicial profiling evidence which should be excluded pursuant to M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b641 In Montana, expert testimony explaining the complexities of child sexual abuse for the purpose of assisting jurors in understanding and evaluating a child\u2019s testimony is admissible. <em>State v. Morgan, </em>1998 MT 268, \u00b6 29, 291 Mont. 347, 968 P.2d 1120; <em>State v. Donnelly, </em>244 Mont. 371, 378, 798 P.2d 89, 93 (1990), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Imlay, </em>249 Mont. 82, 91, 813 P.2d 979, 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b642 The testimony of the State\u2019s expert witness gave general information about grooming; that is, the process of eroding a victim\u2019s \u2022boundaries to physical touch and desensitizing them to sexual issues. Her testimony concerned a subject about which lay persons would have little or no experience. She based her opinions on her experiences and research in the field. The expert testimony is relevant in that it provided the jury with information about how research and experience shows abuse of a child oftentimes does not occur all of a sudden. It provided evidence that young victims sometimes delay in disclosing abuse, disclose the abuse piecemeal, and described how they react to having been sexually abused. Berosik\u2019s defense was that Wanda and her daughters fabricated their allegations against him because they wanted to be rid of him for taking away the daughters\u2019 new-found freedom and because he was going to expose consensual sex with a boyfriend, which would result in criminal charges against him. In the face of this defense, a jury could conclude the evidence is probative in judging the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses, including B.W. and R.W, and the decision whether the charges had, or had not, been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u00b643 In deciding the admissibility of evidence of other acts of a defendant, a district court must weigh whether the evidence\u2019s probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, a waste of time, or is needless presentation of cumulative evidence. M. R. Evid. 403; <em>State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 142, 814 P.2d 52, 56 (1991). The evidence in this case concerning whether Berosik groomed B.W. and R.W. for sexual abuse, as well as whether Berosik committed the specific acts of incest alleged, is not so prejudicial that it is unfair. He has the opportunity to rebut such evidence. Nor is it confusing or misleading. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting such evidence under M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b644 The State argues that the evidence of prior sexual activity between Berosik and his stepdaughters, which occurred before the charged offenses, is part of the transaction of the alleged incest, and can be properly admitted as a part of the transaction under \u00a726-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b645 Section 26-1-103, MCA, provides that prior acts of an accused may be admissible as a part of an alleged criminal transaction when those acts form part of the transaction which is itself the fact in dispute, or if they are evidence of that fact. Generally, admissibility under the transaction rule is predicated on the jury\u2019s right to hear what happened prior to the alleged offense, so that it may evaluate the evidence in the context in which the alleged criminal act occurred. <em>See State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 29, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. To be admissible under the transaction rule, evidence must be explanatory of the charged offense. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 36. Evidence of acts admitted under \u00a726-1-103, MCA, is not character evidence excluded by M. R. Evid. 404(b). Likewise, such evidence is not subject to the notice and other requirements of \u00a746-13-109, MCA, because the acts are considered to be part of the transaction and not wholly independent of the alleged offense. <em>Crosley, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b646 The transaction rule must not be expanded to the point that the prohibition of character evidence under M. R. Evid. 404(b) is swallowed. <em>See Crosley, </em>\u00b6 67 (Nelson &amp; Cotter, JJ., specially concurring). To this end, if evidence of prior acts is to be admitted as a part of the alleged offense, such other acts of the accused are to be linked to, and explanatory of, the charged offense. <em>Crosley, </em>\u00b6 48 (citing <em>State v. Lozon, </em>2004 MT 34, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 26, 85 P.3d 753).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b647  In this case, like in <em>Crosley, </em>the evidence of Berosik\u2019s sexually charged conversations, transactions and contacts with his victims, as described in \u00b6 22 and \u00b6 23 above, were closely linked to and explanatory of the charges. Berosik\u2019s sexualization of his stepdaughters began shortly after he married their mother and continued up to the time the charged incest was reported. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>evidence of Berosik\u2019s escalating sexual acts with these children form a part of the transactions in dispute and are admissible under \u00a726-1-103, MCA. <em>See Crosley, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b648 <em>Issue 4: Did the District Court err in denying Berosik\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence gathered by Berosik\u2019s </em>wife?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b649 Berosik contends that a sheriff s deputy requested Wanda to bring in the items she gathered in her home and Berosik\u2019s truck, and thus, she acted as an agent of the State. As no search warrant was issued, Berosik asserts the search of the home and truck and the seizure of these items is illegal, thus evidence of their existence must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b650 The exclusionary rule does not apply to private searches that do not involve state action, as it does not serve to deter private individuals from engaging in searches that would be illegal if conducted by law enforcement. <em>State v. Malkuch, </em>2007 MT 60, \u00b6 13, 336 Mont. 219, 154 P.3d 558 (citing <em>State v. Long, </em>216 Mont. 65, 71, 700 P.2d 153, 157 (1985); <em>State v. Christensen, </em>244 Mont. 312, 319, 797 P.2d 893, 897 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u00b651  Wanda and her daughter had already seized the books and sex toys and removed them from the home before they contacted law enforcement. And, though the sheriffs deputy requested that Wanda bring these items in, he did not ask her to seize more items from the home, nor did he suggest to her that Berosik\u2019s truck be searched. The District Court correctly concluded that the actions of Wanda and her oldest daughter were private searches neither requested nor agreed to by law enforcement, and therefore the evidence obtained is not subject to the exclusionary rule. <em>See Malkuch, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u00b652 The judgment of the District Court is reversed and remanded for a new trial conducted in conformity with applicable law and this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b51-10\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b51-11\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Ac\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">\u00b653 I join the Court\u2019s Opinion on Issues 1 and 2. In particular, as to Issue 1, I agree that errors involving jury selection are structural errors which require automatic reversal. Opinion, \u00b6 32; <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 40, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244. But I specially concur as to Issues 3 and 4. In addition, I note, as a preliminary matter, that the Court\u2019s statement of the standard of review is incorrect, or at least incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b654 The Court states that \u201c[t]he abuse of discretion standard also applies in reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision whether to admit evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts\u201d under M. R. Evid. 404(b). Opinion, \u00b6 28; <em>accord State v. Campa, </em>2009 MT 251, \u00b6 15, 351 Mont. 504, 213 P.3d 1102. It is true, and we have often stated, that a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See e.g. State v. Crosley, </em>2009 MT 126, \u00b6 26, 350 Mont. 223, 206 P.3d 932; <em>State v. Herman, </em>2009 MT 101, \u00b6 19, 350 Mont. 109, 204 P.3d 1254; <em>State v. Clark, </em>2008 MT 419, \u00b6 13, 347 Mont. 354, 198 P.3d 809; <em>State v. Stearns, </em>2008 MT 356, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 348, 195 P.3d 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b655 But there is no \u201cdiscretion\u201d in properly interpreting a statute or rule of evidence. <em>See State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458; <em>Hagener v. Wallace, </em>2002 MT 109, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 473, 47 P.3d 847. The court\u2019s interpretation is either correct or incorrect. <em>Cf. State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 326, 160 P.3d 511 (\u2018There either is, or is not, sufficient evidence to convict, and the determination is not a matter of discretion.\u2019). Indeed, it is beyond cavil that the interpretation of a statute or rule constitutes a conclusion of law, which we review de novo. <em>See State v. Dunning, </em>2008 MT 427, \u00b6 22, 347 Mont. 443, 198 P.3d 828; <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d 819; <em>Miller v. District Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 22, 337 Mont. 488, 162 P.3d 121; <em>Faulconbridge v. State, </em>2006 MT 198, \u00b6\u00b6 46-57, 333 Mont. 186, 142 P.3d 777; <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b656 Accordingly, we have stated-^epeatedly-fitiat to the extent a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is based on the interpretation of a statute or rule, our review is de novo. <em>See State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811; <em>State v. Mackrill, </em>2008 MT 297, \u00b6 37, 345 Mont. 469, 191 P.3d 451; <em>State v. Bomar, </em>2008 MT 91, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 281, 182 P.3d 47; <em>State v. Gittens, </em>2008 MT 55, \u00b6 10, 341 Mont. 450, 178 P.3d 91; <em>State v.

Incashola, </em>1998 MT 184, \u00b6 9, 289 Mont. 399, 961 P.2d 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b657 Here, the evidentiary rulings at issue were based on the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a726-1-103, MCA, and M. R. Evid. 404(b); i.e., they were based on conclusions of law. Our review of those rulings, therefore, is plenary. <em>Bomar, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b658 With respect to Issue 3,1 completely agree with the Court that the transaction rule<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cmust not be expanded to the point that the prohibition of character evidence under M. R. Evid. 404(b) is swallowed.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 46.1 believe that here, however, Berosik\u2019s prior acts (e.g., the sexually charged conversations and contacts with his stepdaughters) during the years preceding the charged offenses do not \u201cform[ ] part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute.\u201d Section 26-1-103, MCA. The \u201ctransaction which is itself the fact in dispute\u201d is whether Berosik had sexual intercourse with B.W. and R.W. in March 2005. Section 45-5-507(1), MCA (defining incest). None of those earlier events form part of this alleged transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b659 Likewise, evidence of Berosik\u2019s prior acts is not \u201cevidence of [the fact in dispute].\u201d Section 26-1-103, MCA. Berosik could be guilty of having sexual intercourse with his stepdaughters in March 2005 irrespective of whether he committed the prior acts. In other words, the prior sexually charged conversations and contacts with his stepdaughters are in no way \u201c\u2018inextricably linked to\u2019 \u2019\u2019the question of whether he had sexual intercourse with the girls in March 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Crosley, </em>\u00b6 48 (quoting <em>State v. Lozon, </em>2004 MT 34, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 26, 85 P.3d 753).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b660 For these reasons, I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s reliance on the transaction rule, and I fear that we are again reading \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, more broadly than its language allows, contrary to the first maxim of statutory interpretation: \u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The State did not charge a continuing course of conduct. It charged two specific instances of conduct alleged to have occurred in March 2005. Berosik\u2019s sexually charged conversations and contacts with his stepdaughters at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>other times and places simply do not \u201cform! ] part of\u2019the instances of sexual contact in March 2005. Section 26-1-103, MCA. The maverick Pac-Man has blipped to yet another case. <em>Crosley, </em>\u00b6 67 (Nelson &amp; Cotter, JJ., specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b661 This is not to say that evidence of Berosik\u2019s prior acts is per se irrelevant or inadmissible. To the contrary, I believe that the evidence of \u201cgrooming\u201d proffered by the State in this case was probative of his guilt. But for the reasons stated above, I must disagree with the Court that such evidence is admissible because it \u2018forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact.\u201d Section 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b662 In its Notice of Intent to Introduce Other Acts Evidence Pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(b) and/or the \u2018Transaction Rule,\u201d the State argued a \u201ccomplete the story\u201drationale for admitting the evidence of Berosik\u2019s prior acts under the transaction rule. Yet, a \u201ccomplete the story\u201d or \u201cexplain the circumstances\u201d definition of the transaction rule threatens to override M. R. Evid. 404(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">A defendant\u2019s bad act may be only tangentially related to the charged crime, but it nevertheless could \u201ccomplete the story\u201d or \u2018incidentally involve\u201d the charged offense or \u201cexplain the circumstances.\u201d If the prosecution\u2019s evidence did not \u201cexplain\u201d or \u2018incidentally involve\u201d the charged crime, it is difficult to see how it could pass the minimal requirement for admissibility that evidence be relevant. . . . [A]ll relevant prosecution evidence explains the crime or completes the story. The fact that omitting some evidence would render a story slightly less complete cannot justify circumventing Rule 404(b) altogether. Moreover, evidence necessary to complete a story-for instance by furnishing a motive or establishing identity-typically has a non-propensity purpose and is admissible under Rule 404(b). We see no reason to relieve the government and the district court from the obligation of selecting from the myriad of non-propensity purposes available to complete most any story.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\"><em>United States v. Bowie, </em>232 F.3d 923, 928-29 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (paragraph break omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u00b663 In my view, therefore, the correct approach is to analyze the admissibility of the evidence of Berosik\u2019s prior acts pursuant to Rule 404(b), which the prosecutor did as an alternative ground for introducing the evidence. In this regard, while I do not conduct here a comprehensive analysis under Rule 404(b), I tend to agree -with the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the evidence of Berosik\u2019s grooming of his stepdaughters may constitute \u201cpreparation\u201d under Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Issue 4</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b664 I concur in the result of Issue 4 based on the caselaw cited in \u00b6 50 and the facts discussed in \u00b6 51. Importantly, Berosik has failed to present a persuasive argument on appeal that Wanda lacked authority to search for and seize evidence from Berosik\u2019s truck. Moreover, Berosik has no standing to prevent Wanda from seizing and turning over to law enforcement the various sex toys and \u201cgifts\u201d which he gave to the girls. Those items belonged to them and were no longer his. <em>See State v. 1993 Chevrolet Pickup, </em>2005 MT 180, \u00b6\u00b6 14-17, 328 Mont. 10, 116 P.3d 800 (once a person voluntarily relinquishes or intentionally abandons his property, his expectation of privacy in that property is abandoned as well). Finally, Berosik fails to argue effectively that private searches violate Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution and, therefore, that the exclusionary should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b665 On the foregoing basis, I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\"> \u201cWhere the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d Section 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b53-8\"> The Court omits the critical qualifier \u2018inextricably\u201d and inserts a new qualifier: \u201cclosely.\u201d <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 47 (\u2018[T]he evidence of Berosik\u2019s [prior acts] . . . were closely linked to and explanatory of the charges.\u2019). Yet, while our transaction-rule jurisprudence is far from a model of clarity, we have at least been consistent in requiring that the evidence be \u2018inextricably\u201d or \u2018inseparably\u201d linked to the charged offense, not merely \u201cclosely\u201d linked. <em>See Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32; <em>see also Crosley, </em>\u00b6 71 (Nelson &amp; Cotter, JJ., specially concurring), and cases cited therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
