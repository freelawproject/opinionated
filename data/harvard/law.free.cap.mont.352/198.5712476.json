Jenny was 20 and Bobby was 35 at the time of the marriage. The parties have three minor children born in 1993,1995, and 1998. Jenny filed a petition for dissolution of marriage on September 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">\u00b68 Jenny and Bobby have high school educations. During the marriage, Jenny stayed at home and served as the primary caregiver for the three children. Bobby worked long hours outside the home in the family trucking business.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">\u00b69 J.E. Williams, Bobby s father, began his own trucking business under the name of J.E. Williams Trucking, Inc. in 1969. Bobby began working in the business at a young age. Bobby started working as a full-time employee of J.E. Williams Trucking, Inc. when he graduated from high school in 1977. J.E. Williams began giving Bobby stock in J.E. Williams Trucking, Inc. in 1982. Bobby became the sole shareholder of J.E. Williams Trucking, Inc. in 2000, after the company redeemed all of J.E. Williams\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u00b610 Bobby and his father also each owned one-half interests in WHW, Inc., and J.E. Williams, Inc. WHW, Inc. is a trucking company that hauls a different type of cargo that requires specialized trucks. J.E. Williams, Inc. handles the payroll for shop mechanics, owns only a few trucks, and has no customers other than J.E. Williams Trucking, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"APq\">\u00b611 J.E. Williams Trucking, Inc. and WHW, Inc. formed and were capitalized before the marriage. J.E. Williams, Inc. split off from J.E. Williams Trucking, Inc. after Jenny and Bobby had married. Bobby s interest in the entities derives from the interest in J.E. Williams Trucking, Inc. that his father originally gifted to him. Bobby manages all three entities. All three entities operate out of the same location.</p>\n<p id=\"A7t\">\u00b612 Bobby also received income from B&amp;J Properties, LLC (B&amp;J). The income that Bobby received from B&amp;J boosted his yearly taxable income to at least $200,000 to $300,000. B&amp;J is a closely held corporation owned 50% by Bobby and 50% by his father. Bobby and his father formed B&amp;J, a real estate holding company, in 1995. B&amp;J owned five commercial real estate properties around the country and two commercial airplane hangers in Billings.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b613 The District Court included B&amp;J in the marital estate. The court reduced Bobby\u2019s income for child support calculation purposes, however, to reflect the fact that B&amp;J was a sub-chapter S corporation and Bobby, as a 50% owner, could not require B&amp;J to pay out income. The court also discounted the value of Bobby\u2019s interest in B&amp;J by 35% to account for Bobby\u2019s lack of control over the business due to his undivided 50% interest. The District Court counted against Jenny in its property apportionment both the net proceeds of a retirement account that she cashed out after the parties\u2019 separation and the equity in a house that she bought using the retirement account proceeds as a down payment. Jenny appeals and Bobby cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s distribution of marital property and child support award to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>Bock v. Smith, </em>2005 MT 40, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 123, 107 P.3d 488. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Bock, </em>\u00b6 14. Absent clearly erroneous findings, we will affirm the district court unless we identify an abuse of discretion. <em>Bock, </em>\u00b6 14. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or so exceeds the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice. <em>In re Marriage of Crilly, </em>2005 MT 311, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 479, 124 P.3d 1151. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>In re Marriage of Bartsch, </em>2007 MT 136, \u00b6 9, 337 Mont. 386, 162 P.3d 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court incorrectly include Bobby\u2019s interest in B&amp;J Properties in the marital estate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b616 Section 40-4-202(1), MCA, governs a district court\u2019s division of property in a marital dissolution. The district court shall \u201cequitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title ... is in the name of the husband or wife or both.\u201d Section 40-4-202(1), MCA. The district court must consider many factors in its apportionment, including the duration of the marriage, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties; custodial provisions; whether the apportionment is in lieu of or in addition to maintenance; and the opportunity of each party for future acquisition of capital assets and income. Section40-4-202(1), MCA. The court also shall consider the contribution of a spouse as a homemaker or to the family unit. Section 40-4-202(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b617 Section 40-4-202(1), MCA, also governs the court\u2019s equitable distribution of property acquired prior to the marriage or property acquired in exchange for property acquired before the marriage. For prior acquired property, the court shall consider the contributions of the other spouse to the marriage, including: (a) the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker; (b) the extent to which such contributions have facilitated the maintenance of this property; and (c) whether the property division serves as an alternative to maintenance arrangements. Section 40-4-202(l)(a)-(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\u00b618 Bobby argues that his interest in B&amp;J constitutes prior acquired property, as it was \u201ctraceable exclusively to the premarital entity Williams Enterprises.\u201d Bobby contends that B&amp;J \u201cwas capitalized solely with monies from Williams Enterprises and $50,000 each from Bobby and [J.E.] Williams from prior savings.\u201d The District Court acknowledged that most of the business properties \u201cfind their genesis in J.E. Williams, Mr. Williams\u2019 dad,\u201d and \u201csignificantly pre-date[] the marriage.\u201d The court noted that \u201cB&amp;J, however, came into existence shortly after the marriage.\u201d The court included as apportionable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>property the B&amp;J properties outside of Billings and acquired during the marriage \u201cgiven M.C.A. 40-4-202 considerations and the fact that the marital home secures a line of credit which paid at least some of the taxes passed through to Mr. Williams\u201d from B&amp;J.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b619 The District Court determined that the Billings properties constituted a pre-marital asset for Bobby. Jenny does not challenge the District Court\u2019s decision to exclude the B&amp;J properties in Billings from the marital estate. Bobby challenges the court\u2019s decision to include any portion of the B&amp;J properties in the marital estate. As a result, for the purposes of this opinion, we will refer to those B&amp;J properties that the court included in the marital estate simply as B&amp;J.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b620 Bobby conceded that, according to tax returns, B&amp;J officially came into existence on January 9,1995, six months after the marriage. B&amp;J acquired during the marriage all of the properties that the court included in the marital estate. Bobby testified that during the marriage he personally had guaranteed the loans that he and his dad used to acquire the B&amp;J properties. Substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s determination that B&amp;J was not prior acquired property. <em>Bock, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b621 Bobby insists that the court abused its discretion when it apportioned part of B&amp;J to Jenny, because \u201cJenny Williams put no money into B&amp;J properties, nor did she provide any labor, services, or contributions of any kind whatsoever to its preservation, maintenance, operation, management, or acquisition.\u201dBobby emphasizes that Jenny \u2018testified at trial that she didn\u2019t even know about B&amp;J properties until the divorce proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b622 The District Court possessed \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in its equitable apportionment of the Williams\u2019s property. <em>Bartsch, </em>\u00b6 9. The District Court properly considered the applicable statutory factors in equitably dividing the Williams\u2019s property. Section 40-4-202(1), MCA. The court concluded that a number of factors argued toward apportioning to Jenny an equitable share of the property. The court noted that Bobby was a successful businessman, and that Jenny had \u201ca high school education, has never worked outside the home, has few vocational skills, is not particularly employable and has virtually no estate outside this marriage.\u201d The court stated that Jenny\u2019s role as homemaker had \u2018facilitated the maintenance of property by enabling [Bobby] to concentrate on business.\u201d The court emphasized that it intended \u2018to set aside the property in lieu of maintenance.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a740-4-202(1), MCA. Substantial credible evidence supports the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>decision to include B&amp;J properties in its equitable apportionment of the couple\u2019s property. <em>Bock, </em>\u00b6 14; \u00a740-4-202(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b623 Moreover, the District Court properly could include B&amp;J in the marital estate even if B&amp;J constituted pre-marital property. Section 40-4-202(l)(c), MCA, \u201cmakes clear [that] pre-acquired property can be distributed to a non-acquiring spouse <em>in lieu of maintenance, </em>regardless of whether she contributed to its increase in value, if \u2018the property division serves as an alternative to maintenance arrangements.\u2019 <em>\u201d In re Marriage of Rolf, </em>2003 MT 194, \u00b6 22, 316 Mont. 517, 75 P.3d 770 (emphasis in original). The district court must state clearly its intent to award the property in lieu of maintenance and make necessary findings supporting an award of maintenance. <em>Rolf, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b624  The District Court emphasized that it \u201cintend[ed] to set aside property to Ms. Williams in lieu of maintenance.\u201d The District Court properly considered the factors delineated in \u00a7 40-4-203, MCA, in determining maintenance awards. The District Court\u2019s decision to include B&amp;J in the marital property was not clearly erroneous. <em>Bock, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b625 <em>Did the District Court improperly reduce Bobby\u2019s income for the calculation of child support based on the fact that Bobby derived a portion of his income from B&amp;J </em>Properties?</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b626 Jenny argues that the District Court improperly reduced Bobby\u2019s child support obligation to reflect the portion of Bobby s income derived from B&amp;J. The court recognized that Bobby had \u2018pearly taxable income from B&amp;J that runs his taxable income up to $200,000 to $300,000 or greater.\u201d The court noted, however, that B&amp;J was a sub-chapter S corporation and stated that because Bobby was a 50% owner, he could \u2018hot require or force B&amp;J to pay out the income on which he is taxed and to date B&amp;J has paid very little to the owners.\u201d The court added that \u201cof course, when and if B&amp;J pays out income on a regular basis, child support may be recalculated.\u201d The court opined that the \u201cchild support guidelines do not contemplate including passive, taxable but not received, not spendable income which the recipient does not control.\u201d The District Court determined that Bobby should pay $1000 per month in child support, based upon $110,000 as Bobby\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">\u00b627 Section 40-4-204, MCA, governs a district court\u2019s resolution of child support issues. The district court must use the guidelines in all cases unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that applying the guidelines would be unjust to the child or the parties. Section 40-4-204(3)(a), MCA; <em>In re Marriage of Albinger, </em>2002 MT 104, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 437, 47 P.3d 820. If the court finds that the guideline amount is unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, it must state its reasons for the record. Section 40-4-204(3)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b628 Admin. R. M. 37.62.106 guides the court in determining income for child support purposes. Income for child support includes actual income, imputed income, or any combination thereof that fairly reflects a parent\u2019s resources available for child support. Admin. R. M. 37.62.106(1). Actual income includes \u201ceconomic benefit from whatever source derived,\u201d including, but not limited to, income from salaries, wages, earnings, profits, dividends, and pensions. Admin. R. M. 37.62.106(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b629 Bobby points to <em>Gray v. Gray, </em>242 Mont. 69, 788 P.2d 909 (1990), to support his contention that his income from B&amp;J did not constitute actual available disposable income. The wife in <em>Gray </em>argued that the district court improperly had failed to consider for child support calculation purposes certain income that the husband had declined to report on his tax returns. The income consisted of employment benefits, the value of unsold grain, and wages from driving a truck. <em>Gray, </em>242 Mont. at 72, 788 P.2d at 911. This Court determined that the district court had abused its discretion when it did not include the income in the child support formula. <em>Gray, </em>242 Mont. at 72, 788 P.2d at 911. The Court stated that when determining income under the guidelines, fit is disposable income of the parent, and not their income tax returns alone, which must be considered by the Court.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>242 Mont. at 73, 788 P.2d at 912. The Court emphasized that the district court \u201cshould have looked beyond the tax returns,\u201d although \u201ctax returns are a valuable tool in the determination of the child support.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>242 Mont. at 75, 788 P.2d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b630 The husband <em>xa. Albrecht v. Albrecht, </em>2002 MT 227, 311 Mont. 412, 56 P.3d 339, deducted a number of business expenses on his tax return. The district court disregarded the tax return as evidence of the husband\u2019s income. <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 5. The district court noted \u201cthe tendency of taxpayers to minimize income to avoid tax liability.\u201d <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 16. This Court concluded that the district court was not required to accept the tax returns as verification of income. <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 18. The \u201cparent\u2019s disposable income rather than taxable income\u201d constitutes the income with which a court is concerned for child support purposes. <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 17. The Court pointed to evidence indicating that the husband\u2019s tax returns were unreliable for child support purposes due to the aggressive manner in which he had deducted the expenses and the commingling of personal and business expenses. <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u00b631 A district court must determine income for child support purposes \u2018in a realistic manner, taking into account the actual situation of the parties.\u201d <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 7. In <em>Gray </em>and <em>Albrecht, </em>the parent\u2019s taxable income was lower than their actual disposable income due either to the omission of income from the tax returns or to overly aggressive deductions. <em>Gray, </em>242 Mont. at 72, 788 P.2d at 911; <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Bobby attempts to apply the principle from <em>Gray </em>and <em>Albrecht </em>to a distinguishable situation. Bobby claims that his taxable income was much higher than his actual disposable income. The record indicates that Bobby and his father chose to spend B&amp;J\u2019s income on items other than dividends. B&amp;J maintained a private plane. Bobby used $200,000 in B&amp;J funds to buy a condominium in Arizona. Bobby and his father also paid down B&amp;J\u2019s debt by nearly $400,000 each year. This decision to pay down B&amp;J\u2019s debt essentially increased Bobby\u2019s net worth by approximately $200,000 each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b632 This Court faced situations in <em>Gray </em>and <em>Albrecht </em>where the parents manipulated their tax returns to minimize tax liability by underreporting income or aggressively deducting expenses. <em>Gray, </em>242 Mont. at 72, 788 P.2d at 911; <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-5. The Court recognized that a trial court should consider disposable income rather than taxable income in order to determine income realistically for child support purposes. <em>Gray, </em>242 Mont. at 73, 788 P.2d at 912; <em>Albrecht, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b633  The closely held corporation also presents a situation susceptible to substantial manipulation. In the case of a closely held corporation, however, a court\u2019s failure to consider taxable income increases the possibility of manipulation. The District Court decided not to include Bobbys taxable income from B&amp;J as child support income because B&amp;J did not have to pay out money to Bobby. B&amp;J instead could use the money for other purposes, including paying down its debt or reinvesting in the corporation. The court then tied any future decision by B&amp;J to pay out income with a corresponding increase in Bobbys child support obligation. The District Court\u2019s decision provides Bobby and his father with substantial incentive to spend B&amp;J\u2019s income on anything other than dividends. The District Court on remand should use Bobby\u2019s tax returns, B&amp;J\u2019s financial statements, and any other relevant information to determine objectively Bobbys income for child support purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b634 <em>Did the District Court improperly discount by 35% the value of Bobby\u2019s interest in B&amp;J for the purposes of the distribution of marital property in order to reflect Bobby\u2019s lack of control in B&amp;J </em>Properties?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u00b635 The District Court determined that the portion of the B&amp;J properties subject to apportionment had \u201ca net value of $3,360,930 and Mr. Williams\u2019 50% interest is $l,680,465.\u201dThe court reduced the value of Bobby\u2019s interest by 35%, however, \u2018to reach an equitable value for apportionment.\u201d The court emphasized that Bobby had an undivided 50% interest and lack[ed] enough control to operate the business without the concurrence of his dad.\u201d The court noted that \u201ca non-controlling interest in a family business is not saleable at face value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"As2\">\u00b636 Jenny relies on <em>Buxbaum v. Buxbaum, </em>214 Mont. 1, 8, 692 P.2d 411, 414 (1984), to support her argument that \u201cdiscounting for lack of control is not allowed when the underlying valuation is asset-based.\u201d Jenny contends that this Court \u2018has steadfastly followed this rule without any apparent exception.\u201d Bobby \u201crecognize[s] that this precedent exists in Montana,\u201d and concedes that \u201cperhaps the court\u2019s rationale ... was phrased inartfully.\u201d Bobby argues that the court simply used its equitable powers to lower the value of B&amp;J subject to apportionment rather than determine a value and equitably distribute that amount. <em>See Bartsch, </em>\u00b6 9; \u00a740-4-202(1), MCA. Bobby notes that Tt]he court could have stated that 65% [of B&amp;J] was included in the marital estate or simply concluded that Jenny was entitled to the value of 32.5% of the value of Bobby\u2019s interest\u201d in B&amp;J.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b637 This Court has condoned discounting when the trial court estimated the market value of the stock because there was no market value on which to rely. <em>See Buxbaum, </em>214 Mont. at 8, 692 P.2d at 414; <em>see also In re Marriage of Johnston, </em>223 Mont 383, 726 P.2d 322 (1986). A review of this precedent makes it clear, however, that lack of a reliable market value merely represents one consideration in a court\u2019s determination of whether it should discount a parties\u2019 interest in a closely held corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b638 The wife in In <em>re Milesnick, </em>235 Mont. 88, 97, 765 P.2d 751, 757 (1988), relied on <em>Buxbaum </em>for the proposition that discounting stock is improper whenever the market value is founded on net asset value. This Court disagreed: \u2018This is not so. Whether a discount is proper depends on the facts of the case, not on the method used to ascertain the underlying value of the stock.\u201d <em>In re Milesnick, </em>235 Mont. at 97, 765 P.2d at 757. The Court stated that \u201c[a] discount for a minority interest is appropriate when the minority shareholder has no ability to control salaries, dividends, profit distributions, and day-to-day corporate operations.\u201d <em>In re Milesnick, </em>235 Mont. at 97, 765 P.2d at 757; <em>see also In re Marriage of Davies, </em>266 Mont. 466, 476-77, 880 P.2d 1368, 1375 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u00b639 The wife in <em>In re Milesnick, </em>235 Mont. at 97, 765 P.2d at 756, contended that the district court improperly had discounted the value of the parties\u2019 stock in the family ranch. This Court affirmed the district court\u2019s discounting of the Milesnicks\u2019 stock <em>. In re Milesnick, </em>235 Mont. at 98, 765 P.2d at 757. The Court noted that \u2018there is no doubt thatthe [Milesnicks] were minority shareholders.\u201d <em>In re Milesnick, </em>235 Mont. at 97, 765 P.2d at 757. The Court emphasized that the Milesnicks together only owned a little over 10 percent of the total stock of the corporation. <em>In re Milesnick, </em>235 Mont. at 98, 765 P.2d at 757. The husband worked with his parents on the ranch and had some input into day-to-day operations, but the parents had final say on all major decisions. <em>In re Milesnick, </em>235 Mont. at 98, 765 P.2d at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"ANc\">\u00b640 Bobby owned 50% of B&amp;J. Bobby and his father possessed equal power \u2018to control salaries, dividends, profit distributions, and day-today corporate operations.\u201d <em>In re Milesnick, </em>235 Mont. at 97, 765 P.2d at 757. Bobby used B&amp;J funds to service and fly the company airplane and to stay current as a pilot. Bobby\u2019s alleged lack of control in B&amp;J occurred only after his father took the company checkbook from Bobby after Bobby had spent $200,000 for a down payment on a condominium in Arizona. The District Court improperly discounted the value of Bobby\u2019s interest in B&amp;J. <em>Bock, </em>\u00b6 14. The District Court on remand should consider the entire value of Bobby s interest in that portion of the B&amp;J properties included in the marital estate in equitably reapportioning the Williams\u2019s marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b641 <em>Did the District Court\u2019s property apportionment incorrectly double count against Jenny the retirement fund that she cashed out after the separation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b642 Jenny withdrew $67,706 after taxes from a 401(k) and IRA in Bobby\u2019s name after the parties\u2019 separation. The parties had stipulated that the District Court would count the net amount that Jenny had withdrawn from the accounts against \u201cwhatever amount of marital property [the court] would otherwise determine [Jenny] was entitled to.\u201d The District Court counted against Jenny the $67,706 from the retirement fund. The court also counted against Jenny in its property apportionment $80,324 in equity from a town house at 3451 Dunlop Avenue [Dunlop property] that she bought shortly after cashing out the retirement accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b643 Jenny argues that the District Court\u2019s apportionment constituted double counting of the proceeds of the retirement accounts. Bobby suggests that Jenny may not have used the retirement funds towards the Dunlop property. Bobby\u2019s Proposed Finding of Fact No. 44 stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>in part that \u201cJenny used [the proceeds of the retirement funds] to purchase a home at 3451 Dunlop Avenue.\u201dThe court adopted Jenny\u2019s Proposed Finding of Fact No. 29, which provided in part that \u2018Tp]er Stipulation and Court order, Bobby provided the Morgan Stanley and Raymond James accounts to Jenny, which Jenny utilized to purchase the 3451 Dunlop Avenue town home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b644 Bobby strenuously objected to Jenny\u2019s purchase of the Dunlop property before trial. Bobby\u2019s counsel asked Jenny: \u201cIsn\u2019t it true, you\u2019re going to hand $339,000 to the Buschers to buy [the Dunlop property]?\u201d Jenny replied: \u20181 have a loan.\u201d Bobby\u2019s counsel then stated: \u2018Well, $263,000 is a loan and the rest of it is this retirement money.\u201d Bobby\u2019s counsel later objected to Jenny \u201ctaking all of the money that she\u2019s got, $80,000 in cash, and devoting it all to one thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b645  The record indicates that Jenny used the $67,706 from the retirement funds as a down payment on the Dunlop property. The District Court properly counted against Jenny the $80,324 in equity in the Dunlop property. The court improperly double counted the retirement money when it also counted against Jenny the original $67,706 from the retirement funds. On remand, the District Court should count only the $80,324 against Jenny in its property apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b646 We remand and direct the District Court to re-calculate Bobby\u2019s child support obligation and reapportion the Williams\u2019s entire marital estate. The marital estate includes the full value of Bobby\u2019s interest in the portion of the B&amp;J properties that the court earlier determined should be included in the Williams\u2019s marital estate. Our decision likely affects the equitable factors that the District Court must consider when apportioning the Williams\u2019s marital estate. Section 40-4-202(1), MCA. The District Court should exercise its \u2018broad discretion\u201d to apportion equitably the estate in a manner consistent with this opinion. <em>Bartsch, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b647 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
