We affirm in part, reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AP3\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting St. Paul\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>summary judgment and denying United National\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding United National breached its duty to defend its insured, Swank Enterprises?</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in awarding St. Paul attorney fees for defense of the initial personal injury action and for the declaratory judgment action?</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b65 In August 2001, general contractor Swank Enterprises (Swank) entered into a contract with subcontractor Advanced Fireproofing &amp; Insulation (Advanced Fireproofing) to have Advanced Fireproofing perform fireproofing work as part of a construction project at the Kalispell Regional Medical Center (KRMC). Michael Booth (Booth) was an employee of subcontractor Advanced Fireproofing. In January 2002, while performing fireproofing work at the KRMC project, Booth fell from a hydraulic lift called a \u201cscissor lift\u201d and sustained injuries. Swank owned the scissor lift Booth was using at the time of the accident and had provided the lift for Advanced Fireproofing\u2019s employees to use while working on the KRMC project.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b66 Booth stepped backwards off the lift and fell approximately seven feet after a portion of the platform guardrail system on the scissor lift had been removed and was replaced with a latching chain rather than an actual guardrail, in violation of safety statutes and regulations. Because scissor lifts fall under the definitions of \u201cscaffold\u201d contained in the United States Department of Labor and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Montana Scaffolding Act (Scaffolding Act), a scissor lift must comply with the regulatory and statutory requirements applicable to scaffolds. Experts for both parties agree the lift was unsafe, it violated industry standards and government regulations, and the removal of the guardrail, and its replacement with a latching chain, was a cause of Booth\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"AcC\">\u00b67 The prime contract between Swank and KRMC contained the following provisions pertaining to safety: Tt]he contractor shall enforce safety procedures ...\u201d\u201c[t]he contractor shall have overall responsibility for safety precautions and programs in the performance of the Work,\u201d and \u2018tt]he Contractor shall seek to avoid injury, loss or damage to persons or property by taking reasonable steps to protect: .1 its employees and other persons at the Worksite; .2 materials and equipment stored at on-site or off-site locations for use in the Work; and .3 property located at the site and adjacent to Work areas ....\u201d Furthermore, regarding \u201cmaterials brought to the worksite\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>contract stated \u201c[t]he Contractor shall be responsible for the proper delivery, handling, application, storage ... of all materials and substances brought to the worksite by the Contractor in accordance with the Contract Documents and used or consumed in the performance of the Work.\u201d The subcontract between Swank and Advanced Fireproofing also contained an indemnity provision stating that the subcontractor will \u2018indemnify and hold harmless\u201d the contractor for all \u201cclaims, damages, loss and expenses\u201d resulting from \u201cperformance of the Subcontractor\u2019s Work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b68 In the underlying personal injury action <em>(Booth v. Swank Enterprises, et al.), </em>Booth sued Swank, along with Skyjack, Inc., the manufacturer of the lift, and Hytopz, Inc., the company that sold the lift to Swank. Swank\u2019s liability insurance carrier, St. Paul, tendered the defense to Advanced Fireproofing under the indemnity clause in the subcontract and to United National under the commercial general liability policy, under which Swank qualified as an additional insured. United National rejected the tender of defense, arguing the general contractor could not shift responsibility to the subcontractor for the general contractor\u2019s own statutory duties to maintain and supervise the scissor lift at the job site, and thus United National had no duty to defend or cover the loss. Because United National refused the tender of defense, St. Paul continued to defend the claims asserted by Booth and, in August 2004, St. Paul settled the claim with Booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b69 The subcontract between Swank and Advanced Fireproofing required Advanced Fireproofing to purchase and maintain commercial general liability insurance listing Swank as an additional insured. According to the requirements of the subcontract, Advanced Fireproofing purchased liability insurance from United National. The policy contained an endorsement extending insurance coverage to \u201ccertain additional insureds\u201d and United issued a certificate of insurance showing Swank as an additional insured. The certificate of insurance states specifically that \u2018Swank Enterprises and all related entities, the owner, and all other parties as required by contract, are named as Additional Insured on a Primary Non-Contributing Basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9I\">\u00b610 The current action began in September 2004 when St. Paul brought a declaratory judgment action against United National, seeking payment of the amount it paid to settle the claim with Booth as well as the attorney fees and costs it incurred in defending the original action and the declaratory judgment action. Both parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In a June 2007 opinion and order regarding the declaratory judgment, the District Court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>St. Paul\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied United National\u2019s and awarded St. Paul a judgment of $140,000, which equaled the amount St. Paul paid to settle the claim in <em>Booth v. Swank Enterprises, et al.. </em>In an October 2007 order and judgment, the District Court ordered United National to pay St. Paul the $140,000 awarded in the June 2007 judgment as well as $24,695.54 in attorney fees for its defense of Swank in <em>Booth v. Swank Enterprises, et al., </em>and $7,095.66 in attorney fees for the declaratory judgment action. United National now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment and order awarding St. Paul damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b611 Our standard of review of an appeal from a summary judgment order is de novo. <em>National Cas. Co. v. American Bankers Ins. Co. of Florida, </em>2001 MT 28, \u00b6 13, 304 Mont. 163, 19 P.3d 223. We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment to determine whether it was correctly decided pursuant to Rule 56, M. R. Civ. P., which provides that summary judgment is only appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>National Cas. Co., </em>\u00b6 13. In the current case, both parties moved for summary judgment, agreeing there were no genuine issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b612 The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law, which we review de novo to determine whether it is correct. <em>Cusenbary v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>2001 MT 261, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 238, 37 P.3d 67. We are guided in our interpretation of insurance policies by the well-established principle that when the language of a policy is clear and explicit, the policy should be enforced as written. <em>National Cas. Co., </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s decision to award attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Renville v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>2004 MT 366, \u00b6 20, 324 Mont. 509, 105 P.3d 280. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or in excess of the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Kuhr v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 201, \u00b6 14, 338 Mont. 402, 168 P.3d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District err in granting St. Paul\u2019s motion for summary judgment arid denying United National\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding United National breached its duty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number><em>to defend its insured, Swank Enterprises?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b615 United National argues that \u201c[n]either principles of contractual indemnity, nor the additional-insured endorsement to the United National policy, permit St. Paul to shift Swank\u2019s liability to Advanced Fireproofing or United National.\u201d United National claims that doing so would undermine the Montana Scaffolding Act\u2019s goal of making scaffolding operations safe. United National further argues that, even if the additional insured endorsement applied, \u2018the St. Paul policy [should] be deemed primary, and the United National policy excess, with respect to Booth\u2019s claim.\u201dUnited National concludes the District Court erred in determining the additional insured endorsement contained in Advanced Fireproofing\u2019s policy provided coverage for Swank\u2019s own negligence, and Advanced Fireproofing owed no duty to indemnify or provide insurance to Swank for Swank\u2019s liability to Booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b616 St. Paul argues that at issue is not liability under the Scaffolding Act because \u201c[t]here was never any determination that [Swank] violated any duties it owed to [Booth]\u201d and the alleged violations were never proved and the matter was \u201cresolved in a compromise settlement without disposition of the liability on the merits.\u201d Rather, St. Paul argues, at issue is the language in the United National policy and the scope of that policy\u2019s coverage of Swank. St. Paul states that Swank was not only <em>intended </em>to be an additional insured under the United National policy but Swank \u201cwas [actually] added as an additional insured on a primary, non-contributory basis through a Certificate of Insurance issued by Advanced Fireproofing and/or its insurer.\u201d St. Paul states Tt]he subcontract between Advanced Fireproofing and Swank Enterprises required that Swank Enterprises be added as an additional insured precisely for the type of claim that resulted from the injuries to [Booth].\u201d St. Paul further argues United National \u2018breached its duty to defend by failing to accept the tender of defense\u201d and United National \u201cconfuses contractual responsibilities between Advanced Fireproofing and Swank Enterprises with the contractual responsibilities United National had to its additional insured ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">A. Montana Scaffolding Act</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b617 The Montana Scaffolding Act, set forth in Title 50, Chapter 77, MCA, defines \u201cscaffold\u201d or \u201cscaffolding\u201d as \u201ca temporarily elevated platform and it's supporting structure that is used on a construction site to support a person, material, or both.\u201d The Scaffolding Act provides that \u201c[s]ubject to the comparative negligence principles provided in Title 27, chapter 1, part 7, a contractor, subcontractor, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>builder who uses or constructs a scaffold on a construction site is liable for damages sustained by any person who uses the scaffold... when the damages are caused by negligence of the contractor, subcontractor, or builder in the use or construction of the scaffold.\u201d Section 50-77-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\">\u00b618  A violation of the duties imposed by the Scaffolding Act imposes absolute liability. <em>Slater v. Central Plumbing and Heating Co., </em>275 Mont. 266, 269, 912 P.2d 780, 782 (1996). This Court has held that the statutory duty of an employer to provide its employees with a safe workplace is extended to a general contractor when that general contractor controls job safety or has a nondelegable duty of safety, arising out of contract. <em>Stepanek v. Kober Const., </em>191 Mont. 430, 434, 625 P.2d 51, 53 (1981). Furthermore, where a contract imposes a nondelegable duty to ensure a safe place to work, a general contractor \u201ccannot avoid liability by attempting to shift the responsibility to someone else.\u201d Nave <em>v. Harlan Jones Drilling, </em>252 Mont. 199, 203, 827 P.2d 1239, 1241 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b619 United National argues that the indemnity clause in the contract does not apply because the Scaffolding Act prohibits Swank from shifting its liability to Booth for breach of nondelegable duties. United National further argues that \u201c[t]he prime contract imposed on Swank the duty to control, manage, and supervise safety on the construction project... [a]nd Swank was responsible for the proper handling of all materials-like the scissor liffc-it brought to the work-site.\u201d St. Paul counters stating \u201cthe entity controlling the use of the scissor lift at the time of the loss was Advanced Fireproofing, not Swank Enterprises.\u201d Furthermore, fit is Advanced Fireproofing and [Booth] who were in complete control of the cleanliness and operation of the scaffold in question.\u201d St. Paul concludes stating \u2018[t]here was never any determination that Swank Enterprises violated any duties it owed to [Booth]. Many violations were alleged, but none [was] proved and the matter was resolved in a compromise settlement without disposition of the liability issues on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b620  This Court has held that contractual provisions similar to those in the prime contract between Swank and KRMC have created a nondelegable duty to control workplace safety and to comply with the requirements of the Scaffolding Act. <em>See Steiner v. Dept. of Highways, </em>269 Mont. 270, 276-77, 887 P.2d 1228, 1232-33; <em>Slater, </em>275 Mont. at 272, 912 P.2d at 783; <em>Stepanek, </em>191 Mont. at 439, 625 P.2d at 56. As in <em>Stepanek, </em>the prime contract between Swank and KRMC indicates Swank maintained the responsibility to control safety on the project. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The prime contract gave Swank the overall responsibility for safety precautions and programs, the responsibility for protecting employees at the worksite, and the responsibility for the safety of materials brought to the worksite. According to our jurisprudence interpreting the Scaffolding Act, Swank cannot delegate its contractual duty to maintain safety, arising from the prime contract with KRMC. Thus, Swank had a nondelegable duty under the Scaffolding Act to ensure the safety of the scissor lift.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b621  While the Scaffolding Act and the case law interpreting that act create a nondelegable <em>duty </em>to ensure workplace safety, the party with that duty can still insure itself from <em>liability </em>arising out of violations (alleged or proven) of that duty as long as the duty itself is not being delegated to another. In other words, carrying insurance for liability under the Scaffolding Act is not the same as delegating one\u2019s duty to comply with the Scaffolding Act. If Swank\u2019s insurance coverage is not sufficient to satisfy a judgment, then Swank remains liable for the excess. Swank is not attempting to delegate its duty under the Scaffolding Act. Rather, Swank seeks a determination that United National\u2019s policy, listing Swank as an additional insured, covers Swank for its liability to Booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u00b622 The Dissent asserts this conclusion is a \u201csea change\u201d in our nondelegable duty law and that our holding in fact allows a general contractor to delegate its nondelegable duty for workplace safety to a third party. The Dissent claims \u201cAdvanced Fireproofing now bears the <em>liability </em>for Swank\u2019s breach of its nondelegable <em>duty </em>to provide workplace safety\u201d and \u201cAdvanced Fireproofing must either provide workplace safety or, alternatively, incur the financial burdeii (through its insurer) of Swank\u2019s breach of its duty to provide a safe place to work.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 43. Swank was insured under United National\u2019s policy through an \u201cadditional insured\u201dendorsement. This endorsement had the effect of making Swank an insured of United National. Following the Dissent\u2019s reasoning to its logical conclusion, if a general contractor carries insurance (either on its own or through a provision in a subcontract) to cover liability for failure to provide workplace safety, that insurance contract would constitute a delegation of the general contractor\u2019s nondelegable duty; it would, in the words of the Dissent, be \u2018foisting its own misconduct and neglect\u201d onto a third party-the insurance company. Despite the protestations of the Dissent, we have never held that a contractor cannot insure itself for the \u201cabsolute liability\u201d that arises from a violation of the duty to provide workplace safety. Indeed, such a holding would be counterproductive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>in that insurance coverage provides a further resource to satisfy an injured worker\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\">\u00b623 Swank has fulfilled its duty under the Scaffolding Act. Swank\u2019s liability was reflected by and accounted for in its settlement of Booth\u2019s claim. Swank\u2019s subcontract with Advanced Fireproofing required Advanced Fireproofing to obtain insurance covering Swank as an additional insured, on a primary non-contributing basis, in contemplation of the type of incident at issue here. Although our holding is not premised upon the assumption, we note as an aside that if Advanced Fireproofing accounted for the cost of the insurance in its bid for the work, Swank indirectly paid for that insurance. Thus, by requesting that Advanced Fireproofing indemnify Swank for Swank\u2019s own negligence, Swank is not delegating a nondelegable duty under the Montana Scaffolding Act. Rather, that duty has been satisfied. The issue is, thus, a question of insurance contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">B. Indemnity Provision in the Subcontract</p>\n<p id=\"AYM\">\u00b624 We now turn to the indemnity provision in the subcontract between Swank and Advanced Fireproofing to determine whether Swank can be indemnified for its liability arising from an alleged violation of its duty under the Scaffolding Act. This Court has adopted a standard under which \u201ccontractual provisions that indemnify a party for its own negligence must be \u2018clear and unequivocal\u2019 to be enforceable.\u201d <em>Slater, </em>275 Mont. at 270, 912 P.2d at 782 (citing <em>Sweet v. Colborn Sch. Supply, </em>196 Mont. 367, 369-70, 639 P.2d 521, 523 (1982)). In <em>Slater, </em>this Court determined the contractual provisions were not sufficiently clear and unequivocal to indemnify a general contractor for its own negligence. <em>Slater, </em>275 Mont. at 271, 912 P.2d at 782. In <em>Slater, </em>we determined that while the indemnity provision clearly required the subcontractor to indemnify the general contractor for damages arising out of the <em>subcontractor\u2019s </em>negligence, it did not require the subcontractor to indemnify the general contractor for damages arising out of the general contractor\u2019s <em>own </em>negligence. The Court in <em>Slater </em>held the indemnity provision was not sufficiently clear and unequivocal in its intent to indemnify the general contractor for its own negligence. <em>Slater, </em>275 Mont. at 271, 912 P.2d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b625 Similar to <em>Slater, </em>the contract provisions at issue in the instant case do not show clear and unequivocal intent to indemnify Swank for its own negligence. Section 9.1.1 of the subcontract agreement between Swank and Advanced Fireproofing states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">INDEMNITY To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Subcontractor shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Contractor, the Contractor\u2019s other subcontractors ... from and against all claims, damages, loss and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and expenses arising out of or resulting from the performance of the Subcontractor\u2019s Work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The contract provision above is even less specific than the indemnity provision at issue in <em>Slater. </em>Thus, as in <em>Slater, </em>we find the indemnity provision above is not specific in its intent to indemnify Swank for Swank\u2019s liability to Booth for its own negligence. Therefore, we must now turn to the language in United National\u2019s insurance policy to determine whether the policy covers Swank in its own right and whether liability for Swank\u2019s own negligence falls within the scope of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">C. Additional Insured Endorsement</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b626 St. Paul asserts that Swank was an additional insured on a primary non-contributing basis under the terms of the United National policy and United National cannot now \u201cpick and choose language that supports its view of limiting coverage ... [t]he policy must be looked at in its entirety.\u201d United National counters stating that we must look to the intent of the contract language and that the contract language did not intend to cover Swank for Swank\u2019s own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b627 We have held that Ta]n insurance policy, like any other contract, must be given that interpretation which is reasonable and which is consonant with the manifest object and intent of the parties.\u201d <em>Anaconda Co. v. General Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp., Ltd., </em>189 Mont. 447, 455, 616 P.2d 363, 367 (1980). The subcontract agreement specified that Advanced Fireproofing must obtain a policy covering Swank. More specifically, Article 9, \u00a7 9.2.1 of the subcontract agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">[bjefore commencing the Subcontractor\u2019s Work, and as a condition of payment, the Subcontractor [Advanced Fireproofing] shall purchase and maintain insurance that will protect it from the claims arising out of its operations under this Agreement, whether the operations are by the Subcontractor, or any of its consultants or subcontractors or anyone directly or indirectly employed by any of them, or by anyone for whose acts any of them may be liable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Exhibit B to the subcontract agreement states that \u2018Swank Enterprises must be listed as additional insured, and a copy of the additional insured endorsement must be attached to the certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A00\">\u00b628 Endorsement #5 to United National\u2019s policy covering Advanced Fireproofing states the policy affords insurance coverage to \u201cadditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>insureds,\u201d pursuant to the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-3\">[s]ubject to all its terms, conditions and endorsements, such insurance \u00e1s is afforded by the policy shall also apply to the following entity(ies) as an additional insured, but only as respects liability arising from (1) premises owned by or occupied by the Named Insured, or (2) the contract entered into by the Named Insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The policy names additional insured entities as \u2018Ta]ll entities for which a Certificate of Insurance has been issued naming them as an Additional Insured with a copy of the Certificate of Insurance on file with the Company, and required by a written contract.\u201d United National then issued a \u2018Certificate of Liability Insurance\u201d stating that \u2018Swank Enterprises and all other related entities, the owner, and all other parties as required by contract, are named as Additional Insured on a Primary Non-Contributing Basis.\u201d Furthermore, the \u2018Primary Insurance Endorsement\u201d of the policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">Subject to the terms and conditions of this policy, it is understood and agreed that with respect to claims arising out of work performed by the Named Insured, the coverage afforded herein shall be primary in relation to any policies carried by any person or organization to whom or to which the Named Insured is obligated by virtue of a written contract, and then only as required by said written contract. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b629 Montana law is well-settled that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured arises when an insured sets forth facts that represent a risk covered by the terms of an insurance policy. <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 20, 321 Mont. 99, 90 P.3d 381. And the duty to defend is independent from and broader than the duty to indemnify created by the same insurance contract. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 21. Unless there exists an unequivocal demonstration that the claim against the insured does not fall within the policy coverage, the insurer has a duty to defend. <em>Insured Titles, Inc. v. McDonald, </em>275 Mont. 111, 115-16, 911 P.2d 209, 211-12 (1996). And any doubt as to the existence of a duty to defend must be resolved in the insured\u2019s favor. Allan D. Windt, <em>Insurance Claims and Disputes, </em>\u00a74:2 (4th ed., West 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b630 It is clear from the plain language of the policy that United National intended to cover Swank for the type of incident that occurred here. The policy covers Swank as an additional insured on a primary non-contributing basis. The policy plainly states that it affords additional coverage to additional insured for \u2018liability arising from (1) premises owned by or occupied by the Named Insured, or, (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>contract entered into by the Named Insured.\u201d United National\u2019s suggested interpretation of its policy would render the policy meaningless. United National argues that even if United National\u2019s policy covering Advanced Fireproofing extended coverage to Swank, that coverage would be excess coverage, secondary to St. Paul\u2019s coverage. In interpreting insurance contracts, we \u201caccord the usual meaning to the terms and the words ... and we construe them using common sense.\u201d <em>Modroo v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. </em>Co., 2008 MT 275, \u00b6 23, 345 Mont. 262, 191 P.3d 389. The language in the \u2018Certificate of Liability Insurance\u201d issued to Swank under the United National policy plainly states that Swank is \u201cnamed as Additional Insured on a Primary Non-contributing basis.\u201d It is clear from the plain language of the insurance contract that the United National policy was intended to be primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b631  Thus, the District Court was correct in determining that United National had a duty to defend Swank and that United National\u2019s policy is primary, pursuant to the language in the additional insured endorsement in United National\u2019s policy. The District Court did not err in granting St. Paul\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying United National\u2019s motion for summary judgment and holding United National breached its duty to defend Swank.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b632 <em>Did the District Court err in awarding St. Paul attorney fees for defense of the initial personal injury action and for the declaratory judgment action ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b633 In its October 2007 order and judgment, the District Court awarded St. Paul $24,695.54 in attorney fees for the underlying personal injury case <em>Booth v. Swank Enterprises, et al. </em>and $7,095.66 in attorney fees for the declaratory judgment action. United National argues the attorney fees \u201cwere neither necessarily nor properly awarded under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act or ... <em>Trustees of Indiana University v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663 ... [and] consequently, the District Court\u2019s determination that fees ... were attributable to United National was in error.\u201dUnited National further argues \u2018St. Paul should have sought the monetary relief it sought through a properly asserted subrogation claim ... without the invocation of the UDJA. St. Paul\u2019s decision to seek summary judgment in the declaratory judgment context was a tactical decision and the proper claim was for subrogation of St. Paul\u2019s insured\u2019s contractual rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b634 St. Paul argues it is \u201centitled to attorney fees and indemnity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>amounts paid on behalf of Swank Enterprises due to United National\u2019s failure to fulfill its duty to defend and indemnify Swank.\u201d St. Paul further argues \u201c[t]his is not a subrogation action, as characterized by United National... [i]t is rather a direct action against United National by St. Paul as the assignor of the rights of [Swank] for a determination that United National had an obligation to provide a defense and indemnify [Swank] under the terms of its insurance contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">\u00b635 The Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act allows for claims to be brought by \u201c[a]ny person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other writings constituting a contract or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument, statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d Section 27-8-202, MCA. The stated purpose of the Act is \u2018to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations; and it is to be liberally construed and administered.\u201d Section 27-8-102, MCA; <em>Tarlton v. Kaufman, </em>2008 MT 462, \u00b6 33, 348 Mont. 178, 199 P.3d 263. Furthermore, this Court has stated that \u201c[a] declaratory proceeding is primarily intended to determine the meaning of a law or a contract and to adjudicate the rights of the parties therein ....\u201d <em>Tarlton, </em>\u00b6 33 (citing <em>Raynes v. City of Great Falls, </em>215 Mont. 114, 120-21, 696 P.2d 423, 427 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b636 United National argues St. Paul improperly brought its action under the UDJA. However, Swank\u2019s claim was not simply a subrogation action, but rather an action to determine the scope of coverage under United National\u2019s insurance policy covering Swank. Such an action squarely fits within the intent of the UDJA\u2019s liberally constructed purpose \u201cto settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations ....\u201d Thus, Swank properly brought the claim under the UDJA, and we now turn to the question of whether the District Court abused its discretion to award attorney fees under \u00a727-8-313, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b637 Montana follows the general American Rule that a party in a civil action is not entitled to attorney fees absent a specific contractual or statutory provision. <em>Martin v. SAIF Corp., </em>2007 MT 234, \u00b6 22, 339 Mont. 167, 167 P.3d 916 (citing <em>Trustees of Indiana University v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6 19, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663). Because the contracts at issue do not contain language regarding attorney fees, we must turn to the statutory exception. Section 27-8-313, MCA does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>contain a specific attorney fee provision; however, it gives a court the ability to grant \u201csupplemental relief\u2019when the court deems such relief is \u201cnecessary and proper.\u201d Section 27-8-313, MCA. This Court held in <em>Buxbaum </em>that \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA provides a statutory basis for awarding supplemental relief in the form of attorney fees in declaratory judgment actions if the award is \u201cnecessary and proper.\u201d <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 42. The Court in <em>Buxbaum </em>did not define what constitutes \u201cnecessary and proper.\u201dHowever, this Court has adopted the \u2018tangible parameters\u201d test to determine whether attorney fees granted under \u00a7 27-8-313 are necessary and proper. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 23 <em>{citingRenville, </em>\u00b6 27). The tangible parameters test provides that fees are \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d when (1) an insurance company possesses what the plaintiffs sought in the declaratory relief action; (2) it is necessary to seek a declaration showing that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought; and (3) the declaratory relief sought was necessary in order to change the status quo. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 23. And this Court has recognized a party\u2019s \u201ctactical decision\u201d to file a declaratory judgment action does not automatically presume attorney fees are \u201cnecessary or proper.\u201d <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b638 While \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA gives district courts the discretion to award \u201cfurther relief\u2019in the form of attorney fees if a court determines such an award is \u201cnecessary and proper,\u201d implicit in that determination is a threshold question of whether the equities support a grant of attorney fees. In the only case since <em>Buxbaum </em>where we have upheld a district court\u2019s discretionary grant of attorney fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, the fees were granted in order to prevent an anomalous result where one party would have been better off had it never brought the claim in the first place. <em>{See Renville, </em>\u00b6 28, affirming the district court\u2019s grant of attorney fees to an injured party seeking declaratory judgment as to payment of medical costs owed by an insurance company). In <em>Renville, </em>we determined fees were necessary and proper in order to afford meaningful relief to the injured party. Thus, while a district court has the discretion to award attorney fees under \u00a727-8-313, MCA, such fees are only appropriate if equitable considerations support the award. This determination must be made before a court applies the criteria of the tangible parameters test.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b639  In applying the equitable consideration described above to the facts before us, we find the equities do not support an award of attorney fees. The instant case is distinct from the facts of <em>Renville </em>where an injured party expended more on the cost of litigation than it received as a result of the litigation, thus potentially rendering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>declaratory relief meaningless. Rather, here we have two similarly situated parties disputing the interpretation of a contract. Under these circumstances, the equities do not support an award of attorney fees to St. Paul. Because this threshold requirement is not met, we do not even reach an analysis of the tangible parameters test. Therefore, the District Court abused its discretion by acting arbitrarily in its award of attorney fees to St. Paul.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">\u00b640 We reverse the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-4\">JUSTICES WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b147-5\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AnR\">concurs and dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b641 I concur in the analysis of Issue 2, but otherwise dissent from the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u00b642 As to Issue 1,1 agree that under our well-established precedent cited by the Court, Swank had a nondelegable duty under the Scaffolding Act to ensure the safety of the scissor lift. Opinion, \u00b6 20.1 disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion, however, that <em>liability </em>for the breach of a nondelegable <em>duty </em>can be so conveniently shifted to a third party, or its insurer, by way of (1) an indemnity/hold-harmless clause running from the party which does not bear the <em>nondelegable </em>duty for workplace safety to the party who has contractually assumed that duty, Opinion, \u00b6 7, coupled with (2) an insurance policy purchased by the former party naming the latter as an additional insured, Opinion, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u00b643 This approach is flawed for two reasons. First, the Court\u2019s holding completely circumvents what we decreed in <em>Nave v. Harlan Jones Drilling \u012b.e., </em>\u201c[bjecause the <em>duty </em>imposed on [the general contractor] by its contract was nondelegable, [the general contractor] cannot avoid <em>liability </em>by attempting to shift the responsibility to someone else.\u201d <em>Nave v. Harlan Jones Drilling, </em>252 Mont. 199, 203, 827 P.2d 1239, 1241 (1992) (emphasis added). Here, the Court authorizes precisely whatNaue prohibits. Advanced Fireproofing now bears the <em>liability </em>for Swank\u2019s breach of its nondelegable <em>duty </em>to provide workplace safety. Advanced Fireproofing must either provide workplace safety or, alternatively, incur the financial burden (through its insurer) of Swank\u2019s breach of its duty to provide a safe place to work. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 21 (Swank remains liable for excess damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">\u00b644 Through smoke and mirrors Swank has clearly accomplished what we held in <em>Nave </em>it could not. The Court\u2019s pronouncement to the contrary, notwithstanding, Opinion, \u00b6 25, Swank has not fulfilled its duty under the Scaffolding Act by shifting the liability for noncompliance with the Act to Advanced Fireproofing. It was Swank\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>nondelegable duty to insure that the scissor lift was safe; there was an accident because the scissor lift was not safe; Swank, thus, breached its duty to provide a safe place to work; and Swank was absolutely liable for this breach. Opinion, \u00b6 18. Yet, Advanced Fireproofing (and, ultimately, its insurer) is held liable and financially responsible for Swank\u2019s breach. Swank is not absolutely liable at all; Advanced Fireproofing is. We have effectively overruled the underpinnings for our seminal nondelegable duty decision in <em>Ulmen v. Schwieger, </em>92 Mont. 331, 12 P.2d 856 (1932) (general contractor, which has assumed a nondelegable duty of workplace safety, remained in direct control and the provisions of the Scaffolding Act apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b645 Second, the Court\u2019s approach totally abrogates the important public policy reasons underlying the nondelegable duty doctrine. In <em>Nave, </em>we reaffirmed these important public policy concerns as \u2018including preventing accidents in the workplace and protecting against the economic costs of injuries.\u201d <em>Nave, </em>252 Mont. at 202, 827 P.2d at 1240. As a result of the Court\u2019s decision here, the general contractor has no incentive whatsoever to discharge its nondelegable duty to provide workplace safety. If an employee of a subcontractor is injured, so what? The subcontractor is contractually obligated to \u2018indemnify and hold-harmless\u201d the general contractor from its breach of duty; the subcontractor\u2019s insurer is obligated to pay the injured subcontractor\u2019s employee\u2019s damages; and the subcontractor is obligated to bear the liability and financial responsibility for any excess damages. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 21. What could be more convenient and financially foolproof for the general contractor? The general contractor can breach its nondelegable duty with impunity, and require a third party to pick up the tab for the economic costs. As a result of our decision here, there is no reason for the general contractor with a nondelegable duty of workplace safety to actually perform its duty. As long as the general contractor can require a subcontractor to indemnify and hold the general contractor harmless and insure the general contractor against the general contractor\u2019s own negligence, the general contractor is home free. The Court\u2019s decision effectively overrules the underpinnings <em>o\u00ed Nave; Beckman v. Butte-Silver Bow County, </em>2000 MT 112, 299 Mont. 389, 1 P.3d 348; <em>Slater v. Central Plumbing and Heating Co., </em>275 Mont. 266, 912 P.2d 780 (1996); <em>Gibby v. Noranda Minerals Corp., </em>273 Mont. 420, 905 P.2d 126 (1995); <em>Stepanek v. Kober Const., </em>191 Mont. 430, 625 P.2d 51 (1981), and <em>Shannon v. Howard S. Wright Const. Co., </em>181 Mont. 269, 593 P.2d 438 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b646 Sadly, this is the second decision in as many years in which this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Court has made a sea-change in the law of nondelegable duty. The Court has ignored our settled nondelegable dutyjurisprudence andhas permitted a general contractor which has blatantly breached its nondelegable duty for workplace safety to effectively delegate that duty to a third party. In <em>Olson v. Shumaker Truck. and Excav. Contr., </em>2008 MT 378, 347 Mont. 1, 196 P.3d 1265, this Court held that the nondelegable duty of workplace safety can, in fact, be delegated through comparative negligence to the injured subcontractor\u2019s employee-i.e., the very individual whom the nondelegable duty of job-site safety was adopted to protect. In <em>Olson, </em>this Court made the injured subcontractor\u2019s employee responsible and financially liable for providing his own safe place to work. For the first time, this Court made the nondelegable duty of workplace safety delegable by providing the negligent general contractor with a convenient scapegoat on which to foist its own misconduct and neglect. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 73-87 (Nelson, J., concurring and dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">\u00b647 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Court weakens the nondelegable duty doctrine even further. Now, a general contractor which has breached its nondelegable duty of workplace safety has two scapegoats on which to foist its own negligence and misconduct-(l) on the injured subcontractor\u2019s employee by way of comparative negligence, OZsora, and (2) on the subcontractor itself by way of an indemnity/hold-harmless agreement coupled with a required insurance clause. It is difficult to discern what is left of the nondelegable duty doctrine. Indeed, between Olson and our decision today, we have effectively drained our well-established nondelegable duty doctrine jurisprudence of any vitality. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b648 I would reverse. I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-5\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in. the Concurrence and Dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
