The Homestead Caf\u00e9 serves as the principal business of Lakeside Ventures, L.L.C., (Lakeside). The Clerk of Court entered a default judgment against Lakeside. Lakeside filed a motion to quash service, or, in the alternative, to vacate the default and default judgment. The Court denied these motions. We affirm, in part, and reverse, in part, and remand to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">\u00b62 Lakeside raises the following issues for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">\u00b63 Issue 1. Whether the District Court properly denied Lakeside\u2019s Motion to Quash Service pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 4D2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">\u00b64 Issue 2. Whether the District Court properly denied Lakeside\u2019s Motion to Set Aside the Default Judgment entered by the Clerk of Court because the judgment was capable of being made for sum certain pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">\u00b65 Issue 3. Whether the District Court properly denied Lakeside\u2019s Motion to Set Aside the Default.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b66 Bryden began working as the manager of the Homestead Caf\u00e9 in April 2004. Bryden entered into an \u201cat will\u201d contract with a probationary period ending on December 31, 2005. Lakeside operates the Homestead Caf\u00e9 and William Weimar serves as Lakeside\u2019s managing partner/registered agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b67 Weimar requested that Bryden post a notice in November 2007 of Lakeside\u2019s new no gambling policy for Lakeside employees at the Homestead Caf\u00e9. Bryden posted the written notice, but expressed her displeasure with the policy in the notice posted for the employees. Weimar fired Bryden for what he considered to be an act of insubordination. Bryden retained counsel to pursue a wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b68 Counsel for Bryden sent Weimar a demand letter and proposed complaint on June 2, 2008. Bryden\u2019s proposed complaint named Weimer and Lakeside as the defendants. The proposed complaint alleged separate counts of wrongful discharge, breach of contract to pay bonuses, and breach of contract to pay life insurance premiums. The proposed complaint alleged that Bryden earned $32,500 per year and that Lakeside had refused to pay Bryden $14,000 in bonuses that she had earned. Bryden\u2019s proposed complaint did not specify the amount of unpaid life insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b69 Counsel informed Weimar of Bryden\u2019s intention to file the suit if she did not hear back from him by June 13, 2008. Wilmer Windham (Windham), counsel for Weimar, responded to Bryden on June 16, 2008. Windham expressed his belief that the case was frivolous and demanded that Bryden drop the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u00b610 Weimar left Montana for an extended Alaskan vacation at some point during these exchanges. Weimar was to be travelling by boat and would not be within radio or telephone contact for several weeks. Bryden contacted Windham on June 23, 2008, to inquire whether he would accept service of Bryden\u2019s complaint on behalf of Lakeside. Windham declined on the basis that he was not authorized to accept service.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">\u00b611 David Kauffman (Kauffman), a deputy with the Flathead County Sheriffs Office, attempted to serve Bryden\u2019s complaint on Lakeside on June 25, 2008. Kauffman spoke with a female employee at the Homestead Caf\u00e9 who informed him that Weimar was \u201cout of the country.\u201d Kauffman requested to speak with a manager. Matt Snow (Snow) approached Kauffman in response to his request. Snow informed Kauffman that he served as the kitchen manager and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the restaurant manager was not present. Kauffman advised Snow that he had some important papers for Lakeside\u2019s owner. Snow took the papers and placed them in the office safe after further discussion regarding Weimar\u2019s absence. Upon the restaurant manager\u2019s return, Snow advised her of the interaction with Kauffman and the fact that he had placed the papers in the safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b612 Bryden modified the actual complaint that she filed and served from the proposed complaint that she had sent to Weimar. Bryden dropped Weimar as a defendant and names only Lakeside in her complaint. Next, in an apparent attempt to satisfy the sum certain requirement of M. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1), Bryden\u2019s complaint alleges a single count of wrongful discharge. She alleges that she earned $32,500 per year in wages. She further alleges that Lakeside owed her $14,000 in unpaid bonuses. Bryden\u2019s complaint alleges that Lakeside owed her for unpaid life insurance premiums, but her complaint makes no mention of the amount of the unpaid premiums. Bryden\u2019s prayer for relief asks for $140,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b613 Bryden moved for an entry of default and a notice of entry of judgment on the same day. The Clerk of Court granted the default on July 16, 2008, after the period in which to file an answer had expired. The Clerk, through a separate order, entered a default judgment in favor of Bryden in the amount of $140,000 on that same day. Bryden also wasted no time in obtaining a writ of execution. The Clerk of Court also issued the writ of execution on July 16, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b614 Windham entered the Flathead County Courthouse on July 22, 2008, on other business. Windham checked on the status of the Bryden case. Windham had not heard from Bryden regarding the case since the phone call on June 23,2008. Windham discovered that Bryden had filed the action. Windham discovered that Kauffman had served the kitchen manager with a summons and the complaint. And Windham learned that the Clerk of Court had entered a default judgment against Lakeside for the amount of $140,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b615 Windham contacted counsel for Bryden regarding the default judgment on July 28, 2008, and requested that the judgment be vacated. Counsel for Bryden refused to agree to vacate the default judgment. Lakeside moved to quash the service of the complaint, or, in the alternative, to vacate the default judgment on August 11, 2008. Lakeside filed this motion 19 days after Windham first had discovered the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u00b616 The District Court upheld both the effective service of the complaint and the default judgment entered by the Clerk of Court. Lakeside appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b617 The question of whether a court properly refused to quash service of process presents an issue of law. <em>MacPheat v. Schauf, </em>2002 MT 23, \u00b6 7, 308 Mont. 215, 41 P.3d 895. We review issues of law to determine whether the district court\u2019s application or interpretation of the law is correct. <em>MacPheat, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b618 The principle that \u201cevery litigated case should be tried on the merits and thus judgments by default are not favored\u201d guides this Court in considering motions to set aside default judgments. <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 17, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451. We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion to set aside a default judgment for only a slight abuse of discretion. <em>Montana Professional Sports, LLC v. National Indoor Football League, </em>2008 MT 98, \u00b6 21, 342 Mont. 292, 180 P.3d 1142. The party seeking to set aside a default has the burden of proof. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u00b619 Issue 1. Whether the District Court properly denied Lakeside\u2019s Motion to Quash Service pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 4D2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">\u00b620  A plaintiff may serve a limited liability company by leaving a copy of the complaint and summons at the office or business of the company with the person in charge of such office. M. R. Civ. P. 4D(2)(e)(i). We held in <em>Montana Professional Sports </em>that service of an \u201coffice manager\u201d in a building shared between the defendant football league and another business satisfied M. R. Civ. P. 4D(2)(e)(i). The office manager\u2019s \u201capparent authority\u2019constituted reasonable grounds to uphold correct service of process. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-33. Courts generally deem service proper where a person represents themselves to the process server as an \u201coffice manager\u201d and the server reasonably believed that he served the correct person. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">\u00b621 Deputy Kauffman requested to speak with a manager when he arrived at the Homestead Caf\u00e9 to serve the complaint. Snow approached him in response to Kauffman\u2019s request. Snow introduced himself to Kauffman as the kitchen manager. Snow informed Kauffman that the restaurant manager was not present at the time. Snow further informed Kauffman that he was \u201cthe closest thing to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>manager you would get at that time.\u201d Snow\u2019s assertion that he was the kitchen manager reasonably led Kauffman to believe that Snow had apparent authority to accept service. Snow further informed Kauffman of his intention to place the papers in the safe and make sure that the restaurant manager saw them upon her return. No reason existed for Kauffman to believe that a self-proclaimed manager was not in a position of authority to accept service. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b622 Issue 2. Whether the District Court properly denied Lakeside\u2019s Motion to Set Aside the Default Judgment entered by the Clerk of Court because the judgment was capable of being made for a sum certain pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b623 Lakeside alleges that the Clerk of Court improperly entered a default judgment as Bryden sought an award incapable of being calculated to a sum certain. Bryden prayed for $140,000 in damages and \u201cother relief deemed just or proper.\u201d This amount apparently represents the combination of four years of Bryden\u2019s salary and her claimed weekly bonuses. Lakeside argues that this amount was not capable of being made certain as it included weekly bonuses given for meeting certain conditions and four years had not elapsed during which Bryden could have found replacement employment. Lakeside contends that Bryden\u2019s claim to $140,000 appears only in the prayer for relief in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b624 The Clerk of Court may enter a default judgment on a claim for a sum certain, or for a sum which can by computation be made certain. M. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1). This default judgment can be entered upon request of the plaintiff and affidavit of the amount due. M. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1). Lakeside argued to the District Court that Bryden\u2019s complaint did not seek a sum certain as she had a duty to mitigate her damages in the wrongful discharge conduct, as required by \u00a739-2-905, MCA, and that her complaint sought \u201capproximately\u201d $14,000 in unpaid bonuses. The District Court rejected this claim based on its determination that \u2018the amount sought was capable of being made certain.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u00b625 Rule 55 empowers the clerk to enter a default judgment at the request of the plaintiff when three conditions are satisfied: (1) the claim is for a sum certain or for a sum which can by computation be made certain, (2) the default is for failure to appear, and (3) the defendant is not an infant or incompetent person. In all other cases, default judgment may be entered only by the Court. M. R. Civ. P. 55(b). \u2018The provisions in Rule 55 for the entry of default judgment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the clerk were inserted for the obvious purpose of relieving the judge of some of his less complicated functions.\u201d <em>United States v. Herlong, </em>9 F.R.D. 194 (W.D.S.C. 1949). Rule 55 carefully limits the clerk\u2019s authority to those cases where entry of judgment represents purely a ministerial act, as \u201c[s]ound policy dictates that the clerk should not be invested with discretionary power.\u2019\u201d <em>Combs v. Coal &amp; Mineral Management Services, </em>Inc., 105 F.R.D. 472, 474 (D.D.C. 1984), (quoting C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72683 at 416 (2nd ed. 1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b626 Courts have interpreted strictly the sum certain requirement. In fact, some courts appear to use interchangeably the terms \u201csum certain\u201d and liquidated amount.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Thorn Lumber Co., </em>501 S.E.2d 786, 791 (W. Va. 1998). Courts generally have limited the sum certain criteria to situations where the amount of liability is capable of precise calculation, such as an amount appearing on the face of an instrument, <em>Thorpe v. </em>Thorpe, 364 F.2d 692 (D.C. Cir. 1966), or the amount of a delinquent tax assessment, <em>United States v. Raleigh Restaurant, </em>398 F. Supp. 496 (E.D.N.Y. 1975). These situations do not ask the clerk to exercise discretion that he or she does not possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b627 Bryden points to <em>Capitol Records v. Carmichael, </em>508 F. Supp. 2d 1079 (S.D. Ala. 2007), to argue that her claim of lost wages in a wrongful discharge action constitutes \u201cstatutory damages.\u201d Statutory damages, as explained in <em>Capitol Records, </em>involve a specific damage amount set by statute. For example, a copyright owner whose copyright has been infringed may recover, at his election, either actual damages or statutory damages for the infringing activity. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a) - (c). Where the copyright owner elects to pursue statutory damages, a court may award, \u2018instead of actual damages and profits, an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action, with respect to any one work.\u201d The federal copyright law sets the damages for which any one infringer is liable individually \u2018in a sum of not less than $750 or more than $30,000 as the court considers just.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7504(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b628 The plaintiffs in <em>Capitol Records </em>sought entry only of the statutory minimum amount of $750 per work for each work that the complaint charged Carmichael with unlawfully downloading and/or distributing. <em>Capitol Records, </em>508 F. Supp. 2d at 1085. Bryden seeks to recover four years of lost wages allowed under \u00a7 39-2-905, MCA. Unlike the specific damage amount set in the federal copyright act, \u00a7 905 specifies no particular damage amount for a wrongful discharge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The statute instead provides that a wrongfully discharged employee may recover the employee\u2019s lost wages and benefits for a period of four years. The specific amount of wages and benefits to which the employee may be entitled presents a potential factual question. Bryden also fails to take into account that this same statute requires her to undertake reasonable efforts to find replacement employment to mitigate her damages. Section 39-2-905, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b629  Neither Bryden\u2019s purported aggregate total damages as alleged in her complaint, nor the fact that her affidavit attests to such a sum, automatically converts Bryden\u2019s claim into a \u201csum certain.\u201d Courts considering the question are clear that a claim is not for a \u201csum certain\u201d merely because the demand in the complaint seeks a specific dollar amount. A contrary holding would permit almost any unliquidated amount to be transformed into a claim for a sum certain simply by placing a monetary figure on the item of claimed damage, \u201ceven though that amount has not been fixed, settled, or agreed upon by the parties and regardless of the nature of the claim.\u201d <em>Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em>501 S.E.2d at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b630 The court in <em>Exotex Corp. v. Rinehart, </em>3 P.3d 826 (Wyo. 2000), vacated a default judgment entered by the clerk of court where a realtor sought to recover his 6 percent commission on a $350,000 offer on a property. The court limited the sum certain requirement to situations where the amount due could not be disputed. <em>Exotex Corp., </em>3 P.3d at 830. The realtor had alleged tortuous interference with prospective advantage. Lost profits represented the proper measure of damages for this type of tort claim. <em>Exotex Corp., </em>3 P.3d at 830. Lost profits in that context would have been the alleged commission less the realtor\u2019s expenses. <em>Exotex Corp., </em>3 P.3d at 830. The court would have needed to conduct a hearing to determine the realtor\u2019s expenses. <em>Exotex Corp., </em>3 P.3d at 830. Bryden\u2019s claim of a sum certain presents similar problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b631  Section 39-2-905, MCA, provides that an employee alleging wrongful discharge may recover lost wages for a period not to exceed four years. A court must determine interim earnings, which include the amount the employee could have earned with reasonable diligence, from the amount awarded for lost wages. Section 39-2-905, MCA. The District Court made no such determination. The District Court did not consider whether Bryden had made reasonable attempts to obtain new employment. The District Court reviewed only an entry made by the Clerk of Court. The District Court never addressed whether Bryden had undertaken efforts to find a new job with reasonable diligence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>This failure by the District Court overlooked a question of fact that reasonably could have lowered the amount to which Bryden would be entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b632 Bryden inexplicably relies on <em>Beck v. Atlantic Contracting Co., </em>Inc., 157 F.R.D. 61 (D. Kan. 1994), to support her claim that lost wages and unpaid bonuses in a wrongful discharge action constitute a sum certain for purposes of M. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1). Here the Clerk of Court entered the default <em>and </em>the default judgment. The clerk of court entered the default in <em>Beck, </em>but the <em>court </em>entered the default judgment. <em>Beck, </em>157 F.R.D. at 64. The District Court held no hearing in this case on the appropriateness of Bryden\u2019s claimed $140,000 in damages. The court in <em>Beck </em>held a hearing on the plaintiffs motion for entry of default judgment and ordered supplemental briefing by the parties. <em>Beck, </em>157 F.R.D. at 61. Only after the hearing and considering the evidence and argument presented by the parties did the court deem it appropriate to award the plaintiff the full amount of alleged damages. <em>Beck, </em>157 F.R.D. at 64. The court entered the default judgment pursuant to Rule 55(b)(2). <em>Beck, </em>157 F.R.D. at 64. Here, of course, the Clerk of Court entered the default judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b633 Moreover, the management agreement between Bryden and Lakeside allowed Bryden to be \u201celigible to receive an annual performance bonus based upon excellence in the performance of her duties and her enhancement of the company s business and financial condition.\u201dBryden\u2019s complaint alleges that Lakeside agreed to pay her $100 per week, contingent on her meeting certain conditions. The record contains no definition, however, of what constitutes these conditions. And the record contains no evaluation of whether Bryden had met the conditions giving rise to her bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b634  The District Court nevertheless determined that the \u201capproximately $14,000 in bonuses\u201d were capable of being made certain. We previously have held that a mere estimate of the amount of damages does not constitute a sum certain. <em>Hoyt v. Eklund, </em>249 Mont. 307, 311, 815 P.2d 1140, 1142 (1991). The plaintiff in <em>Hoyt </em>alleged that he would \u2018have to expend the sum of at least $86,000\u201d to repair alleged shoddy work undertaken by the defendant contractor. <em>Hoyt, </em>249 Mont. at 311, 815 P.2d at 1142. The Court reversed the clerk\u2019s entry of a default judgment on the grounds that the $86,000 alleged in the complaint did not constitute a sum certain. The clerk lacked authority to enter a default judgment under these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>circumstances where the $86,000 represented \u201cmerely an estimate\u201d of the damages. <em>Hoyt, </em>249 Mont. at 311, 815 P.2d at 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b635 The Clerk of Court in this case similarly lacked authority under M. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1), to enter a default judgment in the amount of $140,000. The contingencies not considered with regard to Lakeside\u2019s obligation to pay bonuses to Bryden and the lack of exploration into the \u201cdiligence\u201d of Bryden\u2019s efforts to find a replacement job renders the $140,000 judgment a mere estimate of potential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b636 Issue 3. Whether the District Court properly denied Lakeside\u2019s Motion to Set Aside the Default.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b637 Our decision to set aside the default judgment based upon the Clerk of Court\u2019s lack of authority leaves us in the unusual position of evaluating the validity of the default itself. We recognized in Essex <em>Ins. v. Jaycie, Inc., </em>2004 MT 278, \u00b6 10, 323 Mont. 231, 99 P.3d 651, that the interlocutory nature of defaults provides appellate courts few opportunities to review motions to set aside defaults. We clarified in <em>Essex Ins. </em>that courts should apply the more lenient \u201cgood cause\u201d standard of M. R. Civ. P. 55(c), rather than the stricter standard of M. R. Civ. P. 60(b), when reviewing whether to set aside a default. <em>Essex Ins., </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b638 M. R. Civ. P. 55(c) provides that a court should consider the following factors when deciding whether to set aside a default: (1) whether the default was willful, (2) whether the plaintiff would be prejudiced if the default were set aside, and (3) whether the defendant has presented a meritorious defense to the plaintiff s claim. <em>Essex Ins., </em>\u00b6 10. We already have discussed potentially meritorious defenses available to Lakeside regarding Bryden\u2019s duty to mitigate damages and whether Bryden had satisfied the criteria to entitle herself to bonuses. And we discern little prejudice to Bryden due to the short time frame from her first contact with Weimar regarding the claim on June 2, 2008, to the entry of default on July 16, 2008. As a result, we will focus our analysis on the willfulness prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b639 The District Court focused on the issue of excusable neglect in light of the fact that Bryden\u2019s counsel had sent Weimar a demand letter and a copy of an earlier version of the complaint and Bryden\u2019s counsel later had asked Lakeside\u2019s counsel to accept service on behalf of Lakeside. The court cited to our decision in <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 45, in concluding that Lakeside\u2019s counsel had an ongoing duty to monitor litigation. <em>Montana Professional Sports </em>presented a different factual scenario, however, than the present case. We will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>evaluate the same facts under the willfulness prong of the Rule 55(c) standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b640 The defendant football league and the football team initially tangled in a federal trademark dispute. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 9. The use by the league\u2019s Osceola, Florida franchise of the football team\u2019s federally protected trademark resulted in litigation in federal district court in Florida. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 9. The federal court enjoined the league from using the trademark in a decision issued on February 7, 2006. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 10. The league responded by suspending the Montana team for the season on March 9, 2006. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b641 The team brought an action in district court in Montana on March 9, 2006, to remain in the league and for compensatory and punitive damages. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 11. Counsel for the team contacted the league\u2019s general counsel by e-mail and telephone message on that same day to inform him that the team had filed the action. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 11. The team\u2019s counsel also informed the league\u2019s general counsel of a hearing that same day in district court on a temporary restraining order against the league. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b642 The league\u2019s general counsel participated by telephone in an informal conference with the court and the team\u2019s counsel. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 11. The court granted the temporary restraining order and set a hearing on the temporary injunction request. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 11. The team provided the league\u2019s general counsel with copies of the complaint, the summons, the application for temporary restraining order, and acknowledgment of service on March 9, 2006. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u00b643 The league\u2019s general counsel consulted with Montana counsel regarding the litigation, but took no further action to respond. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 12. The league\u2019s general counsel also failed to return the acknowledgement of services despite his earlier assurance to the team\u2019s counsel that he would. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 12. As a result, the team engaged a process server to serve a summons and complaint to the league\u2019s corporate headquarters in Louisiana. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 12. The process server successfully effected service at the league\u2019s headquarters and the league\u2019s counsel contacted the team\u2019s counsel on March 17, 2006, to confirm that he was aware that the team had served the complaint and related documents to the league\u2019s headquarters. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u00b644 The team and the league continued to conduct settlement negotiations during March and April of 2006 regarding the Montana action and the ancillary federal trademark action. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 16. The league took no action to enter an appearance, file an answer to the Montana action, or attempt to contact the court. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 16. The clerk of court entered a default against the league on April 10, 2006. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 17. The court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order on April 24,2006, granting the league\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 17. Once again, the league failed to make an appearance. The league moved for a default judgment on the underlying claims on May 2, 2006. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b645 The level of contact between Bryden and Lakeside\u2019s counsel regarding Bryden\u2019s complaint pales in comparison to the extended negotiations and litigation between the team and the league in <em>Montana Professional Sports. </em>Bryden\u2019s counsel first sent a letter to Weimar on June 2, 2008, in which he attached a copy of a proposed complaint. Weimar provided a copy of Bryden\u2019s proposed complaint to his counsel. Six weeks later, on July 16, 2008, Bryden had obtained a default entered by the Clerk of Court, a default judgment entered by the Clerk of Court, and a writ of execution entered by the Clerk of Court. At least six months elapsed from the time that the team informed the league of its trademark infringement in November 2005 until the team obtained entry of default against the league in April 2006. <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 17. The six month interlude included numerous contacts and negotiations between the league and the team.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b646  Bryden\u2019s counsel had one other contact with Lakeside\u2019s counsel when he called on June 23, 2008, to inquire whether Lakeside\u2019s counsel would accept service in Weimar\u2019s absence. Lakeside\u2019s counsel declined. The proposed complaint that Lakeside\u2019s counsel had reviewed named Weimar individually as a defendant. It was not unreasonable under the circumstances, and certainly not evidence of willfulness, for Lakeside\u2019s counsel to assume that the matter would be resolved upon Weimar\u2019s return from Alaska. Weimar could have authorized Lakeside\u2019s counsel to accept service of the complaint upon Weimar\u2019s return or Bryden could have served Weimar with the complaint personally upon Weimar\u2019s return. The District Court slightly abused its discretion in refusing to set aside the default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>under the good cause standard of M. R. Civ. P. 55(c). <em>Montana Professional Sports, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b647 Bryden successfully served Lakeside through its agent at the restaurant. We reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of Lakeside\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment, however, and vacate the default judgment entered by the Clerk of Court. We also reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of Lakeside\u2019s motion to set aside the default and vacate the default entered by the Clerk of Court. We remand to the District Court to allow Lakeside to file an answer within 30 days of the date of this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
