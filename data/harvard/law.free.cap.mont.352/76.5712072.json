We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b62 Zier presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b63 Issue One: Whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment to Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Whether the District Court properly awarded attorney fees to Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u00b65 This action arose from the efforts of Zier and Lewis to reach agreement on the terms of the sale to Zier of several thousand acres of land in Carbon County, Montana. When those efforts failed, Zier sued for specific performance of the sale, for damages he claimed from having sold another piece of property in anticipation of the sale, and for attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">\u00b66 Lewis owned the ranch property at issue and advertised it for sale. On November 17, 2005, Zier sent a letter to Lewis offering to purchase the ranch for $425,000 and enclosing a check for earnest money in the amount of $10,000. The letter contained other proposals, including terms regarding wind generation rights and mineral interests on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">\u00b67 On December 1, 2005, Zier phoned Sondra Wolsieffer, Lewis\u2019 business manager, to discuss his offer to purchase the ranch. Zier contends that during the call, Rex Lewis got on the line and accepted the offer. According to Zier\u2019s arguments on appeal, the parties entered a contract to purchase the ranch at this point, and it is this contract that he seeks to enforce. While Lewis denied that he accepted Zier\u2019s offer during the phone conversation, Zier contends on appeal that whichever version of the call is relied upon, \u201cthe result is the same. A binding contract was entered into.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">\u00b68 On December 15, 2005, Zier wrote Wolsieffer, stating his conclusion that his offer to purchase had been accepted in the December 1 phone conversation. The letter also noted conditions that Lewis would retain the right to negotiate a wind energy lease, and that Zier would retain \u201csurface rights\u201dto the property. Wolsieffer responded by email, acknowledging receipt of the letter and stating that they had contacted their attorney to request \u201cchanges in the easement.\u201d Two weeks later Zier sent Wolsieffer an email in which he stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>deal \u2018Will probably be ready to close by January 30, or possibly sooner.\u201d Wolsieffer responded by email, stating that they were \u201cmoving along with the documents\u201d and that they would be sent to Zier for review. During this time Zier sold property in Wyoming and planned to use part of the proceeds to purchase the Lewis property.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b69 On January 23, 2006, Wolsieffer sent a document titled \u201cAgreement to Sell and Purchase\u201d to Zier. The document included a property description, an easement to develop wind energy, and a wind energy development agreement. The documents gave Lewis a perpetual easement to develop all of the wind energy on the property, with half the net revenues going to Zier. The documents provided that Zier would be compensated for any damages to improvements that resulted from wind development.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b610 Zier called Wolsieffer to discuss his objections to the proposed contract and the fact that it was different from \u201cthe offer\u201d he had made. Zier wanted terms to provide for reimbursement for damages due to the loss of the \u201cuse of the land\u201d resulting from wind development, and not just reimbursement for damages to improvements. Zier then consulted with attorney Tom Towe, who sent Wolsieffer a letter on February 1, 2006, detailing objections to the proposed agreements, and containing a revised set of documents. Specifically, Towe stated that Zier would not give up all wind development rights; that he wanted 50% of the gross wind proceeds not net proceeds; that Zier \u201cvigorously\u201d objected to excluding environmental disclosure responsibilities; and that Lewis should be responsible for any required future environmental cleanup. The revised documents sent by Towe specifically provided that Zier could withdraw the offer to buy at any time unless it was accepted in writing by February 10, and that the offer would be automatically withdrawn if not accepted by that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b611 Lewis terminated negotiations for the sale of the property after the February 1, 2006, letter from Towe. An attorney for Lewis sent Towe a letter of February 7, 2006, returning the earnest money check and stating that Lewis was not interested in further discussions based upon the terms demanded in the February 1 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b612 On May 1,2006, Zier filed a \u201cComplaint for Specific Performance\u201d arid a lis pendens on the property. Zier sought specific performance of the sale of the property, damages for breach of contract, and an award of attorney fees and costs. The District Court entered a Memorandum and Order on February 19, 2008, granting summary judgment to Lewis on the ground that there was no enforceable contract for the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>of the property, and awarding attorney fees and costs to Lewis. On September 23, 2008, the District Court entered its order awarding Lewis $87,229.25 in attorney fees and $1,926.55 in costs. Zier appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b613 This Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment, applying the same criteria found in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>State Farm v. Gibson, </em>2007 MT 153, \u00b6 9, 337 Mont. 509, 163 P.3d 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b614 A district court\u2019s equitable decision to award attorney fees is reviewed to determine whether any factual findings are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. Section 3-2-204(5), MCA; <em>Kauffman-Harmon v. Kauffman, </em>2001 MT 238, \u00b6 11, 307 Mont. 45, 36 P.3d 408. The amount of attorney fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Chase v. Bearpaw Ranch Assoc., </em>2006 MT 67, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 421, 133 P.3d 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u00b615 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment to Lewis. </em>After the close of discovery, the District Court granted summary judgment to Lewis on the issue of whether there was a contract to sell the land, relying on \u201conly those facts which the parties have agreed to in their briefs or do not contest, the documents which were communicated between the parties, and the statements of Plaintiff Zier.\u201d The District Court found \u2018ho factual dispute with respect to any material fact necessary for Zier to establish the elements of his contract claim.\u201d The District Court concluded that Montana law, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">No agreement for the sale of real property or of any interest therein is valid unless the same, or some note or memorandum thereof, be in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged or his agent thereunto authorized in writing; but this does not abridge the power of any court to compel the specific performance of any agreement for the sale of real property in case of part performance thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Section 30-11-111, MCA. Similar provisions are found in \u00a7 28-2-903(l)(d), MCA. An agreement for the sale of real property, if made by an agent, is \u201cinvalid unless the authority of the agent is in writing and subscribed by the party sought to be charged.\u201d Section 28-2-903(l)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">\u00b616 The District Court found that Zier\u2019s evidence of email <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>correspondence between himself and Wolsieffer was not sufficient to satisfy the requirements for a written agreement subscribed by Lewis, the party sought to be charged. Zier did not present any evidence of a writing that Wolsieffer, as Lewis\u2019 agent, had authority to enter into an agreement to sell the property. Further, Zier\u2019s arguments that Wolsieffer had ostensible authority to bind Lewis were unavailing in light of the clear requirements that the agent\u2019s authority must be proven by a writing subscribed by Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b617 The District Court also held that Zier had failed to present evidence sufficient to establish all the material elements of an agreement to sell property, and particularly mutual consent. The emails and letters relied upon by Zier as containing all the material elements and conditions of the sale instead established \u201cthe absence of mutual consent and show that no agreement was reached on material contractual terms.... \u2019\u2019The District Court found that even if Wolsieffer had written authority to sell the land, she never told Zier that his offer to purchase had been accepted and instead told him that Lewis\u2019 attorney was preparing a contract for review. Zier never signed the contract proposed by Lewis and countered with the February 1 contract from Towe. The District Court concluded \u201cthat because material elements of a real estate contract for the sale of the Lewis Ranch were not mutually agreed to in writing prior to the Lewis Trust notifying Zier that negotiations were concluded, Zier cannot establish that a binding real estate contract was formed between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AL3\">\u00b618 The District Court considered the elements of the sale that were not settled at the time Lewis broke off negotiations. They included whether the wind development proceeds would be split on a gross or net basis; inclusion of a BLM lease; compensation for surface damages; and financial responsibility for future environmental remediation. Rather than being mere details, the District Court found that these points went \u2018to the heart and substance of the agreement between the parties.\u201dThese unsettled points, plus the fact that Towe\u2019s February 1 letter contained a deadline for Lewis to accept the conditions in writing, all indicated to the District Court that no binding real estate contract was ever formed between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b619 The essential elements of any contract are identifiable parties capable of contracting, consent, a lawful object, and sufficient consideration. <em>Patterson v. Verizon Wireless, </em>2005 MT 261, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 79, 122 P.3d 1193. Consent must be mutual, and the parties must agree upon the same thing, in the same sense. <em>Patterson, </em>\u00b6 11. Acceptance of an offer on terms varying from those offered is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>rejection of the offer, putting an end to the negotiation unless there is assent to the new terms. <em>Patterson, </em>\u00b6 11. Montana adheres to the \u201cstatute of frauds,\u201d which requires that when the contract involves the sale of real property, consent of the parties must be in writing. Sections 28-2-903 and 30-11-111, MCA; <em>Austin v. Cash, </em>274 Mont. 54, 60, 906 P.2d 669, 673 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b620 The District Court held that there was no contract between Zier and Lewis because there was no consent to the terms of a contract. While Zier contends that a contract was formed during a telephone conversation between himself, Wolsieffer, and Lewis, the subsequent actions of all the participants belie this contention. First, despite Zier\u2019s contention that he believed there was a contract and his reliance upon emails sent by Wolsieffer, nowhere in those emails is there an express acceptance of Zier\u2019s offer to buy the Lewis property. Contrast this with the telegram <em>in Hillstrom v. Gosnay, </em>188 Mont. 388, 391, 614 P.2d 466, 468 (1980), in which the seller stated: \u2018Please consider this as my written acceptance of that offer made on my real estate.... \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AFS\">\u00b621 There are no similar written words of agreement by Lewis. In addition to the absence of any written words of consent, Zier presented no proof that Wolsieffer had the written authority to allow her to bind Lewis to a sale of real property. Without such written authority, Wolsieffer had no power to bind Lewis. Section 28-2-903(l)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Af9\">\u00b622 Second, Zier\u2019s own actions up until the cessation of negotiations are inconsistent with the existence of a settled contract. The February 1 letter from his attorney Towe was clearly a counter-offer containing contract terms that the District Court properly found to be material. Towe\u2019s delivery of modified documents containing provisions demanded by Zier, along with a deadline for acceptance after which Zier\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d would be withdrawn, are inconsistent with Zier\u2019s professed belief that the parties had entered an enforceable contract. Clearly the parties were still in negotiation at the time Towe sent the letter with the counter-offer, and Lewis did not accept the counteroffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b623 A party may not obtain specific performance without first establishing that a valid and binding contract exists. <em>Austin, </em>274 Mont. at 62, 906 P.2d at 674; <em>Thornton v. Niswanger, </em>263 Mont. 390, 393, 868 P.2d 633, 635 (1994). Since the District Court properly held that there was no contract between the parties, Zier was not entitled to a decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>of specific performance. If the District Court had attempted to order specific performance, there would have been no way to determine the terms of the agreement. Zier argues that the parts of the contract that had not been agreed to were mere details that could be resolved by \u201cusage and practice.\u201d However, as the District Court found, the matters that remained unresolved when negotiations ended were not mere details but were critical issues. Zier has not suggested any reasonable way that the District Court could have resolved them by application of \u201cusage and practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b624 Zier argues that there was partial performance of the contract because he sold his property in Wyoming in anticipation of purchasing the Lewis property. Whether there has been sufficient part performance to take an otherwise unenforceable contract out of the statute of frauds is an issue of law, and the part performance must be \u201cunequivocally referable to [the] contract.\u201d <em>Austin, </em>274 Mont. at 61, 906 P.2d at 673-74. Acts undertaken in contemplation of eventual performance are not acts which \u2018truly constitute part performance of the contract so as to take it out of the operation of the statute of frauds.\u201d <em>Austin, </em>274 Mont. at 61, 906 P.2d at 673-74. In <em>Austin, </em>this Court specifically held that attempts to sell other property in anticipation of buying the disputed property did not constitute acts of part performance of the disputed contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b625 The same result applies here. Zier sold his Wyoming property to raise money in contemplation of the eventual purchase of the Lewis property. The sale was not, however, an act in performance of any contract with Lewis so as to take the transaction out of the statute of frauds. Moreover, Zier cannot rely upon principles of promissory estoppel, which are inapplicable to contracts subject to the writing requirements of the statute of frauds. <em>Austin, </em>274 Mont. at 62, 906 P.2d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b626 Zier contends that the contract to sell the ranch should be enforced on equitable grounds. Where the parties admit the existence of a contract but one attempts to avoid it by invoking the statute of frauds, courts are more inclined to enforce the contract on equitable grounds. <em>Hayes v. Hartelius, </em>215 Mont. 391, 396, 697 P.2d 1349, 1353 (1985); <em>Hillstrom, </em>188 Mont. at 395-96, 614 P.2d at 470. These principles are not applicable here where Lewis disputes the existence of a contract and his position was upheld by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b627  We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s determination that no contract existed and its order granting summary judgment for Lewis</p>\n<p id=\"AOm\">\u00b628 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court properly awarded attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>fees to Lewis. </em>The District Court\u2019s order on summary judgment awarded attorney fees and costs to Lewis. The decision to award fees was based upon the equitable power of a court to make a party whole. <em>Foy v. Anderson, </em>176 Mont. 507, 580 P.2d 114 (1978); <em>Holmstrom Land Co. v. Hunter, </em>182 Mont. 43, 595 P.2d 360 (1979). This is a narrow exception to the general rule that a prevailing party is not entitled to attorney fees absent a statutory or contractual basis. <em>Kennedy v. Dawson, </em>1999 MT 265, \u00b6 52, 296 Mont. 430, 989 P.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b629 The District Court found that Zier acted in \u201cdisregard of a clear, certain legal standard of contract and agency law as it pertains to the sale of real property\u201d by prosecuting the lawsuit on the theory that Wolsieffer had ostensible authority to bind Lewis to sell the land. In addition, the lis pendens filed by Zier along with the complaint clouded title to the Lewis property and made it impossible to sell to others. All this, the District Court found, caused Lewis to incur \u201csignificant attorney\u2019s fees to prove the obvious.\u201d Since the District Court found that Zier\u2019s lawsuit was without merit, the Noy exception applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b630 The District Court held a hearing on the award of attorney fees. Lewis presented the actual billings from its attorney along with expert testimony as to the reasonableness of the fee request, following the factors set out in <em>Chamberlin v. Puckett Const., </em>277 Mont. 198, 921 P.2d 1237 (1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Zier offered only his own attorney\u2019s billing for the case, but no testimony or other evidence as to the reasonableness of Lewis\u2019 attorney fee request or the hourly rate charged. Upon this record, the District Court stated that it was \u2018left little room to deviate from a finding for Lewis on his request for attorneys\u2019 fees in all respects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b631 Zier argued in the District Court, as he argues on appeal, that the contract was formed when he talked with Lewis on the phone, and that the writings confirming the agreement for purposes of the statute of frauds were the emails sent by Lewis\u2019 assistant Wolsieffer. The following discussion occurred between the District Court and Zier\u2019s attorney in connection with the motion for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">The Court: So, obviously, you have to agree that the only-I mean the only way that you could prevail here on this motion is to indicate that [Wolsieffer] was some sort of an agent of the Lewis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>trust, that her emails bound Lewis trust to this agreement, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\">Mr. Towe: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">The Court: And the law requires that if an agent of the party engages in this, that the agreement-let me just quote it-The agreement if made by an agent of the parties sought to be charged is invalid unless the authority of the agent is in writing and ascribed by the party sought to be charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">So, I guess the question I have for you is: Do we have an instrument here whereby it indicates in writing that this [Wolsieffer] is an agent for Lewis trust?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">Mr. Towe: We have ostensible authority, clear authority because there\u2019s no question but what all communication was done through [Wolsieffer]. Who was he supposed to assume had the authority to act? There was nothing indicating to the contrary. And consequently, she was the one that he addressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">The Court: The law requires this writing. And you\u2019re telling me that you have a theory of ostensible authority. I guess my question is: Do you have this document in writing that indicates [Wolsieffer] is an agent and has the authority to act on behalf of the trust? Is there such a document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">Mr. Towe: I don\u2019t know of such a document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The District Court was confronted with the question of whether this explanation was sufficient to save Zier\u2019s lawsuit from a declaration that the claims were frivolous. The District Court decided that the explanation-fehat Zier assumed the existence of Wolsieffer\u2019s authority-was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">\u00b632 The District Court did not make an error of law in awarding attorney fees to Lewis because the award was within the discretion provided by <em>Foy. </em>Further, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by relying on the factors in the case that indicated that Zier\u2019s claim was frivolous. Zier presented no facts or cogent argument to avoid the conclusion that there was no mutual consent to the terms of a contract to sell the Lewis land. Zier similarly presented no facts or cogent argument to avoid application of the writing requirements of the statute of frauds. Moreover, Zier\u2019s complaint prayed for an award of attorney fees and costs against Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">\u00b633 Zier also argues that the amount of fees awarded was unfair, comparing the much lower fees awarded in <em>Foy. </em>As the District Court found, Zier did not present any evidence to materially contest the hours claimed by Lewis\u2019 attorney or the hourly rate. Zier did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>present any testimony to counter the expert testimony presented by Lewis that the fee request was reasonable. Zier cannot complain about the amount of the fee award when he presented little or nothing to the District Court to contest the fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b634 The <em>Foy </em>exception allowing an equitable award of attorney fees does not presuppose that the award of fees will be great or small. As the <em>Foy </em>opinion noted, each such case must be decided on its own facts. <em>Foy, </em>176 Mont. at 511, 580 P.2d at 117. If a litigant is entitled to an award of fees, the amount of fees must be determined under the factors set out in the <em>Chamberlin </em>case, as the District Court did here.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b635  We find no error or abuse of discretion and affirm the District Court\u2019s award of fees and costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b113-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\"> Comparing telegrams to emails is not the issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\"> Those factors are the amount and character of the services; the labor, time and trouble involved; the character and importance of the litigation; the amount of money or the value of the property affected; the professional skill and experience required; the attorney\u2019s character and standing in the profession; and the result secured by the attorney. <em>Chamberlain, </em>277 Mont at 205, 921 P.2d at 1241-42.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
