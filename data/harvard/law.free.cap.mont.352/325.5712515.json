(Evenflo) after their four-month-old son Tyler suffered fatal brain injuries in a rollover car accident. The Malcolms alleged that the Evenflo \u2018On My Way\u201d (OMW) child safety seat contained a design defect that caused Tyler\u2019s death. The Malcolms asserted strict liability in tort. Evenflo appeals from a judgment in the Sixth Judicial District, Park County, following a jury trial. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it excluded Evenflo\u2019s evidence that the OMW model 207 complied with FMVSS 213 for the purposes of compensatory damages ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting evidence regarding the recall and test failures of the OMW model 206?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by applying unfairly its FMVSS 213 evidentiary ruling with respect to compensatory damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AkJ\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it excluded Evenflo\u2019s FMVSS 213 compliance evidence with respect to punitive damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND The \u2018On My Way\u201d Child Safety Seat</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">\u00b67 Evenflo manufactures child restraint systems, or child seats. Evenflo marketed the OMW as a rear-facing vehicle child safety seat intended for transporting infants weighing up to 20 pounds. Evenflo designed the OMW for use with or without its detachable base. The user routed the vehicle\u2019s seat belt through an enclosed seat belt \u201ctunnel\u201d on the base when they used the detachable base. The seat then latched into the base. The user also could unlatch the seat from the base and use it as a baby carrier. When used without the base, Evenflo designed the seat belt to be slipped into a U-shaped, open-ended plastic seat belt hook on one side of the seat. The user would route the seat belt over the seat\u2019s foot-end and through an open-ended plastic seat belt hook on the other side of the seat. The user then latched the seat belt into the vehicle\u2019s seat belt buckle.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\u00b68 The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) requires that all child restraint systems comply with the minimum requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 (FMVSS 213). <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7571.213 (2009). NHTSArequired Evenflo to conduct internal testing of the OMW to determine if it complied with the FMVSS 213 standards. NHTSA and Transport Canada, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Canadian testing agency, conducted random audit FMVSS 213 tests in addition to Evenflo\u2019s internal testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b69 FMVSS testing consists in part of a front-end sled test at speeds of 27-30 mph. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.213 (1994). In the sled test, the tester accelerates a child restraint seat and a test dummy to 30 mph and crashes it into a frontal barrier. The child restraint seat must manage the force from the crash \u201cso that the forces imparted to the dummy are within tolerable limits.\u201d 67 Fed. Reg. 21806, 21812 (May 1, 2002). FMVSS 213 does not require side-impact, rear-impact, or rollover testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b610 Evenflo first manufactured the OMW model 206 in May of 1994. By February of 1995, Evenflo\u2019s internal testing indicated that the production model 206 was prone to failure of the plastic seat belt hooks and/or the adjacent plastic shell. Internal videotapes showed the OMW seats breaking apart in the area of the vehicle seat belt path. The breaking caused the OMW to come loose from the test sled\u2019s seat belt. The videotapes depicted the OMW ejecting from the sled due to the open belt hook design.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b611 Evenflo briefly halted production of the OMW. Evenflo notified NHTSA on June 12, 1995, that it was going to conduct a \u201cconsumer corrective action/recall campaign\u201d as the OMW did not meet the requirements of FMVSS 213. Evenflo represented to NHTSA that the hazard posed by the design of the OMW model 206 was a \u201cseparation\u201d under the seat\u2019s cloth padding that resulted in a sharp edge that could cause a \u201ccut or pinch\u201d hazard to the child. Evenflo did not notify NHTSA that the OMW\u2019s belt hooks had broken off in some tests and that these breaks had caused the OMW to detach from the vehicle restraint system.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b612 Evenflo had manufactured and sold approximately 200,000 OMWs at the time of the recall. Evenflo designed a plastic \u201cretrofit kit\u201d to be riveted into the underside of the safety seat. Evenflo mailed the plastic retrofit kit to the current OMW users. Evenflo described the recall as a \u201cconsumer corrective action\u201d and instructed the OMW owners to install the plastic insert using double-sided tape. Evenflo also had approximately 55,000 OMW model 206s in its inventory at the time of the recall. Evenflo installed the retrofit kit on its unsold inventory. Evenflo rebranded the retrofitted OMWs as model 207x and sent all 55,000 seats to retailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u00b613 Evenflo altered the plastic mold used to create the OMW at a total cost of $2500. Evenflo added ribs, gussets, and fillets and designated the modified OMW as model 207. Evenflo did not change the OMW\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>open belt hook design. Evenflo resumed production of the OMW model 207 in July of 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b614 In 1997, Ruthie Gonzales of Merced, California, reported to Evenflo that her retrofitted model 207 OMW\u2019s belt hook had broken off during a rollover accident. The OMW came loose from the seatbelt and ended up on her front dashboard. Devon Orneleas of Patterson, California, reported to Evenflo on August 10, 1999, that both belt hooks had broken off her production model 207 in a rollover accident. Ms. Orneleas testified that the OMW came loose from the vehicle seat belt and flew forward when the seat hooks fractured and broke away. Ms. Orneleas found her baby, still secured in the child seat, on the front seat floorboard after the rollover.</p>\n<p id=\"AgEH\">\u00b615 Ms. Orneleas testified that she had reported the incident because she wanted Evenflo to know \u201cthat they had a defective product and I wanted them to recall it.\u201d Ms. Orneleas testified that when she called Evenflo, the customer service representative said that \u201cshe was shocked and hadn\u2019t heard of that before.\u201d Ms. Orneleas further testified that Evenflo had called her back and told her that the OMW was designed to withstand only a 30 mph frontal crash, rather than the physical forces present in a rollover crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b616 Evenflo denied that it had made this statement and claimed that Ms. Orneleas \u201cmust have misunderstood.\u201d Three other OMW owners also called Evenflo in the years before the Malcolm accident to report that seatbelts had slipped out of the open belt hook of the OMW in rollover, side-impact, and rear-end situations. Evenflo did not test the OMW in rear-end, side impact, or rollover scenarios before the Malcolm accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The Malcolm Accident</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b617 The Malcolms lived south of Livingston, Montana, on a ranch near Emigrant. Chad Malcolm was the fourth generation of the family to ranch in the area. A friend gave Jessica Malcolm the OMW while Jessica was pregnant with Tyler. Jessica called Evenflo to ask if the OMW model 207 was safe to use. Evenflo assured her that the OMW was not subject to any of their recalls and that the OMW was safe to use. Evenflo Director of Product Safety Randolph Kiser testified that Jessica Malcolm did not have a right to know about the cracking during testing or the owner reports of seatbelts slipping out of the open belt hooks unless Evenflo considered the problem to be a \u201crampant safety related defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u00b618 Jessica Malcolm drove to Emigrant on the evening of July 16, 2000, in her 1996 Suburban to pick up pizza and a movie with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>sister and her son Tyler. She then drove back south on Highway 89 toward the ranch. Malcolm\u2019s sister rode in the passenger seat and Tyler rode in the back in the OMW model 207 child seat. A northbound motorist swerved into Malcolm\u2019s lane and forced Malcolm off the road. The Suburban rolled three times, traveled down a steep incline, and stopped in a ditch. The accident occurred within sight of the Malcolms\u2019 ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b619 Jessica Malcolm did not suffer serious injury. Her sister sustained a severe head injury. The left belt hook of the OMW broke off during the rollover. The seat belt slipped out from the open-ended belt hook on the opposite side of the seat. The forces of the accident ejected the OMW from the Suburban. The OMW came to rest approximately 60 feet from the Suburban. Tyler remained strapped in the OMW. Tyler suffered brain injuries that resulted in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Pretrial</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b620 The Malcolms\u2019 case sounded exclusively in strict liability in tort, design defect theory. The Malcolms claimed that the Evenflo OMW model 207 infant child safety seat constituted a defectively designed product that failed catastrophically even though they had used the seat in a reasonably anticipated manner. The Malcolms pointed to the OMW\u2019s open-ended belt hook design and the lack of expanded polystyrene (EPS) padding. The Malcolms contended that Evenflo could have manufactured the OMW using a feasible superior alternative design that required the vehicle\u2019s seatbelt to be routed through an enclosed seat belt tunnel even when the seat was used without the base. The Malcolms also sought punitive damages. The Malcolms alleged that Evenflo \u201ccontinued selling the defective product in conscious, deliberate and intentional disregard of the danger presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b621 Evenflo contended that the OMW model 207 was not defective in any way. Evenflo argued that the severity of the forces involved in the accident solely caused Tyler\u2019s death. Evenflo argued that the \u201ctremendous forces\u201d that occurred during the rollover forced open the rear passenger door, which was immediately adjacent to Tyler\u2019s child seat. Evenflo posited that Tyler\u2019s car seat came into direct contact with the ground as the Suburban rolled. Evenflo suggested that the contact caused the seat to detach from the seat belt system and ultimately fly out the open door. Evenflo emphasized that the production model 207 passed each of the FMVSS tests conducted on the seat. Evenflo also argued that the OMW model 207 differed completely from the OMW model 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u00b622 The parties conducted extensive discovery and filed numerous pretrial motions. Evenflo contended in its motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of punitive damages that \u201cthere is a complete absence of evidence of either actual fraud or actual malice.\u201d Evenflo also claimed that its alleged compliance with FMVSS 213 preempted the Malcolms\u2019 punitive damages claim. The District Court rejected Evenflo\u2019s preemption claim and concluded that Evenflo had failed to show an absence of genuine issues of material fact regarding punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b623 The District Court granted the Malcolms\u2019 motion in limine to exclude arguments by Evenflo that the OMW model 207 complied with FMVSS 213. The District Court reasoned that evidence of compliance with FMVSS 213 \u201cdoes not appear to be relevant to the issues or facts in this case.\u201d The District Court stated that even if evidence of Evenflo\u2019s alleged compliance with FMVSS 213 was relevant, \u201cit is more prejudicial than probative and would confuse the jury.\u201d The District Court denied Evenflo\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b624 The District Court conducted a jury trial from July 16 to July 25, 2007. The Malcolms testified as to the severe trauma that resulted from Tyler\u2019s death. Jessica and Chad both had undergone personality changes. Chad Malcolm no longer could perform competently the daily ranch work. The Malcolms could not face living in such close proximity to the location of the accident. The Malcolms eventually moved into Livingston. Chad went to work for a gravel company. Jessica obtained certification as a child seat fit expert and advocated for safer child seats.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b625 Both sides presented expert witnesses. The Malcolms contended that the OMW model 206 and model 207 were identical with respect to the faulty design of the open belt hook and the lack of padding. The Malcolms\u2019 design expert Lou D\u2019Aulerio testified that he had analyzed 582 sled tests conducted on the OMW under the FMVSS 213 standards. The tests included the OMW models 206 and 207 and prototypes. D\u2019Aulerio compiled an 11-page chart titled\u2018Chronological List of Test Failures.\u201d The chart included a column of \u2018Test Report Remarks\u201d that consisted of excerpts from the test reports that described cracks, tears, and other \u2018failures\u201d of the shell. D\u2019Aulerio determined that Evenflo had noted that the plastic shell had cracked or fractured in 157, or 27%, of the tests. D\u2019Aulerio designated these tests \u2018failures.\u201d The Malcolms also mentioned these test \u2018failures\u201d during their opening statement and closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u00b626 Evenflo argued that many of the tests cited by D\u2019Aulerio were irrelevant because they involved models other than the model 207. Evenflo insisted that the District Court should allow Evenflo to respond to D\u2019Aulerio\u2019s testimony by introducing evidence that the OMW model 207 had passed each test based on FMVSS 213 standards. Evenflo contended that the District Court unfairly was applying its motion in limine regarding FMVSS 213 testing by allowing the Malcolms to introduce evidence that the OMW model 206 had \u2018failed\u201d during testing without allowing Evenflo to introduce evidence that the OMW model 207 had \u201cpassed\u201d according to the minimal requirements of FMVSS 213 in each of those instances. The District Court rejected Evenflo\u2019s arguments regarding FMVSS 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b627 The jury awarded the Malcolms $6,697,491 in compensatory damages. The jury also awarded the Malcolms $3,700,000 in punitive damages in a separate proceeding conducted the following day, pursuant to \u00a727-l-221(7)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Post-trial</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b628 The District Court reviewed the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages as required by \u00a727-l-221(7)(c), MCA. Evenflo argued that the court improperly had excluded evidence of Evenflo\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213. Evenflo relied in part on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sunburst School Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079, which we decided after the jury\u2019s verdict in this case. The District Court affirmed the jury\u2019s punitive damages award. The District Court also denied Evenflo\u2019s post-trial motions, including its motion for a new trial, motion for remittitur, motion for judgment as a matter of law. Evenflo appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\u00b629 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 74. A district court possesses broad discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 74. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or so exceeds the bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice. <em>State v. Giddings, </em>2009 MT 61, \u00b6 42, 349 Mont. 347, 208 P.3d 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">\u00b630 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it excluded Evenflo\u2019s evidence that the OMW model 207 complied with FMVSS 213 for the purposes of compensatory damages ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u00b631 Section 27-1-719, MCA, governs design defect liability in Montana. A person who sells a product in a defective condition is liable for the physical harm caused by the defective product. Section 27-1-719, MCA; <em>Wise v. Ford Motor Company, </em>284 Mont. 336, 340, 943 P.2d 1310, 1312 (1997). A product is defective if it is dangerous to an extent beyond that anticipated by the ordinary user. <em>McAlpine v. Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co., </em>2000 MT 383, \u00b6 25, 304 Mont. 31, 16 P.3d 1054; Mont. Pattern Jury Instr. Civ. 7.01 (2d rev. ed. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b632 Strict liability recognizes that the seller is in the best position to insure product safety. <em>Sternhagen v. Dow Co., </em>282 Mont. 168, 180, 935 P.2d 1139, 1146 (1997). Design defect liability therefore places the risk of loss on the manufacturer. This imposition of risk provides \u201can incentive to design and produce fail-safe products which exceed reasonable standards of safety.\u201d <em>Sternhagen, </em>282 Mont. at 178, 935 P.2d at 1145. Design defect strict liability may be imposed even if the seller has \u201cexercised all possible care,\u201d and even though the product was faultlessly manufactured. <em>See McAlpine, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 21; \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA; Mont. Pattern Jury Instr. Civ. 7.00, 7.02 (2d rev. ed. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b633 Evenflo argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it excluded any evidence that the OMW model 207 complied with FMVSS 213. Evenflo contends that the fact that the OMW model 207 passed 341 tests performed under FMVSS 213 is \u2018highly relevant to [the Malcolms\u2019] claim that the model 207 was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\u201dEvenflo opines that FMVSS 213 is a \u201csevere\u201d test with \u201cstrict performance standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b634 Evenflo urges this Court to adopt the <em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability </em>\u00a74 (1998). Section 4 provides that compliance with an applicable regulation is admissible in connection with liability for defective design. Evenflo contends that the majority ofjurisdictions hold that compliance with product safety regulation is relevant and admissible on the question of defectiveness, but is not necessarily controlling. Evenflo also contends that this Court has adopted the <em>Restatement (Third) </em>approach in the negligence context. Evenflo argues that \u2018Tt]here is no reason why such highly relevant evidence should be admissible in negligence, but not products liability cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5Fb\">\u00b635 Evenflo points to <em>Martel v. Montana Power Co., </em>231 Mont. 96, 752 P.2d 140 (1988). Martel suffered severe injuries after coming into contact with power lines owned by Montana Power. <em>Martel, </em>231 Mont. at 98-99, 752 P.2d at 142. Martel alleged that Montana Power negligently had failed to comply with the National Electric Safety Code. <em>Martel, </em>231 Mont. at 100-03, 752 P.2d at 142-45. The Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>that a violation of \u201cdesign standards intended to protect the public\u201d constitutes negligence per se. <em>Martel, </em>231 Mont. at 103, 752 P.2d at 145. The Court further noted that bare compliance with such a statute does not necessarily establish due care. <em>Martel, </em>231 Mont. at 104, 752 P.2d at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b636 This Court reiterated those principles in <em>Schmidt v. Washington Contractors Group, Inc., </em>1998 MT 194, 290 Mont. 276, 964 P.2d 34. Schmidt sustained injuries when he crashed his motorcycle while descending a temporary freeway entrance ramp in a construction zone. <em>Schmidt, </em>\u00b6 3. The Court noted that the construction company owed a duty of ordinary care in maintaining the road construction site in a reasonably safe condition. <em>Schmidt, </em>\u00b6 15. The construction company argued that it was not negligent as it properly had posted warning signs as required by the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). <em>Schmidt, </em>\u00b6 12. The Court stated that \u201cevidence of compliance with the MUTCD does not necessarily establish due care because the MUTCD, like any other national industry standard or code, is only a minimum standard.\u201d <em>Schmidt, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b637 The District Court correctly recognized, however, that Montana draws \u201ca bright line\u201dbetween cases asserting strict liability in tort and those grounded in negligence theory. The court pointed to <em>Lutz v. National Crane Corp., </em>267 Mont. 368, 385, 884 P.2d 455, 465 (1994). Lutz died from electrocution when a crane\u2019s cable contacted a power line. <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 372, 884 P.2d at 457. Lutz\u2019s estate claimed that the crane\u2019s failure to include insulating links constituted a defective design. <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 372-73, 884 P.2d at 457. The manufacturer attempted to introduce evidence that governmental regulations did not require that cranes be equipped with insulated links. <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 384, 884 P.2d at 464. This Court affirmed the district court\u2019s exclusion of the evidence. <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 385, 884 P.2d at 465. The Court observed that Twjhile most courts allow government regulations to be used against manufacturers in negligence cases, the same is not true where the issue is strict liability.\u201d <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 385, 884 P.2d at 465.

The District Court extensively analyzed both FMVSS 213 and the nature of the Malcolm accident in determining that evidence of compliance with FMVSS 213 would not be relevant to the question of whether Evenflo had sold the OMW model 207 in a defective condition. The District Court emphasized in its post-trial order that the FMVSS 213 \u201caddresses only minimum levels of performance in 27-30 mph <em>frontal </em>impacts.\u201dThe court further noted that \u2018FMVSS 213 does not set forth any requirements, or create any reasonable expectations in the mind of the manufacturer, concerning the dynamic performance of a child seat in a motor vehicle rollover.\u201d The court stated that evidence at trial had established that \u201cthe dynamic forces unleashed in a high-speed rollover collision are very different from those present in a minimal 27 to 30 mph frontal crash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b642 The District Court added that \u201cthe risk of mischief and jury confusion\u201d inherent in allowing Evenflo to defend based on the \u201cself-serving\u201d argument that the OMW model 207 had \u201cpassed\u201dFMVSS 213 was \u201cparticularly apparent when the limited purpose of the federal motor vehicle standards is viewed in the light of Montana products liability law.\u201d The District Court recognized that the safety standards are \u201ca minimum standard for motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment performance.\u201d <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a730102(a)(9) (2006).

The District Court acted within its \u201cbroad discretion\u201d when it determined that evidence of the OMW model 207\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213 would be irrelevant to the Malcolms\u2019 design defect strict liability claim. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 74. We also cannot determine that the District Court abused its discretion when it concluded that even if Evenflo\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213\u2019s \u201cminimal standards\u201d would be relevant, the evidence would be more prejudicial than probative and might tend to mislead or confuse the jury. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 74.

Evenflo argues that the court allowed the Malcolms to ''put on trial a different child seat\u201d than the Malcolms\u2019 OMW model 207. Evenflo contends that the OMW model 206 and model 207 are substantially different seats and that the mode of alleged failure that led to the model 206\u2019s recall differed from the alleged defect in the model 207. The Malcolms argue that \u201can ejection due to the defective open belt hook design in a model 206 is the same as one in a 207.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\u00b647 Evenflo representative Randolph Kiser testified that Evenflo had recalled the OMW model 206 due to its failure to conform to FMVSS 213. The District Court admitted letters between Evenflo and NHTSA that referred to the OMW model 206\u2019s failure to comply with the standards of FMVSS 213. The court also admitted videos of the OMW model 206 breaking apart during FMVSS 213 testing. The District Court allowed the Malcolms\u2019 expert D\u2019Aulerio to testify regarding the cracks and other damage to the model 206 that had occurred during FMVSS 213 testing. The court further allowed the Malcolms to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>introduce D\u2019Aulerio\u2019s \u2018Test Failures\u201d chart into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Substantial Similarity</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b648 Evenflo broadly asserts that \u201c[i]t is generally improper in a products liability case to admit evidence regarding a product model other than the one at issue.\u201d The three out-of-jurisdiction cases that Evenflo cites do not support its sweeping assertion. The courts in each case excluded evidence of different product models due to lack of similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b649 For example, in <em>Brock v.

The trial court permitted the expert to base his opinion on a comparison with the allegedly improved braking system of the newer and much larger model DIO. <em>Brock, </em>94 F.3d at 224-25. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court had committed prejudicial error on the grounds that the comparison between the two models at most was \u2018tenuously relevant.\u201d <em>Brock, </em>94 F.3d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u00b650 The court recognized that evidence of product failures \u201cof substantial similarity\u201d would be \u201crelevant and admissible.\u201d <em>Brock, </em>94 F.3d at 224. The court highlighted the substantial differences between the Caterpillar model D9H and the model DIO. <em>Brock, </em>94 F.3d at 224-26. The court noted that \u2018there were a large number of changes in character, size, style, and technological advancement between the manufacture design of the D9H ... and that of the DIO some years later.\u201d <em>Brock, </em>94 F.3d at 225.

The plaintiffs intended to use the reports to impeach the assertions of the defense\u2019s expert witness, made in response to plaintiffs\u2019 own questions, that these other models could not produce a relatively large fire. <em>McBurney, </em>771 A.2d at 911. The court cited the fact that the toasters were different models with features that varied from those in the toaster that the plaintiffs claimed had ignited the building fire. <em>McBurney, </em>771 A.2d at 911-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b652 Evenflo also points to <em>Blevins v.

Evidence of injuries caused by similar models would be relevant to proving punitive damages as \u2018the existence of similar injuries tends to demonstrate the manufacturer\u2019s knowledge of the \u2018high probability of injury.\u2019\u201d <em>Preston, </em>282 Mont. at 209, 936 P.2d at 819. The Court added that \u2018information of similar injuries caused by other models of nailers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>... would be relevant to the issues of whether the design was unreasonably dangerous, whether [the manufacturer] was aware of the danger, and whether [the manufacturer] was aware of a viable, alternative design.\u201d <em>Preston, </em>282 Mont. at 209, 936 P.2d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b656 Evenflo insists that \u201ccourts routinely exclude evidence regarding the recall of different models, especially where the recall involved a different defect.\u201dEvenflo again points solely to out-of-jurisdiction cases that fail to support its broad proposition. In <em>Lewy v. Remington Arms Co., Inc., </em>836 F.2d 1104, 1108-09 (8th Cir. 1988), the Eighth Circuit reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the plaintiff to introduce extensive evidence concerning the Remington model 600 rifle in a product liability action that involved the Remington model 700 rifle. The court acknowledged that the model 600 evidence would have been relevant if the model 600 had been \u201csubstantially similar in design and manufacture\u201d to the model 700 with respect to the design defect at issue. <em>Lewy, </em>836 F.2d at 1109. The court emphasized numerous differences between the two models with respect to the design defect at issue, however, and determined that the plaintiffs had not met their \u2018burden of showing substantial similarity.\u201d <em>Lewy, </em>836 F.2d at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"AvG\">\u00b657 The other cases cited by Evenflo emphasize the dissimilarity between product models or involve facts and procedural postures easily distinguishable from the Malcolms\u2019 case. <em>See Olson v. Ford Motor Co., </em>410 F. Supp. 2d 869 (D.

The Malcolms, by contrast, introduced evidence that the model 206 and 207 were substantially similar with respect to the defects at issue. The evidence included the Malcolms\u2019 expert D\u2019Aurelio\u2019s testimony that the OMW model 206 and 207 were \u2018identical\u201d with respect to the open belt hook design and the lack of EPS padding. Evenflo representative Kiser admitted that the seatbelt hook design was \u2018(pretty close\u201d to absolutely identical. Kiser also admitted that a risk existed that the belt hooks could fail and allow the seat to slip off the seatbelt of any OMW models, including the 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b658  The District Court acted within its discretion when it determined that the model 206 and model 207 were substantially similar with respect to the design defects alleged by the Malcolms. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 74. The substantial similarity between the two models <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>dictates that evidence regarding the model 206 would be relevant to whether Evenflo had sold the model 207 to the Malcolms in a \u201cdefective condition unreasonably dangerous to a user.\u201d Section 27-1-719(2), MCA. Evidence of cracks, shearing of belt hooks, and FMVSS 213 test failures of the model 206 \u201cwould be relevant to both the \u2018defect\u2019 and the \u2018danger.\u2019\u2019\u2019 Preston, 282 Mont. at 209, 936 P.2d at 819. The District Court acted within its discretion when it decided that evidence regarding the model 206 constituted relevant evidence in determining Evenflo\u2019s liability for compensatory damages. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b659 The District Court also determined that evidence of Evenflo\u2019s actions surrounding the 1995 recall would be relevant for the purpose of the Malcolms\u2019 punitive damages claim. Evenflo repeatedly argues that evidence of the 1995 recall of the OMW model 206 should be inadmissible as the Malcolms\u2019 alleged defect in the model 207 \u201cdiffer[s] from the problem that prompted the Model 206\u2019s recall.\u201d Evenflo claims that \u201ccracking in some shells\u201dconstituted \u201cthe sole basis\u201dfor the 1995 recall of the model 206. Evenflo claims that the Malcolms Incorrectly imply that the Model 206 was recalled because of its open belt hook design. If the belt hook design had triggered the recall, NHTSA never would have allowed Evenflo to sell the Model 207.\u201d Evenflo argues that \u201c[t]he proof is in the pudding. Unlike the Model 206, the Model 207 complies with FMVSS 213-a fact the jury never heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b660 Evenflo\u2019s argument disregards the Malcolms\u2019 evidence that the model 206 contained the same defects as the model 207. <em>See </em>\u00b6 57. Evenflo represented to NHTSA and consumers that \u201ccracking in some shells\u201d and a \u201ccut and pinch\u201d hazard constituted the sole reason for the recall of the model 206. The Malcolms presented evidence, however, that Evenflo knew from test results and test videotapes that the breaking apart of the seat in the area of the vehicle seat belt path and the resulting loss of restraint of the child seat constituted the true hazard of the model 206. Evenflo ignores the fact that this incomplete representation to NHTSA formed a major basis of the Malcolms\u2019 punitive damages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b661 The District Court noted in its order denying Evenflo\u2019s motion for a new trial that Evenflo had used evidence of its \u201ccooperation and interaction with the NHTSA\u201d in connection with its 1995 \u201cconsumer corrective action\u201d involving the OMW model 206 to argue against liability for punitive damages. The District Court correctly observed that the Malcolms had \u201cused this same evidence to show ... how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Evenflo lied to NHTSA, the public and even Jessi Malcolm about how badly the [OMW] was breaking apart, and the true ejection hazards posed to children riding in safety seats with open belt hooks.\u201d The court further determined that \u2018Evenflo\u2019s so-called \u2018fix\u2019 incorporated into the model 207 did nothing to eliminate the ejection hazard posed by the open belt hook design.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b662 Evenflo claims that \u201c[t]he Malcolm case is the only case involving an allegation that the belt hook of a Model 207 broke and caused death or serious injury to a child. It is also the only known case of a child being ejected from a vehicle while in a Model 207.\u201d Evenflo\u2019s claim ignores the reports that it received of OMW model 207 belt hooks breaking off, releasing from the vehicle seat belt, with the baby and seat bouncing around in the passenger compartment. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-16. Evenflo made the same assertion in its cross-examination of D\u2019Aulerio. D\u2019Aulerio replied that it was \u201ca miracle\u201dthat the babies involved in the other accidents had not been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\u00b663  Evenflo\u2019s conduct surrounding the testing and recall of the model 206 constituted relevant evidence regarding Evenflo\u2019s state of mind with respect to its sale of the model 207. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 81.

Evenflo equates any mention of the word \u2018failure\u201d with a \u201cpass\u201d or \u2018fail\u201d of the official standards of FMVSS 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b667 The Malcolms raised the issue of the OMW\u2019s test \u2018failures\u201d in their opening statement. The Malcolms referred to sled testing conducted by government agencies, Evenflo, and Consumer Reports that showed cracks on the OMW shell and a tendency for the belt hook to break under stress. The Malcolms claimed that the OMW had been tested 582 times, with 157 \u2018failures.\u201dEvenflo argued in chambers that the court should have allowed it to inform the jury that \u2018the testing agency that was running this test deemed the result a pass.\u201d The Malcolms responded that they were referring to \u201ccracks, rips, and tears ... failures in the shell,\u201d rather than any \u2018failure\u201d of the test standard as determined by any governmental agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b668 The Malcolms\u2019 expert D\u2019Aulerio testified that he had reviewed 582 tests performed on Evenflo OMW child seats. D\u2019Aulerio found 157 tests where \u2018there was some kind of problem, either a fracture or a crack, or a break, in some instances a total complete fracture of the belt hook.... It worked out to be, like, twenty-seven percent of the tests.\u201d The tests included the model 206, model 207, and prototypes of both models. D\u2019Aulerio testified that the tests were \u201ca big huge red flag\u201d that indicated a defect in the OMW. Evenflo contends that \u201c[t]he jurors who heard that testimony could only have believed that the Model 207 regularly failed in testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b669 The District Court also allowed the Malcolms to introduce into evidence as Exhibit 278-AD\u2019Aulerio\u2019s 11-page\u2018test failures\u201dchart. <em>See </em>\u00b6 25. The court denied Evenflo\u2019s motion to introduce the underlying test reports pursuant to the rule of completeness. Evenflo argues that Malcolms\u2019 opening and closing arguments \u201cserved to ensure that the jury would gather from D\u2019Aulerio\u2019s testimony and his \u2018test failures\u2019 chart that Evenflo\u2019s Model 207 seats had failed in testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b670 Evenflo further points to Evenflo representative Randolph Kiser\u2019s testimony on cross-examination. Kiser testified that Evenflo had recalled the OMW model 206 due to its failure to conform to FMVSS 213. Evenflo contends that Kiser\u2019s testimony left the jury with the false impression that the model 207 also must have failed tests. The Malcolms also elicited testimony from Kiser that the Malcolms\u2019 superior alternative tunnel design never had failed in testing. Evenflo argued that the court should have allowed it to introduce evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the model 207 likewise never had failed in testing even without the tunnel design.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b671 Counsel for the Malcolms also referred to test \u2018failures\u201d in his closing argument. For example, counsel for the Malcolms made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">Ladies and gentlemen, Exhibit 278-A, that is the list, the chronological list, of all the testing. And you can look for yourself and see the dates of the tests, and you can see the descriptions that Evenflo actually had as to the nature of these cracks. There was a lot of seats, after production started up in late July of 1995. Dozens, and dozens, and dozens of seats in which there were cracks of varying degrees and magnitude in this seat. Now, the crack, itself, doesn\u2019t mean the child is going to get killed, but what it is is it\u2019s notice that your margin of safety in this design is so thin that you\u2019re getting cracks at these speeds. What\u2019s going to happen if you are involved in a higher speed impact?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Exhibit 278-A lists the \u2018test failures\u201d compiled by D\u2019Aurelio. Counsel for the Malcolms continued throughout their closing to press the point that Evenflo knew about the design defects from its tests. Counsel argued that \u2018Evenflo knew about it. They knew about it from its tests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AgP\">\u00b672 Although the District Court did not allow Evenflo to state specifically that the OMW model 207 had passed FMVSS 213, the court did allow Evenflo some latitude. Evenflo informed the jury in its opening statement that the testing that resulted in the recall involved only the model 206. Evenflo explained that it had changed the OMW before it produced the model 207. Evenflo argued that the \u201ctests don\u2019t tell you anything, at all, about either the Malcolm accident or the Malcolm seat. This wasn\u2019t even the same model seat.\u201d Evenflo went on to state that the production model 207 \u201cwas tested another 320 times by NHTSA, by the Canadian Government, by Evenflo, by independent labs, and it passed every test. Every test, it passed.\u201d Evenflo argued that the Malcolms\u2019 expert D\u2019Aulerio was \u2018the only person that\u2019s going to testify that ... the Canadians, they got it wrong, NHTSA got it wrong, the independent labs got it wrong, the car seats didn\u2019t really pass those tests.\u201d Evenflo reiterated that \u201c[t]here is not one testing agency that has found that the 207 did not pass the test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\u00b673 Evenflo representative Kiser testified that the OMW model 207 never was recalled, \u2018tunjlike the 206.\u201d Kiser stated that \u201c[not] one single video\u201d showed the model 207 breaking apart like the model 206. Kiser testified at length regarding the engineering changes that Evenflo had made to the OMW after the model 206 recall. Kiser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>pointed out that D\u2019Aulerio had counted \u201cfailures\u201d in model 206 seats and prototype seats in his \u201ctest failures\u201d chart. Riser further testified that the NHTSA had conducted 22 tests on the model 207 and had not observed any cracks or any problems with the belt hooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b674 Evenflo witness William Van Arsdell, an engineer and design expert, also testified at trial. Evenflo\u2019s counsel distinguished the OMW model 207 and the model 206 at the beginning of Van Arsdell\u2019s testimony. Van Arsdell opined that the Malcolms\u2019 OMW model 207 child seat was \u2018hot defective in any way.\u201d Van Arsdell testified that he had conducted rollover crash tests of the OMW model 207 and that the belt hooks had not broken or sustained any damage. Van Arsdell testified that, after reviewing \u201call [of] the sled tests,\u201d he believed the model 207 to be \u201ca different seat\u201d than the model 206. Van Arsdell distinguished between the cracks and fractures that occurred in the model 206 during sled testing and the cracks in the Malcolms\u2019 model 207. Van Arsdell testified that not one sled test showed damage to the belt hook of the model 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b675 Van Arsdell also testified that the OMW\u2019s open belt hook design provided advantages over the Malcolms\u2019 alternative \u201ctunnel\u201d design and the same level of safety. Van Arsdell suggested that the open belt hook design was more convenient than the \u201ctunnel\u201d design. Van Arsdell added that the open belt hook design \u201cpromotes easy proper use,\u201d and that If you don\u2019t use [child seats] properly, they probably can\u2019t do you much good.\u201d Van Arsdell noted that he was not aware of anyone aside from the Malcolms\u2019 expert D\u2019Aulerio who had criticized the open belt hook design.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b676 Evenflo repeatedly tested the boundaries of the District Court\u2019s FMVSS 213 ruling. The District Court sustained the Malcolms\u2019 objection after Evenflo\u2019s counsel asked D\u2019Aulerio \u2018you\u2019re the only one that\u2019s been critical of those test results?\u201dEvenflo\u2019s counsel, undeterred, drew further objection for inquiries such as \u2018you know that NHTSA has specifically tested the model 207, that\u2019s at question here?\u201d and \u2018[y]ou can\u2019t sell a child restraint system until NHTSA has deemed it safe and effective, right?\u201d The Malcolms\u2019 objection cut short a similar attempt to circumvent the court\u2019s order in limine in Evenflo\u2019s closing argument: \u201c[t]his product is regulated by the United States government, by the Canadian government, it\u2019s been tested by both governments, by the independent labs. And every lab that man mentioned, has tested this, this 207, and not one lab \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b677 The record does not support Evenflo\u2019s claim that the District Court unfairly precluded it from distinguishing the OMW model 207 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>from the OMW model 206 and from presenting evidence that the model 207 was not defective. Evenflo attempts to bolster its case by again arguing that \u201c[t]he disparate treatment of FMVSS evidence is most obvious if one considers the very predicate for the recall of Model 206. That predicate was the FMVSS 213 testing, which showed cracking in some shells. That\u2019s the sole basis for the recall.\u201d It is true that the cracking of the shells constituted the official reason for the recall. Evenflo ignores the Malcolms\u2019 evidence that Evenflo did not inform NHTSA fully of all the defects in the OMW model 206 during the recall process.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Completeness Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b678 Evenflo further argues that the District Court violated the \u201ccompleteness rule\u201d in M. R. Evid. 106, when it denied Evenflo\u2019s request to introduce the test reports underlying D\u2019Aulerio\u2019s \u2018test failures\u201d chart that the court had admitted as exhibit 278-A. <em>See \u00b6 </em>25. Evenflo contends that D\u2019Aulerio\u2019s chart \u201cquoted selectively and misleadingly from FMVSS 213 test reports.\u201d Evenflo cited to Rule 106 in its cross-examination of D\u2019Aulerio when it offered into evidence the FMVSS 213 test reports from which D\u2019Aulerio collected Evenflo\u2019s quotes regarding cracks in the OMW shell. The test reports showed that many of the OMWs had complied with FMVSS 213 despite the cracks and fractures. The District Court denied Evenflo\u2019s request on the grounds that the evidence was \u2018inore prejudicial than probative ... [t]he testimony goes to the shell, and I don\u2019t think the rest of the results are relevant to this proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u00b679 Montana\u2019s \u201ccompleteness rule\u201d provides that when a party introduces part of a writing, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part of the writing \u201cwhich ought in fairness be considered at that time.\u201d M. R. Evid. 106(a)(1). The adverse party also \"may inquire into or introduce any other part of such item of evidence\u201d in the party\u2019s own case. M. R. Evid. 106(a)(2). Evenflo argues that the District Court did not have discretion to deny the evidence because \u201ca fairness test is not built into Subpart (a)(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIZ\">\u00b680 The Commission Comments to Rule 106 emphasize that the \u2018trial court makes the final determination of how much evidence is needed to make a fair impression under this rule and to prevent abuses of the rule.\u201dThe Commission Comments note that the trial court\u2019s authority arises from M. R. Evid. 403, \u201callowing the exclusion of relevant evidence on the grounds of prejudice,\u201d and M. R. Evid. 611, \u201callowing the court the authority to conduct trial.\u201d M. R. Evid. 106, Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Comments, MCA 2008 Annot., Vol. 5, p. 199. The Commission Comments apply to both subpart (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b681 Evenflo\u2019s Rule 106 argument merely constitutes a different strategy to introduce the prohibited evidence of the OMW model 207\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213. We have decided that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that even if Evenflo\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213\u2019s \u201cminimal standards\u201dwould be relevant, the evidence would be more prejudicial than probative and might tend to mislead or confuse the jury. <em>See </em>\u00b6 44. The District Court also did not abuse its discretion when it denied Evenflo\u2019s attempt to introduce that same evidence pursuant to Rule 106. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Improper Legal Maneuvering</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b682 Evenflo points to <em>Hall v. Big Sky Lumber &amp; Supply, Inc., </em>261 Mont. 328, 863 P.2d 389 (1993), to support its argument that the Malcolms\u2019 counsel committed improper legal maneuvering in his closing argument. Hall filed a tort suit against the driver of a logging truck after the logging truck struck his vehicle from behind when its brakes failed. <em>Hall, </em>261 Mont. at 331, 863 P.2d at 391. A highway patrolman issued the driver a citation at the scene for \u2018inadequate or defective brakes.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>261 Mont. at 336, 863 P.2d at 394. The district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence of the citation. <em>Hall, </em>261 Mont. at 336, 863 P.2d at 394-95. The defendant\u2019s counsel stated during his closing argument that \u201cif there were any defects or problems with that braking system at all, you can be sure that [one of the patrolman witnesses] would have told you about that.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>261 Mont. at 336-37, 863 P.2d at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u00b683 The jury found that the defendant was not negligent. <em>Hall, </em>261 Mont. at 332, 863 P.2d at 392. This Court ordered a new trial. <em>Hall, </em>261 Mont. at 337, 863 P.2d at 395. The Court concluded that the \u201cargument by defense counsel to the jury [was] improper legal maneuvering. Defense counsel cannot ask to have evidence excluded and then argue that if the evidence existed it would have been admitted.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>261 Mont. at 337, 863 P.2d at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\u00b684 Evenflo claims that the Malcolms \u201cengaged in just such improper legal maneuvering here.\u201d Evenflo argues that the District Court committed \u201ctransparent reversible error\u201d when it allowed the Malcolms\u2019 counsel to state that \u201cif there were any inaccuracy\u2019 in D\u2019Aulerio\u2019s chart, Evenflo would have said so.\u201d Evenflo selectively parses the record. Evenflo stated in its closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">[H]e tells you, please, look at Exhibit 278-A, that\u2019s the list put together by Dr. D\u2019Aulerio that he made from the test reports. Why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>not put the test reports in? I mean, that\u2019s where it came from, why not use your best evidence? I mean, think of all of this key evidence that you\u2019re really not seeing, the door, actual test reports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The Malcolms\u2019 counsel then stated in rebuttal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">[Evenflo\u2019s counsel] held it up, and it\u2019s the exhibit prepared by Mr. D\u2019Aulerio that has the tests, 278-A. And he said, well, where are the actual tests? Well, this is the summary. It would not have been admitted if it were not an accurate summary. And as Mr. D\u2019Aulerio said, the words that are written, here, shell cracked on the left side starting at the belt hooks, are the words that were actually on the tests. That\u2019s what it said. And I can assure you that if there were any inaccuracy in these 157 tests included in this summary \u2014 .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The Court overruled Evenflo\u2019s objection. The Malcolms\u2019 counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">I can assure you that if there were any inaccuracy about the cracks that are shown, here, that would have been pointed out. He would have been impeached on it. They would [have] said you inaccurately quoted this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\u00b685 The defendant in <em>Hall </em>asked the court to exclude the evidence and then took advantage of the plaintiffs inability to mention the evidence by implying that the evidence did not exist. <em>Hall, </em>261 Mont. at 336-37, 863 P.2d at 395. The Malcolms, on the other hand, responded to Evenflo\u2019s implication that the actual test reports differed from those presented on the summary. The District Court\u2019s order in limine prohibited the admission of the underlying test reports that Evenflo had mentioned in its closing argument. The Malcolms\u2019 counsel referred to the summary of quotes that the court had deemed to be admissible. The Malcolms\u2019 counsel did not commit improper legal maneuvering in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\u00b686 We agree that several of the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings heightened the task of Evenflo\u2019s defense. The District Court\u2019s rulings regarding Kiser\u2019s and D\u2019Aulerio\u2019s testimony and D\u2019Aulerio\u2019s \u2018test failures\u201d chart left Evenflo with a difficult task. The court\u2019s exclusion of Evenflo\u2019s FMVSS 213 compliance information made that task even more onerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">\u00b687  The District Court operated within the realm of Montana\u2019s strict liability law, however, which places a heavy burden on the manufacturer of products. <em>See, e.g., Sternhagen, </em>282 Mont. at 177-78, 935 P.2d at 1144-45. Montana\u2019s strict liability law emphasizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>maximum protection for the consumer and places the risk of loss on the manufacturer. <em>Sternhagen, </em>282 Mont. at 175-81, 935 P.2d at 1143-46. Montana\u2019s strict liability law rejects concepts fundamental to negligence law such as reasonableness and foreseeability. <em>Sternhagen, </em>282 Mont. at 176, 935 P.2d at 1144.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b688  We cannot say that the District Court\u2019s rulings were improper with regard to Evenflo\u2019s liability for compensatory damages when we view those rulings through the lens of Montana\u2019s strict liability law. We will overturn a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings only if the court abused its \u201cbroad discretion.\u201d <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 74. The record does not indicate that the court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or so exceeded the bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice. <em>Giddings, </em>\u00b6 42. We cannot say based on this record that the court abused that discretion by applying unfairly its FMVSS 213 ruling. <em>Giddings, </em>\u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b689 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it excluded Evenflo\u2019s FMVSS 213 compliance evidence with respect to punitive damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b690 A jury may award punitive damages when a defendant has acted with actual fraud or actual malice. Section 27-1-221, MCA. The defendant\u2019s state of mind represents a key element in determining whether a defendant acted with actual fraud or actual malice. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 81. Evenflo argues that the District Court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence of the OMW model 207\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213 prevented it from introducing evidence bearing on its state of mind. Evenflo contends that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sunburst, </em>which we decided after the Malcolm trial, requires reversal of the jury\u2019s punitive damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b691 In <em>Sunburst, </em>Texaco operated a gasoline refinery just outside the town of Sunburst, Montana, from 1924 to 1961. Gasoline leaked from pipes at the refinery for many years and contaminated the surrounding soil. Texaco conducted a partial cleanup of the contamination in the soil and the groundwater in the late 1950s, but left a significant amount of pollution. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 10. Montana\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) eventually assumed jurisdiction over the refinery site. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">\u00b692 Sunburst filed suit against Texaco on February 22, 2001. Sunburst alleged numerous causes of action, including strict liability for abnormally dangerous activity. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 19. The district court denied Texaco\u2019s attempt to introduce evidence that it had cooperated with DEQ and that it had complied with DEQ regulations during its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>remediation efforts in the decade before Sunburst had filed suit. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 81. The district court determined that evidence of Texaco\u2019s negotiations with DEQ likely would confuse the jury and divert its attention from evaluation of Sunburst\u2019s common law claims <em>.Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 83. The jury awarded Sunburst compensatory damages of approximately $16 million. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 24. Th\u00e9 jury also found that Texaco had acted with actual fraud or actual malice and awarded Sunburst $25 million in punitive damages. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b693 We concluded that the district court had abused its discretion by prohibiting Texaco from introducing evidence at trial of DEQ\u2019s involvement in the site remediation and Texaco\u2019s attempted compliance with government regulations. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 85. We stated that a good faith effort to comply with all government regulations \u201cwould be evidence of conduct inconsistent with the mental state requisite for punitive damages.\u201d <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b694 The District Court concluded that the OMW model 207\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213 had \u201cabsolutely no bearing at all upon the reprehensibility of the conduct of Evenflo.\u201dThe court emphasized that Evenflo could not even begin selling the OMW without complying with FMVSS 213 and thus \u2018Te]ach and every act of Evenflo relating to it[s] adherence to FMVSS 213 was intended solely to free the company up to sell, and profit from, the On My Way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u00b695 We faced similar findings regarding the defendant\u2019s misconduct in <em>Sunburst. </em>The district court noted that Texaco had been communicating with the public regarding the contamination since the late 1980\u2019s. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 82. The court found that Texaco\u2019s communication with the public \u201cconsistently [had] minimized the problem and failed to accurately report their findings.\u201d <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 82. The court attributed this effort at minimization to the fact that Texaco had been motivated by its \u201cown financial interests.\u201d <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 82. The court highlighted a 1989 document that outlined Texaco\u2019s \u2018hidden agenda\u201d to save money at the expense of a meaningful cleanup in Sunburst.

The District Court found that Evenflo had known \u2018from the outset\u201d that it could have used the safer alternative tunnel design for the OMW. The court found that the tunnel design would have provided \u201ca substantial margin of safety\u201d versus the open belt hook design and would have \u201cvirtually eliminate[d] the deadly risk of a loss of restraint during an accident.\u201d The court found that Evenflo had deemed acceptable manufacturing the OMW with an unpadded, hard plastic surface, despite its knowledge that adding EPS foam padding would reduce the potentially deadly hazard of skull fractures.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b698 The District Court further found that Evenflo had concealed from NHTSA the \u2018true hazard [of] potentially deadly ejection\u201d associated with the OMW during its June 1995 \u201cconsumer corrective action.\u201d The court stated that Evenflo had failed to remedy sufficiently the hazard before re-starting production, and had continued to withhold its knowledge that the OMW \u201ccontinued to crack, tear, or peel back in the area of the automobile seat belt path at a rate that was dangerously high.\u201dThe court noted that despite Evenflo\u2019s knowledge of the hazards associated with the OMW, it had assured J essica Malcolm that the seat was \u201csafe to use\u201d with her soon to be born child.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b699 We cannot sustain the District Court\u2019s partial reliance on these findings of misconduct by Evenflo in light of the court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence that might show why Evenflo \u201cacted as it did, or failed to act, whatever the case may be, when the jury considered] whether to award punitive damages.\u201d <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 84. Evidence of Evenflo\u2019s good faith effort to comply with all government regulations, including FMVSS 213, \u201cwould be evidence of conduct inconsistent with the mental state requisite for punitive damages.\u201d <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 81.</p>\n<p id=\"AzR\">\u00b6100  The District Court attempted to distinguish <em>Sunburst </em>on the grounds that compliance with \u201cthe minimal frontal impact standard\u201d established by FMVSS 213 was \u2018irrelevant\u201d and \u2018inadmissible.\u201d We agree that evidence of the OMW model 207\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>compliance with FMVSS 213 was not relevant to the issue of compensatory damages. <em>See </em>\u00b6 44. We cannot agree with the District Court that the FMVSS 213 compliance evidence would not be relevant to the issue of punitive damages. Evenflo may have been able to persuade the jury that its compliance with FMVSS 213 showed that it had not evinced \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the welfare of the occupants of the OMW. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 84.

We vacate the jury\u2019s award of $3.7 million in punitive damages. The question of punitive damages must be put again to a jury with Evenflo being allowed to present evidence of the OMW model 207\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b6102 As we recognized in <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 86, this decision raises the problem of how the District Court could have ensured that the jury considered the OMW model 207\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213 for purposes of punitive damages, but disregarded the same evidence for the purposes of compensatory damages. The District Court noted that \u201cthe dilemma is a thorny one\u201d and opined that \u201cdilemmas such as this are unwelcome injury trials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u00b6103 We recognize the difficulties highlighted by the District Court in conducting a jury trial. We also recognize, however, that our system provides for the presentation of evidence regarding liability for compensatory damages and punitive damages to the jury in a single proceeding. <em>See Finstad v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>2000 MT 228, \u00b6 20, 301 Mont. 240, 8 P.3d 778; <em>First Sec. Bank of Glendive v. Gary, </em>245 Mont. 394, 401, 798 P.2d 523, 527 (1990); \u00a727-l-221(6)-(7). We must trust that the jury will heed the court\u2019s instructions as to how to evaluate the evidence presented. <em>See e.g. Murray v. Talmage, </em>2006 MT 340, \u00b6 17, 335 Mont. 155, 151 P.3d 49. We need not put our reliance to the test here. The District Court excluded evidence of the OMW model 207\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213 for both purposes. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision for the purposes of compensatory damages. <em>See </em>\u00b6 44. A new jury may consider evidence of the OMW model 207\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213 for the purposes of determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Evenflo acted with actual fraud or actual malice.

As noted, the Court has now twice concluded that it is appropriate to exclude evidence relevant to punitive damages from consideration by the jury deciding liability and compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u00b6106 Punitive damage claims involve special issues, but liability for punitive damages must be determined by the same trier of fact. Section 27-1-221(6), MCA. Clearly the evidence of testing results excluded in the court below, like the evidence of negotiations with DEQ excluded in <em>Sunburst, </em>should be heard by the jury deciding punitive damages to ensure fairness to a party defending allegations of actual fraud or malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">\u00b6107 Montana law provides for a bifurcated process for jurors to assess the amount of punitive damages. Section 27-1-221(7), MCA. In the future, trial courts should consider bifurcating liability issues from punitive damages issues. In situations involving similar conflicting evidence, it may be appropriate for the jury to address all of the issues regarding punitive damages following the trial on liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">\u00b6108 Trying these issues to the same jury panel will not necessarily lead to confusion or cast an undue burden on the district court or the jury. Appropriate instructions can be fashioned to address these concerns. Our courts have a history of using innovative techniques to assure fair trials in special situations. <em>See e.g. State v. Jenkins, </em>285 Mont. 131, 948 P.2d 204 (1997) and <em>State v. Lawrence, </em>285 Mont. 140, 948 P.2d 186 (1997) (criminal charges tried against two individuals simultaneously to two juries).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">\u00b6109 Trial courts should consider innovative solutions in cases like the one at bar to provide a fair trial to all parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b382-12\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A_b\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">\u00b6110 I concur with the Court\u2019s decision to reverse on the punitive damages issue, but I would likewise reverse on the issue of compensatory damages, because the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings permitted the Malcolms to make unfair use of the FMVSS 213 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>test results-the very same use which the District Court prohibited by Evenflo.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">fill I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis distinguishing between products liability and negligence claims, and agree that evidence regarding the manufacturer\u2019s compliance with applicable regulations should not be generally admissible in products liability cases, as such evidence would improperly inject principles of negligence law, such as reasonableness and level of care, into a \u201cstrict\u201d liability matter. Accordingly, I concur with the Court\u2019s rejection of Section 4(b) of the Restatement (Third) of Torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b6112 I further agree that the demonstrable observations and findings from the FMVSS 213 testing of models 206 and 207 were relevant and admissible in this case, such as cracks, rips and tears in the seat shell, belt hook breakage under stress, and such outcomes. The Malcolms laid a sufficient foundation to show that the 206 and 207 models were substantially similar, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion by determining that the information would be relevant to determining Evenflo\u2019s liability. Opinion, \u00b6 57. And, as against such observations and findings, the District Court properly denied Evenflo\u2019s effort to introduce evidence that the OMW seat had actually \u201cpassed,\u201d or received a passing result on, the FMVSS 213 testing. Such an overgeneralized response by Evenflo would have been irrelevant or overly prejudicial to the Malcolms.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b6113 However, the District Court did not require the Malcolms to stop there. The District Court did not limit Malcolms to introducing evidence of the product stresses, as listed above, which occurred during testing. Rather, the court allowed Malcolms to <em>characterize </em>these findings in a manner favorable to their case, permitting Malcolms to repeatedly tell the jury that the OMW seat had Tailed\u201d the testing. Then, the court denied Evenflo\u2019s effort to counter this characterization by introducing evidence that the OMW seat had, in fact, \u201cpassed\u201d the testing. From Malcolms\u2019 one-sided characterization of the testing, the jury took to deliberations a simple, powerful, yet fundamentally untrue proposition: that the OMW seat had Tailed\u201d mandatory testing. While the efficacy of the FMVSS 213 testing can certainly be debated, nonetheless, the truth is, the OMW seat had actually passed that testing. The District Court later reasoned that the testing results had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the particular design issues in this case, but, if that was true, then the court should not have allowed Malcolms to introduce evidence that Evenflo had Tailed\u201d the testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b6114 Thus, the District Court inflicted upon Evenflo the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>prejudice from which it had protected Malcolms. But, the District Court went even further. After permitting Malcolms to introduce oral and written evidence using the over-generalized and prejudicial term \u201ctest failures,\u201d and denying a response by Evenflo to that characterization, the court then permitted Malcolms to argue to the jury, over Evenflo\u2019s objection, <em>that Evenflo had failed to offer evidence to the contrary. </em>This was untrue, and the District Court thus permitted Malcolms to make an unfair argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b6115 Evenflo attempted to squeeze a couple references to \u201cpassing\u201d the tests into the trial, but was not permitted to actually offer that evidence or argue it. As the Court acknowledges and describes, the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings \u2018impeded\u201dEvenflo\u2019s defense, \u2018left Evenflo with a difficult task,\u201dand made Evenflo\u2019s burden \u201ceven more onerous.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 86. Nonetheless, the Court dismisses Evenflo\u2019s arguments, concluding the rulings were proper when viewed \u2018through the lens of Montana\u2019s strict liability law.\u201d The Court thus justifies the unfairness of the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings by citing to the unique nature of products liability law. However, though a manufacturer in a product case indeed carries a heavy burden, the trial must still be conducted fairly and evenhandedly, and the rules of evidence applied justly. Here, they were not. There cannot be one set of evidentiary rules for a plaintiff, and a different set of rules for a defendant, even in a products liability case. Montana Rule of Evidence 106 and the related \u2018completeness doctrine\u2019 permit the opposing party to introduce the other part of the evidence \u2018if it is needed to make the primary evidence understandable.\u201d <em>State v. Elliott, </em>2002 MT 26, \u00b6 65, 308 Mont. 227, 43 P.3d 279 (citation omitted). The District Court unfairly prejudiced Evenflo by allowing the Malcolms to characterize the test results as \u2018failures\u201d without permitting Evenflo to offer the other side of the story. <em>See </em>Mont. R. Evid. 403; <em>Hall v. Big Sky Lumber &amp; Supply, </em>261 Mont. 328, 853 P.2d 389 (1993). I thus agree with Evenflo\u2019s argument that the District Court\u2019s ruling on the FMVSS 213 testing was not fairly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b6116 I would reverse for a new trial on both compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b384-6\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"ARR\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AvS\">\u00b6117 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion as to Issues 1, 2, and 3 but dissent as to Issue 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b6118 At the outset, I note that this is the second time in as many years that this Court has stripped plaintiffs of hard-earned and well-deserved jury awards of punitive damages. With today\u2019s decision, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>with its predecessor <em>(Sunburst School Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079), this Court imposes conflicting evidentiary rules regarding proof of compliance with minimum government standards: such evidence is not admissible regarding liability for compensatory damages but is admissible regarding liability for punitive damages. At best, this approach forces jurors into needless and infeasible mental gymnastics. At worst, as in <em>Sunburst, </em>this approach forces the Malcolms to retry their entire case to a different jury, with the concomitant waste of time, money, and resources to the civil justice system-a \u201cdilemma\u201d left unresolved in <em>Sunburst </em>and unresolved here. <em>See Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 86; Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 102-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b6119 Moreover, the Court\u2019s approach provides the camel\u2019s nose in the tent for corporations, such as Evenflo, which ask this Court (and, presumably, the Legislature) to abrogate well-settled, decades-old principles of Montana strict liability law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in favor of the controversial <em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability </em>\u00a74(b), which makes admissible in defective design and inadequate instructions/warnings cases the product\u2019s compliance with an applicable product safety statute or administrative regulation. Although the Court claims to reject \u00a74(b), Opinion, \u00b6 39, the Court for all practical purposes does exactly the opposite by allowing evidence of compliance with minimum government standards to be introduced for purposes of punitive liability during the very <em>same </em>proceeding in which the jury considers the preliminary question of whether the defendant is liable for the alleged tort, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 102-103. The Court asserts that we \u201cmust trust that the jury will heed the court\u2019s instructions as to how to evaluate the evidence presented.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 103. In other words, we must trust that the jurors will somehow put the compliance evidence completely out of their minds for purposes of tort liability and compensatory damages. Yet, it is precisely because we cannot rely on the jury to parse evidence in this manner that we require evidence of the defendant\u2019s financial worth to be presented in a separate proceeding. <em>See </em>\u00a727-l-221(7)(a), MCA. While the Court purportedly \u201cslams the door\u201d on the camel\u2019s nose, Opinion, \u00b6 40, the fact is that before <em>Sunburst </em>and today\u2019s decision, this Court had barred the camel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>completely from the tent. Predictably, his bruised nose notwithstanding, once the camel has had a whiff, he will return in more earnest.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b6120 Bottom line, the Court\u2019s approach will continue detrimentally to impact the victims of toxic torts, those injured by negligent conduct, and, as here, individuals and families devastated by injury and death caused by dangerous and defective products placed into the stream of commerce by corporations whose focus is on self-aggrandizement rather than the health, safety, and welfare of the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b6121 I disagree with the Court\u2019s decision to vacate the Malcolms\u2019 punitive damages award and remand this case to the District Court for a retrial just so that Evenflo can present evidence of its purported \u201cgood faith\u201d compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 (FMVSS 213). Evenflo has failed to demonstrate that the District Court abused its discretion in excluding this evidence, and Evenflo has failed to demonstrate that it was prejudiced as a result of the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">No Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b6122 Addressing the latter point first, it is important to recall that Tn]o error in ... the exclusion of evidence ... is ground ... for setting aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice.\u201dM. R. Civ. P. 61. Moreover, the court \u201cmust disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 61. Thus, we have stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">[o]ur analysis does not end ... if an appellant demonstrates that a district court has abused its broad discretion in rendering an evidentiary ruling. We must then determine whether the demonstrated abuse of discretion constitutes a reversible error. As we have held, no reversible error occurs unless a substantial right of the appellant is affected, nor does reversible error occur unless the evidence in question was of such character as to have affected the outcome of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-9\"><em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 65, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">\u00b6123 As discussed below, I do not agree with Evenflo and the Court that the District Court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of Evenflo\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213. Indeed, Judge Swandal\u2019s orders reviewing the punitive damages award and denying Evenflo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>post-trial motions are exceptionally well-researched, well-reasoned, and well-written, and they fully support his evidentiary rulings. But assuming for the moment, and for the sake of argument, that the court did abuse its discretion and that the 213 compliance evidence was relevant, EvenfLo has not shown that it suffered prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b6124 The jury was instructed that liability for punitive damages could be imposed only if EvenfLo was guilty of actual fraud or actual malice. The court gave the jury the following definitions, which are consistent with \u00a727-1-221(2) and (3), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">Fraud: \u201c[Ejither the making of a representation by the defendant with knowledge of its falsity or concealing a material fact with the purpose of depriving the plaintiff of his/her property or legal rights or otherwise causing him/her injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">Malice: The defendant \u2018has knowledge of facts or intentionally disregards facts that create a high probability of injury to the plaintiff,\u201d and the defendant either \u201cdeliberately proceeds to act in conscious or intentional disregard of the high probability of injury to the plaintiff\u2019 or \u201cdeliberately proceeds to act with indifference to the high probability of injury to the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aiz\">Given the overwhelming and compelling evidence of fraud and malice presented at trial, it simply cannot be said that evidence of EvenfLo\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213 would have affected the jury\u2019s verdict on Evenflo\u2019s liability for punitive damages. If anything, the jury might well have punished EvenfLo more harshly had it known that EvenfLo was seeking to excuse its reprehensible conduct by arguing that it had complied with FMVSS 213, even though EvenfLo knew all along that FMVSS 213 contained only the \u201cminimum\u201d requirements for safety design and even though EvenfLo had been told by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that \u201cmere compliance with the minimum requirements of the standard is not enough.\u201d In any event, the following evidence of actual fraud and actual malice was adduced at trial and, as the District Court noted, was established \u201cby substantial, clear and convincing evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u00b6125 On the evening of July 16, 2000, Jessica Malcolm was driving home with her son, four-month-old Tyler, properly secured in the back seat of the family Suburban in one of Evenflo\u2019s On My Way (OMW) child safety seats. She was forced off the highway, and her vehicle rolled three times down a steep incline. During the 50-mile-per-hour rollover, the left plastic seat-belt hook of Tyler\u2019s car seat broke off. The seat then slipped out of the open-ended belt hook on the opposite side of the seat and came loose from the vehicle\u2019s seatbelt. The car seat, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>with Tyler still strapped inside, was ejected from the Suburban and thrown through the air more than 60 feet. The upper left corner of the seat hit the ground, and the force of this impact transferred through the hard plastic shell, fractured Tyler\u2019s skull, and caused fatal brain damage. Had the seat remained restrained in the vehicle, there is virtually no chance that Tyler would have died in the rollover. Had the seat been lined with energy-absorbing padding, the extent of his injuries could have been mitigated and his death could have been prevented.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b6126 Evenflo knew at all times that the basic purpose of a child safety seat is to restrain the child inside the vehicle to minimize the risk of ejection and that if the restraint fails and a child, still strapped in the safety seat, is ejected, the risk of serious injury or death is increased dramatically. Evenflo also knew that a restraint system utilizing U-shaped, open-ended plastic seat-belt hooks was prone to fail, which could and did result in the OMW seat coming loose from the vehicle\u2019s seatbelts in both simulated and real-world accidents. Despite this knowledge, all models of the OMW seat produced and sold from 1994 through 2002 relied on open-ended plastic seat-belt hooks to secure the seat to the vehicle\u2019s seatbelt.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b6127 Evenflo knew from the outset that the OMW seat could have employed a feasible alternative design: one requiring the vehicle\u2019s seatbelt to be routed through an enclosed seat-belt \u201ctunnel\u201d (as opposed to an open belt hook). This \u2018bomb proof\u2019 design provides a substantial margin of safety and virtually elimin ates the risk of a loss of restraint during an accident. Even before the OMW seat went into production, Evenflo used the tunnel design on most of its infant and convertible safety seats, and Evenflo then used it on the detachable base of the OMW seat itself. During the years it used this design, Evenflo knew of no instance in which an enclosed tunnel restraint system had failed and resulted in a loss of restraint, either in sled tests or in real-world accidents. When questioned at oral argument as to why Evenflo nevertheless chose the open hook design for the OMW, counsel asserted, ironically, that this design is more \u201cuser friendly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJU\">\u00b6128 All OMW seats lack protective foam padding, such as Expanded PolyStyrene (EPS), on the inside shell and sidewings. Such padding reduces the risk of head injuries to the infant in the event of an impact, and Evenflo utilized EPS padding in the shells of some of its safety seats for that very reason. Other manufacturers also utilized protective foam in the shells of their car seats prior to and during the eight years Evenflo sold the OMW seat. However, in 1993 (more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>two years before Tyler Malcolm\u2019s OMW seat was produced), Evenflo considered whether energy-absorbing foam should be incorporated into the OMW design and decided that the OMW seat-with its unpadded, hard plastic surfaces-was, in Evenflo\u2019s own words, \u201cacceptable as is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Arm\">\u00b6129 Evenflo marketed the OMW seat with knowledge of the dangers inherent in its design. As early as February 1995, Evenflo possessed videotapes which documented its own testing and showed OMW production models breaking apart in the area of the automobile seat-belt path and, due to the OMW\u2019s open belt hook design, coming loose from the test sled\u2019s seatbelt and ejecting from the sled. The cracks, rips, and tears in the shells of the tested OMW seats and the related loss of restraint provided Evenflo with notice that its OMW design exposed infants to the risk of severe injury or death from the seat\u2019s coming loose from the seatbelt and banging around inside the vehicle or, as in Tyler\u2019s case, being ejected from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b6130 Evenflo briefly halted production of the OMW seat in June 1995 to conduct a \u201cconsumer corrective action/recall campaign.\u201d Evenflo represented to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), to owners of OMW seats, and to the general public that the hazard posed by the OMW design was a \u201cseparation\u201d under the seat\u2019s cloth padding that resulted in a sharp edge which could cause a \u201ccut or pinch\u201d hazard to the child. Evenflo did not disclose that the OMW\u2019s seat-belt hooks, and in some instances the entire corner of the OMW seat, had broken off during testing and, due to the open belt hook design, had allowed the seat (with the crash test dummy still strapped in) to fly off the test sled-a fact that Evenflo had recorded on videotape. Indeed, even though dozens of OMW seats had broken apart in sled tests, Evenflo concealed that information and reported just four \u201cseparations\u201d creating a \u201ccut or pinch\u201d hazard. Evenflo did not provide NHTSA with its videotapes showing OMW seats flying off the sled-test seats or any of its other documents and test reports that would have revealed the true hazard: potentially deadly ejections.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b6131 After making changes to the plastic mold at a total cost of $2,500, Evenflo resumed manufacturing and selling OMW seats just a few weeks after announcing the recall. Evenflo did not change the open belt hook design or the unpadded shell design and did not inform the public of the problems with these designs. Moreover, Evenflo had no idea why some of its OMW seats were cracking and breaking in tests and others were not, and the design flaw responsible for the cracks, rips, and tears was never discovered. Thus, no true \u2018fix\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ever implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b6132 With respect to the 200,000 OMW model 206 seats it had manufactured and sold at the time of the recall, Evenflo decided to save money by designing a plastic \u201cretrofit kit\u201d which it mailed to current OMW users with instructions to install a plastic insert to the underside of the safety seat using double-sided tape. With respect to the 55,000 seats it had produced but not yet sold, Evenflo installed the \u201cretrofit kit\u201d itself, rebranded the seats as model 207x, and sent all 55.000 seats to retailers. Evenflo took these actions with knowledge that it had not eliminated the deadly hazards posed by the weak open-ended plastic seat-belt hooks and the lack of EPS padding.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b6133 After restarting production, Evenflo continued to withhold from NHTSA and the public its knowledge that the OMW seat was continuing to crack, tear, or peel back in the area of the automobile seat-belt path at a dangerously high rate. Of the 580 sled tests run on both prototype and production versions of the OMW seat without its detachable base, more than one out of four (27%) of these \u201csafety\u2019 seats cracked, tore, ripped, separated, or peeled back at or near the open-ended belt hook. Thus, if all of the 3.7 million OMW seats manufactured by Evenflo were involved in collisions where the resulting forces equaled or exceeded the forces generated in the 27 to 30 mile-per-hour simulated frontal collisions conducted by Evenflo, 999.000 could be expected to fail completely or at least crack, rip, tear, or demonstrate physical evidence of impending failure in the area of the seat-belt path, which in turn could lead to a loss of restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">\u00b6134 Well before Tyler Malcolm was killed, Evenflo was aware that both retrofitted and production model post-recall OMW seats were breaking in real-world rollover accidents and coming loose from the automobile seatbelts. In 1997, Ruthie Gonzales of Merced, California reported to Evenflo that the seat-belt hook on her retrofitted model 207 seat had broken off during a rollover accident. The seat came loose from the vehicle\u2019s seatbelt and ended up on her front dashboard. In 1999, Devon Orneleas of Patterson, California reported to Evenflo that both seat-belt hooks had broken off her model 207 seat in a rollover accident. The seat came loose from the vehicle\u2019s seatbelt and flew forward when the seat\u2019s hooks fractured and broke away. She found her baby, still secured in the seat, on the front floorboard after the rollover.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u00b6135 Yet, rather than take corrective action or notify NHTSA or the public of OMW\u2019s propensity to fail and become unrestrained in rollover collisions, Evenflo moved the Gonzales and Orneleas seats to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>storage warehouse and concealed this information. Indeed, when Ms. Orneleas reported that she believed the OMW seat was defective because the seat-belt hooks had broken off her model 207 seat during a rollover, Evenflo responded that it had never before heard of such a thing happening. At the time it made this blatantly false representation, Evenflo knew fall well that similar shell cracks and failures were occurring in its sled tests and that Ms. Gonzales\u2019s OMW seat was in its warehouse, broken seat-belt hook and all. Moreover, Evenflo told Ms. Orneleas that the OMW seat was designed to withstand only a 30 mile-per-hour frontal crash, rather than the physical forces present in a rollover crash. However, Randolph Kiser, Evenflo\u2019s Director of Product Safety, admitted at trial that rollover accidents involving OMW seats were perfectly foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b6136 A number of other OMW users, who were involved in rear-impact, side-impact, and rollover accidents where the open belt hooks did <em>not </em>break, also reported to Evenflo that the seats had come loose from the automobile seatbelts. Yet, when Jessica Malcolm called Evenflo to ask whether the OMW seat was \u201csafe to use\u201d with her soon-to-be-born child, Evenflo told her that the seat was safe to use and that there were no problems with it. Evenflo did so despite knowing that dozens of OMW seats had been cracking in tests, despite knowing that the belt hooks had been breaking off in real-world accidents like the Gonzales and Orneleas rollovers, and despite knowing that unbroken OMW seats had been coming loose from the vehicle\u2019s seatbelts in other types of accidents. Randolph Kiser testified that Evenflo\u2019s position was that Jessica did not have the right to know about any cracks, rips, or breaks in the OMW seats (either in testing or in real-world accidents). Kiser stated that as far as Evenflo was concerned, no consumer had the right to know about the shell failures and ejections because Evenflo did not consider them to be a \u201crampant safety related defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHh0\">\u00b6 13 7 Evenflo has no way of determining how many OMW seats were actually involved in accidents. Neither Evenflo nor the government tracks that information, and Evenflo\u2019s document-retention policy in the 1990s required that documents pertaining to injuries or deaths resulting in claims or lawsuits be destroyed one year after the matter was concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b6138 In sum, Evenflo knew that the purpose of an infant child safety seat, including its OMW seat, is to restrain a child safely to the vehicle\u2019s seatbelt in a protective cocoon of the seat\u2019s shell during a motor vehicle accident. Moreover, Evenflo knew full well that by virtue of its design, the OMW seat was prone to crack, rip, and tear when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>placed under load, resulting in a complete loss of restraint. And Evenflo\u2019s Randolph Kiser admitted at trial that the probability of serious injury or death to an infant strapped in a car seat increases dramatically when the seat becomes unrestrained. Nevertheless, Evenflo consciously manufactured and marketed the OMW seat as a product intended to keep infants safe and secure while traveling in a motor vehicle. Furthermore, Evenflo considered whether to add protective EPS padding to the hard plastic shell of the OMW seat to protect the infant passenger from skull fractures but decided that the product was \u201cacceptable as is.\u201d As the District Court observed, the words \u201cacceptable as is,\u201d as used by Evenflo here, constitute \u201ca perfect three-word definition of\u2018actual malice.\u2019 \u2019\u2019Evenflo evinced a complete indifference to an infant\u2019s vulnerability to physical injury or death while strapped in one of its OMW seats, and as a result, Tyler Malcolm died. Indeed, when asked point-blank by the consumer, Jessica Malcolm, if the OMW seat was safe, Evenflo lied to her and told her that it was safe and that there were no problems with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b6139 Evenflo manufactured the OMW seat for eight years with knowledge (much of it recorded on its own videotapes, accident reports, and sled-test records) of the risks and dangers posed by the seat\u2019s design. Worse still, Evenflo concealed this information not only from NHTSA and the general public, but also from Jessica Malcolm specifically. Any doubt about whether this deceit was intentional was dispelled by Evenflo\u2019s corporate representative, Randolph Kiser, who testified unapologetically that neither Jessica Malcolm nor any other concerned parent was entitled to information about the OMW seat\u2019s deficiencies and the potentially deadly hazards the seat posed to children until Evenflo, in its own judgment, decided that the safety-related defects were \u201crampant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b6140 In light of all this evidence, the District Court observed in its order reviewing the punitive damages award that Evenflo\u2019s misconduct was \u2018heither isolated, nor accidental.\u201d In fact, Evenflo\u2019s motive was <em>\u201cexclusively </em>profit driven.\u201d And Evenflo\u2019s reprehensible conductwfiiich extended over an eight-year period, involved the knowing distribution of millions of defectively designed automobile child-restraint seats, and resulted in one of the worst forms of physical harm (the death of a child)-was \u201camong the most egregious to be encountered in a strict liability in tort, design defect case.\u201d Indeed, the court noted, the State of Montana considers the probability of serious injury or death to an unrestrained child in a motor vehicle to be so great and so well-known that placing an infant in a vehicle without a proper restraint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>constitutes a criminal act (citing \u00a761-9-419 and -420, MCA). Having heard the witnesses and seen the evidence, the District Court concluded that \u201c[i]t is difficult to conceive a template more naturally fitted to the most virulent form of profit-motivated reprehensibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIs\">\u00b6141 In the face of all of this, Evenflo complains that it should have been allowed to tell the jury about its compliance with FMVSS 213. FMVSS 213 sets forth minimum requirements for child-restraint systems, <em>see </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.213, and NHTSA required Evenflo to conduct internal testing of its OMW seats to determine if they complied with these requirements. FMVSS testing involves a front-end sled test at speeds of 27 to 30 miles per hour. FMVSS 213 does not require (nor does it preclude) side-impact, rear-impact, rollover, or high-speed testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b6142 Congress expressly cautioned, however, that \u201c[cjompliance with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter does not exempt a person from liability at common law.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30103(e). Indeed, Congress intended that \u201ccompliance with safety standards is not to be a defense or otherwise to affect the rights of parties under common law particularly those relating to warranty, contract, and tort liability.\u201d H.R. Rpt. 89-1776 at 24 (July 28, 1966). Moreover, NHTSA Administrator Ricardo Martinez, M.D. sent a letter to Evenflo and other manufacturers in September 1999 stating that \u201cwith the safety of our Nation\u2019s children at issue, mere compliance with the minimum requirements of the standard is not enough.\u201d Dr. Martinez urged each manufacturer of child restraints \u201cto ensure that their restraints perform <em>above </em>the minimum requirements of our standard.\u201d <em>See </em>65 Fed. Reg. 1224, 1224-25 (Jan. 7, 2000) (emphasis added). Along these same lines, this Court warned, before Evenflo started selling its OMW seats in Montana, that bare compliance with a minimum standard does not necessarily establish that the defendant acted with due carecer, as applied in the punitive damages context, that the defendant acted without deliberate indifference to the high probability of injury to the plaintiff. If the circumstances are such that a danger exists beyond the minimum which the standard was designed to meet, then the defendant is liable for not doing more. <em>See Martel v. Montana Power </em>Co., 231 Mont. 96, 104, 752 P.2d 140, 145 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"Af0\">\u00b6143 The Court asserts that Tejvidence of Evenflo\u2019s good faith effort to comply with all government regulations, including FMVSS 213, \u2018would be evidence of conduct inconsistent with the mental state requisite for punitive damages.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 99 (quoting <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 81). The Court opines that \u2018Evenflo may have been able to persuade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the jury that its compliance with FMVSS 213 showed that it had not evinced \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to the welfare of the occupants of the OMW.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 100. I disagree. For one thing, it is doubtful that Evenflo\u2019s proffered evidence even constitutes evidence of a \u201cgood faith effort to comply with all government regulations.\u201d The fact of the matter is that Evenflo did <em>not </em>comply in \u201cgood faith\u201d with FMVSS 213; rather, Evenflo deliberately concealed from NHTSA the fact that OMW seats were breaking apart in Evenflo\u2019s sled tests and were flying off the sled-test seats. Furthermore, given the mountain of evidence presented at trial that Evenflo knowingly misrepresented to Jessica Malcolm the risks and dangers posed by the design of the OMW seat, that Evenflo concealed from her certain material facts about the safety of the seat, and that Evenflo deliberately proceeded to act in conscious disregard of the high probability of injury to Tyler, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury, based simply on Evenflo\u2019s supposed \u201cgood faith\u201d compliance with FMVSS 213, would have reached a different outcome, i.e., would have found Evenflo not liable for punitive damages. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b6 144 Indeed, while it purportedly was complying in \u201cgood faith\u201dwith FMVSS 213, Evenflo knew the following: that mere compliance with the minimum requirements of the standard \u2018is not enough,\u201d particularly where a danger exists beyond the minimum that the standard was designed to meet; that NHTSA wanted Evenflo\u2019s child restraints to \u201cperform above the minimum requirements\u201d; that FMVSS 213 addressed only frontal collisions; that the OMW seat\u2019s open belt hook design had failed in a number of rear-impact, side-impact, and rollover accidents; and that Evenflo, therefore, needed to go beyond the minimum requirements of FMVSS 213 in its design of the OMW seat. Evenflo also knew how to test its safety seats in rollover crash scenarios, but Evenflo never chose to conduct rollover tests on the OMW seats. Rather, Evenflo was content to do only the bare minimum; and it only did that much because it could not have sold the OMW seat otherwise. As the District Court pointed out, Evenflo could not receive one dime of profit if it did not first subject the OMW seat to FMVSS 213 testing. Thus, based on the evidence, the court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ate\">[e]ach and every act of Evenflo relating to [its] adherence to FMVSS 213 was intended solely to free the company up to sell, and profit from, the On My Way. This includes stopping production of the OMW when it realized it could not entirely conceal the seat\u2019s non-compliance with FMVSS 213; writing to NHTSA, characterizing the hazard posed by the noncompliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>as the risk of a \u201ccut or pinch\u201d; and making the bare minimum revisions it could to get the On My Way to comport with the minimal requirements of FMVSS 213 (none of which applied to rollover accidents) and back into production as quickly as possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2Y\">Consequently, although this Court is concerned that Evenflo was not allowed to present the jury with evidence that might show why Evenflo \u201c\u2018acted as it did, or failed to act, whatever the case may be,\u2019 \u2019\u2019Opinion, \u00b6 98 (quoting <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 84), the explanation afforded by the 213 compliance evidence tends, if anything, to bolster the jurors\u2019 decision to punish Evenflo. It in no way undermines their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b6145 Lastly, it must be acknowledged that Evenflo did tell the jury about, and present evidence of, its supposed \u201cgood faith\u201d compliance with government regulations. As the Court notes in \u00b6\u00b6 72-75, Evenflo informed the jury in its opening statement that the OMW model 207 seat was tested \u2018320 times by NHTSA, by the Canadian Government, by Evenflo, by independent test labs, and it passed every test. Every test, it passed.\u201d Evenflo contended that the Malcolms\u2019 design expert, Lou D\u2019Aulerio, would say that \u201cI\u2019ve looked at these, and the Canadians, they got it wrong, NHTSA got it wrong, the independent labs got it wrong, the car seats didn\u2019t really pass those tests,\u201d but Evenflo asserted that \u2018he\u2019s the only person that\u2019s going to testify to that.\u201d Evenflo reiterated that \u2018Ttjhere is not one testing agency that has found that the 207 did not pass the test.\u201d Then, at trial, Evenflo\u2019s Randolph Kiser testified that unlike the OMW 206, which failed to meet the minimal requirements of FMVSS 213, the OMW 207 was never recalled. Kiser testified at length regarding the engineering changes Evenflo had made to the OMW seat after the model 206 recall, and he attempted to impugn D\u2019Aulerio\u2019s \u201cbest failures\u201d chart by pointing out that D\u2019Aulerio had included \u2018failures\u201d of model 206 seats and prototype seats in that chart. Kiser testified that NHTSA had conducted 22 tests on the model 207 seat and had not observed any cracks or any problems with the belt hooks. Similarly, Evenflo got D\u2019Aulerio to acknowledge on cross-examination that \u2018NHTSA passed all of the twenty-two tests it conducted on the model 207.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b6146 Furthermore, as the Court notes in \u00b6 76, Evenflo repeatedly tested the boundaries of the District Court\u2019s FMVSS 213 ruling. For example, Evenflo\u2019s counsel asked D\u2019Aulerio, TYJou\u2019re the only one that\u2019s been critical of those test results\u201d and \u2018You have no information to share with these jurors that anybody other than you is critical of that testing.\u201d The District Court sustained the Malcolms\u2019 objection to the latter question; however, Evenflo\u2019s counsel, undeterred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>nevertheless proceeded with questions such as \u2018You can\u2019t sell a child restraint system until NHTSA has deemed it safe and effective, right?\u201d TY]ou know that NHTSA has specifically tested the model 207, that\u2019s at question here,\u201d \u2018II]n each of the twenty-two [tests] conducted by NHTSA, NHTSA gave the tests a pass,\u201d and \u201c[I]n each of the eighty-five tests that the Canadian Government did, the Canadian Government deemed them a pass.\u201d Notably, in response to these questions, D\u2019Aulerio clarified that his \u201ctest failures\u201d chart did not identify \u2018failures\u201dusing the \u201cother criteria\u201dbeing tested (i.e., FMVSS 213). Rather, he explained, \u2018I\u2019m simply saying that when it comes to the belt hook, and the surrounding area, that all those tests show an insignia problem there. That\u2019s all I made the list for.\u201d This concession by D\u2019Aulerio, in conjunction with Evenflo\u2019s various questions about \u2018test passes,\u2019\u2019undermines Evenflo\u2019s contention that it was not allowed to counter the Malcolms\u2019 \u201cone-sided\u201d characterization of the test results. D\u2019Aulerio admitted on cross-examination that the model 207 had passed NHTSA\u2019s 22 tests and that his \u2018test failures\u201d chart was not based on those same government criteria, but rather was based on problems with the belt hook.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b6147 Thus, Evenflo effectively introduced evidence that it had complied with government regulations in relation to the model 207 seat at issue. Indeed, during closing argument, Evenflo attempted to summarize the evidence as follows: \u2018This product is regulated by the United States Government, by the Canadian Government, it\u2019s been tested by both governments, by the independent labs. And every lab that man mentioned, has tested this, this 207, and not one lab -\u2019\u2019(The court then sustained an objection by the Malcolms.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b6148 Moreover, Evenflo called William Van Arsdell, an engineer and design expert, who testified in essence that Evenflo\u2019s goal in using the open belt hook design was to facilitate child safety. Van Arsdell stated that in his opinion, the open belt hook design had advantages over the Malcolms\u2019 alternative \u2018funnel\u201d design. In particular, he offered that this design was \u201cso much easier\u201d and convenient to use than the tunnel design and, for this reason, that a person would be more likely to properly restrain their child in a seat which used an open belt hook design. Van Arsdell stated that he was not aware of anyone aside from D\u2019Aulerio who had criticized the open belt hook design.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b6149 Finally, Evenflo was given free rein to use the evidence of its cooperation and interaction with NHTSA in connection with the model 206 recall to argue against liability for punitive damages. Indeed, Evenflo took full advantage of this evidence, arguing that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>voluntary recall was proof that Evenflo took prompt corrective action when it discovered a design defect in the OMW seat. Of course, the Malcolms used this same evidence to show (1) Evenflo\u2019s knowledge of the shell cracks that led to the recall, (2) how Evenflo lied to NHTSA, the public, and Jessica Malcolm about how badly the OMW seat was breaking apart and the true ejection hazards posed to children riding in car seats with open belt hooks, and (3) how Evenflo\u2019s so-called \u2018fix\u201d incorporated into the model 207 seat did absolutely nothing to eliminate the ejection hazard posed by the open belt hook design. Nevertheless, as the District Court pointed out in its order denying Evenflo\u2019s post-trial motions, the jury saw and heard each side\u2019s interpretation of Evenflo\u2019s interaction with NHTSA and NHTSA\u2019s role in the recall and the subsequent \"redesign\u201d of the OMW seat. Evenflo\u2019s hands were not tied, nor were its arguments limited, in dealing with this evidence. The jury simply was not persuaded by the view of the evidence argued by Evenflo.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b6150 For the foregoing reasons, I would not vacate the Malcolms\u2019 punitive damages award. I would hold that Evenflo has not demonstrated that it was prejudiced by the District Court\u2019s exclusion of the 213 compliance evidence. For one thing, as explained in the preceding paragraphs, Evenflo was able to present and argue much of this evidence to the jury anyway. Moreover, the jury\u2019s verdict on Evenflo\u2019s liability for punitive damages is amply supported by substantial evidence of actual fraud and actual malice, and Evenflo has not shown that any additional 213 compliance evidence would have affected the outcome of the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">No Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b6 151 Turning back to the question of whether evidence of Evenflo\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213 was even relevant in the first place, the Court states that \u201ca good faith effort to comply with all government regulations \u2018would be evidence of conduct inconsistent with the mental state requisite for punitive damages.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 93 (quoting <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 81). As the District Court correctly pointed out, however, we \u201cobviously did not intend this very broad language to suggest that evidence of compliance with government regulations having nothing to do with the particular design issues presented in a design defect case should be admitted, despite its irrelevance.\u201d Here, in order to sell its OMW seat, Evenflo had to certify that the product complied with FMVSS 213; and since compliance with this minimal standard was a mandatory condition on selling the product, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>concluded that \u201cit does not reflect a voluntary choice in the product design process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b6152 Moreover, the court pointed out that FMVSS 213 addresses only minimum levels of performance in 27 to 30 mile-per-hour <em>frontal </em>impacts and does not set forth any requirements, or create any reasonable expectations in the mind of the manufacturer, concerning the dynamic performance of a child safety seat in a motor vehicle rollover. Furthermore, the present case involves a 50 mile-per-hour rollover crash, and the dynamic forces unleashed in a high-speed rollover crash are very different from those present in a 27 to 30 mile-per-hour frontal crash. Consequently, Evenflo\u2019s compliance with the minimal 27 to 30 mile-per-hour frontal-impact tests required by FMVSS 213 has little, if any, bearing on Evenflo\u2019s state of mind vis-avis the known defects in its OMW seats, the known dangers posed by the seat\u2019s open belt hook design, the expected performance of the seat in a rollover crash, Evenflo\u2019s failure to take corrective actions, and Evenflo\u2019s decision to make knowing misrepresentations to NHTSAand Jessica Malcolm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b6153 Of course, even if the 213 compliance evidence could be considered marginally relevant, this does not make the evidence automatically admissible. The Montana Rules of Evidence state that Tajlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201dM. R. Evid. 403. In this connection, the District Court aptly pointed out that evidence of Evenflo\u2019s supposed \u201cgood faith\u201d compliance with government regulations would have had the tendency to create juror confusion. Evenflo wanted to argue to the jury that because it complied with FMVSS 213, it did not knowingly misrepresent to Jessica Malcolm the risks and dangers posed by the design of the OMW seat, did not conceal from her certain material facts about the safety of the seat, and did not deliberately proceed to act in conscious disregard of the high probability of injury to Tyler. Section 27-1-221(2), (3), MCA. Yet, compliance with FMVSS 213 does not explain why Evenflo failed to ensure that OMW seats would perform <em>above </em>FMVSS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>213\u2019s minimum requirements, why Evenflo manufactured and marketed a \u201csafety\u201d seat that it knew was defectively designed and posed a hazard of potentially deadly ejections, and why Evenflo knowingly misrepresented to Jessica Malcolm, NHTSA, and the public that its OMW seats were safe. The District Court was thus quite correct in concluding that the 213 compliance evidence would confuse the issues and mislead the jury (not to mention waste time). M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b6154 Evenflo has not shown that the District Court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason when it excluded the evidence of Evenflo\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 65.1 dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b6155 The Court\u2019s decision as to Issue 4 ignores the overwhelming evidence of Evenflo\u2019s malice and fraud in the design, manufacture, and marketing of the OMW seat. The Court remands this case to the District Court so that Evenflo may tell a new jury that the model 207 seat complied with minimum government requirements, notwithstanding the fact that Evenflo knew that mere compliance with the minimal requirements was not enough. The Court\u2019s decision is an affront to the jury which heard the evidence and awarded the Malcolms an appropriate amount of punitive damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s decision is also unfair to Judge Swandal, who put up with Evenflo\u2019s pretrial discovery abuses and \u201cgamesmanship\u201d and then, as noted, issued exceptionally well-researched, well-reasoned, and well-written orders fully supporting his evidentiary rulings and his decisions to affirm the awards for compensatory damages and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"A-Y\">\u00b6156 The greater mischief of the Court\u2019s decision today, however, is that Chad and Jessica Malcolm will now be forced to retry their entire case to another jury on the issue of punitive damages. Judge Swandal noted that the Malcolms\u2019 grief from the devastating loss of their firstborn son-ejected in his Evenflo \u201csafety\u201d seat at a location in full view of their living room window-was \u201cso all-consuming\u201d that this \u201cAll American Ranch Family\u201d was forced to move away and give up its fourth-generation ranch life and heritage. The tragedy of the Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>decision today is that Chad and Jessica are stripped of their well-deserved and legally-sound award of punitive damages in the name of \u2018fairness\u201d to a corporation that demonstrated actual malice, actual fraud, and utter contempt for the safety of the consuming public. I do not agree that Evenflo was treated unfairly or that the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings in any way \u2018heightened the task\u201d of Evenflo\u2019s defense with respect to liability for punitive damages (Opinion \u00b6 86). It is, however, fundamentally unfair and unconscionable to force Chad and Jessica to relive the nightmare of Tyler\u2019s tragic and totally unnecessary death.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b6157 As for future cases, the Court again leaves unresolved \u201cthe problem of how the District Court could have ensured that the jury considered the OMW model 207\u2019s compliance with FMVSS 213 for purposes of punitive damages, but disregarded the same evidence for the purposes of compensatory damages.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 102; <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 86 (\u201cOur decision raises the problem of how the District Court could have prevented the jury from hearing evidence of DEQ\u2019s role for purposes of compensatory damages, but allowed the jury to hear evidence of DEQ\u2019s role for purposes of determining the appropriateness of punitive damages. We need not resolve this dilemma, however.\u201d). I cannot understand the Court\u2019s refusal, in two decisions now, to provide any guidance on this dilemma-a dilemma solely of this Court\u2019s creation. Opinion, \u00b6 103. Litigants and the civil justice system must not continue to be burdened, as here, with having to try often gut-wrenching cases to two different juries, first to prove entitlement to compensatory damages and then to prove entitlement to punitive damages-especially when the trial judge\u2019s only \u201cerror\u201d was that he simply followed decades of this Court\u2019s precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b6158 If, as the Court states in \u00b6\u00b6 44 and 100, evidence of a defendant\u2019s compliance with government regulations is not relevant to the issue of compensatory damages (a conclusion with which I agree) but is relevant to the issue of liability for punitive damages (a conclusion with which I strenuously disagree), and if, as the Court states in \u00b6 39, we are truly rejecting the approach of <em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability </em>\u00a74(b), then I suggest that punitive liability necessarily should be determined in a separate proceeding by the same jury seriatim, i.e., immediately after the jury determines tort liability and compensatory damages. This is the approach already contemplated by \u00a7 27-1-221(7), MCA, with respect to liability for punitive damages and the amount of punitive damages. Moreover, this approach is supported by our decision in <em>Malta Public School Dist. A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>and 14 v. Dist. Court, </em>283 Mont. 46, 938 P.2d 1335 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b6159 In <em>Malta, </em>which involved claims for breach of an insurance contract and unfair trade practices, we first noted that a court may, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, order a separate trial of any claim, any separate issue, or any number of claims or issues. <em>Malta, </em>283 Mont. at 50, 938 P.2d at 1338 (citing M. R. Civ. P. 42(b)). We then considered under what circumstances bifurcated issues should be presented to one jury seriatim or to two separate juries. We held that this determination depends on judicial economy, fairness to the parties, clarity of the issues, and convenience. <em>Malta, </em>283 Mont. at 51, 938 P.2d at 1338 (citing <em>Martin v. Bell Helicopter Co., </em>85 F.R.D. 654, 659-60 (D. Colo. 1980)). Thus, for example, we concluded in <em>Malta </em>that the School District\u2019s breach of contract claim and its bad faith claim should be heard by the same jury because a second jury hearing the bad faith claim would first have to be educated about the underlying contract claim which the first jury had already heard and decided. <em>Malta, </em>283 Mont. at 52, 54, 938 P.2d at 1339, 1340. We observed that both claims involved virtually the same evidence and the same witnesses, who would be put to the inconvenience and hardship of a second trial. Thus, \u201conly by trying the bad faith claim immediately after the breach of contract claim to the same jury will the parties avoid relitigating the entire matter. Such a result would further the interests of judicial economy, ensure fairness to the parties, maintain clarity of the issues and provide convenience to both the court and the parties.\u201d <em>Malta, </em>283 Mont. at 52, 938 P.2d at 1339. To do otherwise, we observed, would result in a \u201cgross injustice\u201d and would deny the School District a \u201cspeedy remedy\u201d on its claims. <em>Malta, </em>283 Mont. at 53, 938 P.2d at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b6160 Likewise, in the run of cases, a jury considering the defendant\u2019s liability for punitive damages will first have to be educated about the plaintiffs underlying tort claim. Except for the evidence of compliance with government regulations, the evidence and witnesses in the two proceedings will be virtually the same. Thus, if two separate juries are used, the parties will have to relitigate the entire matter, with the concomitant waste of time, money, and resources. Judicial economy, fairness to the parties, clarity of the issues, and convenience to both the court and the parties are all facilitated by trying the tort liability/compensatory damages issue and the punitive liability issue in two separate proceedings by the same jury seriatim. I suggest that this is the most practical scheme given the Court\u2019s conflicting evidentiary rules regarding the use of evidence of compliance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>government regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b6161 While I concur in Issues 1, 2, and 3,1 strenuously dissent as to Issue 4.</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-5\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the Concurrence and Dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-5\"> <em>See Brandenburger v.
