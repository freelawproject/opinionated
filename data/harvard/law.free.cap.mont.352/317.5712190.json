Ness appeals only that portion of his sentence imposing $3,500 in restitution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred by requiring Ness to pay restitution for funeral expenses as part of his sentence for tampering with evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b63 In the early morning hours of July 1, 2006, Jami Sherman (Sherman) was involved in a single-car accident while driving under the influence of alcohol in Ronan, Montana. Sherman was thrown from her vehicle and was lying in a prone position on the roadway when Ness\u2019s vehicle struck and killed her. Ness fled the scene and went home, waking up his partner, Krista Orr (Orr), to tell her that he\u2019d hit something with the car. Ness told Orr that he was concerned because of the number of emergency vehicles responding to the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b64 After hearing news of Sherman\u2019s death the following morning, Ness and Orr changed the vehicle\u2019s turn signal lenses, which had been broken, disposed of the pieces of the broken lenses, and washed the vehicle. On July 28, nearly a month after Ness had run over Sherman, and after receiving two anonymous tips, police located Ness\u2019s vehicle and arrested him. Ness told police that he initially thought he had hit a cow in the roadway and that he does not stop when merely hitting a cow or other animals. Ness stated that when he later realized that he had hit a person, he did not report the accident because he was afraid of the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\u00b65 Ness was charged with Tampering With or Fabricating Evidence, a felony. The Information alleged that Ness \u201ctampered with evidence by washing a vehicle involved in a hit and run accident that resulted in the death of Jami Sherman.\u201d Ness entered an <em>Alford </em>plea to the charge pursuant to a plea agreement and acknowledged that he was a persistent felony offender. The Pre-Sentence Investigation report (PSI) adopted the plea agreement recommendation that Ness be sentenced to twenty years in the Montana State Prison as a persistent felony offender, and also recommended that Ness be required to reimburse the Montana\u2019s Victims of Crime Act program (VOCA) for the $3,500 the Fund had expended for Sherman\u2019s funeral expenses. The PSI noted that Sherman was the \u201cprimary victim in this case,\u201d and that the \u201csecondary victims\u201d were Sherman\u2019s parents and siblings because Ness had let them \u201csuffer through the trauma of not knowing the circumstances of [Sherman\u2019s] death.\u201d At sentencing, defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>counsel argued that Ness should not be ordered to pay restitution because funeral expenses were not authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b66 The District Court sentenced Ness to the Montana State Prison for twenty years and ordered him to pay $3,500 for Sherman\u2019s funeral expenses. However, the District Court ordered Ness to pay the restitution to Sherman\u2019s parents, who had not paid for the funeral expenses, rather than to VOCA, which actually paid for Sherman\u2019s funeral.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ness only appeals the requirement that he pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b67 We review a sentence in a criminal case for legality to determine whether the sentence is within statutory parameters. <em>State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 11, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err by requiring Ness to pay restitution for funeral expenses as part of his sentence for tampering with evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\u00b69 Ness argues the District Court erred by imposing restitution for Sherman\u2019s funeral expenses because there was no nexus or correlation between the crime for which he was convicted and the restitution imposed. He also argues that Sherman\u2019s family does not qualify as a \u201cvictim\u201d under \u00a746-18-243(2)(a)(ii), MCA, which includes \u201ca member of the immediate family of a homicide victim,\u201d because Sherman was not the victim of a homicide. The State responds that a loss need only be \u201crelated to\u201d the crime to be reimbursable, and that a sufficient connection exists here. The State notes that it was actually VOCA which paid Sherman\u2019s funeral expenses, and that VOCA is included as a \u201cvictim\u201d under the statute to the extent it has reimbursed a victim for \u201cpecuniary loss.\u201d Section 46-18-201(5), MCA. Ness replies that VOCA did not, technically, \u201creimburse\u201d anyone because it paid the funeral expense directly, and therefore the restitution to VOCA is not authorized under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\u00b610 Ness relies upon <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, 293 Mont. 133, 974 P.2d 620; <em>State v. Horton, </em>2001 MT 100, 305 Mont. 242, 25 P.3d 886, <em>overruled on other grounds, Herman, </em>\u00b6 12; and <em>State v. Setters, </em>2001 MT 101, 305 Mont. 253, 25 P.3d 893, for his correlation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>argument. In those cases, we held that a sentencing condition must have \u201csome correlation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced.\u201d <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Horton, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>Setters, </em>\u00b6 27. According to Ness, his crime of tampering with evidence did not result in Sherman\u2019s death and cause her funeral expenses, so there is no correlation between his crime and the restitution imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b611 In <em>Ommundson, </em>we partially reversed the defendant\u2019s sentence because there was \u201cno nexus between the requirement that Ommundson participate in a sex offender program and the charged offense of DUI.\u201d <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 12. In <em>Horton, </em>we held that there was no connection between the defendant\u2019s conviction of DUI and the sentencing requirement that he pay child support as restitution. <em>Horton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-28. In <em>Setters, </em>we reversed a restitution order pertaining only to an unrelated theft charge which had been dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement. <em>Setters, </em>\u00b6 25.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b612 In <em>State v. McIntire, </em>2004 MT 238, 322 Mont. 496, 97 P.3d 576, we considered a condition in the defendant\u2019s burglary sentence requiring him to pay restitution for losses arising from his forgery, when the forgery counts had been dismissed as part of a plea agreement. While burglarizing his deceased neighbor\u2019s apartment, the defendant stole and later forged the victim\u2019s checks. Relying on <em>Horton </em>and <em>Sellers, </em>the defendant argued that restitution for those losses was inappropriate as they had not arisen from the burglary charge. We distinguished <em>Horton </em>and <em>Sellers, </em>reasoning that those cases involved dismissed charges \u201cwholly unrelated to the charges to which the defendants pled guilty,\u201d <em>Mclntire, </em>\u00b6 17, whereas there was a \u201cdirect connection\u201d between the burglary and the forgery losses at issue in that case. <em>Mclntire, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b613 Similar to Ness, the defendant in <em>State v. LaTray, </em>2000 MT 262, \u00b6 14, 302 Mont. 11, 11 P.3d 116, argued that courts could only impose restitution for losses that occurred as a \u201cdirect result\u201d of an offense. At the conclusion of a high-speed chase, LaTray lost control of his car and rolled down a ditch. Responding officers called an ambulance and a tow truck for assistance. LaTray was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, driving without insurance, driving while a habitual traffic offender, leaving the scene of the accident, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>criminal endangerment. Challenging the requirement to pay restitution for the ambulance and towing services, LaTray argued that, while other cars he hit were victims, neither the towing service nor the ambulance company qualified as victims of any of his offenses. <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-6. However, we held that \u201cclassification of an individual as a victim-tor the purpose of ordering restitution-does not depend on the individual\u2019s relationship to the elements of the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced.\u201d <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>State v. Morgan, </em>198 Mont. 391, 402, 646 P.2d 1177, 1183 (1982)). We further noted that \u201cLaTrajf s conviction for criminal endangerment in no way limits restitution only to those he endangered.\u201d <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 16. Rather, because LaTray\u2019s actions \u201ccreated a situation in which ambulance and towing services were reasonably necessary,\u201d the expenses for these services resulted from his crime and were subject to restitution. <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b614 In <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313, we reversed a portion of the defendant\u2019s restitution requirement for damages to a stolen vehicle. Noting that restitution must be ordered for losses which are \u201ca result of the commission of the offense,\u201d <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 13, we nonetheless concluded that there was \u201cnothing in the record indicating that the charge against Breeding and the offense to which he pleaded guilty were based on any of the events that occurred prior to his suggesting that he and Seghetti drive the Jeep to California and his participating in that endeavor ....\u201d <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 16. The subject damage had occurred earlier. We thus reversed the order requiring Breeding to pay restitution for damages to the vehicle which occurred prior to and were not \u2018based on\u201d his involvement. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16, 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b615 Recently, in <em>State v. Perkins, </em>2009 MT 150, 350 Mont. 387, 208 P.3d 386, the defendant was charged with felony criminal endangerment after his girlfriend\u2019s child was removed from the home where he and his girlfriend were residing pursuant to dependency and neglect proceedings. Upon his conviction, the defendant objected to paying child care expenses of $5,947 for the child\u2019s out-of-home care as restitution, arguing that those expenses were his girlfriend\u2019s responsibility. Citing <em>Mclntire, </em>we noted that the district courts have broad powers to impose reasonable requirements upon an offender and that \u00a746-18-202(l)(f), MCA, which allows a court to include \u201cany other limitation reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society,\u201d also provides a basis for restitution. <em>Perkins, </em>\u00b6 12. We concluded that the district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>err by finding a \u201csufficient connection\u201d between the offense and the expenses. <em>Perkins, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11,13.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b616 Here, the charge to which Ness pled guilty alleged that he had \u2018tampered with evidence by washing a vehicle involved in a hit and run accident that resulted in the death of Jami Sherman.\u201d Ness was the driver of that vehicle and he acknowledged that he had struck Sherman. Ness\u2019 s actions in striking Sherman created the evidence that he tampered with. Had he not struck Sherman, the charge of tampering with the evidence from that incident would not have arisen. Sherman died from the injuries she received when Ness struck her, and incurred funeral expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b617  Sherman\u2019s status as a victim for purposes of restitution \u201cdoes not depend on [her] relationship to the elements of the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced.\u201d <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>State v. Morgan, </em>198 Mont. 391, 402, 646 P.2d 1177, 1183 (1982)). Restitution for Sherman\u2019s funeral expenses has \u201csome correlation or connection to the underlying offense\u201d for which Ness was sentenced. <em>Horton, </em>\u00b6 28. The expenses are not \u201cwholly unrelated\u201d to Ness\u2019s crime. <em>McIntire, </em>\u00b6 17. Ness\u2019s actions \u201ccreated a situation in which [funeral expenses] were reasonably necessary.\u201d <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22. We conclude there is a \u2018Sufficient connection\u201dbetween Sherman\u2019s funeral expenses and Ness\u2019s crime, <em>Perkins, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-13, and that the expenses were \u2018based on\u201dNess\u2019s involvement. <em>Breeding, </em>\u00b6 16. Thus, there is a nexus or correlation between the crime and the restitution requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b618 Ness\u2019s second argument is that no one here qualifies as a \u201cvictim\u201d under the statutes for purposes of receiving payment for Sherman\u2019s funeral expenses. As a preliminary matter, we agree with the State that the District Court\u2019s sentence mistakenly ordered restitution for Sherman\u2019s funeral expenses to be paid to Sherman\u2019s parents, when the evidence indicated that the expenses had already been paid directly by VOCA. Upon remand, the District Court\u2019s judgment should be amended accordingly to correct this technical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u00b619 However, that does not resolve Ness\u2019s argument. Section 46-18-243(2)(a)(v), MCA, provides that VOCA is a \u2018Victim\u201d for purposes of restitution only \u201cto the extent that it has reimbursed a victim for pecuniary loss.\u201d Thus, there must be a primary \u201cvictim\u201d for whom VOCA made payment before it can be deemed a \u201cvictim\u201d for reimbursement purposes. Ness argues that Sherman, her estate, and her parents all fail to satisfy the statutory definition of\u2018Victim\u201d under the crime with which he was charged, as Sherman was not a \u2018homicide\u201d victim. Section 46-18-243(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Aio\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u00b620 Section 46-18-201(5), MCA, provides that if a victim \u2018has sustained a pecuniary loss,\u201d the sentencing judge shall require payment of full restitution to the victim. Likewise, \u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA, provides that a sentencing court \u201cshall, as part of the sentence, require an offender to make full restitution to any victim who has sustained pecuniary loss ....\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>LaTray, </em>the defendant argued that neither the towing service nor the ambulance qualified as victims of any of the offenses of which he was convicted. At that time, \u00a746-18-241(1), MCA (1997), stated that a sentencing judge must require an offender \u201cto make full restitution to any victim <em>of the offense </em>who has sustained pecuniary loss <em>as a result of the offense </em>....\u201d (emphasis added). LaTray argued that losses must be directly attributable to an offense in order to qualify. We rejected this argument, reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWN\">[ajdmittedly, application of \u00a746-18-241(1), MCA, requires some interpretation of just how remote a loss can be before it can no longer be considered to be \u201ca result of the offense.\u201d However, the fact that the language is somewhat open does not imply that \u201cdirect\u201d losses are the only ones that qualify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 14. In the 2003 Legislature, House Bill 220 was introduced and passed to, among other things, \u201caddress court opinions\u201dconcerning restitution. Laws of Montana, 2003, Ch. 272. The new law struck the language italicized in the above quote from \u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA, eliminating the words requiring a victim to be a victim \u201cof the offense\u201d and the victim\u2019s loss to be \u201cas a result of the offense.\u201d While we find no explanation in the legislative history for these specific revisions, we can only conclude from the language changes that the Legislature intended to broaden the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d and to relax in some fashion the requirement that victim losses be a \u201cresult\u201d of the offense. We rather think that the Legislature sought to follow our course in <em>LaTray </em>by requiring restitution for persons who are affected by a defendant\u2019s actions, such as the towing service involved in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"AHY\">\u00b621 Had Ness not run over Sherman, there would have been no evidence to cover up. Sherman\u2019s funeral expenses result from Ness\u2019s actions. Given this nexus and the broadening of the statutory language described above, we conclude that Sherman or her estate is a \u201cvictim\u201d who has \u201csuffer[ed] the loss of property, bodily injury, or death as a result of ... the commission of an offense.\u201d Section 46-18-243(2)(a)-(2)(a)(i)(A), MCA. Further, VOCA, having paid for these expenses, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>entitled to reimbursement under \u00a746-18-243(2)(a)(v), MCA. Although the District Court named Sherman\u2019s parents, Sherman or her estate is the primary victim and is eligible for reimbursement from VOCA, who is the secondary victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b622  Ness points out that VOCA did not actually \u201creimburse\u201d anyone for Sherman\u2019s funeral expenses because it paid the funeral home directly, but payment of Sherman\u2019s expenses was nonetheless a reimbursement to her or her estate. We will not interpret the statute to a require a straw man in the form of Sherman\u2019s estate to make payment to the funeral home in order to qualify for reimbursement by VOCA. The law does not require idle acts. Section 1-3-223, MCA (2005). Accordingly, VOCA was entitled to restitution pursuant to \u00a746-18-243(2)(a)(v), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b623 Affirmed and remanded for entry of an amended judgment in accordance herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-11\"> The judgment states that Ness will be \u201cresponsible for restitution for the funeral expenses of the victim to Russ and Joan Sherman ... in the amount of $3500.00, payable to the Department of Corrections Restitution ....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\"> We clarified that the nexus requirement applied \u201cto either the offense for which the offender is being sentenced, or to the offender himself or herself\u2019in <em>State v.
