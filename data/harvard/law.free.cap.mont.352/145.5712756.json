We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Acm\">\u00b62 Gonzales raises several issues on appeal that we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">\u00b63 Issue One: Whether the District Court properly concluded that the public duty doctrine bars Gonzales\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Whether Gonzales was unlawfully arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">\u00b65 On the evening of April 3, 2005, Gonzales was the lone clerk at a Town Pump store on East Main Street in Bozeman, Montana. At 9:55 p.m. a man later identified as transient Jose Mario Gonzalez-Menjivar entered the store wearing a ski cap. He held a knife to Gonzales\u2019 throat and demanded money. Gonzales was able to surreptitiously dial 911 on her cell phone shortly after Menjivar entered the store but could not talk to anyone and never knew whether the call went through. In the meanwhile, Gonzales began removing money from the safe, which was limited by a security device to dispensing $100 every two or three minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">\u00b66 Gonzales\u2019 911 call did go through to Gallatin County dispatch, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>dispatchers heard enough on the open line to understand that there was a robbery in progress somewhere. Dispatch notified Bozeman Police that there was a robbery in progress somewhere in the city, and officers began checking open businesses. Meanwhile, dispatchers worked quickly to identify the location of the robbery. They used a law enforcement database called I/LEADS to determine that the call had been made from a cell phone number registered to Gonzales, and that her last known employment was a Town Pump. The system gave the telephone number of the Town Pump store where Gonzales was last known to work, but not its address. Dispatcher Pickering used a phone book to match the phone number in the I/LEADS system to the Town Pump on East Main Street. She \u201cscreamed it\u2019s the East Main Town Pump, turned around and high-fived the chaplain\u201dand notified officers of the probable location of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b67 Officers responded to the East Main Town Pump and saw that the business was dark and appeared to be closed. Sgt. Megargel directed responding officers to begin establishing a perimeter around the building. An officer approached the building and determined that one of the doors was unlocked and then retreated, while other Bozeman Police and Gallatin County Sheriffs Department officers arrived. Officers approached the building again, saw a man inside wearing a hooded sweatshirt, and then withdrew to the perimeter. Officers saw shadowy figures of two people inside the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b68 In the meanwhile, Menjivar had picked up Gonzales\u2019 cell phone from the counter and closed it, cutting off the connection with the dispatchers. Their calls back to Gonzales\u2019 cell phone were not answered. Dispatchers called the land line for the Town Pump store, and when the phone rang Menjivar picked it up, inadvertently pressed a \u201ctalk\u201d command and placed the phone in his pocket. This left the line open. Dispatchers discerned a male and a female voice, but had difficulty hearing what was happening because the phone was in Menjivar\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b69 At 10:12, Menjivar forced Gonzales into a restroom and during the next four minutes, raped her. Neither the dispatchers nor the officers at the scene knew that'this was happening. The dispatchers testified that they would have immediately notified the officers if there had been any indication that Gonzales was being raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b610 Sgt. Megargel believed that there could be a barricaded suspect with a hostage in the Town Pump. He requested a K-9 dog team and special response team. Menjivar and Gonzales left the bathroom and Gonzales continued to obtain money from the safe. The officers had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>yet announced their presence at the scene. During the event Menjivar repeatedly threatened Gonzales with death and continued to hold a knife on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b611 During these events the responding officers knew there were two people in the Town Pump but never knew whether there were more than two. From time to time they could see \u201cshadows moving\u201d in the dark building. Dispatch informed officers that there was a transient camp near the store and that persons from the camp could be inside the store. Officers investigated another report of a person moving on foot through the area who turned out to be a jogger. Officers did not know how many perpetrators or victims were involved or how any perpetrators were armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b612 Menjivar left the store at 10:28 and was immediately arrested outside. Officers then shouted commands demanding that anyone else in the store come out. The deputy with the K-9 dog gave commands for anyone inside to come out or he would release the dog. Gonzales then came out of the store barefoot and wearing a Town Pump apron. She testified that officers directed her to show her hands and to lie on the ground and that she complied. Officer Kaycee Anderson, one of the defendants, handcuffed Gonzales and performed a pat-down search during which Gonzales said that she had been raped. Anderson immediately got Gonzales to her feet and walked her to a safe location at a police car and removed the handcuffs. Anderson asked Gonzales if she needed an ambulance, and Gonzales said that she did not because she was not hurt. Anderson drove Gonzales to the hospital for treatment. Gonzales confirmed Anderson\u2019s description of these events and testified that she was on the ground in handcuffs for about 30 seconds. Neither Menjivar nor Gonzales knew that law enforcement officers were on the scene prior to leaving the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b613 While Anderson was dealing with Gonzales officers were moving in to secure the building, giving commands for anyone else to come out of the store. They secured the building without finding anyone else inside. Officers did not know that Gonzales had been raped until she came out and told Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b614 Officers did not know that Gonzales was the female voice that had been heard by dispatchers in the store until she came out and was identified by Anderson based upon a prior contact. Anderson knew from the prior contact that Gonzales was pregnant, but there was no evidence that any of the other officers knew this or that they could determine the pregnancy from Gonzales\u2019 appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u00b615 While Officer Anderson suspected when Gonzales came out that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>she was the clerk in the store, officers could not immediately confirm this and the building was not yet secured. Sgt. Megargel explained why the officers at the scene could not assume that Gonzales was the victim in sole reliance on the information from dispatch that they had heard two voices:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">Based on my training and experience in my almost 13 years of law enforcement, I could see why-we can\u2019t make assumptions. I mean, that what they told us that there was. But until I see what there is and until I know what there is, you know, I could assume in the back of my mind that the information is accurate and correct, but I would be doing myself an injustice to assume that there was only two people, and one male and one female. That would put me at risk, that would put my shift at risk, that would put the citizens at risk, it would put the victim at risk and it will put the suspect at risk. We didn\u2019t assume anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Therefore, they secured Gonzales and confirmed her identity and status as quickly as possible (about 30 seconds) after she came out of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b616 Gonzales sued Bozeman and Gallatin County law enforcement agencies, several officers individually, and Town Pump. The government defendants removed the action to United States District Court, where the court granted their motions for summary judgment and dismissed all of the claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Gonzales then re-filed the action in state court and settled with Town Pump. The District Court granted summary judgment to the Bozeman and Gallatin County defendants and Gonzales appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b617 Menjivar was charged with and pled guilty to rape, robbery and aggravated kidnapping. In March, 2006, he was sentenced to a term of 180 years in the Montana State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u00b618 This Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decisions on summary judgment, applying the same criteria as the district court, found in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Watson v. Dundas, </em>2006 MT 104, \u00b6 16, 332 Mont. 164, 136 P.3d 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">\u00b619 Gonzales claims that the Bozeman and Gallatin County defendants negligently responded to the situation at the Town Pump, allowing Menjivar to rape her and that they then improperly arrested her when she came out of the store. A negligence claim depends upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>establishment of a legal duty on the part of the defendant, breach of that duty, causation, and damages. <em>Lopez v. Great Falls Pre-Release Services, </em>1999 MT 199, \u00b6 18, 295 Mont. 416, 986 P.2d 1081. Determination of the existence of a duty is an issue of law. <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"Azq\">\u00b620 The issue here is whether the Bozeman and Gallatin County defendants owed a duty to the plaintiff while responding to the situation at the Town Pump. The District Court held that they had no duty. The general rule, often called the public duty doctrine, is that a law enforcement officer has no duty to protect a particular person absent a special relationship because the officer\u2019s duty to protect and preserve the peace is owed to the public at large and not to individual members of the public. <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 363, 983 P.2d 972; <em>Eves v. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, </em>2005 MT 157, \u00b6 9, 327 Mont. 437, 114 P.3d 1037. Despite the public duty doctrine, a government officer may have an actionable duty to a particular individual if the officer is in a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with that individual. There are four recognized situations in which a special relationship has been found: (1) where a statute intended to protect a specific class of persons from a particular type of harm imposes a duty; (2) where the government agent undertakes a specific action to protect a person or property; (3) where government action reasonably induces detrimental reliance by a member of the public; and (4) where the government has actual custody of the plaintiff or of a third person who harms the plaintiff. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b621 While not expressly decided under the public duty doctrine, other decisions from this Court have considered whether there is a duty to protect when a governmental agent has actual custody of the plaintiff or of a third person who harms the plaintiff. <em>Lopez; LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, 299 Mont. 449, 999 P.2d 1010; <em>Prindle v. Ravalli County, </em>2006 MT 62, 331 Mont. 338, 133 P.3d 165. In <em>Prindle </em>this Court noted the \u201cobvious similarity\u201d between these cases and the public duty doctrine and that it may be appropriate fin the future\u201d to \u201cweave these parallel strands of authority together.\u201d <em>Prindle, </em>\u00b6 26. We do so now. The decisions in <em>Lopez, LaTray </em>and <em>Prindle </em>all involve application of the fourth \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exception to the public duty doctrine identified in <em>Nelson. </em>As stated in <em>Nelson, </em>a duty may arise as an exception to the public duty doctrine when the governmental agent \u2018has actual custody of the plaintiff or of a third person who causes harm to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22. Therefore, the decisions in <em>Lopez, LaTray </em>and <em>Prindle </em>should not be regarded as a separate line of authority to be applied in addition to the public duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>doctrine. Rather, those decisions should be regarded as applicable to the issue of whether there is a custody or control exception to the public duty doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b622 The District Court below held that the public duty doctrine applied to the claims against the City of Bozeman, Gallatin County and the individual officer defendants. The District Court also found that none of the <em>Nelson </em>special relationship exceptions applied and that therefore the defendants owed no duty to protect Gonzales from Menjivar.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b623 Gonzales\u2019 arguments on appeal emphasize applicability of the fourth <em>Nelson </em>exception, which arises when the government has actual custody or control of the plaintiff or a third person who harms the plaintiff. This exception arises, in part, from the Restatement (Second) Torts, \u00a7319, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">One who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Before that section and the exception apply, the officer must take charge of the third person. We have held that an officer takes charge under \u00a7319 \"when the police officer takes a person into custody, or exerts some legal or physical restraint on his or her liberty.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u00b624 The cases relied upon by Gonzales do not assist her argument that she is entitled to application of <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>fourth exception to the public duty doctrine because they are each distinguishable. In <em>Lopez, </em>the convict who injured the plaintiff was under the express authority and control of the Pre-Release Center that failed to track his whereabouts after he walked away. In <em>LaTray </em>the officers had actual physical custody of the third party who harmed the plaintiff, and that party was assisting the officers in removing a prisoner from a police car at the time of the assault. In <em>Prindle </em>a court order required the county to take custody of and incarcerate a convicted individual who was turned away by jailers when he tried to surrender to serve time. That individual harmed the plaintiff during the time he should have been in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">\u00b625 It is clear under the facts of this case that the defendants never had custody or control of Menjivar until he came out of the Town Pump and was placed under arrest. Furthermore, it is only speculation that responding officers could have reasonably and safely arrested Menjivar before he raped Gonzales, an incident that occurred only minutes after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the initial arrival of officers at the scene. Because of the quick and accurate investigative work done by the dispatchers, the initial responding officers arrived at the store about six minutes after Menjivar entered. The store was dark inside and the door was not locked. They did not know who was inside or how many people were involved. They had no information about the weapons involved and had no way to determine in that time what reaction they would provoke by confronting those inside or forcibly entering the building. Contrary to Gonzales\u2019 assertion in her brief, the officers did not watch and listen while she was raped. The officers\u2019 perimeter around the building was not custody or control of either Menjivar or Gonzales, but was only a step in attempting to assert custody or control of those inside the Town Pump. A hostage or captive like Gonzales is not in the control of responding officers, but of the criminal holding her. <em>Kepner v. Houstoun, </em>164 F. Supp. 2d 494, 500 (E.D. Pa. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b626  Therefore, we conclude as a matter of law that the responding officers did not have custody or control of either Gonzales or Menjivar at the time the rape occurred. They did not have custody or control of Menjivar until he came out of the store and officers placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b627 Gonzales also argues, briefly, that other <em>Nelson </em>special relationship exceptions to the public duty doctrine should be applied. She argues that the defendants undertook specific action to protect her by responding to the Town Pump. The officers responding to the situation at the Town Pump were there to intervene in a possible robbery. Their identification of Gonzales as a victim and their understanding of her relationship to the events did not come about until she came out of the building and her role and identity were established. While dispatchers had determined that the initial cell phone call to 911 was placed from a number registered to Gonzales, they could not confirm that Gonzales herself was using the phone or that she had placed the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b628 In <em>Eves </em>this Court found that undertaking efforts to find an identified missing person did not support a special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine. In <em>Kepner </em>the Court expressed the principle that law enforcement officers have no duty to rescue based upon knowing about a person\u2019s situation or even expressing intent to help. <em>Kepner, </em>164 F. Supp. 2d at 498. In <em>Nelson </em>a duty arose because the officers personally dealt with the decedent and undertook affirmative steps to keep her from driving her vehicle because they believed that she was too intoxicated to do so safely. By contrast, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>officers here were in no position to undertake specific actions to protect Gonzales until she came out of the store and her identity and role in the events were established. The facts here do not support application of the <em>Nelson </em>exception to the public duty doctrine that applies when officers undertake specific action to protect a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b629 Gonzales also argues that she was reasonably induced to detrimentally rely on law enforcement officers. The facts adduced in the District Court do not support her argument. Gonzales did not know whether her attempt to call 911 had been successful and did not know that law enforcement officers had been dispatched to the store. She did not know that law enforcement officers had a perimeter around the store. The only action she could possibly have taken in reliance upon actions of the officers was to eventually come out of the store. After Menjivar\u2019s arrest, she clearly had to leave the store so that officers could secure the crime scene and so that she could get medical attention. The officers were preparing to send a police dog into the store to subdue anyone else inside, and she had no alternative but to come out. This does not constitute detrimental reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b630 <em>Issue Two: Whether Gonzales was unlawfully arrested. </em>Gonzales\u2019 second claim is that the officers wrongfully arrested her when she left the building. The evidence adduced in the proceedings in District Court showed that after Menjivar left the store and was arrested, officers still did not know how many people were left inside or their connection to Menjivar and the robbery. The officers gave commands for anyone inside to come out and after some delay, Gonzales did so. She was directed to lie on the ground and was then handcuffed. After the approximately 30 seconds required to confirm her identity and involvement, she was taken to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b631 This event was at most a justified investigatory stop reasonably related to the officers\u2019 overall response to the robbery at the Town Pump. <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S. Ct. 1568, 1574 (1985); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 1879 (1968). Even outside the context of responding to a felony in progress, police are allowed to conduct a brief investigatory stop as long as they have a reasonable suspicion that justifies their actions. This is less than probable cause and requires only a minimal level of objective justification. <em>Gallegos v. City of Los Angeles, </em>308 F.3d 987, 990 (9th Cir. 2002). The Fourth Amendment \u201caccepts the risk\u201dthat officers may stop innocent people. <em>Gallegos, </em>308 F.3d at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b632 In Montana law, this appears as a requirement for particularized suspicion that criminal activity is currently taking place. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, \u00b6 24, 315 Mont. 59, 67 P.3d 295. The existence of particularized suspicion depends on the totality of the circumstances but does not require certainty on the part of the officer. <em>State v. Trombley, </em>2005 MT 174, \u00b6 9, 327 Mont. 507, 116 P.3d 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b633  In this case the officers did not have to suspect that there was criminal activity taking place. Based upon the information given to them, they were reasonably certain that criminal activity was taking place. The officers responded to a call that there was a robbery in progress at a Town Pump store. They had information that there were two people in the store and that one of them was female, but did not know if there were others. When Menjivar came out and was arrested they did not know how many others were inside or the relationship between any others and Menjivar. Gonzales did not immediately show herself when officers ordered anyone in the building to come out. When Gonzales came out she was directed to lie on the ground, and was handcuffed and detained for what she estimated was only 30 seconds until her status could be determined. Officers were still giving commands directed at clearing the store and were trying to secure the building when Officer Anderson took Gonzales to the hospital for medical care. We decline to adopt a rule that would require officers in a similar situation to assume that anyone else at the scene of a crime is a victim or otherwise not involved in crimin al activity after an initial arrest is made. Under the circumstances presented in this case, the officers responded to Gonzales quickly and professionally and immediately got her to a safe position and to medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b634 Law enforcement officers are not required to compromise their safety or the safety of others by making potentially unwarranted assumptions as to the identity, involvement or dangerousness of persons at a crime scene. As the District Court noted in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOp\">Assumptions get officers and victims killed. It would have been unreasonable for the officers to assume that the plaintiff was the victim without some verification, and they were correct to treat everyone who exited the building as a possible perpetrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArH\">Officers are justified in diligently pursuing a means of investigation that will confirm or dispel suspicions as expeditiously as the situation allows. In doing so, they may be required to detain and identify a person who is later confirmed to be a victim and not a perpetrator. Officers who do so, however, have not committed any wrong. <em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. at 686-87, 105 S. Ct. at 1575-76. Courts have upheld much longer handcuffed investigatory detentions of persons who were later determined to not be perpetrators. <em>Gallegos, </em>308 F.3d at 992-93; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Haynie v. County of Los </em>Angeles, 339 F.3d 1071, 1077 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"Aee\">\u00b635  Under the circumstances of this case, the brief detention of Gonzales was justified and provides her with no cause of action against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b636 The District Court orders granting summary judgment to the defendants are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b183-5\">JUSTICES WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b183-6\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"Av6s\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AC5\">\u00b637 I concur with the resolution of issue one and dissent as to issue two: whether Leah Gonzales was unlawfully arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b638 As the court notes, police are allowed to conduct a brief investigatory stop as long as they have a particularized suspicion that criminal activity is currently taking place and that the person in question is or has been engaged in wrongdoing. <em>State v. Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, \u00b6 24, 315 Mont. 59, 67 P.3d 295; \u00a746-5-401(1), MCA. Whether particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact. <em>State v. Deines, </em>2009 MT 179, \u00b6 8, 351 Mont. 1, 208 P.3d 857. In light of the totality of circumstances set forth below, I submit that the ultimate question of fact (was there particularized suspicion) is in dispute and must be resolved by a jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\u00b639 1. Leah Gonzales (Leah) dialed 911 on her cell phone after the defendant entered the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\u00b640 2. Upon receiving the 911 call, the dispatchers knew that there was a robbery in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\u00b641 3. The dispatchers were able to determine that the call came from Leah\u2019s cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">\u00b642 4. The dispatchers were able to determine that Leah\u2019s last known place of employment was a Town Pump.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">\u00b643 5. Police officers responded to the Town Pump where they arrested the defendant as he exited.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">\u00b644 6. In response to the officers\u2019 commands, Leah came out of the Town Pump, bare-footed and wearing her Town Pump apron.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">\u00b645 7.

Officer Anderson also knew that Leah was pregnant and suspected that Leah was the store clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">\u00b647 Given the above totality of circumstances, a very strong argument can be made that there was no basis for conducting an investigatory stop of Leah. That is, there was no basis for concluding that Leah was or had been engaged in wrongdoing. Section 46-5-401(1), MCA. At the very least, looking at the totality of the circumstances, there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>question of fact as to whether there was particularized suspicion justifying having Leah lie on the ground and be hand-cuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b648 The District Court erred in concluding as a matter of law that there was no question of fact as to the existence of particularized suspicion. I would reverse the grant of summary judgment on issue two and allow the matter to be presented to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b649 Finally, I confess that after reading Justice Nelson\u2019s dissent on the issue of the public duty doctrine, I thought that perhaps I had missed what Justice Nelson depicts as the main issue on appeal; whether the public duty doctrine should be thrown out as violative of Article II, sec. 18 of the Montana Constitution and \u00a72-9-102, MCA. Upon re-reading the briefs, however, I re-affirmed my recollection that, although the appellant argued that the <em>exceptions </em>to the public duty doctrine were triggered, there was no constitutional or statutory challenge to the doctrine itself. Nowhere in the five briefs on appeal is there any citation to Article II, sec. 18 of the Montana Constitution or to \u00a72-9-102, MCA. None of the parties suggest that the Court should retain or reject the public duty doctrine. In other words, the viability of the public duty doctrine was not an issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b650 In my view, constitutional issues are best left to resolution after a party has raised a constitutional challenge and the issues have been briefed and argued. As Justice Nelson frequently points out when writing for the Court, we consistently refuse to address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Matter of </em>M.B., 350 Mont. 76, in M.B., the appellants sought, for the first time on appeal, to raise \u2018Various constitutional issues\u201d re the application of ICWA. For the Court, Justice Nelson stated: \u201cWe consistently refuse to consider theories or issues raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>M.B. </em>at 80, n. 1; <em>Hajenga v. Schwein, </em>336 Mont. 507, \u00b6 21, 155 P.3d 1241 (it is unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given an opportunity to consider); <em>In re A.S., </em>334 Mont. 280, \u00b6 35, 146 P.3d 778; <em>In re Estate of Kindsfather, </em>326 Mont. 192, 108 P.3d 487 (2005); <em>Bekkedahl v.

As to Issue One, and the colloquy between Justice Leaphart and Justice Nelson concerning the viability of the Public Duty Doctrine, it is apparent that our jurisprudence with respect to resolving issues not explicitly raised by the parties is not entirely consistent. For purposes of this case, I agree with Justice Nelson that the question of the Public Duty Doctrine\u2019s continuing viability is open to challenge in the proper case. I will reserve further judgment on this important constitutional issue until that case is before us and the issue is squarely presented and fully briefed. I therefore concur with the resolution of Issue One and dissent from our resolution of Issue Two.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b185-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AWz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u00b654 This Court\u2019s public duty doctrine has claimed yet another innocent victim. Last time, it was Doris Nelson, a widow whose husband died as the result of medical care provided by an unqualified, unprofessional, and corrupt physician whom the State Board of Medical Examiners nevertheless licensed to practice medicine in this state. <em>See Doris Nelson v. State, </em>2008 MT 336, 346 Mont. 206, 195 P.3d 293. This time, it is Leah Gonzales, a six-months-pregnant employee of a Bozeman Town Pump who was raped in the store\u2019s restroom on April 3, 2005, while local law enforcement officers, having responded to her 911 call, were standing by outside the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u00b655 In <em>Doris Nelson, </em>this Court held that since the laws governing the regulation of the practice of medicine protect all the people of Montana, they do not, therefore, protect any of the people of Montana. <em>Doris Nelson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35, 49-50. Today, the Court holds that because the law enforcement officers who responded to Leah\u2019s 911 call owed a duty to protect all the citizens of Bozeman and Gallatin County, they did not, therefore, owe this duty to any of the citizens of Bozeman and Gallatin County. Opinion, \u00b6 20. That is because under this Court\u2019s public duty doctrine, \u201c \u2018a duty owed to all is a duty owed to none.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>Stephen Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 363, 983 P.2d 972. Plaintiffs counsel will be hard-pressed to explain this to Leah, who surely will wonder why it is that because the police owed a duty to her and all other Bozeman and Gallatin County citizens on the evening of April 3, 2005, they did not, therefore, owe this duty to her individually, with the result that her negligence claim fails at its inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b656 I continue to reject this senseless judge-created doctrine as a violation of Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution. <em>See Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, \u00b6\u00b6 89, 93-95, 321 Mont. 210, 90 P.3d 394 (Nelson, J., specially concurring and dissenting); <em>Prosser v. Kennedy Enterprises, </em>2008 MT 87, \u00b6\u00b6 71-75, 342 Mont. 209, 179 P.3d 1178 (Nelson, J., dissenting). While I explained my reasoning in <em>Massee </em>and <em>Prosser, </em>I further develop those arguments below. But first, I explain that to the extent this Court insists on continuing to apply this juris-legislation, it should, at least, do so in accordance with its own court-made rules-here, the second \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exception to the public duty doctrine: \u201c \u2018when a government agent undertakes specific action to protect a person or property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stephen Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The \u201cUndertake Specific Action\u201dException</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b657 At the outset, I agree with Justice Leaphart\u2019s dissent as to Issue Two. There is a question of fact as to whether there was particularized suspicion justifying the officers having Leah lie on the ground and be handcuffed. Concurrence/Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 38-47. The majority, who hold to the contrary, have exceeded the scope of appellate review and have improperly usurped the role of the jury in deciding that there was, in fact, particularized suspicion for conducting an investigatory stop of Leah and that the officers\u2019 conduct was, in fact, reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b658 But the same is just as true with respect to Issue One. First, there is no dispute that the Bozeman and Gallatin County officers learned through a 911 call that a robbery was in progress at the Town Pump. Second, there is no dispute that the officers undertook specific action to protect people and property by responding to the 911 call. Indeed, it belies all logic and common sense to suggest that the officers initially \u201cdisperse[d] throughout the City [to] check for suspicious activity\u201d (as the City puts it) and then rushed to the Town Pump (arriving just minutes after Leah placed the call) for any other reason but \u2018to protect a person or property.\u201dEven the City concedes this point, acknowledging that the police \u201cmay have undertaken specific actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to protect Gonzales, including responding to her 911 call regarding a possible robbery, establishing a perimeter around Town Pump, and contacting the Special Response Team.\u201d Likewise, the County acknowledges that \u2018the 911 dispatchers and the law enforcement officers involved did undertake actions in responding to what they perceived was a robbery in progress.\u201d The County notes that the dispatchers made \u201cextraordinary efforts\u201d to locate the scene of the robbery and arranged to have law enforcement officers dispatched to the Town Pump. The County further observes that the officers then established a perimeter around the building and arranged for the implementation of the Special Response Team and a negotiator-all with the purpose of protecting people and property. Third, it is reasonable to infer, as we must, that the officers recognized the 911 call may have been made by someone in need of help (such as the victim of the robbery) and that upon arriving at the scene, they made tactical decisions as to how to proceed in order to address this possibility. <em>See Debcon v. City of Glasgow, </em>2001 MT 124, \u00b6 21, 305 Mont. 391, 28 P.3d 478 (\u201cAny inferences to be drawn from the factual record ... must be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment\u201d-here, Leah). Fourth, there is no dispute that the officers arrived several minutes before Leah was raped. Fifth, there is no dispute that the officers were present outside the store while Leah was being raped inside. Sixth, and lastly, there is no dispute that the 911 dispatchers reported to the officers during the course of these events that a male at the other end of the line was \u2018threatening\u201d a female and that the female was \u201ccrying\u201d and \u2018Very frightened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b659 Leah\u2019s claim is that the officers failed to use reasonable care in responding to her 911 call and the robbery-in particular, by not using reasonable care to protect innocent persons inside the store from being further injured by the perpetrator of the robbery. In short, she claims the officers breached a legal duty and that this breach of duty was a substantial factor in the injuries she suffered. <em>See Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 540, 189 P.3d 615; <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp., </em>276 Mont. 342, 371, 916 P.2d 122, 139-40 (1996); <em>see also e.g. Massee, </em>\u00b6 48 (\u201c[T]he Sheriffs negligence was a cause of Vickie\u2019s death if it was a substantial factor in bringing it about.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). As we reaffirmed just last year, \u2018Isjince negligence actions ordinarily involve questions of fact, they are generally not susceptible to summary judgment.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Swift Transp. Co., </em>2008 MT 105, \u00b6 12, 342 Mont. 335, 181 P.3d 601. The only exception is where, on the facts presented, reasonable minds could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>differ. <em>See Poole v. Poole, </em>2000 MT 117, \u00b6 14, 299 Mont. 435, 1 P.3d 936; <em>see also e.g. Peterson, </em>\u00b6 37. Here, however, reasonable minds certainly could-and, in fact, do-differ over the officers\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b660 In this connection, Leah\u2019s expert on police and security practices (whose affidavit Leah filed in the District Court) determined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">Both the Bozeman Police officers and Gallatin Sheriffs officers acted with reckless disregard to a known risk of harm and deliberate indifference to Leah Gonzales\u2019 welfare by failing to act on a <em>crime in progress. </em>This incident <em>was not </em>and <em>never became </em>a hostage incident or issue. Officers, specifically Greg Megargel, officer in charge of the scene, recklessly failed to quickly identify to the robber and rapist, [Menjivar], that the police were on the scene and ready to intervene and stop his actions. To the contrary, they backed out of [sight]. Had they used all of the information known to them the best police practices would have been to immediately identify their presence, secure the perimeter and intercept his actions against Leah Gonzales.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">The information known to the police officers on the scene by their own observation included knowledge of the doors being unlocked and that there were two subjects in the store one of them obviously Leah Gonzales. She not only was known to work there, but officers on the scene knew her, and it was her cell phone that initiated the call and open line to the police. The open door meant unfettered access by the police to enter and intervene at will, which they chose not to do-a reckless and improper choice that violates best police practices. As time went on the police clearly had the opportunity to make a stealth entrance when Ms. Leah Gonzales was forced into the bathroom-an action the police clearly were aware of. Instead of a stealth entrance, the police simply remained stealth themselves while [Menjivar] was unfettered in his criminal actions against Leah Gonzales.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b661 Nevertheless, a majority of this Court-evidently sitting as a quasi-jury-has decided as a factual matter that \u2018the officers here were in no position to undertake specific actions to protect [Leah] until she came out of the store and her identity and role in the events were established.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 28. This assertion founders on four factors. First, as just noted, the City and the County themselves acknowledge that the officers undertook specific action to protect a person or property by ascertaining the origin of the 911 call and the events transpiring at the other end of the line and responding en masse, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>in multi-agency force, to the location of the crime. Second, the County states that the officers\u2019 actions with respect to Leah in fact did <em>not </em>depend on knowing her identity and role in the events. The County explains in its brief that \u201ceven had law enforcement been made aware that Leah Gonzales was inside the building, it would not \u2018have altered, in any manner\u2019 their response at the scene.\u201d Third, the majority\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d is not by any means established on the record before us-in fact, it is directly contradicted by Leah\u2019s expert-and it is not this Court\u2019s role to weigh and resolve conflicts in the evidence, to judge the credibility of witnesses, and to find the facts. That, rather, is uniquely the task of a jury. <em>Sandman v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>1998 MT 286, \u00b6 45, 291 Mont. 456, 969 P.2d 277. Fourth, the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 actions also is a question of fact, <em>see In re Marriage of Bryant, </em>276 Mont. 317, 323, 916 P.2d 115, 119 (1996), and, as such, must be resolved by a jury, <em>Sandman, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b662 The Court relies on <em>Kepner v. Houstoun, </em>164 F. Supp. 2d 494 (E.D.Pa.2001), and Eves <em>v. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, </em>2005 MT 157, 327 Mont. 437, 114 P.3d 1037. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 28. But these cases are readily distinguishable from the present case and thus lend no support to the Court\u2019s decision here. <em>Kepner </em>arose out of a hostage situation at a Pennsylvania state hospital. The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that state officials had violated their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Kepner, </em>164 F. Supp. 2d at 496-97. In the portion of the <em>Kepner </em>opinion cited by the Court, the federal district court discussed the \u201cstate-created danger\u201d rule and duties which arise under the Due Process Clause as the result of special relationships between state agents and citizens. <em>Kepner, </em>164 F. Supp. 2d at 498. The court ultimately determined that the plaintiffs had no cause of action under substantive due process principles. <em>See Kepner, </em>164 F. Supp. 2d at 500-01. But the court did <em>not </em>in any way purport to state the law as it relates to the special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine. <em>Kepner </em>simply has nothing at all to do with the present case-factually, legally, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b663 In <em>Eves, </em>Zachary (a voluntarily committed patient at the Montana State Hospital in Warm Springs) left the hospital grounds and walked into the countryside without telling anyone. The temperature that day was approximately 37 degrees, and there was snow on the ground. Once hospital staff discovered that Zachary had left, the nursing supervisor telephoned local law enforcement to report his disappearance. She asked if county police could locate him but did not ask for a search-and-rescue operation. Indeed, the dispatcher told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>nursing supervisor that because Zachary was a voluntarily committed patient, the police had no legal basis to stop and detain him. Thereafter, county police officer Blume was notified of Zachary\u2019s disappearance, but he did not initiate a search. Instead, he \u2018kept lookout for Zachary during his routine patrol of the general area where Zachary was believed to be.\u201d He did not see any signs of Zachary, who was found several weeks later in a field approximately six miles from the hospital. <em>See </em>Eves, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b664 To the extent Blume actually undertook to protect Zachary, he did so by passively keeping \u2018lookout\u201d for Zachary during his routine patrol of the general area. Here, by contrast, officers from multiple agencies abandoned their \u201croutine patrols\u201d and undertook specific action. They responded to a 911 call arising out of a robbery at the Town Pump. They endeavored to ascertain who was inside and what was transpiring. When the 911 call through Leah\u2019s cell phone was dropped, they didn\u2019t pack up and leave; rather, they called the store\u2019s land line and reestablished contact. All of this was done in an effort to protect people and property. <em>Eves </em>does not stand for the Court\u2019s untenable proposition that when police officers respond to the scene of a robbery, they have no duty to use reasonable care regarding the protection and safety of victims inside. Obviously, they do have such a duty. Indeed, the police are in the business of rescue and prevention of injury to person and property. Accordingly, when these professionals involve themselves in an actual rescue, they are bound to do so in accordance with applicable standards of care and proper procedure. <em>See e.g. City of Kotzebue v. McLean, </em>702 P.2d 1309, 1313-14 (Alaska 1985) (police officer who responded to a life-threatening phone call owed a duty of reasonable care to protect the plaintiff); <em>Hopkins v. State, </em>702 P.2d 311, 319 (Kan. 1985) (\u201cA law enforcement officer is obligated to use reasonable and ordinary care and diligence in the exercise of his duties, to use his best judgment, and to exercise that reasonable degree of learning, skill and experience which is ordinarily possessed by other law enforcement officers in the same or similar locations.\u201d); <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 323 and cmt. a (1965) (one who undertakes to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of the other\u2019s person is subject to liability to the other for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to perform or complete the undertaking). As Judge Keating pointed out in <em>Riss v. City of New York, </em>240 N.E.2d 860 (N.Y. 1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">No one questions the proposition that the first duty of government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>is to assure its citizens the opportunity to live in personal security.... [I]f a stranger, who had absolutely no obligation to aid [the plaintiff], had offered her assistance, and thereafter [she was injured] as a result of the negligence of the volunteer, the courts would certainly require him to pay damages. Why then should the city, whose duties are imposed by law and include the prevention of crime and, consequently, extend far beyond that of the Good Samaritan, not be responsible? ... It is not a distortion to summarize the essence of the city\u2019s case here in the following language: \u2018Because we owe a duty to everybody, we owe it to nobody.\u201d Were it not for the fact that this position has been hallowed by much ancient and revered precedent, we would surely dismiss it as preposterous. To say that there is no duty is, of course, to start with the conclusion. The question is whether or not there should be liability for the negligent failure to provide adequate police protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><em>Riss, </em>240 N.E.2d at 862 (Keating, J., dissenting) (citations and paragraph breaks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b665 While acknowledging that the responding officers undertook specific actions to protect people and property, the City and the County attempt to avoid this exception to the public duty doctrine by arguing that it applies only if the \u201cdetrimental reliance\u201d exception also applies. <em>See Stephen Nelson, </em>\u00b6 22 (\u201cAn exception to the public duty doctrine arises when there exists a special relationship between the police officer and an individual,\u201d and \u201c \u2018[a] special relationship can be established... (2) when a government agent undertakes specific action to protect a person or property; (3) by governmental actions that reasonably induce detrimental reliance by a member of the public; ....\u2019 \u201d). In other words, they assert that we must \u201ccombine\u201d these two exceptions into one. The City and the County then argue that Leah did not rely to her detriment on the officers\u2019 actions because she did not know for sure that the call to 911 actually went through and that the police actually responded. This approach, however, lacks any support in our caselaw and is properly (albeit, implicitly) rejected by the Court. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29; <em>see also Doris Nelson, </em>\u00b6 36 (\u201cA special relationship can be established in <em>one of four </em>ways ....\u201d (emphasis added)). The \u201cdetrimental reliance\u201d exception is distinct from the \u201cundertake specific action\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b666 Not only that, the approach argued by the City and the County belies common sense and, more importantly, what every person is taught by their parents and, indeed, by the police themselves. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Leah covertly and blindly (as was necessary under the circumstances) pushed the \u201c9-1-1\u201d buttons on her cell phone, she took a substantial risk of being further injured by her attacker should he discover her maneuver. In fact, he threatened to kill her if she called the police. But she desperately needed help, and she did the one thing that every person does in dire circumstances: she tried to call 911, she tried to send out the ordinary citizen\u2019s SOS, the average person\u2019s mayday.See <em>e.g. </em>Jeffrey D. Hickman, Note, <em>It\u2019s Time to Call 911 for Government Immunity, </em>43 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 1067,1067 (1993) (\u2018Tn our modern society we are trained, almost from birth, that we should telephone 911 to summon help in the event of a medical emergency. Generally, when one calls 911, prompt help arrives quickly, and professional assistance is rendered, resulting in countless saved lives.\u201d (footnotes omitted)); <em>State v. Williams, </em>623 N.W.2d 106, \u00b6\u00b6 84-89 (Wis. 2001) (Prosser, J., concurring) (explaining that \u201cthere is widespread public understanding of the 911 system\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is a system that citizens expect to depend upon in their own emergencies\u2019). While Leah no doubt <em>hoped </em>that she had pushed the right buttons, she <em>knew </em>that if she had, rescuers would undertake to protect and rescue her, and she <em>expected </em>that they would use reasonable care in responding to her call for help just as a person in medical need whose service dog dials \u201c9-1-1\u201d expects that if the call goes through, responders will be promptly dispatched and will exercise reasonable care in addressing the situation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is absurd to hold that although responding medical personnel owe a duty to the patient in the latter situation, the responding officers owed no duty to Leah here. <em>Cf. Cummins v. Lewis County, </em>133 P.3d 458, \u00b6 64 (Wash. 2006) (Chambers, C. Johnson, &amp; Sanders, JJ., concurring) (\u201cA government entity that encourages people to call it for medical emergencies should be liable for the foreseeable consequences proximately caused by its failure to exercise ordinary care.\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b667 Leah followed the rule that every one of us is taught from childhood: When in trouble and in need of assistance, call (or, at least, try to call) the police or the fire department; call 911! She did as she was taught, and she relied on the police-indeed, <em>counted </em>on them-to rescue her. That was the only reason why, at risk to her own safety, she dialed 911. Her subjective expectation that officers would undertake to protect her is not a function of her objective knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>that her plea for help was actually heard by them. The point is that she relied on the police, if her call did make.it through, to rescue her and use reasonable care in doing so. The same would be true if she had pressed an alarm button. While she might not know with certainty that the police had received the alarm, she would expect that if they had, they would exercise reasonable care when responding. As it turns out, Leah\u2019s 911 call did make it through and the police did undertake to protect her. The real question at issue in this case-a question for the jury-is whether the officers used reasonable care in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b668 For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the officers undertook specific action to protect people and property at the Town Pump; that the second special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine therefore applies; and that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the officers acted with reasonable care, thus precluding summary judgment.

As noted, this antiquated judge-created doctrine, which effectively immunizes governmental entities and their employees from liability for their tortious conduct, is incompatible with Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution, which states that \u201c[t]he state, counties, cities, towns, and all other local governmental entities shall have no immunity from suit for injury to a person or property, except as may be specifically provided by law by a 2/3 vote of each house of the legislature.\u201d <em>See Prosser, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 71-75 (Nelson, J., dissenting); <em>Massee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79-89, 93-95 (Nelson, J., specially concurring and dissenting). Not only that, the doctrine is incompatible with \u00a7 2-9-102, MCA, which states that \u2018lejvery governmental entity is subject to liability for its torts and those of its employees acting within the scope of their employment or duties whether arising out of a governmental or proprietary function except as specifically provided <em>by the legislature\u201d </em>(emphasis added). It is inappropriate for this Court, by judicial fiat, to effectively immunize governmental entities for their torts and those of their employees when the Constitution and the Legislature have expressly stated that such immunity does not exist except as specifically provided <em>by the Legislature.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b670 Notably, many other courts, as well as other members of this Court, have likewise recognized that the public duty doctrine cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>survive the abrogation of governmental immunity. <em>See e.g. Massee, </em>\u00b6 98 (Regnier &amp; Cotter, JJ., specially concurring) (T agree with most of Justice Nelson\u2019s analysis and conclusion that it is difficult to sustain the Public Duty Doctrine in light of Article II, Section 18, of the Montana Constitution which abolished sovereign immunity in this state.\u2019!); <em>Adams v.

As we have stated previously, the public-duty rule is neither \u201cset forth\u201d in R.C. Chapter 2743 nor a rule of law applicable to suits between private parties. It is inappropriate for the court to engraft the public-duty rule as an additional limitation on liability that the General Assembly has not provided. If the public-duty rule is to become a rule of substantive law applicable to suits in the Court of Claims, it is the General Assembly-the ultimate arbiter of public policy-that should make it so by way of legislation. It is not this court\u2019s role to apply a judicially created doctrine when faced with statutory language that cuts <em>against </em>its applicability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\"><em>Wallace, </em>773 N.E.2d 1018, \u00b6 33 (footnote omitted); <em>accord Brennen </em>v. <em>City of Eugene, </em>591 P.2d 719, 725 (Or. 1979) (\u2018In abolishing governmental tort immunity, the Legislature specifically provided for certain exceptions under which immunity would be retained, and we find no warrant for judicially engrafting an additional exception [such as the public duty doctrine] onto the statute.\u201d (citation omitted)). Similarly, the Missouri Supreme Court announced last year:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">In deference to the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity provided by section 537.600.1, this Court is no longer willing to apply the judicially-created protections of the public duty doctrine in a way that would insulate government entities from tort liability where the legislature has expressly abolished such immunity. Application of the public duty doctrine should not expand the scope of a sovereign\u2019s immunity beyond that intended by statute, nor be contrary to the legislature\u2019s intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\"><em>Southers v. City of Farmington, </em>263 S.W.3d 603, 613 (Mo. 2008) (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u00b673 Yet, this Court inexplicably persists in applying its public duty doctrine-and at an ever-increasing rate, no less. The Court has never articulated a meritorious basis for doing so in the face of constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>and statutory provisions to the contrary. In <em>Doris Nelson, </em>\u00b6 35, the majority simply asserted that \u2018tt]he rationale underlying this doctrine is that <em>\u2018a </em>duty owed to all is a duty owed to none\u2019 \u2019\u2019-though one has to wonder how this logical absurdity constitutes a \u201crationale\u201d for the doctrine. In <em>Stephen Nelson, </em>\u00b6 21, the Court asserted that the doctrine \u201c \u2018serves the important purpose of preventing excessive court intervention into the governmental process by protecting the exercise of law enforcement discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stephen Nelson, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Ezell v.

And in <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 18, the majority opined that without the public duty doctrine, municipalities would be hopelessly mired in civil lawsuits and unduly constrained in their discretion to use limited resources to promote the general welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b674 Preventing unreasonable interference with the governing process and protecting against excessive governmental liability are two commonly cited justifications for retaining the public duty doctrine. <em>See Leake, </em>720 P.2d at 158; <em>Beaudrie, </em>631 N.W.2d at 313. As noted, however, the Legislature is the ultimate arbiter of public policy, and the Legislature has already decided that \u201c[e]very governmental entity is subject to liability for its torts and those of its employees acting within the scope of their employment or duties... except as specifically provided <em>by the legislature T </em>Section 2-9-102, MCA (emphasis added). The Legislature did not grant this Court the option of devising its own exceptions to the general tort liability placed on governmental entities by \u00a72-9-102, MCA, which is reason enough for this Court to refrain from applying its public duty doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b675 But to the extent the Court is adhering to the public duty doctrine based on the policy concerns noted above, those concerns simply cannot survive close examination. In this connection, \u201c\u2018the trend has been to abolish the [public duty] rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ficek, </em>685 N.W.2d 98, \u00b6 20 (citing cases and secondary authorities). As summarized in <em>Ficek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-26, and McQuillin, <em>The Law of Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a753.04.25,206-08, courts have abrogated or refused to adopt the public duty doctrine for various reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">1. The doctrine is in effect, if not in theory, a continuation of the abolished governmental immunity doctrine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">2. The doctrine has a harsh effect on plaintiffs who would be entitled to recover for their injuries but for the public status of the tortfeasor, and there has been a reasoned reluctance to apply a doctrine that results in a duty to none where there is a duty to all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">3. The doctrine creates confusion in the law and produces uneven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>and inequitable results in practice. <em>See e.g. Jean W. v. Commonwealth, </em>610 N.E.2d 305, 313 (Mass. 1993) (noting that courts \u201c \u2018have not managed to draw an intellectually defensible line between immune \u201cpublic\u201dduties and actionable negligence\u2019 \u201d); <em>Beaudrie, </em>631 N.W.2d at 314 (\u201c[A]ny attempt to draw a distinction between a government employee\u2019s \u2018public duty\u2019 and \u2018private duty\u2019 has proven to be confusing and prone to arbitrary and inconsistent application.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">4. Concerns over excessive liability are overstated. For one thing, the public duty doctrine is not the only protection municipalities have against massive liabilities. <em>See e.g. </em>\u00a7 2-9-108(1), MCA (limiting liability for damages suffered as a result of an act or omission of a government officer, agent, or employee). Moreover, the underlying purposes of the doctrine are better served by the application of conventional tort principles and the protection afforded by statutes governing sovereign immunity. <em>Leake, </em>720 P.2d at 158; <em>see also City of Kotzebue, </em>702 P.2d at 1314-15 (applying factors for determining whether city owed an actionable duty to the plaintiff); <em>Ryan v. State, </em>656 P.2d 597, 598 (Ariz. 1982) (\u201cWe are also told that not only will the public treasury suffer but government will come to a standstill because its agents will be afraid to act. We can\u2019t but recall the dire predictions attendant to the publication of [our decision in <em>Stone v. Arizona Highway Commn., </em>381 P.2d 107 (Ariz. 1963), abolishing governmental immunity]. Arizona survived!\u2019); <em>Beaudrie, </em>631 N.W.2d at 315 (\u2018\u00cdA] traditional common-law duty analysis provides a far more familiar and workable framework for determining whether a public employee owes a tort-enforceable duty in a given case.\u2019); <em>Schear, </em>687 P.2d at 733-34 (\u2018The spectre of dire financial consequences to municipalities raised by some courts... is no more real in the context of law enforcement officers\u2019 liability for negligence than it has proved to be in any other area in which sovereign immunity has been abolished.... [W]e are confident that any amounts associated with programs aimed at reducing law enforcement officers\u2019 negligence, or awarded to victims of negligent performance of duty, will be far outweighed by the advantage to society of more responsive agencies.\u2019); <em>Wallace, </em>773 N.E.2d 1018, \u00b6 38 (\u2018TC]onventional negligence principles already provide some measure of protection against the possibility of the state\u2019s becoming the de facto guarantor of every injury somehow attributable to the actions of a state tortfeasor. A state defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>just like any private defendant, remains protected by traditional tort concepts of duty, including foreseeability and pertinent public-policy considerations.\u201d); <em>Brennen, </em>591 P.2d at 723 (noting that municipalities are protected from unlimited liability by statute and by principles of tort law); <em>Hudson, </em>638 A.2d at 566 (\u201c[C]oncerns over excessive government or public employee liability are baseless considering the limitations on liability afforded by conventional tort principles, various types of official immunity, or exceptions to waivers of sovereign immunity.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">5. The doctrine is incompatible with tort-claims acts mandating that suits against public defendants be determined in accordance with rules of law applicable to private persons. <em>See e.g. </em>\u00a7 2-9-101(1), MCA (directing that liability be analyzed as though the governmental entity were a private person); <em>Maple v. City of Omaha, </em>384 N.W.2d 254, 260 (Neb. 1986) (\u2018Nowhere [in the Political Subdivisions Tort Claims Act] is there found an exemption for the exercise of a duty owed to the public generally.\u201d); <em>Schear, </em>687 P.2d at 730 (\u2018Nothing in the [Tort Claims Act] refers to performance of either public or special duties.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">6. The doctrine places the costs of inadequate government performance on the shoulders of the innocent victims of official negligence rather than spreading these costs throughout society, and it reduces the incentive for public bodies to see that the functions of government are carried out responsibly and with reasonable care. <em>Stewart v. Schmieder, </em>386 So. 2d 1351, 1357 (La. 1980); <em>see also Cummins, </em>133 P.3d 458, \u00b6 64 (Chambers, C. Johnson, &amp; Sanders, JJ., concurring) (\u201c[Government should be accountable for its actions just as a private party is held accountable. Accountability encourages competency.\u201d); Edward H. Ziegler, Jr., <em>Rathkopfs The Law of Zoning and Planning </em>vol. 4, \u00a746.02[l][a], 46-9 (4th ed., 1996) (\u2018\u00cdT]he doctrine has the effect of removing an incentive to ensure that the functions of government are responsibly executed.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b676 For these reasons, the dire consequences the Court fears if the public duty doctrine is not retained are simply not plausible; in fact, there are persuasive policy reasons to jettison the doctrine. But more importantly, <em>this Court\u2019s </em>policy concerns are no justification for ignoring unequivocal <em>constitutional and statutory directives. </em>Article II, Section 18 abolishes governmental immunity; the Legislature has provided that every governmental entity is subject to liability for its torts and those of its employees except as specifically provided <em>by the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Legislature, </em>\u00a72-9-102, MCA; and the Legislature has not enacted the public duty doctrine. Consequently, each time this Court applies its public duty doctrine, it flouts the will of the people, as expressed through the Constitution and legislative enactment, that our government and its agents generally be held liable for their torts. As I have said before, the public duty doctrine should be consigned to the dustbin of history, where it clearly belongs. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 75 (Nelson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b677 Before concluding, I note Justice Leaphart\u2019s contention that the viability of the public duty doctrine Vas not an issue in this case.\u201d Concurrence/Dissent, \u00b6 49. With respect, I disagree. The City, the County, Officer Anderson, and Officer Megargel have each asserted the public duty doctrine as a defense to Leah\u2019s negligence claims. Leah, in turn, has disputed the doctrine\u2019s applicability. As noted, the public duty doctrine shields governmental defendants from tort liability. Yet, the doctrine is judge-created, and the Legislature has proclaimed that \u201c[e]very governmental entity is subject to liability for its torts and those of its employees ... except as specifically provided <em>by the legislature </em>under Article II, section 18.\u201d Section 2-9-102, MCA (emphasis added). These facts are all self-evident, and I maintain that it is not the province of this Court, in case after case, to shield governmental defendants from tort liability in the face of express constitutional and statutory directives to the contrary. Whether or not Leah has made this point explicit in her appellate briefs is, in my view, not the issue. It is axiomatic that we are bound to faithfully uphold the Constitution and apply the laws enacted by the Legislature. <em>See e.g. </em>Mont. Const, art. Ill, \u00a73. Moreover, as Justice Leaphart himself has previously pointed out, this Court is not required to blindly apply the law in conformance with the parties\u2019 underlying assumptions. <em>See State v. Zabawa, </em>279 Mont. 307, 319, 928 P.2d 151, 159 (1996) (Leaphart, Hunt, &amp; Trieweiler, JJ., dissenting) (asserting that we are not bound by counsel\u2019s assumptions concerning constitutional provisions; rather, we have a duty to provide an independent interpretation); <em>see also Kudrna v. Comet Corp., </em>175 Mont. 29, 51, 572 P.2d 183, 195 (1977) (\u2018If the court were limited to the arguments and reasoning of counsel in its decisions of cases, to the exclusion of its own observations, many cases would lead us far from what we understand to be the true object of the court.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"AMI\">\u00b678 Indeed, I cannot agree with the proposition that we must consciously disregard express constitutional and statutory directives which bear directly on our resolution of a case simply because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>parties misapprehended the relevance of those directives, chose to ignore them, or simply were unaware of them. In fact, there is precedent for raising an applicable constitutional or statutory issue sua sponte. Just last year, in a decision which Justice Leaphart joined, the Court observed that <em>\u2018\u201ca </em>serious error which appears on the face of [the] record is reviewable, although not presented by the parties\u2019 if ignoring the error would cause substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Andersen-Conway, </em>2007 MT 281, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 439, 171 P.3d 678 (brackets in <em>Andersen-Conway) </em>(quoting <em>Kudrna, </em>175 Mont. at 51, 572 P.2d at 195); <em>cf. Wolfe v. Dept. of Labor and Industry, </em>255 Mont. 336, 339, 843 P.2d 338, 340 (1992) (this Court may consider an otherwise procedurally-barred question if it \u201crelates to a substantial or fundamental right of a litigant\u201d); <em>Cottrill v. Cottrill Sodding Service, </em>229 Mont. 40, 42, 744 P.2d 895, 896 (1987) (this Court may consider an otherwise procedurally-barred constitutional issue if it \u201c involve[s] broad public concerns\u2019 <em>\u201d). </em>Relying on this rule, the Court \u201csua sponte\u201d raised and decided an issue that was \u201cdispositive\u201d of the appeal, notwithstanding the parties\u2019 failure to do so themselves, because ignoring the error would have caused substantial injustice. <em>See Andersen-Conway, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-19. Of course, this rule is not limited to criminal cases-indeed, it derived from a civil case (Kudrna)-and as applied to the facts here, I submit that applying the public duty doctrine to Leah\u2019s tort claims in the face of Article II, Section 18 and \u00a7 2-9-102, MCA, constitutes a serious error and will cause her substantial injustice (she is being thrown out of court without even a trial), thus requiring our review of the doctrine\u2019s viability.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b679 Lastly, I respectfully disagree with the suggestion that questioning the validity of the public duty doctrine involves \u201cprejudging\u201d an issue. Concurrence/Dissent, \u00b6 52. We are long past the point of \u201cprejudging\u201d this issue. In point of fact, the Massees asked us to abolish the doctrine five years ago. <em>See Massee, </em>\u00b6 44; <em>see also Prosser, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 70-71 (Nelson, J., dissenting) (noting the Neighbors\u2019 argument in the district court that the doctrine is unconstitutional). Moreover, Doris Nelson pointed out in the district court that the State\u2019s argument that it had no duty of care \u201cis basically a sovereign immunity argument, which clearly doesn\u2019t apply under our constitution.\u201d Then, on appeal, she argued that governmental immunity exists in this state only to the extent the Legislature has enacted statutes providing for it and that it is Tt]he function of the legislature, not this Court, to establish the public policy of the State\u201d vis-a-vis governmental liability and immunity for its torts. Yet, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>than remand the case for further proceedings on the question of whether the State owed Jack Nelson a duty, the Court instead invoked the public duty doctrine sua sponte-even though the parties had not briefed the doctrine and its exceptions on appeal, and even though the district court had declined to address the State\u2019s duty argument in the first instance when ruling on the cross-motions for summary judgment-in order to affirm the district court\u2019s decision that Doris could not sue the Board of Medical Examiners. <em>See Doris Nelson, </em>\u00b6 34. Worse still, in its zeal to reach the desired result, the Court did not address three of the four exceptions to the doctrinenmost notably the question of whether Jack had relied to his detriment on the fact that the Board issued Dr. Stephenson a license to practice medicine. <em>See Doris Nelson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b680 The Court\u2019s approach in these and other public-duty cases could easily lead a person to conclude that the validity of the public duty doctrine is settled. Thus, it is not surprising that Leah has not made the specific arguments that Justice Leaphart contends are missing from her briefs in this appeal. In any event, setting aside our difference of opinion as to whether the viability of the public duty doctrine is an issue in this particular case, one thing is clear: The doctrine\u2019s underlying validity is, in fact, open to challenge in the proper case-presumably, a future case that directly challenges the public duty doctrine on constitutional grounds under Article II, Section 18, and statutory grounds under \u00a7\u00a7 1-1-108, 2-9-101(1), and 2-9-102, MCA. <em>See Massee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79-95 (Nelson, J., specially concurring and dissenting); <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 70-75 (Nelson, J., dissenting); <em>Doris Nelson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 65-77 (Nelson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); \u00b6\u00b6 69-76, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b681 In sum, I conclude that this Court\u2019s public duty doctrine is incompatible with Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution and the liability/immunity provisions of Title 2, chapter 9, parts 1 to 3, MCA. There is little reason to believe that abolishing the doctrine would commence the parade of horribles the Court fears. But, in any event, the policy concerns cited by the Court do not justify the Court\u2019s perpetuation of the doctrine. It is for the Legislature to weigh the public policy arguments and enact appropriate measures to protect governmental entities and their employees, if necessary. The Legislature has done so and has decided that every governmental entity is subject to liability for its torts and those of its employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>acting within the scope of their employment or duties, except as specifically provided <em>by the </em>Legislature. It is not for this Court to create and perpetuate its own exceptions to \u00a72-9-102, MCA. As one court has noted, when a court applies the public duty doctrine in the face of statutory abrogation of sovereign immunity, \u201c \u2018the judicial responsibility for governmental irresponsibility is very grave indeed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brennen, </em>591 P.2d at 724 (quoting K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>vol. 3, \u00a725.06, 458-59 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b682 Meanwhile, Leah will no doubt be dumbfounded by the Court\u2019s decision. During the course of a robbery, she managed surreptitiously to call 911. The call went through, the dispatchers ascertained what was occurring and where, and the police were sent to Leah\u2019s location. Upon arriving, they established a perimeter around the Town Pump, determined that the door was unlocked, and observed two individuals inside. They ascertained that one of the individuals (Menjivar) was directing the other individual (Leah). When the call from Leah\u2019s cell phone was dropped, the dispatchers established a connection on the store\u2019s land line. They told the officers that the male (Menjivar) was \u201cthreatening\u201d the female (Leah) and that she was \u201ccrying\u201d and \u201cvery frightened.\u201d The police saw Menjivar and Leah enter the restroom, where it turns out Leah was then raped. They arrested Menjivar when he left the store of his own volition. They then threatened Leah with a dog, at which point she exited the store, barefoot and wearing her Town Pump apron. They forced her to the ground and handcuffed her-although she was six months pregnant and one of the officers had recognized who she was.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b683 Leah claims the officers acted negligently and unreasonably, but the Court holds that the officers owed her no duty to exercise reasonable care when they responded to her distress call. The Court explains that because the officers owed all members of the public a duty to protect and preserve the peace, they did not owe this duty to any members of the public. Opinion, \u00b6 20. If Leah is confused by this, I, for one, do not blame her. Indeed, the Court\u2019s decision makes no sense. We have now ruled, as a matter of law, that when the police respond to a crime in progress, they have no duty to protect the victim of the crime because they have a duty to protect everybody. Thus, the victim is simultaneously entitled and not entitled to reasonable police protection. We have also ruled, as a matter of law, that regardless of expert evidence that the police breached the appropriate standard of care, they are nonetheless immune from liability for such breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b684 Leah may be surprised to learn that had the events of April 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>2005, transpired across the border in North Dakota or Wyoming, she would be entitled to pursue her negligence claims. <em>See Ficek, </em>685 N.W.2d 98, \u00b6 28; <em>Natrona County, </em>81 P.3d 948, \u00b6 12. She may find it bewildering that in Montana, \u201ca duty owed to all is a duty owed to none,\u201d <em>Doris Nelson, </em>\u00b6 35, but in some other states, \u2018ta]ny duty owed to the public generally is a duty owed to individual members of the public,\u201d <em>Coffey, </em>247 N.W.2d at 139. She may be frustrated and shocked to learn that she is barred from pursuing her negligence claims not because of any constitutional or statutory barrier to those claims, but because of a judge-created rule that actually contravenes the Montana Constitution and statutes enacted pursuant thereto. <em>See </em>Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a718; \u00a72-9-102, MCA. Finally, she may be surprised to find out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">* Notwithstanding her own personal knowledge of what she felt at the time, this Court has decided that Leah in fact did not rely on the police to come to her rescue (even though they did) because she did not know that her call to 911 had actually gone through and that the police had actually been dispatched to the store. Opinion, \u00b6 29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">* The responding officers did not undertake to protect her until she came out of the store-at which point they forced her to the ground and handcuffed her. Their purpose in responding to her 911 call, surrounding the store, and attempting to ascertain what was transpiring inside was, apparently, for some other purpose but not to protect a person or property. Opinion, \u00b6 28.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">* Being forced to the ground and handcuffed, although one of the officers recognized Leah, \u201cwas at most a justified investigatory stop.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 31.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">* The officers were justified in forcing Leah to the ground and handcuffing her, Opinion, \u00b6 34, but they did not owe her a duty of reasonable care or protection, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 20-29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">* Leah has been denied her fundamental right to her day in court under Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution because of a judge-created rule that is outdated, logically absurd, and patently unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\u00b685 Whether the officers acted appropriately and with reasonable care when they responded to the Town Pump I cannot say. That is a question of fact for a jury of Leah\u2019s peers to decide. It is not a decision to be made by the District Court or this Court. Leah presented the District Court with sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment. She is entitled to a trial on her complaint. That she has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>been thrown out of court and under the bus because of the public duty doctrine is unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b686 Montana\u2019s courts have no business shielding the government or its actors from their own negligence, misconduct, misfeasance, or malfeasance. That is the Legislature\u2019s job. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a718; \u00a72-9-102, MCA. Montana\u2019s courts have no authority to enact their own tort-relief act by devising exceptions to the rule that \u201c[e]very governmental entity is subject to liability for its torts and those of its employees acting within the scope of their employment or duties ... except as specifically provided by the legislature.\u201d Section 2-9-102, MCA. The public duty doctrine is simply indefensible from a constitutional standpoint, a statutory standpoint, and a commonsense standpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b687 I would reverse and remand for a trial.
