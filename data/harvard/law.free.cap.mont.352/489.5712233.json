Wal-Mart requested that the zoning of their property be changed from a Low Density Residential Zoning District (LRZD) to a Highway Commercial Zoning District (HCZD). The Poison City Council (Council) approved the request. Lake County First, Greg Hertz, Meredith B. Pollack, and others (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) filed suit against the Council and individual members of the Council in the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Lake County. Wal-Mart intervened. Appellants and Wal-Mart filed cross motions for summary judgment, and the District Court granted Wal-Mart\u2019s motion, from which Appellants appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">\u00b62 Appellants raise numerous issues on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b63 1.

Whether Wal-Mart\u2019s substitution of Judge Deschamps was untimely and should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">\u00b69 Wal-Mart obtained a property interest in approximately twenty-eight acres of land zoned LRZD lying on the east side of Highway 93 as it enters Poison from the south. In the fall of 2005, Wal-Mart submitted \u201cpre-application\u201d materials to the City of Poison Planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Department (Department) seeking a change in the zoning designation to HCZD, approval of a three-lot subdivision, and annexation into the City of Poison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wal-Mart appeared before the City/County Planning Board (Planning Board or Board) in October 2005 and received comments from both Board members and the public concerning the proposed development. Wal-Mart then conducted various studies to address the issues raised during that public meeting. In March 2006, Wal-Mart submitted an application to the Department requesting approval of a Special Use Permit, approval of a subdivision, a zoning amendment, and annexation of the property by the City. Wal-Mart\u2019s zoning change request was contingent upon approval of the annexation request. The subdivision request served to separate the twenty-eight total acres into three lots: Lot 1, an approximately eighteen-acre WalMart Supercenter site; Lot 2, an approximately one-acre site to the south of Lot 1; and Lot 3, an approximately nine-acre lot to the east of Lot 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b610 On May 9, 2006, the Planning Board conducted a public meeting concerning the application and received public comment. The Department provided a staff report (Department\u2019s Report) to the Board analyzing the factual circumstances and the legal requirements related to the application. The Department\u2019s Report included findings of fact, which were referenced for both the subdivision request and the zoning amendment. The Report recommended that, upon conditions, the Planning Board should recommend approval of the application to the City Council. The Board conducted a public hearing at which the Department presented its Report to the Board, Wal-Mart made a presentation about the proposal, and extensive public comments were received. The Board then discussed the application and voted to approve the Special Use Permit, recommend that the Council approve the subdivision, and recommend that the Council deny the zoning change. The Board does not review annexation requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b611 On June 29, 2006, the Council met to consider the application. The Department discussed its Report, Wal-Mart made a presentation about the proposal, and the Council heard extensive public comments. The Council then voted to approve the subdivision and annexation requests. The Council approved the zoning amendment as to Lots 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and 2 but denied the zoning change requested for Lot 3, leaving its designation as residential. The zoning change to Lots 1 and 2 was enacted by the Council as Ordinance 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">\u00b612 Simultaneously with the processing ofWal-Mart\u2019s application, the City developed and adopted a new growth policy. That process began in January 2005 and continued through June 19, 2006, when the Council adopted the Poison Growth Policy (PGP). Prior to adoption of the PGP, the Poison Master Plan (PMP) was the City\u2019s comprehensive planning document. Also relevant to the application was the Poison Development Code (PDC), a set of regulatory requirements aimed at implementing the policies of the PMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b613 Appellants filed this action in District Court challenging the Council\u2019s approval of the zoning amendment. Wal-Mart intervened in the suit. Other than filing an answer, the Council did not participate in the litigation. The District Court heard cross motions for summary judgment and found in favor of Wal-Mart. Additional facts will be discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b614 This case is before us on a grant of summary judgment. We review district court grants of summary judgment de novo. <em>North 93 Neighbors, Inc. v. Bd. of Co. Commrs. of Flathead </em>Co., 2006 MT 132, \u00b6 17, 332 Mont. 327, 137 P.3d 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u00b615 Additional standards of review will be discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">\u00b616 1. Whether the District Court erred by ruling that the Council need not consider the Poison Growth Policy that was adopted shortly before the approval of the zoning change.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">\u00b617 As mentioned, development of the new PGP and processing of Wal-Mart\u2019s application for zoning change occurred simultaneously, with approval of the PGP coming about ten days prior to the Council\u2019s final vote on the zoning amendment. Appellants argue that because the PGP was adopted before the zoning change was finalized, the Council erred by not reconsidering Wal-Mart\u2019s application under the PGP. Wal-Mart responds that because the PMP was undeniably the relevant document during the application process, the Council did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>need to reconsider the application under the PGP.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AaQ\">\u00b618 Appellants rely on \u00a776-1-605(1), MCA (2005), which provides that Ts]ubject to subsection (2), after adoption of a growth policy, the governing body ... must be guided by and give consideration to the ... growth policy in the ... adoption of zoning ordinances or resolutions.\u201d However, in turn, subsection (2) provides that \u201c[a] growth policy is not a regulatory document\u201d and that a governing body \u201cmay not withhold, deny, or impose conditions on any land use approval or other authority to act based solely on compliance with a growth policy....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b619 Appellants also cite to a provision in the new PGP, which states that the PGP \u201cis intended to help guide present and future development in the City of Poison.\u201d (emphasis by Appellants). However, this quote is a snippet from a section of the PGP entitled \u2018Growth Policy Review and Revision,\u201d which governs future review and amendment of the Growth Policy for purposes of keeping it current. Taken in its context, this is not a statement about the applicability of the PCP to applications under review when the PGP was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b620 The District Court concluded that \u2018tn]othing in the record supports the assertion that the PGP was meant to apply retroactively, and equity requires that both the Board and Council consider the application under the same regulation.\u201d The District Court\u2019s determination distinguishes the PGP from the development code at issue in <em>Town Pump, Inc. v. Bd. of Adjustment of the City of Red Lodge, </em>1998 MT 294, \u00b6 11, 292 Mont. 6, 971 P.2d 349, which contained a retroactivity clause making the code explicitly applicable to pending applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b621  The predecessor PMP was the document in effect during virtually the entirety of the review process, from the submission of Wal-Mart\u2019s application through the preparation of city reports, review by the Planning Board, and the holding of public hearings. Appellants de-emphasize the fact that this earlier version of the PGP guided consideration of Wal-Mart\u2019s application.at each stage of the review process. In consideration of the stated statutory purpose of a growth policy as a non-regulatory document, and the absence of any indication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>that the PGP was intended to apply retroactively, we conclude the District Court reached a correct and reasonable determination. To hold otherwise would require the Council to put all applications on hold pending approval of a new growth policy, repeat the review process under the new policy, or attempt to apply a not-yet-finalized growth policy to an application. Under these facts, we cannot conclude there was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">\u00b622 2. Whether the District Court erred by ruling that the Council need not consider the Lake County Growth Policy and corresponding zone density maps and regulations in approving the zoning change.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b623 Appellants briefly argue that the Council abused its discretion by failing to rely upon the Lake County Growth Policy (LCGP) and County Density Map in reviewing the application, asserting that Tujntil such time as the subject property was approved for annexation into the City, planning and zoning for the property was governed by the Lake County Growth Policy and the Lake County Density Map and Regulations ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u00b624 Implicit in Appellants\u2019 argument is the recognition that once the property was annexed into the City, the county planning regulations would no longer be applicable. In fact, the application was submitted as contingent upon approval of the property\u2019s annexation into the City. Without annexation, the application would be denied and there would be no development. The District Court reasoned that \u2018Ts]ince the annexation request was an essential part of the application, it was not necessary for the Council to consider the [County policies].\u201d Because the County regulations would never govern the application as submitted, we agree with the District Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u00b625 3. Whether the District Court erred in its review of challenges regarding the <em>Lowe </em>criteria, the Poison Master Plan, and the Poison Development Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b626 Appellants\u2019 briefing sets forth nine issues for review. However, the arguments do not always correspond with the issues as stated, and multiple points are argued under single headings. Thus, we have reorganized Appellants\u2019 arguments around the types of challenges presented, and will address them as follows. Under Issue 3a, we will take up Appellants\u2019 arguments concerning the sufficiency of the Council\u2019s consideration of the <em>Lowe </em>criteria and issuance of findings of facts. Under Issue 3b, we will address whether the Council reached incorrect substantive conclusions in applying the <em>Lowe </em>criteria. Under Issue 3c, we will address whether the zoning amendment substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>complies with the PMP. Under Issue 3d, we will address issues concerning the PDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b627 3a. Whether the Council sufficiently considered the <em>Lowe </em>criteria and issued sufficient findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b628 Appellants argue that the Council failed to enter findings of fact and failed to conduct a sufficient, independent analysis of the <em>Lowe </em>criteria to satisfy the requirements of statute and the PDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u00b629 In <em>Lowe v. City of Missoula, </em>165 Mont. 38, 41, 525 P.2d 551, 553 (1974), this Court set aside a zoning change after determining there was an insufficient factual record for the governing body to make findings regarding the zoning change criteria. We stated that \u201cthe record is so lacking in fact information that the action on the part of the City Council and district court could be said to have been based on mistakes of fact,\u201d and noted that the record simply lacked any evidence pertaining to certain statutory zoning criteria, commonly referred to as the <em>\u201cLowe </em>criteria.\u201d <em>Lowe, </em>165 Mont. at 42, 525 P.2d at 553. Then, in <em>Schanz v. City of Billings, </em>182 Mont. 328, 335-36, 597 P.2d 67, 71 (1979), the Court held that the District Court erred by failing to examine whether the governing body had engaged in an appropriate consideration of the <em>Lowe </em>criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\u00b630 Similarly, in <em>North 93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6 43, we considered appellants\u2019 arguments that the commissioners had failed to issue findings of fact under the zoning statutes and local regulations, which required that the commissioners \u201cbe guided by and adopt findings of fact,\u201d and that the commissioners had failed to properly consider the <em>Lowe </em>criteria.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We considered what information was before the commissioners, including the application for the zoning amendment and the planning office\u2019s report, as well as the planning board\u2019s discussion and adoption of findings of fact. <em>North 93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6 43. We noted that the commissioners had reviewed the planning office\u2019s report, reviewed the planning board\u2019s recommendation, and considered public comment, including plaintiffs\u2019 report asserting that the <em>Lowe </em>criteria had not been met. <em>North 93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6 44. Although the commission had not adopted its own findings of fact, we concluded that nothing required the commissioners to enter such independent findings, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>commissioners had \u201cfollowed the proper statutory and regulatory procedure for adopting zoning amendments and had sufficient evidence before it to make an Informed decision.\u201d <em>North 93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">\u00b631 Similar to the county municipal statutes, the municipal zoning statutes require notice and hearings, but do not require the entry of findings of fact. <em>See </em>\u00a776-2-303,305, MCA. The PDC states, similar to the local regulations at issue in <em>North 93 Neighbors, </em>that Council decisions \u201cshall be reported in the form of findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d PDC (Mont.) Ch. 11, Div. 4, \u00b6 U (1993). However, it further provides that findings of fact may be established by reference to application materials, the [Department\u2019s Report], and testimony at the hearing. Conclusions of law shall be reported in the form of checklists showing that all requirements of the plan and these regulations have been considered.\u201d PDC at Ch. 11, Div. 4, \u00b6 U.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b632 Wal-Mart\u2019s application addressed each <em>Lowe </em>criteria in detail, describing why the proposed zoning is designed to meet each requirement. <em>See North 93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6 42 (\u2018Wolford\u2019s application to amend the zoning regulations addressed all 12 of these criteria at length.\u201d) The Department\u2019s Report referenced Wal-Mart\u2019s discussion of the <em>Lowe </em>criteria, and also referenced findings of fact that were read into the record by Department staff during the Board\u2019s public hearing. The Department\u2019s Report contained findings and analysis relating to various <em>Lowe </em>criteria, although these were not specifically denominated as such. For instance, the report indicates the subject property may not be appropriate for residential development due to its proximity to the highway, finding that the \u201cproperty is in an appropriate location for commercial development.\u201d This would correspond to the criterion concerning suitability of the area for particular uses. The findings demonstrate that analyses of traffic, water, sewer, fire, police, and other community impacts were conducted and that Wal-Mart would be required to comply with further conditions to ensure the zoning change would satisfy broader zoning purposes. The Council also received extensive public comment, including a report addressing the <em>Lowe </em>criteria prepared by a land use consultant hired by the Plaintiffs/Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b633 In enacting Ordinance 623, which adopted the zoning amendment, the Council considered Wal-Mart\u2019s application, the Department\u2019s Report and comments, the Board\u2019s recommendation, and public comments. The Ordinance provides that \u2018the report of the City planning staff, as presented and submitted to the City Council, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>hereby adopted and issued as the findings of the City Council as to the criteria of MCA \u00a7 76-2-304 and <em>Lowe v. City of Missoula\u201d </em>The Ordinance states that the <em>Lowe </em>criteria have all been satisfied, delineating each criterion, and concludes that the statutes and the PDC had been complied with. This incorporation by reference to the application, the Department\u2019s Report, and other evidence is expressly contemplated by the PDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b634  \u2018The applicable standard of review is whether the information upon which the [governing body] based its decision \u2018is so lacking in fact and foundation\u2019 that \u2018it is clearly unreasonable and constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019North 93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6 44 (quoting <em>Schanz, </em>182 Mont. at 335-36, 597 P.2d at 71). We have not established a requirement that a governing body explain in detail why it has determined each criterion is or is not met, and precisely what facts it found most convincing. In a review process similar to that approved in <em>North 93 Neighbors, </em>the Council considered the application, the Department\u2019s Report, the Board\u2019s recommendation and public comments, and assessed the <em>Lowe </em>criteria based upon these considerations. It adopted as its own the findings set forth in the Department\u2019s written report and oral presentations. Therefore, we conclude that the Council \u2018followed the proper statutory and regulatory procedure for adopting zoning amendments and had sufficient evidence before it to make an informed decision.\u201d <em>North 93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b635 3b. Whether the Council made incorrect conclusions concerning the <em>Lowe </em>criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b636 In addition to arguing that the Council did not have sufficient information and did not sufficiently consider the <em>Lowe </em>criteria, Appellants also assert that the Council erred in its determination that the <em>Lowe </em>criteria were satisfied. Appellants argue that \u2018the <em>Lowe </em>criteria are actually impeded rather than encouraged by this zone change.\u201d Thus, Appellants are not only challenging whether the Council performed its procedural duty and considered the <em>Lowe </em>criteria based on sufficient evidence, but whether the Council reached the wrong substantive conclusions based upon that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u00b637 Zoning is a legislative enactment and thus is presumed to be valid and reasonable. In <em>Lowe, </em>the court stated that rezoning and zoning are different and thus the standard of review is different. <em>Lowe, </em>165 Mont. at 44, 525 P.2d at 554. However, we overruled this distinction in <em>Schanz, </em>stating that \u2018[a] rezoning ordinance, like a zoning ordinance, is a legislative enactment, and is entitled to the presumptions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>validity and reasonableness.\u201d <em>Schanz, </em>182 Mont. at 335, 597 P.2d at 71; see <em>also The Greens at Fort Missoula, LLC v. City of Missoula, </em>271 Mont. 398, 403, 897 P.2d 1078, 1081 (1995); <em>North 93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6 18. As discussed above, where a party challenges whether the governing body had sufficient facts to consider the <em>Lowe </em>criteria, we will review \u201cwhether the information upon which the [governing body] based its decision \u2018is so lacking in fact and foundation\u2019 that \u2018it is clearly unreasonable and constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>North 93 Neighbors, </em>\u00b6 44 <em>(quoting Schanz, </em>182 Mont. at 335-36, 597 P.2d at 71); <em>see also Town and Country Foods, Inc. v. City of Bozeman, </em>2009 MT 72, \u00b6 13, 349 Mont. 453, 203 P.3d 1283. However, unlike the challenges in <em>Schanz </em>and <em>North 93 Neighbors </em>to the procedure used and the sufficiency of evidence before the governing body, under this issue Appellants are challenging the substantive decision made by the Council. The authority to make such determinations is within the Council\u2019s legislative powers, and courts are ill-equipped to make them, thus entitling the decisions \u201cto the presumptions of validity and reasonableness.\u201d <em>Schanz, </em>182 Mont. at 335, 597 P.2d at 71 (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-3\">[A]ctions on proposals to rezone property are generally characterized as legislative acts representing legislative judgment. Consequently, such actions have been accorded a presumption of validity, limiting judicial review to a determination of whether the amendment or rezoning or refusal to rezone was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety or general welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad-7\">Patrick J. Rohan, <em>Zoning Law and Practice </em>vol. 6, \u00a7 38.02[3] (Eric Damian Kelly ed., Matthew Bender 2009); <em>see also Englin v. Bd. of Co. Commrs., </em>2002 MT 115, 310 Mont. 1, 48 P.3d 39 (board\u2019s denial of request for zoning change was not \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d). To be arbitrary or capricious, \u201cthe decision being challenged must appear to be random, unreasonable, or seemingly unmotivated, based on the existing record.\u201d <em>Kiely Const., L.L.C. v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, \u00b6 69, 312 Mont. 52, 57 P.3d 836 (quoting <em>Silva v. City of Columbia Falls, </em>258 Mont. 329, 335, 852 P.2d 671, 675 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b638 Appellants assert that the zoning change violates the <em>Lowe </em>criterion regarding the promotion of health and the general welfare because of \u201cthe negative impact that Wal-mart stores, particularly Super Centers, have on local wages, health care and the universal negative impacts caused to pre-existing competing local businesses.\u201d While there is evidence to support these claims, there is also evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>in the record which contradicts these claims, including a statement provided by an economist hired by Wal-Mart and public comments made by local citizens. Quoting \u00a776-2-304(2), MCA, Appellants also assert that the zoning change was not \u201cmade with reasonable consideration, among other things, to the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the municipality.\u201d However, the Council received extensive comments that a HCZD is a more appropriate classification for this property because it lies next to the highway and is surrounded on three sides by HCZD zoning. Appellants argue that the zoning change fails to insure safety from fire and other dangers. Yet Wal-Mart was required to address these needs by adding a water pressure booster system to aid fire-fighting capabilities to the surrounding areas and to improve the municipal water system.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b639  Based on the evidence before it, the Council\u2019s decision that the <em>Lowe </em>criteria were satisfied cannot be deemed \u201crandom\u201d or \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>Kiely Const., </em>\u00b6 69. The Council had conflicting evidence and analyses before it for each of the <em>Lowe </em>criteria and made a legislative determination based upon its consideration of this information. Appellants have failed to establish that the Council\u2019s conclusions concerning the <em>Lowe </em>criteria were arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"ATWI\">\u00b640 3c. Whether the Council erred in finding that the zoning change substantially complied with the PMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b641 Appellants argue that the zoning change does not substantially comply with PMP provisions addressing line-of-sight views and the Central Business District (CBD). They assert that the Council failed to even consider issues related to the CBD.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b642 TI]n reaching zoning decisions, the local governmental unit should at least substantially comply with the comprehensive plan (or master plan).\u201d <em>Little v. Bd. of Co. Commrs. of Flathead Co., </em>193 Mont. 334, 353, 631 P.2d 1282, 1293 (1981). Although we have explained that statutory changes were apparently intended to alter this standard to some degree, <em>Citizen Advocates, </em>\u00b6 25, Wal-Mart offers that this Court need not \u201cascertain the impact of those amendments on the \u2018substantial compliance\u2019 standard, because this is a case where the zoning amendment at issue here more than \u2018substantially complied\u2019 with the applicable regulations ....\u201d Thus, we apply the substantial compliance standard herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u00b643 Appellants first allege noncompliance with the PMP based on the Wal-Mart store\u2019s potential visual impacts. The PMP provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u201cmonolithic structures that continuously block views from the highway to the lake\u201d should not be permitted. Views were a significant issue during the application process and were discussed in detail by the application and during public meetings. Wal-Mart worked cooperatively with the Department and the Board to address the architecture and elevation of the building to ensure that views would not be hindered. Wal-Mart presented a computer simulation of the proposed store to illustrate that the store would not rise above the grade of the hill next to the highway and thus would not obstruct the views from the highway to the lake. Therefore, we conclude that the Council substantially complied with the PMP\u2019s objectives concerning views of the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">\u00b644 Appellants also assert that the zoning change violates PMP goals concerning the Central Business District, or CBD. The PMP states that the \u201cregulatory strategy\u201d regarding the CBD is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\">F. Avoid Excessive Commercial Zoning Outside the CBD. Poison\u2019s approach to the implementation of this policy is generally a positive one of making the CBD more functional and attractive. Still, the viability of the CBD should be one of the factors considered in reviewing any request to amend the future land use and zoning maps to permit more commercial development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b645 Addressing this issue, the Department\u2019s Report explained that no properties big enough to accommodate the Wal-Mart store were available within the CBD, and that the roads within the CBD \u201ccannot handle the traffic and parking needs.\u201d While presenting the Department\u2019s Report to the Board, the Department Director stated her department\u2019s belief that traffic to Poison from surrounding areas would increase because of the new store, and that some of this increased traffic may provide additional customers to businesses within the CBD. During the same meeting, an economist hired by WalMart addressed the potential impact of Wal-Mart at length to alleviate fears about impacts upon existing local businesses. Public comments on this issue, pro and con, were also received.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u00b646 Appellants assert that the PMP\u2019s provisions regarding the CBD \u201cmandate the rejection of Wal-mart.\u201d However, the PMP states that \u2018Poison\u2019s approach to the implementation of [the CBD] is generally a positive one\u201d and does not prohibit adoption of zoning classifications that permit commercial development outside the CBD. Rather, it provides that the viability of the CBD \u201cshould be one of the factors considered\u201d when reviewing requests for commercial development. Clearly, that factor was considered here. The evidence indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the proposed store could not be physically located within the CBD, that roads within the CBD could not accommodate expected traffic, and that parking in the CBD was insufficient. On the other hand, these concerns were not present on the proposed site, which was bounded on three sides by property with the same HCZD zoning classification that Wal-Mart sought. Further, evidence was offered that the proposed store would help the CBD by increasing total customer traffic to the city. While opposing views were expressed, a conclusion by the Council that the proposed store would endanger the viability of the CBD was certainly not compelled. The issue was well debated and the Council complied with the PMP\u2019s requirement for consideration of the issue. Although Appellants briefly argue that the Council did not even consider issues concerning the CBD, this issue was a very visible issue throughout the review process and within the evidentiary record before the Council, including the Department Report, the Department Director\u2019s public statements, the Plaintiffs\u2019 Report, and many public comments. The Ordinance states that the Council had considered the evidence before it concerning the requirements of the PMP. We conclude that the zoning amendment substantially complied with the PMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b647 3d. Whether Appellants properly challenged compliance with the Poison Development Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u00b648 Appellants also attempt to argue that the zoning amendment does not \u201csubstantially comply\u201d with the PDC. However, unlike the PMP, which is a non-regulatory \u201cgrowth policy,\u201d the PDC is a separate, binding regulatory ordinance. The PDC was not adopted under the authority of chapter 1, section 6 of Title 76, MCA, governing growth policies, but was enacted under chapters 2 and 3 of Title 76, MCA, granting regulatory powers to counties and cities. <em>See also </em>PDC at Ch. 1, Div. 1, \u00b6 C (\u2018These regulations are adopted under the authority granted by 76-2-201, MCA, et seq., which authorizes county zoning; 76-2-301, MCA, et seq., which authorizes city zoning; and 76-3-501, MCA, which requires cities and counties to adopt subdivision regulations.\u201d). Therefore, because the PDC is not a growth policy, challenges to the Council\u2019s compliance with it cannot be made pursuant to \u00a7 76-2-304(l)(a), MCA (zoning regulations must be made in accordance with a growth policy). Appellants cite PDC provisions governing permissible development within a specific zoning district-not governing whether a zoning classification is appropriate for an area. Thus, Appellants are not challenging the Council\u2019s adoption of the zoning amendment, but, rather, they are challenging the Planning Board\u2019s granting of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Special Use Permit. However, this issue was not properly filed or preserved within this case. The Board is a different entity than the Council and different review procedures exist for challenges to its permit decisions. Both the statutes and the PDC provide that appeals of Board decisions concerning special use permits are to be made to the Board of Adjustment, and judicial review of board of adjustment decisions has its own procedures. <em>See </em>\u00a776-2-326, 327, MCA. We need not consider this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">\u00b649 4. Whether the zoning amendment constitutes illegal spot zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\u00b650 In <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 346, 631 P.2d at 1289, we stated that generally, \u201cthree factors enter into determining whether spot zoning exists in any given instance.\u201d Those factors are \u201c(1) whether the requested use is significantly different from the prevailing use in the area, (2) whether the area which is being rezoned is rather small, and looks to benefit a small number of persons, and (3) whether the rezone appears to be more in the nature of special legislation, designed to benefit a few landowners at the expense of the surrounding landowners or the general public.\u201d <em>Citizen Advocates, </em>\u00b6 32 (citing <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 346, 631 P.2d at 1289). \u2018If spot zoning is invalid, usually all three elements are present....\u201d <em>Little, </em>193 Mont. at 346, 631 P.2d at 1289 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u00b651 In <em>Citizen Advocates, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-34, the Court considered whether a zoning change that permitted a Safeway store was spot zoning. Analyzing the first factor, we considered the prior zoning and uses in the area and concluded that the Safeway store was not \u201csignificantly different\u201d from the past history of mixed residential and business uses, which would continue to exist. <em>Citizen Advocates, </em>\u00b6 33. As to the last two factors, we concluded that \u201cwhile the zoning proposal certainly benefits Safeway and [a co-applicant hospital], we cannot conclude that the benefit is conferred at the expense of the general public.\u201d <em>Citizen Advocates, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u00b652  Here, the property at issue is bound on three sides by HCZD, or highway commercial zoning. Commercial uses are currently established to the north and south of the property. Thus, the zoning change and proposed use of the property are not significantly different than the prevailing use in the area. The Department Report indicated that the \u201cproperty is in an appropriate location for commercial development\u201d and that commercial use might be more appropriate than residential use because residential development next to a highway leads to a variety of problems. Similar to our conclusion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>Citizen Advocates, </em>while the zoning proposal certainly benefits WalMart, we cannot conclude that the benefit is inappropriately conferred at the expense of the general public and constitutes illegal spot zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"Amt\">\u00b653 5. Whether Appellants\u2019 constitutional due process rights to know and participate were violated by adoption of the zoning amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u00b654  Appellants very briefly argue that the Council\u2019s decision to approve the zoning amendment only as to two of the three lots at issue deprived the public of the right to know and participate. Appellants offer no legal authority demonstrating why the Council would not have authority to partially approve and partially deny a zoning request that had undergone a substantial public review process without asking for further public comment. As Wal-Mart points out, \u201cthere was no action taken by the City Council to affect any parcel of property that was not\u201d noticed and discussed. We find no error with the District Court\u2019s ruling upholding the Council\u2019s partial approval of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u00b655 6. Whether Wal-Mart\u2019s substitution of Judge Deschamps was untimely and should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\u00b656 Appellants argue that Wal-Mart\u2019s motion for substitution of Judge Deschamps was untimely filed, and therefore Judge Swandal did not have jurisdiction to preside over this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u00b657 We have held that, in cases where a motion for substitution was improperly denied, the presiding judge no longer has jurisdiction over the case. <em>Taylor v. Matejovsky, </em>261 Mont. 514, 519, 863 P.2d 1022, 1025 (1993) (\u2018lOJnce the motion for substitution of judge was timely filed, Judge Sorte was without jurisdiction to act on the merits ....\u20190. In this case, however, Judge Deschamps voluntarily withdrew from the case when the motion for substitution was filed, even though it was apparently untimely. Judge Deschamps\u2019 withdrawal effectuated a substitution and effectively mooted the motion for substitution before it was acted upon. Thus, the motion was not improperly disposed, and Judge Swandal properly presided over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">\u00b658 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b532-9\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, NELSON, LEAPHART, MORRIS and DISTRICT JUDGE RICE, sitting for former CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\"> In late 2004 Wal-Mart\u2019s predecessor-in-interest submitted an application for annexation and zoning change for the property.
