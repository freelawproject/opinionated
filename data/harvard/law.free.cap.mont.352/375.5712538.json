We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">\u00b62 This Court considers the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">\u00b63 I. Did the District Court err in identifying the Truman Creek property, in its entirety, as a marital asset?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">\u00b64 II. Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees to Ginger Cameron (Ginger)?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">\u00b65 III. Did the District Court err in categorizing Ginger\u2019s assets as not income-producing in its decision to award maintenance?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">\u00b66 IV. Is Ginger entitled to attorney fees on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">\u00b67 This case arises from the marriage and subsequent divorce of Jeffrey and Ginger Cameron. During their marriage, the parties acquired several properties, including 80 acres near Kila, Montana. The property is comprised of three parcels, collectively referred to as the Truman Creek property. When the contract on the property was paid in full, the deed was recorded naming Jeff and Ginger as joint owners. In 1991, at a time when the parties had temporarily separated, Ginger executed a quitclaim deed to the property in favor of Jeff. The parties eventually reconciled, but the property remained in Jeffs name. Jeffs father, Earl Cameron (Earl), contributed to the development of the property, building a road and installing power and phone service. The District Court determined the improvements were worth $25,000. Jeff testified that his father contributed annually to a portion of the property payments, while Jeff made the remainder of the payments. Jeff claimed he could never have purchased the property without his father\u2019s financial help and the use of Earl\u2019s equipment to remove gravel from the property, which he then sold. Jeff claims he and his father entered an informal agreement to sell the property and share the profits. There is no written documentation of this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u00b68 The parties separated for the final time in January 2006. Ginger left the home with few financial resources. She was primarily a homemaker during the parties\u2019 marriage. She does not have a high school education or GED but has a limited number of college credits. Ginger has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, and in July of 2006 admitted herself to a treatment center. The District Court found that Ginger suffers from a mental disability which renders her unable to obtain meaningful, immediate employment. Ginger reported her monthly needs, including medical care, at $2,300. Jeff operates several businesses, including Smith Valley Shale and Excavating, The Sandman, and Master Blaster. He estimated his monthly living expenses at $3,657, a number decreased by the court to $2,800 after removing duplicate or unreasonable expenses. Jeff owns several vehicles and pieces of business equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b69 On October 29, 2007, the District Court issued its Findings of Facts, Conclusions of Law, and Decree of Dissolution. The court identified the Truman Creek property as marital property and ordered Jeff to pay Ginger $750 in monthly maintenance until two conditions are met: the Somers property is sold and Ginger obtains further education to secure appropriate employment to meet her needs. In its April 18, 2008 Order, the District Court directed Jeff to pay Ginger\u2019s attorney fees. Jeffrey Cameron appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s Findings of Facts to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Crone v. Crone, </em>2003 MT 238, \u00b6 16, 317 Mont. 256, 260, 77 P.3d 167, 171. Findings of Fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehends the effect of the evidence, or this Court\u2019s review of the record convinces it a mistake has been made. <em>In re Marriage of Toavs, </em>2002 MT 230, \u00b6 23, 311 Mont. 455, 461, 56 P.3d 356, 360. If the Findings of Fact are not clearly erroneous, we review the District Court\u2019s final award decision for abuse of discretion to determine whether the trial judge acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or has exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>In re Marriage of Toavs, </em>\u00b6 23. An award of attorney fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Lee, </em>282 Mont. 410, 423, 938 P.2d 650, 658 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err in identifying the Truman Creek </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>property, in its entirety, as a marital asset?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b612 Jeff contends that only 40 of the 80 acres of the Truman Creek property should have been identified as marital property because the property is an asset of a partnership between Jeff and his father, Earl. Jeff argues that he and his father developed an informal partnership, invested money and labor in the property, and had planned to sell the estate and split the profits. Ginger contends the Truman Creek property was the parties\u2019 retirement asset and, under law, was acquired by the parties alone. The District Court determined that the entire property was a marital asset, with Jeffs portion reduced by $25,000 in light of Earl\u2019s contributions to the property. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AVG\">\u00b613 The District Court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehends the effect of the evidence, or this Court\u2019s review of the record convinces it a mistake has been made. <em>In re Marriage of Toavs, </em>\u00b6 23. None of these justifications apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b614  When the contract on the property was paid in full, the deed was recorded naming Jeff and Ginger as joint owners. Following Ginger\u2019s quitclaim in 1991, the property remained in Jeff s name alone. While Jeff claims that he and his father agreed to purchase the land together, the District Court determined there is no formal documentation, no registration with the State of Montana, and no partnership tax returns filed in their names. There is evidence, however, that Earl was responsible for building a road and installing power and phone facilities on the property. The District Court determined these contributions were worth approximately $25,000, an amount that should be deducted from Jeffs portion of the marital property as debt owed to Earl. In light of the above evidence, the District Court properly identified all 80 acres as a marital asset, with an adjustment for Earl\u2019s contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees to Ginger Cameron?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b616 Jeff avers the District Court erred in awarding attorney fees to Ginger. He claims the District Court wrongly awarded her $17,988.78 in fees because it considered the parties\u2019 relative financial positions in a vacuum without regard to Ginger\u2019s financial gains as a result of the Decree of Dissolution. Ginger claims the District Court properly considered all marital and post-marital factors. On appeal, Ginger also contends Jeff failed to obtain a transcript of the hearing addressing attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b617 Our standard of review regarding payment of attorney fees is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Lee, </em>282 Mont. at 423, 938 P.2d at 658. Under \u00a740-4-110, MCA, a district court must consider the financial resources of both parties before it orders a party to pay the reasonable costs and attorney fees of another party. We have held that an award under the statute \u201cmust be based on necessity, must be reasonable, and must be based on competent evidence.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Zander, </em>262 Mont. 215, 227, 864 P.2d 1225, 1233 (1993); <em>In re Marriage of Barnard, </em>241 Mont. 147, 154, 785 P.2d 1387, 1391 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b618 Ginger provided the District Court with competent evidence supporting an award of attorney fees under \u00a7 40-4-110, including testimony regarding her health problems, inability to generate income to support herself and simultaneously pay the attorney fees, and Jeffs ability to contribute to the fees. Ginger also argues on appeal that Jeffs failure to provide a transcript of the attorney fees hearing constitutes grounds for awarding her fees. Jeff contends the hearing only addressed the amount of attorney fees, a quantity he\u2019s not contesting. He further claims that attaching the Order was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"AECd\">\u00b619  Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure require parties to provide a record sufficient to enable the Court to rule upon the issues raised. M. R. App. P. 8. In the absence of the transcript in the record, we cannot review this issue. For that reason, we affirm the District Court\u2019s holding regarding the awarding of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b620 <em>Did the District Court err in categorizing the property equalization payment and the Somers property as not income-producing in its decision to award maintenance?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b621 Jeff argues the District Court erred in identifying the Somers property and property equalization payment as not income-producing. The District Court determined that Jeffs net distribution of property amounted to $658,786 and valued Ginger\u2019s at $422,542. As a result of this inequity, the District Court awarded Ginger $118,122 to achieve an equitable distribution of the marital estate. Jeff asserts that the payment was income-producing because it gave Ginger the immediate ability to pay her daily expenses and invest the money. He also argues the Somers property was readily convertible to cash, and <em>was </em>converted to $117,535 through the sale of the property, transforming the 2.4 acres into income-producing property.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b622  Section 40-4-203(1), MCA, provides that the District Court may grant maintenance only if it finds that the spouse seeking maintenance: (a) lacks sufficient property to provide for his reasonable needs; and (b) is unable to support himself through employment. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>have held that the term \u201csufficient property\u201d means income-producing property rather than income-consuming property. <em>Van Atta v. Van Atta, 252 </em>Mont. 310, 313, 829 P.2d 3, 5 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b623 While this Court has recognized that cash payments can be income-producing when viewed in isolation, an analysis within the overall context of the Dissolution is required. <em>In re Marriage of Olson, </em>257 Mont. 208, 219, 848 P.2d 1026, 1033 (1993) (noting that a $1,000 cash payment was income-producing but had to be used to replace property, an act which depleted-not increased4ts value to the recipient). Additionally, it is unclear from the record whether the equalization payments are readily available within the marital estate. The equalization payments, therefore, cannot be predictably identified as sufficient, income-producing property under \u00a740-4-203, MCA. The District Court accurately identified the property equalization payment as not income-producing.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b624 Jeff next argues the District Court erred in identifying the Somers property as not income-producing. He claims it was readily convertible to cash and was, in fact, converted to cash when Ginger sold the property for $117,535. The District Court, however, correctly identified the property as not income-producing. In its original form, the marital estate constituted property, not cash. The statute demands an analysis of whether the property itself was sufficient for the recipient, not an analysis of whether the recipient was able to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b625 This understanding of the statute is supported by this Court\u2019s precedent and the rationale behind the statute. In the context of the maintenance statute, we have deemed property \u2018income-producing\u201d in a limited number of situations in which living or working on the property itself either sustains or grows the individual\u2019s income. <em>See Pfeifer v. Pfeifer, </em>282 Mont. 461, 474, 938 P.2d 682, 692 (1997) (recipient able to generate income from working on the property\u2019s ranch); <em>In re Marriage of Herron, </em>186 Mont. 396, 408, 608 P.2d 97, 103 (1980) (ongoing medical practice categorized as \u201cincome-producing\u201d property). This Court has also noted that the potential future conversion of a home or real property into cash does not negate the reality that property itself, even in significant volume, can be income-consuming. <em>In re Marriage of Herron, </em>186 Mont. at 408, 608 P.2d at 103. This understanding is supported by the rationale justifying the property distinction, which expresses concern that one party will be left \u201cproperty poor\u201d with an estate he or she cannot maintain. <em>See In re Marriage of Herron, </em>186 Mont. at 408, 608 P.2d at 103. The rationale, like precedent on this issue, analyzes what the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>itself can provide. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s categorization of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b626 <em>Is Ginger entitled to attorney fees on appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b627 Finally, Ginger asks this Court to award her attorney fees on appeal under \u00a740-4-110, MCA. Having reviewed the facts of this case, we determine that fees on appeal are not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b628 For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-7\">JUSTICES RICE, NELSON, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
