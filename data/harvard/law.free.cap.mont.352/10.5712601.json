McCollom moved for a new trial on the grounds that the District Court erroneously had allowed a police officer to testify to the out-of-court statement of McCollom\u2019s friend when the friend was unavailable for trial. The friend\u2019s statement implicated McCollom in setting the fire. The District Court denied this motion and imposed a deferred sentence on McCollom. McCollom filed this timely appeal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b62 McCollom raises two issues on appeal. He first argues that the District Court violated his right to confrontation when it allowed a police officer to testify as to a friend\u2019s out-of-court statement. We need not reach this issue, however, in light of our resolution of the question of whether McCollom had adopted the friend\u2019s statement as his own. We restate the dispositive issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court erroneously admitted the statement of an unavailable third-party on the basis that McCollom had adopted as his own the third-party\u2019s statement implicating McCollom?</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b64 McCollom returned home in the early morning hours of August 27, 2006, after having dinner and drinks in downtown Missoula. McCollom joined his neighbors, Jake Allen (Allen) and Nate Wise (Wise), who were in the process of moving out of their apartment. The three friends continued to drink and eventually decided to discard some junk in nearby garbage dumpsters.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b65 The three friends loaded an old couch into a truck and drove to Shopko. They dumped the couch in a parking lot behind the store. The friends ignited the couch before leaving the area. The three friends reloaded the truck upon returning home. This time they drove to the Cine III Theatre and discarded the items into a large metal dumpster. The group ignited the contents of the dumpster. Police and fire crews responded to the two fires. Officers saw McCollom and Allen running away from the area. Officers picked up McCollom, Allen, and Wise for questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">\u00b66 Officer Michael Wood (Wood), a detective with the Missoula Police Department, investigated the fires. Wood determined that McCollom and Wise were too intoxicated to be interviewed on the night of their arrests. Wood allowed McCollom and Wise to leave on the condition that they return the next day for questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">\u00b67 Wood interviewed Allen that night, however, as Wood felt that Allen was capable of giving a statement. Allen admitted to Wood that he and McCollom had started the Shopko fire. Allen claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>McCollom alone had started the fire in the dumpster behind the Cine III. Wood recorded his interview with Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b68 Wise told Wood that he did not see who started the fire, but claimed that he did see McCollom with a lighter in his hand. Wise also claimed that he saw McCollom adding more items to the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b69 McCollom telephoned Allen before going to the police station for his interview with Wood. McCollom explained to Allen that he remembered little of the events of the previous evening due to his high level of intoxication. He asked Allen for his recollection of events. Allen relayed to McCollom that they were in trouble for starting the two fires. Allen cut short the telephone call as he was busy with other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b610 McCollom explained to Wood that he briefly had talked to Allen. McCollom claimed to be confused about what had happened. McCollom recalled that he had offered to help throw away some stuff belonging to Allen and Wise. McCollom could not recall the exact details, however, due to his level of intoxication. McCollom also could not recall how much he had to drink that night. He admitted that he had been drinking for a good portion of the day and evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b611 McCollom claimed that he had no recollection of lighting either fire. He did not believe that he had helped start the fire in the dumpster behind the Cine III. McCollom acknowledged that he considered Allen to be trustworthy. McCollom also acknowledged that Allen claimed that McCollom had been next to the dumpster at Cine III at the time of the fire. McCollom conceded to Wood that it was possible that he could have been involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b612 The damage caused by the fire in the dumpster behind the Cine III exceeded $1,000. As a result, the State charged McCollom with felony criminal mischief for starting the fire. Allen was unavailable at the time of McCollom\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u00b613 The State asked Wood at trial about Allen\u2019s statement implicating McCollom. McCollom objected to the question on the grounds that Allen\u2019s statement constituted inadmissible hearsay. The State argued that McCollom had adopted Allen\u2019s statement. McCollom countered that Allen\u2019s statement was testimonial and that any testimonial statement triggered his right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">\u00b614 The District Court overruled McCollom\u2019s objection on the basis that sufficient evidence in the record established that McCollom had adopted Allen\u2019s statement as his own, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(B). The court pointed to several items from McCollom\u2019s interview with Wood. The court noted that McCollom had agreed that Allen was trustworthy. McCollom acknowledged that if Allen had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>claimed that McCollom had lit the fire fit was possible\u201d that McCollom had in fact lit the fire. Finally the court cited McCollom\u2019s statement to Wood that Allen had been the most sober of the three friends and as a result McCollom was \u201cgoing with what [Allen] said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b615 The jury convicted McCollom. McCollom moved for a new trial. The court denied McCollom\u2019s motion for a new trial. McCollom appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b616 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary decisions to determine whether it abused its discretion. <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 8,330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u00b617 Whether the District Court erroneously admitted the statement of an unavailable third-party on the basis that McCollom had adopted as his own the third-party\u2019s statement implicating McCollom?</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">\u00b618 M. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(B) provides an exception to the hearsay rule if a party has manifested an adoption or belief in the truth of a statement. The Court in <em>State v. Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. 341, 950 P.2d 1383, recognized that the trial court first must make an express determination that an innocent defendant normally would have made a response to the third-party\u2019s statement. <em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 349, 950 P.2d at 1388. Upon satisfaction of this first criterion the court must determine whether the State has presented sufficient evidence that the defendant acquiesced in the third-party\u2019s statement. <em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 349, 950 P.2d at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">\u00b619 The fact that Montana modeled M. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(B) after the federal rules of evidence also allows us to look for guidance from federal precedent. <em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 350, 950 P.2d at 1388. The Sixth Circuit has applied a similar test. The first inquiry is whether the statement was one that under the circumstances, \u201can innocent defendant would normally be induced to respond.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Jinadu, </em>98 F.3d 239, 244 (6th Cir. 1996). The first criterion is of particular relevance in cases involving silent acquiescence. <em>Jinadu, </em>98 F.3d at 244. The court then must determine whether sufficient facts exist from which the jury could infer that the defendant \u201cheard, understood, and acquiesced in the statement.\u201d <em>Jinadu, </em>98 F.3d at 244. The Seventh Circuit follows a slightly modified version of the test. It requires that the statement must have been made in the defendant\u2019s presence, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the defendant understood the statement, and that the defendant had the opportunity to deny the statement. <em>U.S. v. Ward, </em>377 F.3d 671, 675 (7th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b620 <em>Jinadu </em>involved a heroin bust after the delivery of a marked package. A federal drug agent initially interviewed the defendant. The defendant responded \u2018Ves\u201d when asked by the agent if he knew that the package had contained \u201cChina White heroin.\u201d The agent died before the case proceeded to trial. The government sought to admit the agent\u2019s inquiry at trial on the grounds that the defendant had adopted the agent\u2019s statement as his own. The court determined that the government had satisfied the first criterion by demonstrating that the defendant had answered \u2018Ves\u201d to the agent\u2019s question about the content of the package. The court determined that the government had satisfied the second criterion by presenting evidence that the defendant had heard the agent\u2019s question and by presenting evidence that the defendant understood English. <em>Jinadu, </em>98 F.3d at 244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b621 The first criterion addresses a defendant\u2019s silent acquiescence-fehe most common form of adopted statement. <em>Jinadu, </em>98 F.3d at 244. McCollom, of course, did not remain silent in the face of Allen\u2019s statements. We will focus on whether sufficient evidence exists that McCollom had acquiesced in Allen\u2019s statement. <em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 349, 950 P.2d at 1388; <em>Jinadu, </em>98 F.3d at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b622 The \u201cadmission\u201d in Widenhofer also arose from the defendant\u2019s silence. <em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 349, 950 P.2d at 1388. <em>Widenhofer </em>involved a DUI investigation. A passenger in the defendant\u2019s car claimed that the defendant had been the driver of the car and pointed out the defendant to the investigating officer. The defendant did not hear the passenger\u2019s statement and he did not witness the passenger\u2019s alleged identification. The defendant remained silent when questioned by the investigating officer regarding the passenger\u2019s statement. The State argued that the defendant had adopted the passenger\u2019s statement when he agreed to sit in the front seat of the patrol car and then remained silent to the accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u00b623 This Court determined that the defendant\u2019s absence from hearing the passenger\u2019s original statement combined with the defendant\u2019s subsequent failure to contradict the passenger\u2019s statement did not rise to the level of an adoption. <em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 350, 950 P.2d at 1388. The Court considered the fact that the defendant had not heard the conversation between the officer and the passenger, and, in fact, had no reason to know what conversation might have been taking place between the passenger and the officer. <em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 350, 950 P.2d at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u00b624 McCollom, too, was absent during Wood\u2019s interview with Allen. He did not hear or witness the discussion between the two. <em>Ward, </em>377 F.3d at 675. McCollom did not hear the statement firsthand from Allen. McCollom did not hear the entirety of the conversation from Wood. Wood simply related to McCollom excerpts of his conversation with Allen from the previous evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b625 The record fails to establish that McCollom adopted those portions of Allen\u2019s statement related by Wood. McCollom never heard the entire statement from Allen before talking to Wood. McCollom expressed equivocation regarding the statement when confronted by Wood. McCollom repeatedly reiterated the fact that he had been extremely intoxicated at the time of the incident. McCollom conceded to Wood that it possibly could be true that he had started the fire in the dumpster behind the Cine III. McCollom further agreed with Wood that Allen was \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b626  McCollom never affirmatively agreed with Wood, however, that Allen\u2019s statement represented a definitive account of what had happened. The mere expressions that it was \u201cpossible,\u201d and that Allen was \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d fail to rise to the level of adoption. Our review of the record reveals insufficient facts that the jury could infer that McCollom \u201cheard, understood, and acquiesced in the statement.\u201d <em>Jinadu, </em>98 F.3d at 244. The District Court abused its discretion by allowing Wood to testify as to Allen\u2019s statement that implicated McCollom.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\u00b627 Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b41-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
