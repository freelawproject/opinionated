The District Court entered a default judgment against Weaver on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Weaver failed to file a timely response to Mobley\u2019s Complaint. Weaver moved to have the default judgment set aside and the District Court did not issue an order within 60 days; therefore, the motion was deemed denied. Weaver appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b62 Did the District Court slightly abuse its discretion by denying Weaver\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b63 Weaver is a shareholder and employee of Five Rivers, Inc., a corporation that designs and constructs ponds, streams and wetlands. Mobley and Sons (Mobley) is a Montana corporation that built ponds, installed power lines, dug ditches and performed other construction work in Wyoming on a Five Rivers\u2019 project in 2007. After Mobley completed the work, Five Rivers made payments to Mobley for several months but, according to Mobley, stopped making payments in June 2008, leaving an unpaid balance of $65,467.11. In October 2008, Mobley filed a Complaint naming Weaver, rather than Five Rivers, as the defendant, seeking payment of the above-referenced balance plus interest. The parties dispute whether Five Rivers or Weaver is the proper defendant. Weaver claims the contract with Mobley was between Five Rivers and Mobley. Mobley asserts that it contracted personally with Weaver.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\u00b64 Weaver was served with the Complaint on November 10, 2008, and had until December 2, 2008, to file his answer. He failed to do so. On December 3, Mobley moved for default judgment. Mobley\u2019s attorney filed an affidavit in support of Mobley\u2019s motion for default judgment in which he claimed Mobley and Weaver entered into a contract under which Mobley would perform the above-described work. Counsel also stated in the affidavit that under the contract Mobley was to bill Weaver directly for time and materials provided on the project and that Weaver failed to pay the billed amount. The affidavit included a statement of \u201camount due\u201d that included the alleged unpaid balance, $272 in interest accrued from the last payment in June 2008 and $238 in costs, for a total of $65,977.11. On December 3, the Clerk of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court entered a default as well as the judgment by default against Weaver, ordering him to pay $65,977.11, plus 10% per annum interest from the date of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">\u00b65 On December 11, Weaver moved to set aside the default judgment and Mobley filed a timely objection to the motion. On February 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>2009, the District Court granted Weaver\u2019s motion. Mobley then challenged the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction to enter its February 18 order, arguing that the District Court lost jurisdiction of the matter on February 9, 2009, sixty days after Weaver filed his motion to set aside the default judgment. In response, Weaver filed an Emergency Motion to Reconsider, Remediate Clerical Error Pursuant to Rule 60(a), or Alternatively Motion for Nunc Pro Tunc and Brief in Support (Emergency Motion). Mobley then filed a special pleading in support of its challenge on March 4, 2009, arguing that under M. R. Civ. P. 59(d), the court was required to rule on Weaver\u2019s motion within 60 days. Mobley maintained that because the District Court did not respond within 60 days, the motion was deemed denied and the District Court no longer had jurisdiction over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b66 Weaver, on the other hand, urged the District Court to exercise its authority to \u201ccorrect a clerical error\u201d or utilize its \u201cnunc pro tunc\u201d authority, both of which could be implemented by back-dating the order. Weaver asserted that such action was appropriate because it was \u2018indisputably\u201d the court\u2019s intention to meet the 60-day requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b67 The court held a hearing on Weaver\u2019s Emergency Motion on March 4. On March 10, the District Court denied Weaver\u2019s motion, set aside its February 18 order, and reinstated the December 3 default judgment. It also denied Mobley\u2019s request for attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AWx\">\u00b68 Weaver appeals the court\u2019s March 10 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to set aside an entry of default for good cause under M. R. Civ. P. 55(c) under the slight abuse of discretion standard. To determine whether good cause exists we consider the factors originally set forth in <em>Cribb v. Matlock Communications, Inc., </em>236 Mont. 27, 30, 768 P.2d 337, 339 (1989): (1) whether the default was willful, (2) whether the plaintiff would be prejudiced if the default should be set aside, and (3) whether the defendant has presented a meritorious defense to plaintiffs claim. The court must also balance the interests of the defendant in the adjudication of his defense on the merits, against the interests of the public and the court in the orderly and timely administration of justice. <em>Legal Resources Agency, LLC v. Armstrong, </em>2008 MT 262, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 345 Mont. 115, 191 P.3d 368 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court slightly abuse its discretion by denying Weaver\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b611 M.. R. Civ. P. 55(a) (Rule 55) provides that Twjhen a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter the party\u2019s default.\u201d Additionally, Rule 55(b) provides, in part, that \u2018Twjhen the plaintiffs claim against a defendant is for a sum certain or for a sum which can by computation be made certain, the clerk upon request of the plaintiff and upon affidavit of the amount due shall enter judgment for that amount and costs against the defendant, if the defendant has been defaulted for failure to appear <em>...\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b612 The primary issue before us is the proper identity of the \u201cparty\u201d and the \u201cdefendant\u201d as referenced in the above statutes. Mobley sought a judgment against Weaver, individually, and argues on appeal the correctness of its position. Weaver asserted to the District Court and to this Court that Five Rivers is the correct party because Five Rivers contracted with Mobley, not Weaver, individually. Weaver professes that Mobley misrepresented, or worse, fraudulently represented to the court that Weaver was the proper party defendant. This misrepresentation or fraudulent representation, argues Weaver, justifies relief from the District Court\u2019s March 10 order reinstating the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u00b613 The documents Mobley filed with the District Court did indeed allege that Weaver was the proper defendant. Certainly, had Weaver filed a timely response to Mobley s Complaint he would have addressed this issue but his failure to do so set in motion the default followed by the District Court\u2019s untimely ruling. We conclude, however, that the untimely actions of Weaver and the District Court do not drive the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u00b614 As noted above, the clerk of court is authorized to enter a judgment by default upon the filing of an affidavit for a sum certain. Rule 55(b). Mobley\u2019s attorney submitted an Affidavit in Support of Motion to Enter Default Judgment. This affidavit asserted that Mobley, \u201ca Corporation\u201d and Weaver, \u201ca resident of Gallatin County, Montana,\u201d entered into an agreement in May 2007. The affiant described the work that Mobley would perform under this agreement as well as the billing arrangement purportedly agreed upon by the parties. Mobley\u2019s attorney continued in his affidavit that Mobley properly submitted the invoices and Weaver failed to pay all of them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The attorney set forth the unpaid amounts, including costs and calculated interest. Based upon this affidavit, the Clerk of Court entered judgment by default and instructed Weaver to pay the amount demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b615 We conclude Mobley\u2019s attorney\u2019s affidavit was flawed and therefore functionally defective. Mobley\u2019s attorney was not present at the time the parties discussed the contract terms; therefore, he has no personal knowledge of the identity of the parties, the job description the parties agreed upon, or the billing arrangements. While he stated in the affidavit that he was \u2018familiar with the facts herein,\u201d he was clearly testifying to information provided by his client, the veracity of which he had no personal knowledge. In <em>Mountain States Resources, Inc. v. Ehlert, </em>195 Mont. 496, 503, 636 P.2d 868, 872, (1981), we evaluated the sufficiency of an affidavit. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">An affidavit is defined as \u201ca written statement, under oath, sworn to or affirmed by the person making it before some person who has authority to administer an oath or affirmation.\u201d (Citations omitted.) The maker must have personal knowledge of the information contained in the statement and must swear to its validity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\"><em>See also McDermott v. Carie, LLC, </em>2005 MT 293, \u00b6 26, 329 Mont. 295, 124 P.3d 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u00b616  Here, Mobley\u2019s attorney testified via affidavit to significant and disputed factual issues well outside of his personal knowledge. This being so, we conclude that the affidavit was improperly relied upon to support the entry of default judgment. <em>McDermott, </em>\u00b6 26 (improper affidavit cannot support bill of costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\u00b617 Finally, we note that the District Court correctly concluded it lost jurisdiction over this matter on the day Weaver\u2019s motion was deemed denied for the court\u2019s failure to issue a timely order. Having so concluded, the appropriate action would have been to simply revoke its February 18 order. Upon such a revocation, Weaver was then free to appeal the deemed denial of his motion. Given that the District Court was without jurisdiction, it had no authority to reinstate the default judgment in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">\u00b618 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the default judgment and reverse and remand this matter to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-11\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
