Taylor, surviving executors of the said Eobert Taylor, the said sum of nine thousand dollars, mentioned in the codicil to the will of the said Eobert Taylor, deceased, together with the lawful interest thereon from one year after the death of the said testator; and it was referred to Charles Ewing, esquire, one of the masters of this court, to ascertain who were the nearest descendants of the said deceased sisters, at the date of the said decree, and their names respectively, and the several proportions of said legacy to which they were respectively entitled, to the end that such further decree should be made thereon as the said chancellor might think equitable and just: and that in pursuance of said nterlocutory decree, the said master made his report, bearing date on the second day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine, thereby ascertaining the nearest descendants of the said five sisters of the testator and the amount of the said legacy: and it further appearing, that although Garret D.
