Favela-Masuca contends the district court erred by applying an eight-level increase to his offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C), because the conviction that resulted in his deportation, misdemeanor serious domestic abuse assault in violation of Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 236.2(2), 708.1 and 708.2A, is not a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 and does not constitute an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-26\">In <em>United States v. Villegas-Hemandez, </em>468 F.3d 874 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1351, 167 L.Ed.2d 144 (2007), this court determined that an offense is a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 only if the use of force was both intentional and an element of the offense. <em>Villegas-Hemandez, </em>468 F.3d at 880-82. As the Government concedes, the use of force is not an element of serious domestic abuse assault under Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 236.2(2), 708.1 and 708.2A. The district court thus erred in applying an enhancement based on this offense. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the sentence is vacated, and this matter remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Favela-Masuca also challenges the constitutionality of the treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Favela-Masuca\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Favela-Masuca properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">We deny as moot his motion to expedite the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING; MOTION TO EXPEDITE THE APPEAL DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
