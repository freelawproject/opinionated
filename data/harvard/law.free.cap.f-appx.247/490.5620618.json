United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998); dismissals pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) (failure to state a claim) and \u00a7 1915A, <em>de novo. E.g., id. </em>Because the district court\u2019s dismissal referred to both \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1915A, <em>de novo </em>review applies. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Regarding the failure-to-state-a-claim dismissal of the claims purportedly brought under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 241, and 1001, and Texas Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 39.022 and 39.04, Chambers contends the district court erroneously failed to liberally construe his pleadings or require a more definite statement, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a). Despite Chambers\u2019 <em>pro se </em>status, dismissal of these claims, which asserted criminal charges, was proper. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>953 F.2d 1449,1462 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Similarly, the district court properly dismissed as frivolous Chambers\u2019 count-one deliberate-indifference claim regarding Dr. Kwatra\u2019s alleged inadequate pain treatment, because Dr. Kwatra\u2019s response to Chambers\u2019 request for different pain medication does not constitute deliberate indifference. <em>See Vamado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">Dismissal as frivolous was also proper for Chambers\u2019 count-one claims regarding Jeter\u2019s and Dr. Kwatra\u2019s alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress, <em>see City of Midland v. O\u2019Bryant, </em>18 S.W.3d 209, 216-17 (Tex.2000), and Chambers\u2019 count-two claims relying on <em>United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954), which alleged violations of BOP program statements. <em>See Royal v. Tombone, </em>141 F.3d 596, 600-01 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Miller v. Hen-man, </em>804 F.2d 421, 426 (7th Cir.1986); <em>cf. Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">For his other count-one deliberate-indifference claims, Chambers\u2019 complaint alleged: defendants delayed and denied medical care to him, including arm surgery; despite his advising Officer Roth-man of medical restrictions related to his heart condition and high blood pressure, Officer Rothman forced him to work in violation of them; as a result, his blood pressure rose to a dangerous level, he experienced light-headedness, fatigue, and chest pain, he had an abnormal EKG, and he was hospitalized for over a week; and Officer Rothman\u2019s actions constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress. Along that line, Chambers\u2019 count-three claims alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>policies and customs of punishing inmates with manual labor and retaliating against grievance-filing inmates, and his count-eight claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act related to the alleged incident with Officer Roth-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>man and retaliation for Chambers\u2019 filing a related grievance. These claims are not based on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory\u201d. <em>Davis v. Scott, </em>157 F.3d 1003, 1005 (5th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1246 (5th Cir.1989). Moreover, the district court, which did not give reasons in dismissing these claims as frivolous, did not allow Chambers the opportunity to develop them. Accordingly, such dismissal was improper. <em>See Davis, </em>157 F.3d at 1005; <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Moore v. Mabus, </em>976 F.2d 268, 271 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Concomitantly, because exhaustion is an affirmative defense that must be raised by the defendant, the district court\u2019s failure-to-exhaust conclusion was premature. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 910, 921,166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In sum, the. failure-to-state-a-claim dismissal, and the dismissal as frivolous of Chambers\u2019 Accardi-based claims, his deliberate-indifference claim regarding Dr. Kwatra\u2019s alleged inadequate pain treatment, and his intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress claims as to Dr. Kwatra and Jeter, are affirmed. The dismissal as frivolous of the remaining claims is vacated, and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b513-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
