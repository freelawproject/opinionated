Finding no error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">After receiving a tip regarding child pornography at the home of John Mickelson, the Louisiana Attorney General\u2019s High Tech Crime Unit obtained a \u201cno knock\u201d warrant to search Mickelson\u2019s home and \u201call other structures, vehicles, and places on the premises.\u201d While executing the warrant, the crime unit, assisted by Baker police officers, searched a room adjoining the garage, which Djohan was renting.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Following the search, Djohan asserted claims against the officers and the attorney general for false arrest, unreasonable search, unreasonable seizure of property, conspiracy in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985, and municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and various state law claims. The district court granted summary judgment to Defendants on all claims, and Djohan now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-17\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b525-18\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. <em>MacLachlan v. ExxonMobil Corp., </em>350 F.3d 472, 478 (5th Cir.2003). A court should grant summary judgment when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). Facts are material only if they \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.... Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-20\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Djohan\u2019s false arrest claim. Although his movement was restricted to some degree during the search, this was required in order to provide for the protection of the officers and to prevent the contamination of evidence. <em>See Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 702, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 2594, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981). The record evidence shows that Djohan was not physically restrained or abused at any point, and any restraint was both minimal and justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-21\">Similarly, the search of the garage room was proper. The plain language of the warrant allowed the officers to search the entire premises, and that room shared a roof with the main house. Even assuming the room is separate from the main <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>house, it easily would fall under the definition of curtilage. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 571 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Djohan\u2019s remaining claims are without merit. He presents no facts to establish his \u00a7 1985 conspiracy claim, <em>see Hilliard v. Ferguson, </em>30 F.3d 649, 652-53 (5th Cir.1994), and identifies no official policy that would substantiate his \u00a7 1983 claim, <em>see Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 578 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2038, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b525-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
