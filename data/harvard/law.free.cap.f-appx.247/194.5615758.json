The district court found that Sanchez\u2019s counsel was not ineffective, but did not address Sanchez\u2019s claim that her sentence was unconstitutional. On appeal, Sanchez argues that the district court did not address all of the claims in her \u00a7 2255 motion. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">Sanchez filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion attacking her convictions, after jury trial, for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)-(B), 846, and the 235-month term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to those convictions under the then-mandatory guidelines system. In her \u00a7 2255 motion, Sanchez presented various arguments that trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in advising her regarding the government\u2019s plea offer. The district court later permitted her to file a supplemental brief raising the claim that her sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court set an evidentiary hearing before a magistrate judge and appointed current counsel to represent Sanchez.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">The magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation addressed Sanchez\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, but did not mention her <em>Blakely </em>claim. Sanchez objected that the magistrate had failed to resolve all of the claims in her motion because he had failed to address her <em>Blakely </em>claim. She also objected that the magistrate had failed to discuss one aspect of her ineffective-assistance claim, that trial counsel had grossly underestimated her sentencing exposure. The district court denied Sanchez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, stating that \u201c[f]or the reasons stated in the report of the Magistrate Judge and upon independent review of the file, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows: [ ] This motion to vacate is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-17\">Sanchez moved for a certificate of appealability, which the district court granted in part as to the issue of whether it had erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>without specifically addressing Sanchez\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim. We later expanded the certificate of appealability to include the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">Whether the district court erred in denying appellant\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately advise her regarding the risks and benefits of accepting the proffered plea agreement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Sanchez argues that the district court violated our rule, as announced in <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>that district courts must address all claims raised in habeas cases and that, therefore, we should vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice to permit it to consider her <em>Blakely </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). The scope of review is limited to the issues specified in the certificate of appealability. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Expressing \u201cdeep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions\u201d in <em>Clisby, </em>we exercised our supervisory authority to require that district courts resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2254, regardless of whether habeas relief is granted or denied. <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 935-36. We explained that, when a district court does not address all claims presented in a habeas petition, we will \u201cvacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Although this case arises from a \u00a7 2255 motion rather than a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, the principles developed in \u00a7 2254 proceedings generally likewise apply to motions under \u00a7 2255. <em>Gay v. United States, </em>816 F.2d 614, 616 n. 1 (11th Cir.1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have also vacated and remanded a district court\u2019s one-sentence denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion so that the district court could \u201cprovide further explanation of its ruling in order to provide this court with a sufficient basis for review.\u201d <em>Broadwater v. United States, </em>292 F.3d 1302, 1303 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">A careful review of the record reveals that the district court did not address Sanchez\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim. The government does not contend that the district court did address the claim, but instead argues that we should address the claim in the first instance because it is \u201ca pure question of law whose proper resolution is beyond any doubt.\u201d The government relies on <em>Baumann v. Savers Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan </em>Assoc., 934 F.2d 1506, 1512 (11th Cir.1991), but <em>Baumann </em>is inapposite because it addresses exceptions to the general rule that we will not address an issue that a party failed to raise in the district court, but wishes to raise on appeal. <em>See id. Clisby, </em>on the other hand, addresses the situation where a party did raise the issue below, but the district court failed to address it. <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 934-36. Nothing in <em>Clisby </em>indicates that a forfeited-issue analysis should apply where the district court has erred under <em>Clisby. See id. </em>at 935 (concluding that, even though the respondent urged us to consider the claims not addressed by the district court, we could \u201cdo no more than remand the case to the district court to consider all remaining claims\u201d). We hold that remand is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>here for the district court to consider all of Sanchez\u2019s claims in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In light of the forgoing, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand with instructions for the district court to consider Sanchez\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">. We have previously applied <em>Clisby </em>in \u00a7 2255 cases, although in unpublished, non-binding opinions. <em>See, e.g., Conaway v. United States, </em>184 Fed.Appx. 890, 891 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Jernigan v. United States, </em>180 Fed.Appx. 56, 57-58 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-17\">. We also note that a review of the record reveals that the district court did not address the portion of Sanchez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim relating to trial counsel's alleged misadvice regarding the possible maximum sentence she faced if convicted after trial. The district court should address this assertion on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
