GP files two motions with this court: (1) to dismiss Parker\u2019s appeal for failure to comply with 5th Cir. R. 30, and (2) to strike Parker\u2019s record excerpts A-l through A-3, A-5 through A-10, A-12 through A-13, and Appendix A to Parker\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-19\">Regarding GP\u2019s motions, it is noted that Parker\u2019s record excerpts A-l through A-3, A-5 through A-10, A-12 through A-13, and Appendix A to Parker\u2019s brief were not filed with the district court and, therefore, are not contained in the record on appeal. Parker\u2019s actions on appeal are not sufficiently egregious to warrant dismissal. However, \u201c[t]his court\u2019s inquiry is limited to the summary judgment record before the trial court: the parties cannot add exhibits, depositions, or affidavits to support their positions on appeal.... \u201d <em>Topalian v. Ehrman, </em>954 F.2d 1125, 1131 n. 10 (5th Cir.1992). Therefore, GP\u2019s motion to strike is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-20\">The district court found that Parker did not satisfy her burden of production in rebutting each of GP\u2019s proffered justifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>tions for termination, namely that Parker was fired for \u201cdishonesty.\u201d Furthermore, the district court found that Parker did not establish that GP\u2019s nondiscriminatory rationale for termination was pretextual. Parker argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to GP because there are genuine issues of material fact concerning whether she was terminated for actions occurring during or related to her FMLA-approved leave on the date of termination.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of America, </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Clark v. America\u2019s Favorite Chicken Co., </em>110 F.3d 295, 297 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Parker has not shown that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of GP as she has not shown that there were genuine issues of material fact. The undisputed evidence established that Parker was granted FMLA-approved leave beginning at 2:00 p.m. on March 11, 2004. The undisputed evidence also showed that, before 2:00 p.m., Parker falsely claimed a machine was repaired, was insubordinate towards her supervisors, neglected her duties, and left her job earlier than requested or approved. These actions support GP\u2019s termination of Parker. Parker had the burden to bring forth evidence that GP\u2019s reason for termination, namely Parker\u2019s \u201cdishonesty,\u201d was \u201cnot the true reason for the employment decision and that the real reason was the plaintiffs participation in the protected activity.\u201d <em>Chaffin v. John H. Carter Co., Inc., </em>179 F.3d 316, 320 (5th Cir.1999). Parker has not met this burden. Therefore, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">AFFIRMED; APPELLEE\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS DENIED; APPELLEE\u2019S MOTION TO STRIKE GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under dle limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\"><em> </em>Parker also argues for the first time that she was a pro se litigant and should have received additional time to conduct discovery. This argument lacks merit because Parker was not a pro se litigant at any stage of the district court proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
