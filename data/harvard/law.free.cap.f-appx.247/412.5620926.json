We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>While the district court may have erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to provide evidence he exhausted his administrative remedies, <em>see Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 910, 921, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007) (holding that \u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA\u201d and \u201cinmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints\u201d), we nonetheless affirm the district court\u2019s order on the grounds that Furby failed to particularize his complaint to allege facts indicating he was deprived of a federal right by an individual acting under color of state law. We grant Furby leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>on appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
