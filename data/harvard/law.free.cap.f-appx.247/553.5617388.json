Sias pleaded guilty of using and carrying a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1) (A) (ii) and was sentenced to 120 months of imprisonment. Because he was not sentenced on his conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) in conjunction with any other conviction, Amendment 599 is not applicable to him, and the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 599; <em>United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir.1994). Sias\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983) (per curiam); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">Sias filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 598 to the guidelines, advancing essentially the same argument presented in his current motion. His appeal from the denial of that motion was dismissed as frivolous. Sias is cautioned that further frivolous filings may result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary penalties, and restrictions on his ability to file appeals in this court and actions in any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b576-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
