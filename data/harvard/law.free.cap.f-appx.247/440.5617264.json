Lyons, a state prisoner, petitions for habeas relief, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d) (West 2005), from his sentence of 360-441 months\u2019 imprisonment, contending that he received a sentence in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Although the district court held, as the State conceded, that the state court\u2019s adjudication of his claim resulted in a decision contrary to established Supreme Court precedent in <em>Blakely, </em>the district court further concluded that this error was harmless. Because the <em>Blakely </em>sentencing error was not harmless, we must reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-19\">Lyons entered an <em>Alford </em>plea to first-degree sexual offense and first-degree kid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>naping in Wake County Superior Court in North Carolina. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970). The prosecutor proffered a statement of facts in support of the <em>Alford </em>plea; Lyons neither objected to the statement, nor admitted the facts it contained. On direct appeal, the Court of Appeals of North Carolina summarized the prosecutor\u2019s statement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">Th[e] statement set forth the following facts. Defendant invited a childhood friend and his family to temporarily live in defendant\u2019s home in Raleigh while the friend looked for a house in the Triangle or Triad area. In encouraging his friend, defendant announced that he loved the friend\u2019s 15-year-old son (\u201cK.V.M.\u201d) \u201clike a son[.]\u201d Despite the friend\u2019s initial reluctance, the family moved into defendant\u2019s home in the fall of 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">K.V.M., his father, his stepmother, and two step-siblings lived in defendant\u2019s home for approximately a month and a half. During this time, K.V.M.\u2019s father traveled back and forth to Greensboro searching for a new house for his family, always returning to defendant\u2019s home at night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">On 4 December 2001, K.V.M.\u2019s father, stepmother, and two step-siblings went out of town, but left K.V.M. in Raleigh in defendant\u2019s care. When K.V.M. returned from school that day, defendant was the only person in the house. Defendant and K.V.M. smoked marijuana together. Later, although defendant tried to engage K.V.M. in conversation, K.V.M. ignored him and played with a video game that defendant had previously given him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">KV.M.\u2019s father called that evening to tell defendant that he had purchased a home in Greensboro and that the family would move the next day. At some point after the call ended, defendant grabbed K.V.M. and took him upstairs to a bedroom. Defendant told K.V.M. that either K.V.M. was going to perform fellatio on him or that defendant was going to perform fellatio on K.V.M. When K.V.M. refused, defendant pulled a gun out of the closet and pointed it at K.V.M. Through the night, defendant repeatedly performed fellatio on K.V.M. while displaying the gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">At some point that night, defendant forced K.V.M. to perform fellatio on him. When K.V.M. was unable to complete the act and gagged, defendant made K.V.M. lie down in bed with him and masturbate him until defendant ejaculated on KV.M.\u2019s chest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">The next morning, defendant would not allow K.V.M. to go toschool [sic]. Defendant swallowed several hundred over-the-counter painkillers and became woozy. He again performed fellatio on K.V.M., but then vomited and became weak. K.V.M. told defendant that the smell of vomit was making him ill and asked permission to go for a walk. Defendant told K.V.M. he could go outside, but that he had to return. K.V.M. went directly to a laundromat and called his mother in New York. After the call, he went to a police station where a police officer interviewed him, writing in her report that K.V.M. was violently shaking and crying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">The police arrived at defendant\u2019s home and took defendant to a hospital because of his consumption of pills. During questioning by police, defendant asked if K.V.M. was \u201cokay\u201d and said, \u201c[T]ell him I am sorry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-12\"><em>State v. Lyons, </em>No. COA03-208, 592 S.E.2d 294, 2004 WL 291984, at *1-2 (N.C.Ct.App. Feb.17, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">Based on Lyons\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea alone, the state court could have imposed a maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>sentence of 288-355 months. However, at sentencing, pursuant to the North Carolina Structured Sentencing Act, <em>see </em>N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.10 <em>et seq. </em>(1994), the court relied on the facts proffered in the prosecutor\u2019s statement to find an aggravating factor \u2014 that Lyons took advantage of a position of trust or confidence to commit his offense \u2014 and then sentenced Lyons to <em>360-441 </em>months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Lyons appealed to the Court of Appeals of North Carolina, maintaining that the sentencing court did not have a sufficient factual basis to find that he took advantage of a position of trust to commit the offense. While his appeal was pending before the Court of Appeals of North Carolina, Lyons also filed a Motion for Appropriate Relief (MAR) for collateral review, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the state court\u2019s \u201csentencing procedure,\u201d which \u201callowed the trial court, rather than a jury, to find the aggravating factor,\u201d violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227,119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999). In further support of this claim, he noted that the Supreme Court had granted certiorari in <em>State v. Blakely, </em>148 Wash.2d 1010, 62 P.3d 889 (2003), <em>cert. granted, sub nom. Blakely v. Washington, </em>540 U.S. 965, 124 S.Ct. 429, 157 L.Ed.2d 309 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The Court of Appeals of North Carolina resolved both the direct appeal and MAR in the same opinion: it found that the \u201cundisputed\u201d facts sufficed to support the trial judge\u2019s finding of the aggravating factor, and that <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Jones </em>did not aid Lyons; it did not mention the pending <em>Blakely </em>case. Lyons appealed this decision to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, which summarily denied discretionary review. <em>State v. Lyons, </em>358 N.C. 239, 595 S.E.2d 694 (2004). Lyons\u2019s conviction became final ninety days after this decision, on June 30, 2004. <em>See Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 525, 123 .S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003) (holding that a state judgment becomes final for habeas purposes when the time expires for filing a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, or ninety days following the decision of the state\u2019s highest court).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">On May 3, 2004, Lyons filed a second MAR, <em>pro se, </em>in which he once again claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that under <em>Apprendi </em>only a jury could find the existence of the aggravating factor that increased his sentence. On July 9, 2004, the MAR court rejected that claim. It noted that after Lyons filed this <em>pro se </em>MAR, the Supreme Court of the United States had decided <em>Blakely </em>on June 24, 2004, but the MAR court concluded that <em>Blakely </em>did not assist Lyons because it did not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>State v. Lyons, </em>Nos. 01CRS112990, 01CRS112994 (County of Wake, N.C. Superior Ct. July 9, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Lyons subsequently filed the instant <em>pro se </em>petition for federal habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The district court held that the state MAR court erred in its determination that <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to Lyons\u2019s claim because the MAR court \u201cinadvertently failed to recognize that a case is not considered final on direct review until the 90-day time period to file a certiorari petition to the United States Supreme Court expires.\u201d Nonetheless, the district court denied Lyons habeas relief, concluding that any <em>Blakely </em>error was harmless. Lyons noted a timely appeal. We granted a certificate of appealability to consider Lyons\u2019s claim of <em>Blakely </em>error, and appointed counsel to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), provides that federal courts may grant habeas relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>only if an underlying state court adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Lyons contends that the state courts\u2019 adjudication' of his case resulted in a decision that was contrary to \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d as determined by the Supreme Court in <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">In <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court clarified its holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the Sixth Amendment requires that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The <em>Blakely </em>Court explained that the \u201c \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d </em>542 U.S. at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The North Carolina Structured Sentencing Act under which Lyons was sentenced plainly violates the <em>Blakely </em>holding. For the North Carolina statute requires a judge (rather than a jury) to find by a preponderance of the evidence (rather than beyond a reasonable doubt) aggravating factors that increase the maximum penalty for a crime. Indeed, in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court of North Carolina itself has held that those portions of the North Carolina Structured Sentencing Act that \u201crequire judges to consider aggravating factors not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant and which permit imposition of an aggravated sentence upon judicial findings of such aggravating factors by a preponderance of the evidence are unconstitutional.\u201d <em>State v. Allen, </em>359 N.C. 425, 615 S.E.2d 256, 262 (2005) (withdrawn on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Repeatedly conceding \u2014 at the district court and in its appellate brief \u2014 that <em>Blakely </em>applies to Lyons\u2019s case, the State argues that <em>Blakely </em>error was harmless and thus affirmance proper. We, however, asked the State to address at oral argument the question of whether <em>Blakely </em>qualifies as \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d in this case given that although the <em>Blakely </em>opinion had been issued when Lyons\u2019s conviction became final for habeas purposes and when the state MAR court considered Lyons\u2019s claim, it had not been issued when the Supreme Court of North Carolina issued its order rejecting Lyons\u2019s direct appeal. We attempted to pursue this line of inquiry at oral argument, but the State once again conceded that <em>Blakely </em>applies to Lyons\u2019s appeal and requested that we \u201crule on the harmless error issue.\u201d Accordingly, we consider here only whether conceded <em>Blakely </em>error requires reversal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Typically, in conducting harmless error review in habeas cases, a court can grant relief only if, after consideration of the entire record, it can conclude \u201cwith fair assurance\u201d that an error did not have \u201ca substantial and injurious effect or influence\u201d on the <em>jury's verdict, Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), or is in \u201cgrave doubt\u201d as to this question, <em>O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 U.S. 432, 436, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995). <em>See also Fry v. Pliler, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2321, 2326-28,168 L.Ed.2d 16 (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Although by definition <em>Blakely </em>error arises from the <em>lack </em>of a jury verdict with respect to a sentencing factor, it can nevertheless be harmless. <em>See Washington v. Recuenco, </em>548 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2546, 2558, 165 L.Ed.2d 466 (2006). In determining the harmlessness of an error in a case <em>without </em>a jury verdict, a court considers the entire record and determines whether it can conclude \u201cwith fair assurance\u201d that a reasonable jury <em>would </em>have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the acts establishing the challenged sentencing factor, or if it is in \u201cgrave doubt\u201d as to this question. <em>Cf. Patterson v. Haskins, </em>316 F.3d 596, 609 (6th Cir.2003) (applying this standard when considering on habeas whether a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct a jury on an element of an offense constituted harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Here, the district court reasoned that the <em>Blakely </em>error was harmless because \u201c[b]ased on the evidence in the stenographic transcript of the guilty plea proceeding, no reasonable jury could have\u201d failed to find that Lyons took advantage of a position of trust to commit his offense. We cannot agree. We have no need to fall back on <em>O\u2019Neal\u2019s </em>\u201cgrave doubt\u201d rule, for we find it impossible to conclude with <em>any </em>assurance, on the basis of the record in this case, that a reasonable jury would have found beyond a reasonable doubt this aggravating factor, which the sentencing judge found only by a preponderance of the evidence based on the prosecutor\u2019s proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Although Lyons did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s proffer when he entered his <em>Alford </em>plea, neither did he admit to the facts contained in it. <em>See Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 37, 91 S.Ct. 160. This proffer alone does not give us fair assurance that a reasonable jury would have found the presence of the position of trust or confidence aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Indeed, the North Carolina courts have \u201cupheld a finding of the \u2018trust or confidence\u2019 factor in very limited factual circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Mann, </em>355 N.C. 294, 560 S.E.2d 776, 791 (2002). To apply the enhancement, a jury must find that both: (1) \u201ca position of trust existed,\u201d and (2) the \u201cdefendant abused the position of trust in order to commit the assault.\u201d <em>See State v. Nicholson, </em>169 N.C.App. 390, 610 S.E.2d 433, 437 (2005). Even if we assume that the facts stated in the proffer are true, they do not provide us with \u201cfair assurance\u201d that a reasonable jury would have found beyond a reasonable doubt that a position of trust existed between Lyons and the victim or that Lyons abused that position to commit the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">As to the existence of a position of trust, the State asserts that a position of trust <em>must </em>exist when a minor is left in the care of the defendant overnight. But all of the cases on which the States relies involve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>very different facts. For, in each of them the minor victim had a familial or other close relationship with the abuser, or was very young and so extremely dependent on the defendant, or both. <em>See State v. Far-low, </em>336 N.C. 534, 444 S.E.2d 913, 918 (N.C.1994) (finding a position of trust when nine-year old victim \u201cessentially lived with [the] defendant\u201d while the mother was repeatedly away for her job as a long-distance truck driver); <em>State v. Holden, </em>321 N.C. 689, 365 S.E.2d 626 (1988) (finding a position of trust when victim was three-months old and the daughter of the defendant); <em>State v. Daniel, </em>319 N.C. 308, 354 S.E.2d 216, 218 (1987) (finding a position of trust when defendant mother was \u201csingularly responsible\u201d for the infant victim\u2019s \u201cwelfare\u201d); <em>State v. Gilbert, </em>96 N.C.App. 363, 385 S.E.2d 815, 817 (1989) (finding a position of trust when the victim was six-years old and \u201ca frequent visitor in defendant\u2019s home\u201d); <em>State v. Caldwell, </em>85 N.C.App. 713, 355 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1987) (finding a position of trust between defendant and his stepson and his stepson\u2019s cousin, both of whom lived with the defendant for the summer). In the case at hand, the facts contained in the proffer indicate that the victim was not an infant, not six, not nine, but fifteen-years old; moreover, he was neither related in any way to Lyons nor did he have a particularly close relationship with Lyons. Certainly it could not be said that Lyons was \u201csingularly\u201d responsible for his \u201cwelfare.\u201d <em>Daniel, </em>354 S.E.2d at 218. Thus, a jury might well have concluded that no position of trust existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Moreover, even if a jury were to find that a position of trust did exist, the North Carolina Court of Appeals has held that a defendant has not taken advantage of a position of trust or confidence when the \u201cdefendant\u2019s actions were accomplished as a result of the use of force alone.\u201d <em>Nicholson, </em>610 S.E.2d at 437. According to the prosecution\u2019s proffer, Lyons accomplished his actions solely through the use of force, by pointing a gun at K.V.M. Thus, a reasonable jury, having been instructed on the elements of the aggravating factor, could well have found that the crime was not the result of abuse of a position of trust.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Hence, we do not have fair assurance that a reasonable jury would have found the aggravating factor to enhance Lyons\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>error resulted in Lyons receiving a sentence months, and perhaps years, longer than he would otherwise have received. Thus, we cannot conclude that the error did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on Lyons\u2019s sentence. <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 765, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239; <em>see also Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710. In sum, the error was not harmless.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court erred in denying Lyons habeas relief. We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case with directions to issue a writ of habeas corpus, unless the state court re-sentences Lyons within a reasonable period of time to be set by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\">. The Supreme Court initially enunciated this standard in reviewing nonconstitutional errors on direct appeal of a federal conviction in <em>Kotteakos, </em>and later adopted it as the appropriate standard for collateral review of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>state court criminal judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). Then in <em>O'Neal, </em>the Court held that if a federal court reviewing a state court judgment under \u00a7 2254 has \u201cgrave doubt\u201d as to the harmlessness of an error, it should \"treat the error as if it affected the verdict.\u201d 513 U.S. at 436, 115 S.Ct. 992. In <em>Fry, </em>the Court reiterated that the <em>Brecht-O'Neal </em>standard applies in all \u00a7 2254 cases, even those decided post-AEDPA. 127 S.Ct. at 2326-28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-13\">. The victim\u2019s mother, who was living in New York at the time of the offense, testified at the sentencing hearing, \u201cI gave ... my trust\u201d to Lyons and \u201d[w]hen [K.V.M.] told me [what] happened, I knew exactly what he was talking about\u201d because \u201cwe always heard [about] things that [Lyons] ha[d] done.\u201d This statement does not appear to have been offered specifically in support of the aggravating factor. In any event, it is too ambiguous to constitute support for proof of the aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b468-4\">. The North Carolina Court of Appeals in this case concluded that the facts were \"sufficient\u201d to support a finding of the aggravating factor; but that court operated under a pre<em>Blakely </em>regime where the <em>trial judge </em>needed to find the facts supporting the aggravating factor only by a <em>preponderance of the evidence. </em>That holding does not affect our conclusion that we have grave doubt whether a <em>jury </em>could have found the facts supporting the aggravating factor <em>beyond a reasonable doubt.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b468-5\">. The State also argues that Lyons's <em>Blakely </em>claim is waived and non-exhausted. With respect to waiver, relying on <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973), the State contends that Lyons waived his right to have a jury sentence him by pleading guilty. But <em>Tollett </em>only holds that when a defendant pleads guilty, \u201che may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred <em>prior </em>to the entry of the guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602 (emphasis added). Here, the constitutional violation\u2014 the judge finding the aggravating factor by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 occurred <em>after </em>Lyons pleaded guilty. Thus, Lyons did not waive his right to appeal this constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>With respect to exhaustion, the State contends that Lyons failed to exhaust state remedies because he did not seek review of the order denying his post-conviction MAR. In fact, Lyons exhausted his claim by raising it on direct appeal to the Court of Appeals of North Carolina and the Supreme Court of North Carolina, which is sufficient in North Carolina to exhaust a claim for federal habeas purposes. <em>See Skipper v. French, </em>130 F.3d 603, 610 n. 4 (4th Cir. 1997) (holding on federal habeas review of a North Carolina conviction that \"[e]xhaustion principles would not have required\u201d petitioner even to bring a MAR at all, so long as he raised federal claims on direct appeal). Thus, the North Carolina courts had a \"full\u201d and \"fair opportunity\u201d to consider the substance of his claim, so it has been properly exhausted. <em>O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 845, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999); <em>see also Baldwin v. Reese, </em>541 U.S. 27, 29, 32, 124 S.Ct. 1347, 158 L.Ed.2d 64 (2004) (holding that \"[tjo provide the State with the necessary opportunity, the prisoner must fairly present his claim,\u201d and concluding that \u201cfair presentation\u201d requires simply that the prisoner's petition or brief \"alert [the court] to the presence of a federal claim\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b469-7\">TRAXLER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AhL\">concurring in the result:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Because of the concessions made by the State and the fact that I have grave doubt as to the harmlessness of attributing the aggravating circumstance to the appellant, I concur in the result reached by my colleagues.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
