He was sentenced to 120 months on the possession charge and sixty months consecutive for the firearm offense. He now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that the sentence is unreasonable but stating that there are no meritorious issues for review. Alexander was advised of his right to file a supplemental brief; however, he did not file such a brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">We find that Alexander\u2019s sentence, imposed within the properly calculated advisory guideline range and applicable statutory limits, is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and we find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
