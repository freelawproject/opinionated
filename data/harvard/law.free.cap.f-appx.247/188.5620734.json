We granted Melendez a certificate of appealability to consider whether equitable tolling rendered the filing of his petition timely. It does not and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-23\">Melendez argues that he is entitled to have his limitations period equitably tolled because the lawyer who represented him in his state postconviction proceedings mistakenly filed a <em>second </em>petition for state posteonviction relief (a petition that was held untimely under state law) rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>complying with Melendez\u2019s request to file a \u00a7 2254 petition within the period of limitations. Melendez alleges that he diligently pursued this matter with his lawyer, but that his lawyer ignored his requests and did not return his legal papers to him until after AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u201cThis Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a [\u00a7 2254 petition] as time-barred, as well as a district court\u2019s finding that equitable tolling does not apply.\u201d <em>Outler v. United States, </em>485 F.Sd 1273,1278 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">AEDPA imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition and identifies four discrete events that trigger the running of the one-year period. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A)-(D). The district court found that Melendez\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), the only potentially relevant triggering event. Melendez does not challenge that ruling on appeal. Thus, Melendez\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition can be considered timely only if equitable tolling applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Equitable tolling operates to save an otherwise untimely filed \u00a7 2254 petition if the petition was untimely filed \u201cbecause of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond [the petitioner\u2019s] control and unavoidable even with due diligence.\u201d <em>Rainey v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>443 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). Equitable tolling, however, is an extreme remedy and is applied sparingly. <em>See Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir.2002). Melendez bears the burden of showing that equitable tolling is warranted and must demonstrate both (1) diligent efforts to timely file and (2) extraordinary and unavoidable circumstances. <em>See Arthur v. Allen, </em>452 F.3d 1234, 1253 (11th Cir.2006). We have held that \u201can attorney\u2019s miscalculation of the limitations period or mistake is not a basis for equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Steed v. Head,, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Helton v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>259 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir.2001). We have also said that \u201cperiods in which a prisoner is separated from his legal papers are not \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 in which equitable tolling is appropriate.\u201d <em>Dodd v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1273, 1283 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">We conclude that equitable tolling is not warranted in this case because Melendez cannot show extraordinary circumstances. The untimely filing of his \u00a7 2254 petition ultimately resulted from his lawyer\u2019s mistaken belief that the filing of a second state postconviction petition would toll the limitations period under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). That belief turned out to be mistaken because Melendez\u2019s second application for state postconviction relief was dismissed as untimely, and such an untimely application in state court is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d under AEDPA and thus does not toll the limitations period under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>See Webster v. Moore, </em>199 F.3d 1256, 1257 (11th Cir.2000). Our case law establishes that such a \u201cmiscalculation or misinterpretation by [petitioner\u2019s] attorney in interpreting the plain language of the statute does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Steed, </em>219 F.3d at 1300; <em>Helton, </em>259 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">Equally unavailing is Melendez\u2019s argument that he lacked access to his legal papers until after the federal limitations period had expired. Melendez was separated from his legal papers while his lawyer prepared his case for state postconvie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>tion relief, a period of separation that is routine for prisoners with access to legal representation. Even assuming that Melendez\u2019s lawyer failed to return Melendez\u2019s legal papers promptly upon request, it is clear that any such failure was the result of the lawyer\u2019s mistaken belief that filing a second state postconviction petition was the appropriate course of action and would toll AEDPA\u2019s one-year period of limitations. Because a lawyer\u2019s error does not constitute extraordinary circumstances, equitable tolling is not warranted under the circumstances of this case. <em>See Steed, </em>219 F.3d at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing Melendez\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
