We deny Centerline\u2019s petition for review and grant the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">This case arises from an unfair labor practice charge filed on June 25, 2004, against Centerline by the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council of Carpenters, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, AFL-CIO. The charge alleged that Centerline violated section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), by, <em>inter alia, </em>interrogating job applicant Roy Friend and employee Johnny Terrones concerning their union affiliation, and by threatening to never rehire former employees who had accepted work with union contractors. It further alleged that the company violated section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 158(a)(3), (1) by laying off Terrones because of his union affiliation and activity and by refusing to hire Friend and Hally Ashby because of their union affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">After a hearing, an administrative law judge issued a decision and recommended order finding, as is relevant here, that Centerline had violated the Act as alleged with respect to the above charges. The Board subsequently affirmed the judge\u2019s rulings, findings, and conclusions and adopted his remedial order, modifying it only to conform to his findings of unfair labor practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Our review of the record discloses that the Board\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error. <em>See Pirelli Cable Corp. v. NLRB, </em>141 F.3d 503, 514 (4th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we deny the petition on the reasoning of the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED; ORDER ENFORCED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
