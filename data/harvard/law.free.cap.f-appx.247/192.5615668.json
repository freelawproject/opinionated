Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Since the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is mandatory and jurisdictional, it is not subject to equitable tolling. Furthermore, the filing deadline is not suspended or tolled by the fact that [the petitioner] filed a [timely] motion to reopen the removal proceedings ... after issuance of the final order of removal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>371 F.3d 771, 773 n. 3 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The BIA\u2019s final order of removal in this case was filed on February 15, 2006, when the BIA summarily dismissed Sierra-Espita\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a) (providing \u201c[a]n order of removal made by the immigration judge at the conclusion of proceedings under section 240 of the Act shall become final ... [u]pon dismissal of an appeal by the [BIA]\u201d). The BIA denied Sierra-Espita\u2019s motion to reopen on August 3, 2006, and Sierra-Espita did not file a petition for review of that order. Although Sierra-Espita filed a motion for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen, the filing did not toll the limitations period for filing a petition for review in this Court. <em>See Dakane, </em>371 F.3d at 773 n. 3. Sierra-Espita filed his petition for review on December 20, 2006, which was more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal and its denial of his motion to reopen. Accordingly, to the extent Sierra-Espita argues the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relief or denying his motion to reopen, we lack jurisdiction to review the claims because Sierra-Espita did not file timely petitions for review. Hence, the only issue on appeal in this case is whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying Sierra-Espita\u2019s motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In his brief, Sierra-Espita argues he should have received asylum and that the motion to reopen was incorrectly denied, but does not present any arguments regarding the motion to reconsider. By failing to argue the motion to reconsider in his brief, Sierra-Espita has abandoned this issue. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (stating the respondent abandoned his CAT claim because he did not raise it in his brief on appeal). Accordingly, we deny Sierra-Espita\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
