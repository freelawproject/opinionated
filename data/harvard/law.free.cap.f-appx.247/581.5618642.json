California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Oliva-Morales has not filed a response. Although Oliva-Morales has been released from prison and removed from the United States, his appeal is not moot for purposes of our review. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7-12, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Lares-Meraz, </em>452 F.3d 352, 355 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
