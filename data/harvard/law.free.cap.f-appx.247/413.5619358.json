We vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal order and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The PLRA requires that a prisoner exhaust administrative remedies before filing any action under federal law with respect to confinement. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (2000). The PLRA defines a \u201cprisoner\u201d as \u201cany person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The district court concluded that Cofield was incarcerated at the time he submitted his complaint because Cofield signed the complaint on August 10, 2006, but was not released from the Hampton City Jail until September 11, 2006. However, our examination of the record indicates that, although the complaint was signed over a month before Cofield left the Hampton City Jail, the complaint was not submitted and filed until after Cofield was released from incarceration. First, the envelope used to mail the complaint indicates that Cofield\u2019s initial filing was processed by the postal service on September 12, 2006, the day after Cofield was released. Additionally, the complaint was received on September 13, 2006, and was filed by the district court on September 21, 2006. Finally, Cofield\u2019s mailing address, as listed on the envelope and in his complaint, provided a private street address in Newport News, Virginia, while the subject jail is in Hampton City, Virginia. Therefore, we conclude that Cofield was not an inmate of the Hampton City Jail at the time he filed his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Because Cofield was not a prisoner when he filed his complaint, the PLRA exhaustion requirement is not applicable to his \u00a7 1983 action. A former inmate who has been released is no longer \u201cincarcerated or detained\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 1997e(h) and therefore does not qualify as a \u201cprisoner\u201d subject to the PLRA. Furthermore, it is the plaintiffs status at the time he filed the lawsuit that is determinative as to whether the \u00a7 1997e(a) exhaustion requirement applies. <em>See Norion v. City of Marietta, </em>432 F.3d 1145, 1150 (10th Cir.2005) (collecting cases concluding that plaintiff who brings action regarding prison conditions after his release does not have to satisfy PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement). Because Cofield was not incarcerated at the time he filed his \u00a7 1983 action, he was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Accordingly, we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Cofield\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action, and remand for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the' court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-12\"> We express no opinion about the merits of Cofield's claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
