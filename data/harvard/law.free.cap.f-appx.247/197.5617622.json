No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Here, the district court sentenced Anderson to 72 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was above his advisory sentencing guidelines range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Anderson argues that the district court applied an upward departure to his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a) but did not provide an adequate explanation to support this departure, as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(e) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">But the government responds that the district court sentenced Anderson above his advisory guidelines range as a variance, not as a departure; and for that reason, the district court was not required to provide the explanations described by Anderson. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Anderson was sentenced after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We have determined that a higher-than-guidelines sentence is a variance, not an upward departure, in these circumstances: (1) the district court considered the adequacy of its correctly-calculated advisory guidelines range in the light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and evidence presented at the sentencing hearing, and (2) the district court \u201cexercised its <em>post-Booker </em>discretion to impose a reasonable sentence outside the sentencing guidelines range\u201d because the district court concluded that a sentence within the range was inadequate to address a section 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Oct. 26, 2006) (06-7517).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Here, the district court discussed at sentencing that it had to consider the sentencing factors set out at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. The district court did not reference U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 as a reason for Anderson\u2019s sentence; and the district court did not say that it was engaged in an upward departure. The district court acknowledged that Anderson\u2019s sentence exceeded his advisory guidelines range but explained its sentencing decision in the context of the section 3553(a) factors. For example, the district court explained that it was mindful that the public needed to be protected from Anderson. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (listing as a sentencing factor \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d). The district court also discussed that Anderson\u2019s crime involved pointing a firearm at a female store clerk and that other people were in the vicinity of the store being robbed. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1) (discussing \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d as a sentencing factor). In addition, the district court considered Anderson\u2019s \u201ccriminal past.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(listing as a sentencing factor \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court judge was not required to discuss all of the section 3553(a) factors at the sentencing hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Therefore, the district court did not apply an upward departure to Anderson\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3; Anderson\u2019s above-guidelines sentence was a variance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d at 1211-12. And we are not persuaded that the district court \u2014 which explained at the sentencing hearing its reasons for imposing an above-guidelines sentence \u2014 committed reversible error under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) by not including written findings to support Anderson\u2019s sentence in its order of judgment and commitment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We turn to Anderson\u2019s contention that, after <em>Booker, </em>a district court violates the Sixth Amendment by making factual findings that \u201crequire a higher sentence\u201d under the guidelines. It appears that Anderson argues that, by sentencing him above his advisory guidelines range, the district court violated the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 756. Here, the statutory maximum sentence for Anderson\u2019s offense \u2014 to which he pled guilty pursuant to a plea <em>agreement </em>\u2014 was 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). Anderson\u2019s sentence was far below the statutory maximum; no constitutional violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">In sum, Anderson\u2019s sentence was a variance, which is permitted after <em>Booker </em>because the guidelines are \u2014 as the district court recognized \u2014 advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">. About section 3553(c)(2), Anderson contends that the district court should have put written findings justifying its decision to depart in its judgment and commitment order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b220-9\">. Anderson argues that because the district court also discussed that his criminal history category did not adequately reflect his past criminal conduct, the district court applied an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a). But \u2014 based on the entire record of Anderson's sentencing hearing \u2014 the sentence imposed was a variance, not a departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">. We do not consider Anderson\u2019s contention-raised for the first time in his reply brief-that the district court should have provided him with notice that he might be sentenced outside of his guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Whitesell, </em>314 F.3d 1251, 1256 (11th Cir.2002). Even if Anderson had properly raised this argument, we would reject it because the district court was not required to give Anderson advance notice of a variance. <em>See Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d at 1212 (\"After <em>Booker, </em>parties are inherently on notice that the sentencing guidelines range is advisory.... [P]arties cannot claim unfair surprise or inability to present informed comment ... when a district court imposes a sentence above the guidelines range based on the section 3553(a) sentencing factors.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b221-24\">. Anderson has offered no authority indicating that sentencing courts must comply with section 3553(c)(2) in imposing an above-guidelines sentence that was a variance. And even if we were to conclude that the district court should have complied with section 3553(c)(2), Anderson \u2014 who did not raise this issue before the district court \u2014 has not shown harmful error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
