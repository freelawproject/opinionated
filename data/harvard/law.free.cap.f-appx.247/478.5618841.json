Reviewing the record de novo and applying the same standard as the district court, we affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">1. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, an employee must demonstrate that: (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action <em>Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 348 (5th Cir.2007). Fierros has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to meet the third element of this showing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">Fierros has produced no evidence that her 1997 charge of discrimination and the resulting 1999 lawsuit were causally related to her receiving extra paid leave in lieu of a recommended merit pay increase in June 2001. In addition to the lack of temporal proximity between the events, there is no evidence that Fierros was singled out for such a non-monetary merit award. All employees paid from the same budget as Fierros who were recommended for merit pay increases received leave instead, TDH citing a budget shortfall. There is likewise no evidence that Fierros was singled out for placement -within the deficient budget. Further, Fierros received re-classifications with significant pay increases both before and after the merit award, each increase substantially more than the merit raise she would have received had there been funds in the budget in 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">2. Additionally, the alleged $300.00 reduction in pay Fierros asserts as a secondary retaliatory act immediately following her December 2001 charge of discrimination is belied by the record evidence. In the earnings statement summary table first presented in her response to TDH\u2019s motion for summary judgment and then reproduced in appellant\u2019s brief, Fierro erroneously cites her $2,101 regular pay from her January 2002 earnings statement, rather than her total salary (including benefit replacement and longevity pay) as cited for previous months. Fierro\u2019s total salary for January 2002 was $2,415.01, which is in keeping with the $2,421 from the prior month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">3. Finally, we agree with the district court that, even if Fierros had met the prima facie elements of a retaliation claim, she could not survive the remainder of the <em>McDonnell-Danglas </em>burden-shifting analysis. TDH produced a legitimate non-diseriminatory reason for awarding Fierros paid leave rather than a merit raise: a budget shortfall resulting in identical treatment of all similarly-situated employees. Fierros offers no evidence that TDH\u2019s stated reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>its employment action was a pretext for discriminatory animus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
