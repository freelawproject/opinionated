His first contention, which challenges our precedent holding that properly calculated guideline sentences are presumed to be reasonable, fails in light of <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-24\">Murillo-Goches\u2019s second argument is that his sentence is unreasonable because he requested a sentence below the guideline range, but the district court imposed sentence without considering all of his reasons for a lower sentence and without giving sufficient weight to his arguments regarding the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors. More specifically, the errors Murillo-Goches asserts are that the court gave (1) too little weight to his argument that he reentered the United States because he feared for his life in his native El Salvador; (2) too little weight to his concerns that his small size would make him vulnerable in prison; and (3) too much weight to his criminal history. He does not contend that the guideline range was improperly calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-25\">A sentence within a properly calculated guideline range is entitled to great deference. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). In reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>such a sentence, we merely ask whether the district court abused its discretion in' imposing it. <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2465.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">We reject Murillo-Goches\u2019s contentions. Our review of the record does not reveal that the district court failed to address, or improperly balanced, the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Murillo-Goches presented no evidence that his small physical stature and his illegal reentry into the United States to escape gang violence in El Salvador constitute circumstances \u201cspecial enough that, in light of \u00a7 3553(a), they require a sentence lower than the sentence the Guidelines provide.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2470.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in its weighing of Murillo-Goches\u2019s criminal history, including his North Carolina felonies and misdemeanors and his two prior illegal entries into the United States. Murillo-Goches has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Murillo-Goches\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), this court has repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 2874, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">We recently held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625-27 (5th Cir.2007). Galvan-Lozano properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">The judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
