We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-23\">Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (West 2005), this court has no jurisdiction to review \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229b ... of this title.\u201d In view of these statutory limitations, we lack jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s determination that Tiatco failed to establish \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to her mother. <em>See Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 132, 134-36 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Martinez-Maldonado v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 679, 682 (7th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Cir.2006); <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005). The petition for review is dismissed as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">An exception to section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s jurisdictional ban exists for \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005), \u201carising from the agency\u2019s decision to deny discretionary relief.\u201d <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 480 (4th Cir.2006). Tiateo asserts that the immigration judge\u2019s denial of a continuance to allow her to arrange for her mother\u2019s presence at the hearing violated her constitutionally protected due process rights. An alien must be given \u201can opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner, i.e., [to] receive a full and fair hearing on [her] claims.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 321-22 (4th Cir.2002). An alien must establish not only that a violation occurred but also that she suffered prejudice from the violation. <em>Id. </em>at 320. Prejudice requires that the violation was likely to affect the results of the hearing. <em>Jean, </em>435 F.3d at 484. Having reviewed the administrative record in this case, we conclude that Tiatco did not establish that the immigration judge\u2019s denial of a continuance denied her due process. The petition for review is denied as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part Tiatco\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
