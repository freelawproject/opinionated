Violations of Louisiana statutes setting filing fees and deprivation of constitutional rights are claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Partial summary judgment was awarded on two bases: seven of the state actions underlying the claims were prescribed by state law; and punitive damages were not available against the clerks of court because they were sued in their official capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Todd v. AIG Life Ins. Co., </em>47 F.3d 1448, 1451 (5th Cir.1995). Such judgment is proper if the summary-judgment evidence \u201cshow[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\u201d. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In making this determination, we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant. <em>Id. </em>at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505. Conclusory allegations and naked assertions, however, are not sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>Fontenot v. Upjohn Co., </em>780 F.2d 1190, 1195-96 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court, the partial summary judgment was proper. Concerning prescription, the constitutional torts claimed are most similar to a general tort under Louisiana law, which has a one-year prescriptive period. <em>Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of the State of New York v. Tomauio, </em>446 U.S. 478, 483, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980) (because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lacks its own prescriptive period, federal courts apply that of the most analogous state-law cause of action); La. Civ. C. Art. 3492 (providing one-year prescription for general torts).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Summary judgment for punitive damages against the clerks of court was proper because such damages would necessarily be paid from clerk of court funds. <em>See City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., </em>453 U.S. 247, 267-71, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
