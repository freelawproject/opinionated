Gregory alleged violation of his civil rights arising out of medical treatment he received for a right wrist injury sustained on September 10, 2004, claiming the medical care he received was negligent, inadequate, and involved numerous delays, and resulted in permanent damage to his wrist. We conclude the district court properly granted Defendants\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s adverse grant of summary judgment, and we construe the facts in the light most favorable to Gregory, the non-moving party. <em>See Laber v. Harvey, </em>438 F.3d 404, 415 (4th Cir.2006) (en banc). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Laber, </em>438 F.3d at 415 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain proscribed by the Eighth Amendment. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). \u201cDeliberate indifference may be demonstrated by either actual intent or reckless disregard.\u201d <em>Miltier v. Beam, </em>896 F.2d 848, 851 (4th Cir.1990). An Eighth Amendment violation occurs where treatment is \u201cso grossly incompetent, inadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>We find Gregory\u2019s claims subject to dismissal on the ground that Gregory failed to allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful so as to demonstrate deliberate indifference. Specifically, Gregory claims negligence, medical malpractice, and disagreement with medical treatment, which claims do not support relief under \u00a7 1983. <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 106, 97 S.Ct. 285; <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 849 (4th Cir.1985). We find no facts in the record to suggest that Defendants acted with the necessary state of mind to support a viable \u00a7 1983 claim. Review of the record reveals that Gregory was seen by medical staff the day of his injury, was referred to an orthopaedic hand specialist in an outside emergency room facility within four days of his initial injury, was ultimately provided with surgery on October 22, 2004, after less-intrusive means of treatment failed, and was seen approximately twenty-four times for treatment of his injury (including consultations with orthopaedic and neurological specialists) through December 28, 2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, Gregory received approximately 105 physical therapy treatments beginning on November 17, 2004, and lasting through mid-November 2005. This uncontradicted evidence belies Gregory\u2019s claims of deliberate indifference.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Accordingly, we deny Gregory\u2019s motion to dismiss, and affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Gregory\u2019s action. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\">. That Gregory\u2019s surgery was rescheduled twice because his treatment was twice transferred to a different medical provider does not support a deliberate indifference claim, and the only evidence to support Gregory's allegations that his injury became worse due to Defendants\u2019 actions or inactions are his own, unsubstantiated allegations, which are insufficient to withstand summary judgment. <em>See Ash v. United. Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>800 F.2d 409, 411-12 (4th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-24\">. While Defendants also asserted that Gregory failed properly to exhaust his administrative claims, we find that, even assuming exhaustion, Gregory\u2019s claims fell short of establishing deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs protected against by the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
