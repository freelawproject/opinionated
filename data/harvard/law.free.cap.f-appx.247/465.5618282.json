He now appeals his 72-month guideline sentence. Roberts argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court imposed a sentence that it felt was harsh without conducting an extensive analysis of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He also argues that the presumption that such a sentence is reasonable violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Under this court\u2019s precedent, a sentence within a properly-calculated guidelines range, like the one here, is presumptively reasonable, <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005), and Roberts hasn\u2019t overcome that presumption. Because an intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling prior precedent is required to alter this court\u2019s precedent, the grant of certiorari in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006) has no impact on the presumption, <em>see United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999), as Roberts recognizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In any event, the record shows that the district court thoroughly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determined that a deviation therefrom was not warranted by the facts of the case, even though in its sentencing memorandum it devoted little space explicitly to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Consequently, Roberts has not demonstrated that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519-20.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-10\">. Roberts argued to the district court that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4(a)(2) should apply, not \u00a7 2A3.1. The court applied \u00a7 2A3.1. On appeal, Roberts mentions this issue only in one sentence, in his summary of the argument, stating that the court erred in applying \u00a7 2A3.1. Consequently, he has waived the argument. <em>See United States v. Thibodeaux, </em>211 F.3d 910, 912 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
