The district court granted Marshall a certificate of appealability (COA) on the following issues: whether counsel was ineffective for (1) allowing the jury to hear Detective Calvin Brazley\u2019s hearsay testimony regarding the substance of an anonymous tip; (2) failing to investigate, interview, and secure witnesses; and (3) failing to investigate and find impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-24\">Marshall\u2019s brief is devoid of discussion of the issues on which the district court granted him a COA. Marshall alleges that he is unable to address the merits of his ineffective assistance claims because he was required to leave behind his legal materials when he was evacuated from the Orleans Parish Prison during Hurricane Katrina. The record discloses, however, that despite the unavailability of his legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>materials, Marshall nevertheless sufficiently objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation concerning the three ineffective assistance issues on which he was ultimately granted a COA. The record further discloses that Marshall\u2019s request for a free copy of the record was granted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Marshall did not wait for this court to rule on his request for a free copy of the record before asking that a pleading devoid of discussion of the ineffective assistance issues be filed as his merits brief. Based on the preceding, we hold that his failure to brief the issues on which COA was granted renders them abandoned. <em>Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
