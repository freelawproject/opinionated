After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">While on routine counter-drug patrol with the United States Coast Guard (\u201cUSCG\u201d), the British Naval Vessel HMS Southhampton spotted a possible target, the M/V Rampage, a Panamanian-flagged vessel. Pursuant to a consent to board agreement, the USCG team boarded the vessel and discovered 118 bales of cocaine, weighing 3,393.4 kilograms. Defendant Alvarado-Forbes was one of five crew members on board and was the vessel\u2019s motorman.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned Alvarado-Forbes a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3) and (c)(1), based on the 3,393.4 kilograms of cocaine found on the vessel.. The PSI reduced Alvarado-Forbes\u2019s offense level by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(9), because Alvarado-Forbes met the safety-valve criteria, and by three levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b), for acceptance of responsibility. With a total offense level of 33 and a criminal history category of I, the PSI recommended an advisory guidelines range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">At sentencing, Alvarado-Forbes objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a mitigating-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The district court overruled his objection, noting that \u201c3393.4 kilograms of cocaine is no small amount.\u201d The district court concluded that Alvarado-Forbes was an \u201caverage participant\u201d in the drug importation conspiracy and that there was no basis for a mitigating-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The district court adopted the PSI and imposed an 135-month sentence. Alvarado-Forbes filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">On appeal, Alvarado-Forbes argues that the district court erred by denying him a minor or minimal-role reduction because he was merely a mariner on the vessel and not an organizer or leader.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. A minimal participant is one who \u201cplays a minimal role in concerted activity\u201d and \u201cis intended to cover defendants who are plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4. The defendant has the burden to establish his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In determining whether a minor-role reduction applies, the district court considers two principles: (1) the defendant\u2019s role in the offense compared to the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his base offense level; and (2) the defendant\u2019s role compared to that of other participants in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 940-45. When relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to his actual conduct, he cannot prove that he is entitled to a minor-role adjustment simply by pointing to a broader scheme for which he was not held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 941. Furthermore, \u201cin the drug courier context, ... the amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct .... [and] may be dispositive \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 in the extreme case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in denying Alvarado-Forbes a minor-role reduction. Under the first prong of <em>De Varon, </em>the district court held Alvarado-Forbes accountable only for his actual conduct of participating in the smuggling of the 3,393.4 of cocaine on the M/V Rampage. He was not held accountable for a broader drug conspiracy. In addition, the substantial amount of cocaine on the vessel was a material consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">Under the second prong of <em>De Varon, </em>Alvarado-Forbes was at least as culpable as the other members of the vessel\u2019s crew who participated in the smuggling conspiracy. Alvarado-Forbes claims on appeal that his sole purpose on the vessel was \u201cto be a live body on a boat\u201d and \u201cto make the vessel look like a fishing vessel.... \u201d Alvarado-Forbes failed to present any evidence to support this claim at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Trainor, </em>376 F.3d 1325, 1334 n. 5 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[A] defendant must provide evidence regarding mitigating circumstances to support a district court\u2019s downward departure.\u201d). Furthermore, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this was Alvarado-Forbes\u2019s purpose on the vessel, it would not make him a minor participant because concealing the illegal nature of the vessel\u2019s cargo would be vital to the success of the smuggling scheme.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">Alvarado-Forbes also complains that the district court did not consider on the record all of the factors listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1) through (4) relating to Alvarado-Forbes\u2019s relevant conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch.3, pt. B, introductory cmt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>(\u201cThe determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is to be made on the basis of all conduct with the scope of \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), <em>ie., </em>all conduct included under \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)-(4), and not solely on the basis of elements and acts cited in the count of conviction.\u201d). However, there is no requirement that the district court explicitly consider on the record all relevant conduct falling within U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)\u2014(4). <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940 (\u201c[A] district court is not required to make any specific findings other than the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\">.
