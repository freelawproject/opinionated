Wheeler, Texas prisoner # 731348, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action against various Texas Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>of Criminal Justice officers and medical personnel as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Wheeler argues on appeal that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his need for psychiatric care concerning his uncontrollable thoughts of escape. However, Wheeler has not shown that \u201cthe officials refused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Wheeler does not, as he did in the district court, make any specific claims concerning any officials acting in their supervisory capacity or any deliberate indifference claims concerning his placement in the hoe squad. Because he has not briefed these claims, they are waived. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Wheeler also argues that his First Amendment rights were violated when he was prevented from using a telephone to call his family for one year. However, because Wheeler has not alleged any physical injury, nor has he requested declaratory or injunctive relief concerning this claim, it is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 374-75 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Wheeler contends that his due process rights were violated at a disciplinary hearing because (1) his mental health concerns, including his concerns under the Americans with Disabilities Act, were not taken into account; (2) he was not given notice that an 1-60 such as the one he submitted would result in disciplinary action; and (3) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. Wheeler argues that the district court erred in determining that his claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because he was sentenced under Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 508.149 and thus could not recover good-time credits. Regardless whether Wheeler\u2019s claims were barred under <em>Heck, </em>the district court did not err in dismissing his claims because he did not have a liberty interest in any of the rights of which he was deprived at the hearing. <em>See Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 958-59 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that 30-day loss of cell and commissary privileges does not implicate due process concerns); <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 508 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 767-68 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Luken v. Scott, </em>71 F.3d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Wheeler\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wheeler\u2019s complaint as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Wheeler is warned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
