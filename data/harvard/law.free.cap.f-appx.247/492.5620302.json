Lang alleged that the defendants failed to abate a known risk of violence and failed to provide him with adequate medical attention for injuries from an assault. The district court dismissed the suit as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), finding that Lang had failed to exhaust his prison administrative remedies, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), with respect to inadequate-medical-treatment claim and that Lang had failed to allege more than a de minimis injury, as required by \u00a7 1997e(e), for civil actions alleging mental or emotional injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">A district court may dismiss a complaint as frivolous \u201c \u2018where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 31-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992) (quoting <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989)). Because the district court dismissed as frivolous for failing to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1997e(e), this court should review the dismissal de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">With respect to exhaustion, the district court\u2019s determination that Lang failed to exhaust his administrative remedies was premature because exhaustion is an affirmative defense that must be raised by the defendant. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 910, 921, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). With respect to the failure-to-protect claim, Lang\u2019s pleadings were sufficient to allege conditions of incarceration that posed a substantial risk of serious harm to which prison officials were deliberately indifferent. <em>See Neals v. Norwood, </em>59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995). The district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-17\">We do not consider Lang\u2019s assertion that it is wrong for prison officials to collect filing fees from his prisoner account because it was not raised below. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
