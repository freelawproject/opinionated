After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b222-19\">While on routine counter-drug patrol with the United States Coast Guard (\u201cUSCG\u201d), a British Navy vessel detected a Panamanian-flagged vessel as a possible target of interest. The USCG boarded the vessel and seized a total of 118 bales of cocaine (3,393.4 kilograms of cocaine). Five crew members were found on board, including the captain, two seamen, a motorman and defendant Panesso-Murillo, who was the chief engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-20\">At his change-of-plea hearing, Panesso-Murillo acknowledged that while working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>on board the vessel headed for Mexico, the captain told him that they were going to pick up cocaine. Panesso-Murillo agreed to be paid $60,000 for his participation in the plan. During the hearing, the government noted that two other individuals found on the vessel were not arrested. One of these individuals was not involved in the conspiracy to distribute drugs and the other was providing information to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) held Panesso-Murillo accountable for 3,398.4 kilograms of cocaine and assigned a base offense level of 38 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). The PSI reduced Panesso-Murillo\u2019s offense level by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(9), because Panesso-Murillo met the safety-valve criteria, and by three levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b), for acceptance of responsibility. With a total offense level of 33 and a criminal history category of I, the PSI recommended an advisory guidelines range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Panesso-Murillo objected to the PSI because, <em>inter alia, </em>it did not recommend a minor-role reduction. The district court overruled his objection, stating that Panes-so-Murillo was not any less culpable than any of the other participants in the conspiracy, other than the captain who received a role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Panesso-Murillo argued for a below-advisory guidelines range sentence of 97 months\u2019 imprisonment. In support, Panesso-Murillo pointed out that he had a ninth grade education, had no history of drug importation and had taught himself how to be a mechanic. In response to Panesso-Murillo\u2019s argument that he had never done anything like the instant offense, the district court stated that Panes-so-Murillo was better educated than most of the defendants that came before the court and that Panesso-Murillo \u201cshould have known better.\u201d When Panesso-Murillo argued that the need for deterrence was lessened because Panesso-Murillo would be subject to deportation following his sentence, the district court responded that Panesso-Murillo\u2019s sentence could possibly deter future crew members from engaging in similar conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Before hearing from Panesso-Murillo directly, the district court noted, among other things, that Panesso-Murillo was 48 years old; had a ninth grade education; had obtained a diesel engineering certification; was the father of four children; was born in Cartagena, Colombia; and had siblings living in Colombia. The district court also stated that, in an effort to make money, Panesso-Murillo had made the \u201cwrong decision\u201d while on board the vessel, unlike two of the seven people on board who had chosen not to be a part of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The district court then heard Panesso-Murillo\u2019s statement of remorse, in which Panesso-Murillo suggested that he had committed the crime against his will. The district court questioned Panesso-Murillo about this statement and confirmed that Panesso-Murillo had willfully and voluntarily agreed to the conspiracy. The district court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">I know your attorney has been over this with you but I wanted you to hear that from me. What happened on board that boat to all the people involved I don\u2019t know because I wasn\u2019t there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-12\">Why the other people on board the vessel may or may not have been charged may have occurred for a variety of reasons. Those people may have been able to convince law enforcement that they were not part of the conspiracy and the possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-13\">There may have been other reasons why they were not charged. I don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>know. But what has come to me before your words were that you admitted your guilt to Judge Wilson. And that you agreed to do this....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The district court determined that Panesso-Murillo\u2019s total offense level was 33, his criminal history category was I, and his advisory guidelines range was 135 to 168 months. The district court denied Panesso-Murillo\u2019s request for a downward variance from the advisory guidelines range and imposed a 135-month sentence on each count, to be served concurrently. In so doing, the district court noted that it had considered the advisory guidelines as well as the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Panesso-Murillo filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">A. Minor-Role Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Panesso-Murillo contends the district court erred in denying him a minor-role reduction because he did not assist in loading the drugs on the boat and had no equity interest in the drugs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. The defendant has the burden of establishing his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>Two principles guide a district court\u2019s consideration: (1) the court must compare the defendant\u2019s role in the offense with the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his base offense level; and (2) the court may compare the defendant\u2019s conduct to that of other participants involved in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 940-45. When relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to his actual conduct, he cannot prove that he is entitled' to a minor-role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader scheme for which he was not held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in refusing Panesso-Murillo a minor-role reduction. Under the first prong of <em>De Varon, </em>the district court held Panesso-Murillo accountable for only his own conduct, namely his involvement in the transport of 3,393.4 kilograms of cocaine, a large quantity of drugs. Under the second prong of <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>Panesso-Murillo was at least as culpable as his crewmates who participated in the transportation scheme.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, as the vessel\u2019s chief engineer, it could be argued that his role was more vital to the enterprise than those of his crewmates. Although Panesso-Murillo\u2019s role may have been less than that of the vessel\u2019s captain, who was given a role enhancement, this fact does not automatically entitle Panesso-Murillo to a minor-role reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">B. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">Panesso-Murillo also contends that his 135-month sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to sufficiently consider his arguments in mitigation and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>a district court in determining a reasonable sentence must consider the correctly calculated advisory guidelines range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. 543 U.S. 220, 258-64, 125 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>738, 764-67, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We review the ultimate sentence imposed for unreasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the reasons given by the district court. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2006). The party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We cannot say that Panes so-Murillo\u2019s 135-month sentence, at the low end of the correctly calculated advisory guidelines range, is unreasonable. The district court stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in arriving at Panesso-Murillo\u2019s sentence, and it was not required to address each \u00a7 3553(a) factor explicitly. Furthermore, a review of the record reflects that the district court considered Panesso-Murillo\u2019s arguments with respect the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, Panesso-Murillo\u2019s characteristics and history and the need for deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-10\">. We review a district court's determination of the defendant's role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937-38 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-11\">. Panesso-Murillo emphasizes that there were other individuals on the vessel who were not arrested, but there is no evidence in the record that Panesso-Murillo was less culpable than these individuals.
