Henry, </em>and administratively closing the case. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-26\">In a habeas corpus petition, Carlton challenged the application of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14135a (2000) and the subsequent amendment by The Justice For All Act, which extended the reach of the Act to any person convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>The district court denied Carlton\u2019s motion for injunctive relief in which he sought an order prohibiting the Bureau of Prisons from taking a blood sample in order to have his DNA. We find the court did not abuse its discretion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Insofar as Carlton appeals that part of the district court order staying a final determination until this court issues an opinion in <em>Trolinger v. Henry, </em>234 Fed.Appx. 147 (4th Cir.2007) (unpublished), we are without jurisdiction. The federal courts of appeals are courts of limited jurisdiction, <em>Baird v. Palmer, </em>114 F.3d 39, 42 (4th Cir.1997), and may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000). Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). A final decision is one that \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945). We are obligated to review our jurisdiction sua sponte in all cases. <em>Maksymchuk v. Frank, </em>987 F.2d 1072, 1075 (4th Cir.1993). Because the district court order contemplated further action after this court acted in another appeal, the order was not a final order, nor was the decision to stay a final determination an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal from that part of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We affirm the denial of injunctive relief and dismiss that part of the appeal from the district court order staying a final determination and administratively closing the case. We also deny Carlton\u2019s motion for a reconsideration of the court\u2019s order denying his motion for a stay. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
