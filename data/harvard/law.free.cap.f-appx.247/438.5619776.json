Having reviewed Stewart\u2019s claims, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-21\">Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (West 2005), \u201cwe have no jurisdiction to review a final order of removal of an alien removable for having committed an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Ramtulla v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 202, 203 (4th Cir.2002). We do, however, retain jurisdiction to review the factual determinations that trigger the applicability of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) \u2014 that Stewart is an alien and that he was convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (West 2005), \u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d The immigration judge found that the Department of Homeland Security established by clear and convincing evidence that Stewart is a Jamaican citizen. Upon reviewing the record, we conclude that this finding is not unreasonable. <em>See Markovski v. Gonzales, </em>486 F.3d 108, 110 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cAn agency\u2019s factual determinations are conclusive unless unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-22\">Because we find that Stewart\u2019s alienage and conviction were established below, we have jurisdiction to review only constitutional claims and questions of law. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>Mbea v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 276, 278 n. 1 (4th Cir.2007). Stewart has raised three such claims, but each lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">First, we find no due process violation in the denial of a sixth continuance. Stewart was given ample opportunity to be heard in a meaningful time and manner. <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 321-22 (4th Cir.2002). Due process did not require the immigration judge to continue Stewart\u2019s proceedings pending resolution of the collateral challenge to his conviction. <em>See Grageda v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 919, 921 (9th Cir.1993). Second, Stewart\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishment claim fails because the Eighth Amendment does not apply to deportation and removal proceedings. <em>Fong Yue Ting v. United States, </em>149 U.S. 698, 730, 13 S.Ct. 1016, 37 L.Ed. 905 (1893); <em>Elia v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 268, 276 (6th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2019, 164 L.Ed.2d 779 (2006). Third, Stewart alleges that 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) (2000), the statute defining aggravated felonies under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), is unconstitutionally overbroad because the definition can include misdemeanors under state law. We need not address this issue, however, because Stewart is removable based on his conviction for burglary in the first degree, a felony under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
