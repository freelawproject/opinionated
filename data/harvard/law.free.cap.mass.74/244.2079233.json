It was also in evidence that the plaintiff did not appear at the time and places named in the citation, and that the debtor took the oath and received his discharge; and afterwards, within ninety days from his commitment, went without the jail limits; and did not surrender. himself according to the bond. <em>Huntington, </em>J. ruled that the citation was insufficient, and the discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>invalid.

Hence a defective notice has always been held fatal to the validity of the discharge. There may have been some relaxation in the application of the rule, but the principle has always been adhered to. Though no precise form of notice is required, yet it must substantially state the case in reference to which the party is summoned to show cause why the poor debtors\u2019 oath should not be administered. In the c\u00e1se before us, there was a substantial misrecital of the demand upon which the debtor was committed, and from which he contends he was discharged by virtue of the proceedings before the magistrate. The notice to the plaintiff was, that the debtor having been committed \u201con an execution issued from the court of common pleas at Lowell within and for the county of Middle-sex,\u201d was desirous to take the oath prescribed by law for the relief of poor debtors; whereas the plaintiff\u2019s execution, upon which the debtor was committed, issued from the court of common pleas holden at Boston within and for the county of Suffolk. This was a misdescription, and substantially variant from the real execution upon which he was committed; and the notice was therefore insufficient to authorize the administration of the poor debtors\u2019 oath, and the discharge of the debtor. The defence relied upon cannot avail the parties to the prison bond, and judgment must therefore be entered upon the verdict for the plaintiff. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
