The parties submitted the following case to the decision of the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-13\">The building in question was erected in 1836, by the Cabot-ville Mechanics\u2019 Association, which was a voluntary association, formed for this purpose, having a written constitution and bylaws, and records of stock and of notes, and whose stock was issued to the subscribers, (most of whom were members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>tenants\u2019 society,) in proportion to their subscriptions. The upper part of the building was fitted up as a church, and has since been occupied by the tenants, paying no rent, and applying the rents of pews for preaching. The rent of the shops in the lower part of the building has been received by the treasurer of the Mechanics\u2019 Association, and paid over to their stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-5\">On the 17th of January 1837, the building and land wer conveyed by John Chase to John Chase and four others, \u201c trustees of said association, in trust for the stockholders of the Cabotville Mechanics\u2019 Association, their heirs and assigns,\u201d <em>habendum </em>\u201c to the said stockholders, their heirs and assigns.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-6\">The four demandants, either as original subscribers or by purchase, own all the shares in that association. One of them is John Chase, one of the original trustees; and Austin Chapin, another of the demandants, is the grantee by several conveyances of the title of each of them of the other four trustees.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-7\"><em>J. </em>Wells, for the demandants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avs\">The deed from John Chase to himself and others, trustees, \u201c in trust for the stockholders of the Cabotville Mechanics\u2019 Association,\u201d vested the legal title in the \u201c stockholders \u201d \u2014 provided they were capable of taking the title. <em>Sammes\u2019s case, </em>13 Co. 54. <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Wheeler, 7 </em>Mass. 189. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>9 Mass. 514. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>12 Pick. 152. <em>Earle </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>8 Cush. 430. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Sanger, 4 </em>Gray, 84. 1 Hilliard on Real Property, c. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 11 <em>&amp; seq. </em>\u201c Stockholders \u201d (with the aid of the subscription or contract of association) is a sufficient designation of the persons beneficially interested, to enable them to take the legal title. <em>Shaw </em>v <em>Loud, </em>12 Mass. 447. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Leonard, 1 </em>Pick. 27. <em>Thomas </em>v <em>Marshfield, </em>10 Pick. 364.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-8\">If the title of the demandants is merely equitable, they may maintain ejectment upon it and their prior possession. <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>7 Mass. 189. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>15 Mass. 209. <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Hopkins Academy, </em>14 Pick. 240. <em>North Bridgewater Congregational Society </em>v.

The demandants are entitled to recover the whole estate against strangers to their title, although the evidence does not show the transfer of all the shares of the original trustees to them. <em>Benedict </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>10 Met. 223.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-5\"><em>H.

The <em>habendum </em>\u201c to the said stockholders, their heirs and assigns,\u201d created no other estate in the stockholders, different from what they acquired under the grant to the trustees, in the premises of the deed. 4 Cruise Dig. tit. 32, <em>c. </em>21, \u00a7\u00a7 67-77. <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>8 Mass. 174.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">As joint trustees, the original grantees under the deed of January 17th 1837 had an equal power, interest and authority in and over the trust estate; and, if they had any power to convey, all must join in any conveyance of their legal interest in the trust estate. They had no separate legal interest of their own on which their separate deeds would operate.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6F\">The sole question in this case is that of legal title. The four demandants claim title to the premises on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>own seisin ; the tenants traverse by their plea of nul disseisin; and thus the question of legal title is raised. But the demandants do not hold jointly; two of them seem to have no other title than as stockholders in an association not incorporated, called the Cabotville Mechanics\u2019 Association, having themselves no other interest than that of <em>cestuis que trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">As a general rule, trustees, not for a charity or public trust, must join in holding or conveying trust property for the preservation of the trust, and separate conveyances by each of his aliquot part or separate share will be void. If the trust is apparent on the deed, all who take under it will take subject to such trust. That was the case here. These demandants do not show any legal estate. Two of them are <em>cestuis que </em>trust, or assignees or grantees of <em>cestuis que trust, </em>as shareholders in the stock of the voluntary unincorporated association known as the Cabotville Mechanics\u2019 Association. This is not a case in which it could be pretended that the use was within the statute of uses, so that the use was vested by force of the statute, and constituted an estate in fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">If it is asked, what remedy the demandants have, who hold various shares in the joint stock of this unincorporated association ; the answer is, by bill in equity, if they have any beneficial interest in the estate, requiring the trustees to execute their trust by effecting a partition or sale, so as to secure to each the proceeds of his beneficial interest. It may be that the trusts in favor of the Universalist Society, or others, have priority to those of these shareholders, so that they have no valuable beneficial interest, and of course no remedy. But at all events they do not show that legal title necessary to maintain this action. <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Hallett, </em>6 Cush. 407. <em>Demandants nonsuit.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
