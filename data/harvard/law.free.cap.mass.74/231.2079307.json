The case was submitted to the superior court of Suffolk on the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-12\">On the 20th of January 1855, the defendant executed to u Mary Casey, wife of Cornelius Casey,\u201d a deed for the conveyance of certain land in East Boston to her upon the payment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>her of certain sums of money; and at the same time received from her the first instalment of such purchase money, (which was the money now suev for,) and gave her a receipt therefor. Said money was in fact taken by the wife from a savings bank in Boston, where it had been deposited by her in her own name. The plaintiff was at that time serving out a sentence in the house of correction, and was ignorant of the transaction between his wife and the defendant, and never received the bond, which was left for record by his wife in the Suffolk registry. The plaintiff\u2019s wife, during the negotiations for the estate, and at the time of payment, always declared to the defendant that the money was her own. She has since declared that it was her husband\u2019s, left in her hands by him. Neither the plaintiff nor his wife has had possession of the estate. The plaintiff, on the 7th of February 1855, gave notice to the defendant that he disaffirmed the transaction, and that the bond had never been delivered to him, but might be found and received by the defendant at the registry of deeds; and demanded of the defendant the money paid to him- by the plaintiff\u2019s wife as aforesaid. The defendant refused to comply with this demand, and therefor this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">The superior court gave judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-6\"><em>J.

Even if the plaintiff\u2019s wife had not her husband\u2019s consent to dispose of the money deposited by her, yet if the defendant, not knowing that she had no right to dispose of it, gave her a valuable consideration for it, the plaintiff cannot recover it. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>14 N.

He has no legal interest in it. If he had died without assenting or dissenting, his wife could have enforced it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b241-5\">Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az4\">The judgment of the superior court, in favor of the plaintiff, brought before this court by appeal, on the facts agreed, must be affirmed. The defendant knew that the persoi who paid him the money was a married woman, and wife of the plaintiff. It is so recited in his bond. The money paid to him by the plaintiff\u2019s wife, as the law then stood, was <em>prima facie </em>the plaintiff\u2019s money; and being bound to know the law, it must be assumed that the defendant knew it. The defendant acted on the belief that the wife had the authority of the husband for what she did; had that been so, he would have been safe, but on the proof the fact was otherwise. We cannot distinguish it from the recent cases of <em>Ames </em>v. Chew, 5 Met. 320, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Davis, 9 Cush. 283. The transaction having occurred before the <em>St. </em>of 1855, <em>c. </em>304, it is not affected by the provisions of that act. <em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
