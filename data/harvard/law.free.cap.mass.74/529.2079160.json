Sts. c. 39, \u00a7 53, to recover a deficiency of assessments, after selling the defendant\u2019s shares for payment of the same. A demurrer filed by the defendant was overruled, and the case remitted to the court of common pleas. 4 Gray, 61. The defendant then answered, denying the validity of the assessment, and the regularity of the plaintiffs\u2019 proceedings, in various particulars which he pointed out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-10\">He also filed interrogatories, under <em>St. </em>1852, c. 312, \u00a7\u00a7 61-72, to Edward Dickinson, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 directors, and to John S. Adams, their treasurer and clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-11\">Dickinson answered some of the interrogatories to him, and declined to answer others, on the ground that they related to matters not in issue upon the pleadings. The court then passed a general order that he should make further answers; and he accordingly made additional answers upon the several matters inquired of, (a particular statement of which is not necessary to the understanding of the questions of law decided,) in some instances, however, making a single answer to several interrogatories upon one subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-12\">Adams declined to comply with a request, contained in one of the interrogatories to him, to file with the clerk of the court the records, documents and papers in his possession, belonging to the plaintiffs, and inquired for by the defendant; or otherwise to exhibit them to the defendant\u2019s inspection, except by order and under direction of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The defendant moved for a nonsuit, for the failure of 1he plaintiffs\u2019 officers fully to answer the interrogatories. Upon the hearing on this motion, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that said director would, if desired by the defendant\u2019s counsel, add to his answers an affidavit that they contained all that he knew upon the matters inquired of; and that the treasurer was willing to exhibit to the defendant\u2019s counsel, at any time, at the office of the corporation, their books and papers, and to give all the information in his power in relation thereto. But the defendant insisted on his motion for a nonsuit, and <em>Morris, </em>J. granted it. The plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-4\"><em>E. Dickinson, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-5\"><em>S. T. Spaulding, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOl\">compared the interrogatories and answers, and argued that the plaintiffs were rightly nonsuited,</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-6\">1st. Because Dickinson had not answered the interrogatories to him, as he was bound to do by <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>312, \u00a7\u00a7 61, 63, 66, 67, 72; and especially had not answered \u201c each interrogatory separately and fully,\u201d as required by \u00a7 67.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-7\">2d. Because Adams had refused to file the records and documents asked for by the interrogatories, as he should have done, under \u00a7\u00a7 61, 68.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b538-8\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgU\">There was, in our judgment, no sufficient ground for the nonsuit of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">1. The amended answers of Mr. Dickinson, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 directors, indicate to us no purpose on his part of avoiding his duty. They are substantial answers to all the interrogatories put. If the defendant objected to any of the answers as not full and clear, he should have filed his motion, setting forth his objections to the answers, and praying that they should be made more full and clear. Upon the consideration of such motion and inspection of the answers, the presiding judge must determine and direct which of the interrogatories require further and fuller answers. And for the refusal or neglect of the party to make such further and fuller answers, a nonsuit or default may be entered. <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>312, \u00a7\u00a7 70-72. It would expose parties to great peril if, after a general order to make further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>answers, and a compliance with such order in good faith, they could be nonsuited or defaulted because some imperfection could still be discovered in some of the answers made.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">2. As to the answers of the treasurer and clerk, we are of opinion that the practice act gave to the defendant no such power over the books and papers of the plaintiff corporation as is claimed in his interrogatories and request to the clerk and treasurer. When this officer submitted himself to the direction of the court, the defendant should have applied to the presiding judge for an order to inspect the books and papers of the corporation. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
