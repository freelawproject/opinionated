Gray.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b251-5\">An action on the Rev. Sts. c. 60, \u00a7 12, to recover back money lost at gaming, cannot be maintained by the loser after the expiration of three months from the loss.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-6\">Action of contract by a loser of money at gaming, on th Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>50, \u00a7 12, which provide that any \u201cperson, losing money at gaming and paying it to the winner, may sue for and recover such money, in an action for money had and received to the use of the plaintiff, or he may bring a special action on the case therefor ; and if the person, so losing said money, shall not, within three months after such loss, without coercion or collusion, prosecute with effect for such money, it shall be lawful for any other person to sue for and recover treble the value of such money, with full costs of suit, in an action of debt, the one moiety to the use of the person so prosecuting, and the other moiety to the use of the Commonwealth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-7\">At the trial in the superior court of Suffolk at January term 1856, <em>Abbott, </em>J. ruled that this action could not be maintained, because it was not commenced until more than three months after the money was lost by the plaintiff and won by the defendant. A verdict was taken for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-8\"><em>W. L. Burt, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-9\">No counsel appeared for the defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b251-10\">Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW__\">The Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>50, \u00a7 12, differ from tire previous <em>St. </em>of 1785, <em>c. </em>58, in not expressly limiting the right of action of the loser to three months; but we are of opinion that such a limitation must be implied from the other provisions of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">The Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>50, \u00a7 12, give a right of action to the loser exclusively for his own benefit, and time enough to bring it but if he does not, then a right is given to the person who maj sue <em>qui tam, </em>to recover three times the amount lost, one half to his own use, and one half to the use of the Commonwealth \u2014 a right utterly inconsistent with that of the loser. The loser has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>no right at common law to recover back of the winner the money lost at gaming; the statute is an enabling act, and the proceedings of the plaintiff must follow it strictly. After three months, the right of action is vested in other persons, to other uses; and not being concurrent, the right of action of the loser is by necessary implication devested. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
