No other buildings within four rods except the ice-house.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-9\">Answer: the existence of a carriage-house adjoining the wood-house, and of other buildings within four rods of the premises, not disclosed in the application; and the use of the premises for keeping straw; all of which increased the risk. Trial in the court of common pleas in Hampden at October term 1856, before <em>Bishop, </em>J., who, after verdict for the defendants, signed a bill of exceptions, of which the material parts were as follows : \u201c There was evidence that the dwelling-house and wood-house building were built by Elihu Adams in 1839 ; the whole of the wood-house building was built at one time, had but one frame, was all under one roof, and Adams testified that it was designed for one building, for a wood-house and carriage-house; the wood room constituted two thirds or more of the entire building, and was separated from the carriage room by a loose partition, about seven feet high, which extended to the eaves on one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>side, and not so high on the other side, leaving a distance of about seven feet between the top of the partition and the ridge, pole. There were large cracks and holes between the boards of the partition, through which one might look from one room into the other; and the carnage room was open on the east side, but the wood room was inclosed on all sides.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-4\">*' It appeared in evidence that in June 1854, at about three o\u2019clock P. M., a fire was discovered in the carriage room, and consumed the wood-house building, damaged the back part of the dwelling-house, and consumed the ice-house, hog-house and hen-house, hereafter mentioned. It also appeared that in the carriage room there were from four hundred to one thousand pounds of straw, which was scattered about and trod down on the ground, there being no floor in the room, and which had been put there without the knowledge or assent of the plaintiff in the fall or winter previous by one Fuller, who then occupied part of the plaintiff\u2019s house, but moved out in the April before the fire, and was succeeded by another tenant. The plaintiff proved that from 1849, when he purchased the premises from Adams, to the time of the fire, no cattle were kept in said carriage room, and no straw, hay or other similar articles were put there, except the straw put there by Fuller, as before stated. The plaintiff resided in Enfield, twelve or fifteen miles from the insured premises, and never personally occupied said premises, but rented them, and visited them from time to time for the purpose of collecting rents and looking after the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">\u201c The plaintiff offered to prove by several witnesses, some of whom had been tenants of the premises, and others near neighbors, that the building in which the wood-house and carnage room were, had always been commonly known and called as the \u2018 wood-house.\u2019 But the court rejected the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The defendants called Mrs. Jewett, who testified that she lived nearly opposite the insured premises; ' that about three weeks before the fire she saw from her house a bonfire near the carriage-house; that she went out, and found that the fire was made of straw, and that there was a trail of straw from the carriage-house to the fire; that she separated the burning from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>other straw, and put the fire out; that the carriage-house was open, and loose straw was lying there; that her little boy and the child of one of the tenants made the fire. To this evidence the plaintiff objected; but for the purpose of showing the condition of the straw at the time, and for no other purpose, the testimony was admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-5\"><em>\u201c </em>It appeared in evidence that in the rear of the building con taining the wood room and carriage room, and separated from said building by a passage way three feet wide, was an ice-house, and that in the rear of the ice-house, and distant from ii one or two feet, was a small structure, called by some of the witnesses a hog-house and hen-house, being three and a half feet high in' the rear, and six feet high in front, and covered by boards, but not shingled or battened, and with a board fence or partition between the hog-house part and the hen-house part. It extended towards the barn and to within about twenty four feet of it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-6\">The defendants were permitted, notwithstanding the plaintiff\u2019s objection, to introduce evidence that the hog-house and hen-house increased the risk, and would, if disclosed, have increased the premium.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The plaintiff contended that, as it appeared from the application that the insured premises were to be occupied by tenants, there was an implied agreement on the part of the defendants that if the plaintiff used reasonable care and diligence in the selection of trustworthy tenants, and in the general management of the premises, the insurance should not be affected by acts done by the tenants without his knowledge or consent; and he asked the court to instruct the jury that, if they were satisfied that the plaintiff used such reasonable care and diligence, and did not assent to or know of Fuller\u2019s putting and keeping the straw in the carriage-house, the fact that the straw was thus put and kept there- by Fuller would not prevent the plaintiff from recovering, even if the straw being there did increase the risk. But the court declined so to instruct the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-8\">\u201c The plaintiff also asked the court to instruct the jury that, as the policy and by-laws nowhere specifically prohibited the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>keeping of straw on the premises, it was not a violation of any of the provisions of. said policy and by-laws if the plaintiff\u2019s tenant did keep said straw there, provided he kept it only in reasonable quantities, and for his own use. But the court declined so to instruct the jury; and instructed them, that if the straw materially increased the risk, it was a violation of the policy, and worked a forfeiture of the plaintiff\u2019s claim under it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-4\">\u201c To the foregoing rulings and instructions the plaintiff excepts.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b578-5\"><em>E.

The application represented that the property insured was a house and wood-house, \u201c occupied for the usual purposes.\u201d The carriage-house was a distinct building, used for a different and more hazardous purpose, which, not being disclosed, avoided the policy. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Tower, </em>1 Gray, 426. <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Eastern Railroad, 2 </em>Met. 147. It was built for a carriage-house, and used for storing straw, which is not a \u201cusual purpose\u201d of a house or wood-house. Evidence that it was sometimes called by neighbors the \u201c wood-house \u201d was inadmissible,</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-7\">2. -Mrs. Jewett\u2019s testimony was properly admitted to show for what purpose the carriage room bad been used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-8\">3. The representation that there was \u201c no other buildings within four rods \u201d was a material representation, if not a warranty ; and the question whether the hog-house and hen-house materially increased the risk, was properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-9\">4. The application, while it stipulated that the premises should be used for the \u201c usual purposes,\u201d in terms contemplated their occupation by tenants. For the acts of such tenants, paying rent to the plaintiff, and subject to his control, the plaintiff is responsible. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Tower, </em>1 Gray, 426. <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>Mid</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>dlesex Mutual Fire Ins.

They were not mere trespassers, or occupants for a special purpose under a license which they abused, as in <em>Loud, </em>v. <em>Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co. 2 </em>Gray, 221.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b579-5\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa84\">1. The description of the premises in the evidence, fully detailed in the bill of exceptions, very clearly shows that the \u201c wood-house \u201d covered and included the room in which the straw was deposited. We perceive no ground for saying that this room, designed for a carriage room, was a building, so as to make the application false when it stated there was no other building within four rods of the premises insured except the ice-house. But the evidence that the building which covered and included the wood room and carriage room was known and called by the tenants and neighbors the \u201c wood-house,\u201d though not necessary, was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">2. The evidence of Mrs. Jewett as to the bonfire of straw three weeks before the fire was immaterial, because the fact it tended to prove, and to which its effect was limited by the learned judge, was itself immaterial. From its manifest tendency also, to prejudice the cause of the plaintiff, it should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">3. Whether the pig-pen and hen-house were buildings within the terms of the application \u2014 \u201cno other buildings within four rods \u201d\u2014would depend upon their size and structure. Upon the evidence given in the bill of exceptions they were not buildings, within the meaning of the application; and evidence as to increase of risk from them was not competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">4. The instructions prayed for should in form or substance have been given. There was nothing in the acts of the tenant, as proved, which avoided the policy. The instructions given Were unsound, for the same reason. <em>Exceptions sustained,</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
