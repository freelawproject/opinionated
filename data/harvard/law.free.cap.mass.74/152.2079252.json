On the 18th of August the defendant was duly appointed her administrator, and on the 30th of that month received from the railroad corporation twenty five hundred dollars, and as such administrator executed to them a release of all claims for damages on account of her death, and also, under a power of attorney from Mrs. Anderson which was afterwards ratified by her husband, a release of all her claims. Said Julia had no other estate than this claim for damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Afterwards, and before the defendant had paid over any of the money, the plaintiff filed with him her bill of five hundred dollars for board; and he said, \u201c it was an honest claim, and he would see that she had it, whether the money went to Mr. Anderson or Mrs. Anderson,\u201d and about the same time\" paid Mrs. Anderson two hundred dollars out of the twenty five hundred dollars ; and afterwards, and before this suit was brought, represented that he had paid Mr. Anderson fourteen hundred dollars in full discharge of his claims.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-5\"><em>F. W </em>Sawyer, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqd\">cited <em>Gay </em>v. Ballou, 4 Wend. 403 ; <em>Hallett </em>v. Oakes, 1 Cush. 296.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-6\"><em>I. J. Austin, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b161-7\">Bigelow, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgE\">The facts in this case do not show any valid debt by the infant\u2019s intestate to the plaintiff. The board of the child was clearly a gratuity, furnished from motives of affection and kindness by the plaintiff, without any expectation of remuneration, or intent to make a claim in the nature of a debt. There is therefore nothing on which an implied contract can rest to charge the assets of the intestate in the hands of the defendant. <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Governors of Guy's Hospital, </em>2 Stra. 728. <em>Pelly </em>v. <em>Rawlins, </em>Peake\u2019s Add. Cas. 226. <em>Dearborn </em>v. <em>Brownson, </em>3 Met. 155. <em>Mc Gilvery </em>v. <em>Capen, </em>7 Gray, 524, 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Nor can the plaintiff maintain her action against the defendant as administrator, to charge assets in his hands on the express promise of the defendant. It was wholly without consideration and void, as <em>nudum pactum. </em>Besides, it was not competent for the defendant, by his promise, to lbind the assets in his hands as administrator, to pay a claim which was not valid as against the estate of his intestate. <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>10 Pick. 431, <em>Ripley </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>10 Pick. 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\"><em>Judgment for the </em>defendant-;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
