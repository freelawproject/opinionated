The defendant objected that it was not shown that the witness knew or was capable to distinguish or tell what the liquor was. But the judge admitted the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-10\">The officer who made the seizure was also called as a witness, and asked if there were at the defendant\u2019s house other jugs than those containing liquors. The defendant objected. But the witness was allowed to answer the question, and testified that he did find there jugs which had no liquor in them, but which had had liquor in them recently.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-11\">The defendant, being found guilty, brought this case up by exceptions. He also moved in arrest o\u00ed judgment, because the complaint did not set forth the offence fully, plainly and formally, nor allege particularly what liquors the defendant kept; and did not show but that the liquors kept were not otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>intoxicating than as so declared and considered by force of <em>Si. </em>1855, <em>c. 215, \u00a7 1, </em>contrary to the fact.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-5\"><em>G. M. Stearns, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASS\">1. The opinion of the first witness, that what was found was gin, was not admissible, as it does not appear that he had any knowledge of the matter. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 440. <em>New England Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Lovell, </em>7 Cush. 319.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-6\"><em>2. </em>Evidence that the defendant had jugs which had formerly contained liquor was improperly admitted, as it did not tend to show with 'what intent the defendant kept the liquor alleged in the complaint to have been unlawfully kept. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madden, </em>1 Gray, 486. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Short, 21 </em>Pick. 142. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Call, 21 </em>Pick. 522.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-7\">3. The allegation that the defendant kept intoxicating liquor contrary to the <em>St. </em>of 1855, c. 215, is insufficient, because it may apply to cider or wine, unintoxicating in fact, which \u00a7 1 declares <em>\u201c </em>shall be considered intoxicating liquors, within the meaning of this act.\u201d The legislature have no power to declare unintoxicating liquors to be intoxicating, and punish them as if they were. 1 Bishop on Crim. Law, \u00a7 53, &amp; cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-8\">4. The complaint does not describe with sufficient certainty the property kept \u2014 there being no statement of the kind or quantity. 1 Chit. Crim. Law, 236, 237. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Chalkley, </em>Russ. &amp; Ry. 258. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>Russ. &amp; Ry. 274. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 S. &amp; R. 194. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>16 Pick. 211. It is not sufficient to allege an offence in the words of the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maxwell, 2 </em>Pick. 143. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thurlow, </em>24 Pick. 379. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Met. 243.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-9\"><em>D. W. Alvord, </em>(District Attorney,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b489-10\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A5P\">1. Whether a particular article is gin is not a subject requiring an expert, but a matter of general knowledge. If the witness did not know, he might say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">2. The evidence of the jugs which had contained liquor was rightly admitted. They tended to show that the defendant kept liquor, which was a necessary step in proving that she kept liquor unlawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>3. If the liquor sold was not in fact intoxicating, still, if it was within the liquors enumerated in the first section of the statute, the keeping of it with intent to sell was, by the terms of the statute, to be punished in the same manner as if it was intoxicating. And such an enactment is within the discretion of the legislature to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">4. The liquors ar\u00e9 described in the complaint in the manner which has always been practised in similar cases. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conant, </em>6 Gray, 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\n<em>Exceptions and motion in arrest overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
