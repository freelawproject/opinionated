Clancey Trial in the superior court of Suffolk at January term 1856 before <em>Nelson, </em>C. J., who signed this bill of exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-10\">\u201c At the trial, the plaintiff produced from the files of the court, and offered in evidence a deposition of Clancey ; and the defendants objected to said deposition, because it nowhere appeared that the said deposition had been inclosed, sealed up and directed by the justice to the court before whom the cause was pending, and remained sealed up until opened in court by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the court. The court, finding the indorsement of the clerk that said deposition had been opened and filed by the clerk, and no other objection save the above named being made, and the defendant furnishing no evidence upon the subject matter, overruled the objection and allowed the deposition to be read. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants except.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-5\"><em>P. Willard, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5H\">The deposition of Clancey was improperly admitted, because it nowhere appeared that all the statute provisions had been complied with; and the burden of proof is upon the party offering a deposition to show a strict compliance with the statutes. Rev. Sts. c. 94, \u00a7 24. <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>8 Cranch, 70. 1 Greenl.

If there had been any irregularity in this particular, the presumption is that the clerk would have noticed it, and have preserved the envelop or return of the magistrate, so that either party might bring the question before the court. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
