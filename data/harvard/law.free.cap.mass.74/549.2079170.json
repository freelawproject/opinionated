The defendant was also permitted, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, to prove that, after the sale to him and before the sale to the plaintiff, the defendant went with her to the pen where the hog was, and saw the hog, and directed her to keep it well, and she said she would do so. There was no other evidence of delivery to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-9\">The plaintiff, admitting the defendant\u2019s evidence to be time, contended that it did not show such a sale and delivery of the hog by Ellen Sullivan to the defendant as would prevent the plaintiff from acquiring a title to it under the subsequent purchase by him; and that the contract of sale between the said Ellen and the defendant was so vague and indefinite in its terms that it would not vest a title to the property in the defendant as against a subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. But the court in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>structed the jury otherwise, and they found a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-4\"><em>E.
