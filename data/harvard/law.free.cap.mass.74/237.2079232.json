The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ALB\"><em>H. C. </em>Hutchins, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQf\">This evidence was inadmissible, unless allowed by the <em>St. </em>of 1851, <em>c. </em>147, \u00a7 5. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Eastern </em>Railroad, 12 Met. 44. The plaintiff had arrived at her journey\u2019s end, and received her trunk, and deposited it with the baggage master; the relation of the defendants to the plaintiff as common carriers had ceased, and that of warehousemen had supervened. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence </em>Railroad, <em>10 </em>Met. 472. <em>Norway Plains Co. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine </em>Railroad, <em>1 </em>Gray, 263. The <em>St. </em>of 1851, <em>c. </em>147, \u00a7 5, does not extend to actions against warehousemen ; but applies only <em>\u201c </em>whenever an action shall be brought by a passenger against any railroad corporation, steamboat proprietor or other common carrier,\u201d for the loss of baggage <em>\u201c </em>by the fault of such carrier, or of the agents of such carrier \u201d \u2014 showing that the statute is limited to the relation of common carrier and passenger. If it is only necessary to show that a plaintiff has been a passenger, in order to make his testimony admissible under this statute, when does the rule cease to be applicable ? The common earner is a public servant, to whom the plaintiff must entrust his baggage when he travels; but a bailment, after the arrival, is the traveller\u2019s own voluntary act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-6\"><em>J. M. </em>Bell, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b246-7\">Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW_\">The main question made at the trial, and the only one now argued here is, whether the case was within the <em>St. </em>of 1851, <em>c, </em>147, respecting the carrying of effects of passengers by railroad corporations, steamboat proprietors and other common carriers, and especially section 5 of said statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>which provides, that after proof of the bailment of any trunk, <em>See., </em>and the subsequent loss thereof by such carrier, the plaintiff may put in evidence his own schedule or written descriptive statement of the contents of such trank. The argument was, that because the transit of the passenger and that of her baggage had terminated, the relation of passenger and common carrier between the parties had ceased, and therefore the cause was not within this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We lay no great stress on the facts, that on arrival of the train at Waltham the plaintiff requested the conductor to take charge of her luggage until she could send for it; that the conductor consented to do so, and directed the baggage master of the defendants to take charge of it. But this evidence was competent, and has a tendency to show that the plaintiff did not at that time take possession of her trunk, or intend to do so, but intended to leave it temporarily at the depot; that the proper officers and servants of the company had notice of it, and did in fact take the trunk to the baggage room, the proper place of deposit for that purpose. What we mean is, that we do not consider that this request to the conductor and baggage master, and their assent to it, were the basis of the obligation of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We are then to inquire what was the duty of the defendant company, as carriers of passengers; and what is the ground on which it rests. The purchase of a ticket must be regarded, in law, as compensation for all the duties which the carriers undertake to perform, in respect to the person of the passenger, and in respect to the care and transportation of his baggage. When therefore the .baggage of a passenger is placed in their custody, to be carried with the passenger, they are bailees for hire, paid agents and depositaries, and their responsibility is to be tested accordingly. Now, whether a common earner of passengers, in respect to the baggage of a passenger, is like a common carrier of merchandise, liable for all losses except those caused by an act of God or a public enemy, and whether or not that larger responsibility terminates when the transit ends and the goods are unladen\u2014which it is not necessary to decide\u2014all responsi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>bility of the carriers does not then cease. They, the same company, in virtue of the same duty, and upon the same pecuniary consideration, are bound, both by the rules of the common law, as a necessary incident to their undertaking, and by the obligations imposed upon them by the <em>St. </em>of 1851, to keep the property safely, and deliver it to the owner on request. Then, as bailees for hire, they are bound to use due and reasonable care and diligence in keeping the property, such reasonable care and diligence as the nature of the property may require to preserve it from loss and damage, such as a person of common prudence would exercise in the care and preservation of his own \u25a0property of a similar kind in like circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">And the court are of opinion that this was a case within the statute, so as to make the evidence of a descriptive list, sworn to by the plaintiff, competent evidence. The statute makes no distinction, if there be one, between the larger liability of carriers whilst the baggage is <em>in trcmsitu </em>and before they are unladen from the cars, and that more limited duty which devolves on them as bailees for hire, after it is received at the depot. The provision is, that whenever an action shall be brought by a passenger against any railroad corporation, &amp;c., to recover damage for any trunk, &amp;c. lost or damaged, and the plaintiff shall have made proof of the bailment, &amp;c., and the loss of the same, by the fault of such carrier or his agents, the plaintiff shall be allowed to put in evidence a descriptive list sworn to by him, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Whatever may be the nature and extent of the duties of carriers, whether they be liable for all losses, or only for such as proceed from negligence and carelessness of them or their agents, or from failure in the performance of all duties incumbent on all bailees for hire, the relation of passenger and carrier, in regard to baggage, continues until the carriers have performed their whole duty. The same reasons, therefore, for admitting the sworn descriptive list, to prove the contents of a lost trunk, apply to all cases in which the company may be responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
