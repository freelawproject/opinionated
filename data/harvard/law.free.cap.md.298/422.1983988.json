Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 591, and Maryland Rule 746. The State took appeals in all four cases, raising similar issues concerning the operation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. Because of the importance of the questions presented, this Court issued writs of certiorari prior to argument in the Court of Special Appeals, and we directed that the cases be heard together. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Before setting out the facts of each case, it would be useful to review the requirements of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 as interpreted by this Court in <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 403 A.2d 356, on motion for reconsideration, 285 Md. 334, 403 A.2d 368 (1979), and <em>Goins v. State, </em>293 Md. 97, 442 A.2d 550 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>(1982), and to review the assignment system for criminal cases in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Art. 27, \u00a7 591, was enacted by Ch. 212 of the Acts of 1971, and Rule 746 was promulgated in 1977 to implement \u00a7 591. The statute and the rule, applicable to criminal cases in the circuit courts, require that a trial date be set which shall not be later than 180 days after the appearance of counsel or the arraignment of the defendant, whichever shall first occur. Under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, a postponement of the trial date must be made or approved by the administrative judge or a judge designated by him and only for good cause shown.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A42\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Soon after \u00a7 591 was enacted, but prior to the adoption of Rule 746, it was held in <em>Young v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 707, 292 A.2d 137, <em>summarily aff\u2019d, </em>266 Md. 438, 294 A.2d 467 (1972), that the requirements of \u00a7 591 were only \u201cdirectory\u201d and not mandatory. Seven years later, however, in <em>State v. Hicks, supra, </em>we overruled the <em>Young </em>case, held that the time period for trying a circuit court criminal case was mandatory,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and held that if the case was not tried within that period and there was no postponement of the trial date complying with \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, dismissal of the criminal charges is ordinarily the appropriate sanction. There were several reasons for overruling <em>Young. </em>First, it was pointed out in the <em>Hicks </em>opinion that \u00a7 591 represented a legislative policy to obtain the prompt disposition of criminal charges, manifesting the Legislature\u2019s recognition that excessive delay in trying criminal cases is detrimental to the criminal justice system, but that this policy had been \u201clargely unheeded\u201d in light of the <em>Young </em>decision. 285 Md. at 316-317, 334, 403 A.2d 356. Second, we stated in <em>Hicks </em>that the adoption of Rule 746 was intended to \u201cput teeth\u201d into the statutory requirements governing the assignment of criminal cases for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 318, 403 A.2d 356. Finally, we pointed out that the holding in <em>Young </em>was contrary to the language of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, <em>Id. </em>at 334, 403 A.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"ANF\">Section 591 and Rule 746 require setting <em>\u201ca </em>date for the trial\u201d or \u201ca trial date\u201d within 180 days from arraignment or the appearance of counsel. Section 591 states that \u201c[t]he date established for the trial\u201d shall not be postponed except for good cause and with the approval of the administrative judge, and Rule 746 requires that <em>\u201ca </em>change of trial date\u201d be granted by the county administrative judge or his designee and only for good cause. Under this language, it could be argued either (1) that the statute and rule apply only to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>setting and postponement of the first trial date or (2) that the provisions apply to all scheduled trial dates in a case. In the <em>Hicks </em>opinion we indicated that every postponement of a circuit court criminal trial date was required to be granted by the administrative judge or his designee and only upon a showing of the requisite cause. 285 Md. at 316-318, 403 A.2d 356. <em>See Guarnera v. State, </em>20 Md.App. 562, 572-573, 318 A.2d 243, <em>cert, denied, </em>272 Md. 742 (1974), cited and quoted with approval <em>in.Hicks. See also Bethea v. State, </em>26 Md.App. 398, 400-401, 338 A.2d 390 (1975). At the same time, we made it clear in <em>Hicks </em>that the purpose of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 was to set a time limit for. the trial of a criminal case, that the dismissal sanction was applicable when the case was not tried within that time limit and not postponed in accordance with \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, but that the dismissal sanction was inapplicable to violations of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 which did not prevent the case from being tried within the prescribed time period. 285 Md. at 318, 320, 334, 335, 403 A.2d 356. Thus, when there are several orders by the administrative judge postponing a criminal trial, and one of those orders has the effect of postponing the trial beyond the 180-day deadline, it is the latter order with which a judge hearing a motion to dismiss is concerned. The critical order by the administrative judge, for purposes of the dismissal sanction, is the order having the effect of extending the trial date beyond 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">This Court also stated in the <em>Hicks </em>opinion that \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 were not intended to be codifications of the constitutional speedy trial right but stand \u201con a different legal footing.\u201d 285 Md. at 320, 403 A.2d 356. In addition, we emphasized that one circumstance where the dismissal sanction was inappropriate was \u201cwhere the defendant, either individually or by his attorney, seeks or expressly consents to a trial date in violation of Rule 746.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 403 A.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Finally, the Court held in <em>Hicks </em>(285 Md. at 336-338, 403 A.2d 356) that the overruling of <em>Young v. State </em>and the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>rulings in the <em>Hicks </em>opinion should be given prospective effect under the principles set forth in cases such as <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 296-297, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1969-1970,18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 636, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1741, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965); and <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>275 Md. 689, 344 A.2d 80 (1975). <em>See also McClain v. State, </em>288 Md. 456, 419 A.2d 369 (1980). In reaching this conclusion, we pointed out that \u201cthe new interpretation announced does not relate to the fact-finding determination of whether a defendant did the act, but, like the exclusionary rule involved in <em>Linkletter v. Walker, supra, </em>is a prophylactic measure designed to insure compliance with the requirements imposed on the State regarding prompt trials of criminal cases. It is the type of new ruling that is almost invariably not given retroactive effect.\u201d 285 Md. at 337, 403 A.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Three years after <em>Hicks, </em>in <em>Goins </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>this Court reiterated that dismissal was the appropriate sanction if a circuit court criminal case was not tried within the 180-day time period, and if there was no order by the administrative judge, based on good cause, postponing the trial beyond the 180-day deadline, and if the defendant did not seek or expressly consent to a trial date in violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. Under such circumstances, dismissal would be the appropriate sanction even if the delay may have been for the defendant\u2019s benefit, or the defendant may have engaged in dilatory conduct, or the prosecution may have been free of fault. 293 Md. at 100, 106-109, 112, 442 A.2d 550. We repeated in <em>Goins </em>that \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 were not intended to be codifications of constitutional speedy trial analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 109, 442 A.2d 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In the <em>Goins </em>opinion we reaffirmed that the State has the duty of bringing the defendant to trial, that the defendant has no duty to bring himself to trial, and that, therefore, the defendant has no obligation to seek a postponement under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. 293 Md. at 109-110, 442 A.2d 550. <em>Goins </em>also held that, under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, the administrative judge may, for good cause, order a postponement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the trial date on his own motion. <em>Id. </em>at 110-111, 442 A.2d 550.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lastly, we held in <em>Goins </em>that when an order of the administrative judge necessarily has the effect of postponing the trial date past the 180-day deadline, and the order is supported by good cause, such order complies with \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 regardless of whether the administrative judge was conscious of the 180-day deadline. <em>Id. </em>at 111-112, 442 A.2d 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">As a result of the <em>Hicks </em>decision, it was necessary that procedures be adopted in various subdivisions to assure that criminal cases be tried in conformity with \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. The subdivision with the greatest criminal caseload, and thus presenting a real need for an efficient assignment system, was Baltimore City. For example, in fiscal year 1983 there were 8,571 new criminal cases filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, consisting of 4,147 felony cases and 4,424 misdemeanor cases. The criminal assignment system which evolved in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City is as follows.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Within a few weeks after the filing of every criminal case in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, a mandatory arraignment is routinely held.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the arraignment there is present someone from the criminal division of the Central <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Assignment Office<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with the necessary data for the assignment of a trial date, and at that time a trial date is assigned for each case except those which are terminated at the arraignment. This initial trial date is usually within ninety days from the arraignment but in all cases within 150 days.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Administrative Judge Karwacki has described the initial scheduling of cases, and the operation of what is called the \u201cmove list,\u201d as follows (Karwacki, <em>Countdown to Supreme Bench Consolidation, </em>4 The Baltimore Barrister 5, 5-6 (No. 4 1983)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\u201cAt the criminal arraignment, felony cases are scheduled into nine criminal courts, ten per court per week. Misdemeanor cases appealed from the District Court or removed from that Court prior to trial on a request for jury trial are scheduled before one criminal court at the rate of 60 per week. All of these cases are scheduled as potential jury trials since under Maryland law the defendant is permitted to change his election as to mode of trial at any time within 48 hours prior to trial. Two criminal courts are undocketed and stand ready to handle overflow from the criminal docketed courts. At a conference held daily before me as the administrative judge the current state of the docket is assessed and requests for postponements and priority status for the cases awaiting trial are considered. Because of the deliberate overscheduling of criminal cases we are able to insure the minimum of down time on the part of any criminal court judge. When a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>judge completes his assigned cases for the day he is immediately assigned a case from the \u2018move\u2019 or \u2018ready\u2019 list of cases which are awaiting trial. An attempt is made through the daily scheduling conferences to maintain the \u2018move\u2019 or \u2018ready\u2019 list at between 10 and 20 cases. To insure prompt movement of the cases on \u2018move\u2019 or \u2018ready\u2019 status to an available court, an assignment office monitor personally surveys the status of proceedings in each of the 11 felony trial courts twice a day and reports that status at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. to the administrative judge. Should a court become available at any time prior to 4 p.m. a case from the \u2018move\u2019 or \u2018ready\u2019 list is moved to that court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The majority of cases assigned a trial date are ultimately disposed of by guilty plea, nol pros, or stet. For this reason, as pointed out above by Judge Karwacki, there must be a deliberate overscheduling of criminal trials. Otherwise initial trial dates would have to be set far into the future, judges would be available for great periods of time without cases to try, and few if any cases would be tried within 180 days. Nevertheless, there is no way to determine precisely for a particular period how many cases will be disposed of by guilty plea, nol pros or stet, and thus how much overscheduling should be done for that period. As Assignment Commissioner George B. Riggin, Jr., has explained (Riggin, <em>Circuit Court for Baltimore City </em>\u2014 Criminal <em>Court Overview, </em>4 (Distributed by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, July 13, 1983)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201cScheduling dockets into the future is more of an \u2018art\u2019 than a \u2018science\u2019. It involves the prediction of complex trial events which have no guaranteed certainty and can change from moment to moment. Despite the confusion, certain known factors allow future dockets to be assembled with some degree of rationale. For example, although we may not know specifically which cases will plead out, we nevertheless know that 80-85% will never go to trial. This concept dictates the technique called \u2018overscheduling\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201cThe general guidelines which are used in loading the future dockets can be described .... These guidelines are periodically adjusted as the caseload dictates or due to some specific knowledge about a protracted case ... . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8k2\">Because criminal case scheduling is not a precise science, because trials may take longer than anticipated, and because in a particular time period fewer cases than predicted may be disposed of by guilty plea, nol pros or stet, there will be occasions in any busy jurisdiction when the scheduled judge is not available to conduct a trial on the assigned date. In Baltimore City most such cases will be placed by the administrative judge on the so-called \u201cmove list,\u201d to be tried by one of the two \u201cmove courts\u201d or by the first other available judge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A case on the move list will typically be tried by a different judge on the scheduled trial date or within a few days thereafter. But, in order for the \u201cmove list\u201d mechanism to work, and in order to try such cases within a few days of the scheduled trial date, the move list can accommodate only a limited number of cases. If, in the judgment of the administrative judge, a criminal trial cannot be reached in the scheduled court on the assigned trial date and cannot be accommodated on the move list, the administrative judge ordinarily will conclude that \u201cgood cause\u201d for a postponement exists and that a new trial date must be assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Administrative Judge Karwacki, or in his absence another judge designated by him as acting administrative judge, is available at noon each day to hear motions for trial postponements in criminal cases or to consider criminal cases which, for whatever reason, apparently cannot be tried that day. After hearing argument (and evidence if any is offered), the administrative judge determines whether or not good cause exists for a postponement. If the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>judge agrees that a case cannot be reached in the scheduled court that day, he decides whether it can be accommodated on the move list or whether there should be a postponement and a new trial date assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City has developed a form of order, sometimes referred to as the \u201cstandard postponement form,\u201d to reflect what occurs at the postponement hearing. The information to be recorded on this form includes the essential data concerning the criminal case, the charges, the type of trial requested and the trial date, whether there had been prior trial postponements, which side requested the postponement, whether opposing counsel agrees, and whether the administrative judge approves the postponement request. The form has a space for entry of the reasons for postponing the case, the signature of the administrative judge and the new trial date. If, after hearing from the parties, the administrative judge concludes that good cause exists for a postponement, the necessary data is at that time recorded on the form and the administrative judge signs the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">At every one of these postponement hearings, the court clerk is someone from the Central Assignment Office, and it is that clerk\u2019s responsibility to insure that the form is correctly filled out. Nevertheless, the prosecuting attorney often fills in the data for the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">When the administrative judge orders a trial postponement, he is occasionally aware of a definite time period in the near future when, because of some unexpected development, there will be a judge who is available for the trial of criminal cases but to whom no cases have been assigned. In this event, a new trial date may be assigned at the postponement hearing and entered on the order. Ordinarily, however, a new trial date will not be assigned at the postponement hearing and, therefore, will not be entered on the order. Instead the clerk at the postponement hearing, after insuring that the other data is recorded and the administrative judge has signed the order, is responsible for delivering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the order to the Central Assignment Office for the selection of a new trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Upon receipt of the signed postponement order, the Central Assignment Office selects a new trial date. The Office picks the first available date under the normal guidelines for the assignment of trials, although the testimony in the instant cases suggested that, if such date is beyond the 180-day period, it may sometimes be possible to assign an earlier date. The Assignment Commissioner takes the position that it is the primary responsibility of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to determine if the new trial date in a previously postponed case is within the 180-day time period, and, if it is not, to notify the Assignment Office so that an earlier date can be selected if possible. Nevertheless the personnel in the Assignment Office, as a check upon the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, also normally calculate the 180-day deadline and try to select a new trial date prior to that deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The relevant facts in each of the four cases before us are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">No. 94, <em>State v. Frazier</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">On June 9, 1981, the State filed in the Criminal Court of Baltimore a criminal information against Antoine Frazier, charging him with robbery and related offenses. The appearance of Frazier\u2019s attorney was entered on June 30,1981, and Frazier\u2019s arraignment was on the same date, with him pleading \u201cnot guilty\u201d and praying a jury trial. Therefore, the 180-day period for trying the case would expire on December 27, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Frazier\u2019s trial was initially scheduled for September 3, 1981. On that date, both the prosecuting attorney and the defense attorney were ready to begin the trial, with their witnesses available, but the case could not be reached. The attorneys then appeared before the designated administrative judge (Grady, C.J.), and the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>requested that the case be placed upon the move list, although he acknowledged \u201cthat the move list is full.\u201d Chief Judge Grady declined, stating that \u201cthe system cannot accommodate you on the move list.\u201d The designated administrative judge found that there was good cause for a postponement because of the \u201cunavailability of a court\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the seventeen cases already on the move list for the next available court. The assignment office selected a new trial date of December 14, 1981, which was 167 days after arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Again on December 14, 1981, the case could not be reached, and a hearing was held on that date before the administrative judge (Karwacki, J.). Administrative Judge Karwacki found good cause to postpone the trial \u201cdue to an excess buildup of cases awaiting trial with no courtroom available\u201d and with \u201c29 cases already pending on the list to be moved to the first available court.\u201d The new trial date selected was March 23, 1982, which was 266 days after arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">When the case was called on March 23, 1982, the defendant Frazier orally moved to dismiss for failure to comply with \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. At the conclusion of the argument on the motion, the trial judge dismissed the case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The trial judge ruled that there was not good cause for the delay, observing that her \u201cCourt has been available on a number of occasions.\u201d It is unclear from the trial judge\u2019s remarks whether she was finding lack of good cause for any postponement on December 14, 1981, or a lack of good cause for the delay until March 28, 1982, or both.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">No. 95, <em>State v. Weems and Patton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">On July 7, 1981, in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, Thomas Edward Weems and Lamont Patton were indicted together on charges of armed robbery occurring on June 6, 1981, and related offenses. Weems and Patton were arraigned and the appearance of their counsel was entered on July 28, 1981. Consequently, the 180-day limit under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 was to expire on January 24, 1982. Trial was set for October 14,1981, 78 days after their arraignment. In August 1981, the defendants filed demands for a speedy trial, motions to suppress evidence, and a motion to dismiss because of alleged defects in the charging documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The case could not be reached on the October 14, 1981, trial date, and the attorneys were instructed to go before the administrative judge. There were apparently two reasons for the inability to try the case on October 14th. First, the trial judge to whom the case was assigned could not reach it because he was trying a case which had been continued from a previous day. Second, the assigned public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>defender for the defendant Weems stated to Administrative Judge Karwacki on October 14th as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">\u201cMy client, for the record, has indicated to me that he doesn\u2019t think I am prepared, in that this case was paneled [assigned] to me October first. I have seen him twice at the jail; however, he thinks I need more time and he needs more time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Judge Karwacki found that there was good cause to postpone the case, and he refused to place the case on the move list because there were already twenty cases on that list. Knowing that there would be an available judge during the first week of November 1981, Judge Karwacki gave the attorneys the option of either choosing a date certain during that week or having the case postponed to the next available date thereafter as selected by the Assignment Office. The prosecuting attorney and both defense attorneys selected November 5, 1981, as the trial date, and the case was postponed to November 5th, to be tried in Part 4 of the Criminal Court of Baltimore on that date. The clerk from the Assignment Office attending the administrative judge\u2019s hearing placed two \u201cx\u2019s\u201d on a sheet of paper titled November 5th to indicate that two cases were set for that date, but she did not record the names or numbers of the cases. Also there was a failure to follow the normal procedure of filling out the standard postponement form and submitting it to the Assignment Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Patton\u2019s attorney and the prosecuting attorney arrived at Part 4 of the Criminal Court of Baltimore on November 5th to try the case. They discovered that the case was not on the docket, that the defendants had not been brought from jail, that the court files had not been delivered, that no witnesses were present, and that Weems\u2019s attorney was absent. An inquiry at the Assignment Office disclosed that the Office had no knowledge that the case was supposed to be tried on November 5th. Because of a failure after the October 14th hearing to notify the Assignment Office of the November 5th trial date, the computer did not generate the necessary paperwork to place the case on the November 5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>docket, issue the appropriate summonses, send notices to counsel and issue writs to assure that the defendants were brought from jail to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In light of this, there was no court available on November 5th to try the case, and necessary persons were absent. Consequently, the prosecuting attorney and Patton\u2019s attorney appeared before Administrative Judge Karwacki on November 5th, and Judge Karwacki signed an order postponing the case. This time the postponement form was properly transmitted to the Assignment Office, and a new trial date of January 28,1982, was assigned.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The date was four days beyond the 180-day limit prescribed by \u00a7 591 and Rule 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On January 20,1982, the defendant Weems filed a written motion to dismiss, asserting two grounds: 1. a violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746; 2. a violation of his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. An extensive hearing on the motion, with testimony from a court employee, was held before Judge Ross on January 28, 1982, and the hearing continued on January 29, 1982. At the beginning of the hearing, the defendant Patton orally joined in the motion to dismiss. When the hearing concluded, Judge Ross denied the motion to dismiss insofar as it was based upon a claimed violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, ruling that there was good cause for the postponements by the administrative judge and that \u201cthere is nothing that has been done by anyone that is inconsistent with [Rule] 746.\u201d Judge Ross expressly did not rule upon that part of the motion asserting a denial of the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>right to a speedy trial, pointing out that another judge was waiting to receive the case for trial and indicating that the trial judge should hear the speedy trial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Thereafter on the same day, January 29th, the case was called for trial before Judge Hammerman. Following the defendants\u2019 reiteration of their not guilty pleas and their desire for a jury trial, and defense counsel\u2019s review of the various pre-trial motions which had been filed, defense counsel requested the court to reconsider the motion to dismiss based upon an asserted violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 and to hear additional evidence and argument that had not been presented to Judge Ross. After considerable discussion, the trial judge agreed to reconsider the \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 question, stating that he would hear evidence on that issue and the constitutional speedy trial issue together and that he would \u201crule first ... on [Rule] 746 and then, if necessary, on the speedy trial [issue] after that.\u201d Following a review of the prior postponements, there was testimony from the \u201cPostponement Clerk\u201d (also called the \u201cDocket Assignment Clerk\u201d), a supervisor in the Assignment Office, the Assignment Commissioner, and both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The witness who was a supervisor in the Assignment Office testified that, after the postponement form was received on November 5, 1981, she assigned the January 28, 1982, trial date which was the \u201cearliest available date to set the case in.\u201d She further testified that even if the postponement form had been correctly marked to show that the defendants had requested speedy trials and that neither defense attorney had consented to the postponement, she would not have been able to select an earlier trial date \u201cbecause the dockets were overloaded\u201d and \u201cI just looked for the earliest available date and that is what I gave.\u201d After the supervisor selected the January 28th trial date, she left the postponement form on the desk of the Postponement Clerk for the latter \u201cto check it out and put it in the computer.\u201d She explained that the Postponement Clerk normally \u201ccheck[s] the first appearance of the attorney and the arraignment date [to determine] if the trial [date] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>within one hundred eighty days.\u201d The supervisor herself did not ascertain whether the January 28th date was within 180 days, as she relied upon the Postponement Clerk to do this. The Postponement Clerk, however, testified that she did not follow her normal procedure of checking to determine whether the January 28th date was more than 180 days from arraignment because she did not initially process the form, and she assumed that the person who had selected the trial date \u201cwould have already screened it.\u201d Neither the supervisor nor the Postponement Clerk indicated that an earlier trial date could have been secured if they had been aware that January 28, 1982, was 184 days beyond the arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As previously indicated, the Assignment Commissioner testified generally concerning the assignment of cases in the Criminal Court of Baltimore. With regard to the January 28th trial date in the <em>Weems and Patton </em>case, the Assignment Commissioner\u2019s testimony suggested that if the personnel in his office had been aware that this date was four days beyond the 180-day deadline, an earlier trial date might have been secured. Although reiterating his view that it was the ultimate responsibility of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office to monitor the trial date in light of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, and to notify the Assignment Office of a problem, the Assignment Commissioner did acknowledge that there had been a \u201cslip up\u201d in his office\u2019s checking of the matter. Similarly, concerning the earlier failure to notify the Assignment Office of the November 5th trial date, the Assignment Commissioner indicated that the Assignment Office clerk attending the administrative judge\u2019s hearing on October 14, 1981, should have seen to it that the necessary data was placed on the form and delivered to the Assignment Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge granted each defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruling that there had been a violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. In his oral opinion, the trial judge found that neither the defendants nor their counsel had consented to the postponement of the November 5th trial date. The judge found that the failure to try the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>case on November 5th, and the failure thereafter to secure a new trial date within the 180-day deadline, was \u201cthe State\u2019s own fault, entirely,\u201d viewing the State as \u201cthe State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, the administrative judge, and the assignment office.\u201d While not expressly using the statutory \u201cgood cause\u201d terminology, Judge Hammerman appeared to find both a lack of good cause for the postponement on November 5th and a lack of good cause for the length of the postponement to January 28th.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">No. 96, <em>State v. Shaw</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">An information was filed in the Criminal Court of Baltimore on August 26, 1981, charging Gary Shaw with armed robbery and related offenses. Shaw was released on bail, and has remained on bail ever since. The appearance of Shaw\u2019s attorney was entered on September 18, 1981, and Shaw was arraigned on that date, pleading \u201cnot guilty\u201d and electing a jury trial. The trial was scheduled for December 18, 1981, 91 days after arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">On the December 18th trial date, the prosecution moved for a postponement. At the hearing on the motion before the designated administrative judge, the prosecuting attorney argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201cIf your honor please, the State is asking for a very, very short postponement in this matter, the reason being, I found out just this morning that a co-defendant\u2019s case is scheduled for January 6 in Criminal Court Part VIL I would move to consolidate. There is no Hicks problem. We are well within the 180 days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The defense attorney \u201cvehemently\u201d objected to the postponement, stating that he was prepared for trial \u201ctoday,\u201d that he \u201chad no knowledge there was a co-defendant in this case,\u201d that he was opposed to a consolidation and that he wanted \u201ca severance between all co-defendants we didn\u2019t even know about.\u201d The designated administrative judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>granted the State\u2019s motion for a postponement, finding that \u201cgood cause exists.\u201d The judge expressed the opinion that the matter of consolidation \u201cjustifies a two-week investigation,\u201d and that the question of severance should be decided on January 6th. The standard postponement form was filled out and delivered to the Assignment Office, and the trial date of January 6, 1982, was assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">On January 6, 1982, there was no court available for a jury trial of the case as desired by the defendant Shaw. The co-defendant pleaded guilty, and the attorneys in the <em>Shaw </em>case appeared before Administrative Judge Karwacki. At the January 6th hearing before Judge Karwacki, the State represented that it was prepared for trial and asked that the case be placed on the move list. Defense counsel, pointing out that the case had previously been postponed over the objection of the defense, opposed any further postponement. Judge Karwacki, however, refused to put the case on the move list and <em>sua sponte </em>postponed it, stating that \u201c[tjhere are just not enough courts for all our business.\u201d The postponement form signed by Judge Karwacki stated that the postponement was necessary because of the \u201cexcess buildup of cases awaiting trial with no courtroom available\u201d and because \u201c[tjhere are currently 26 cases already pending on the list to be moved to the first available court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The 180-day period from the date of arraignment ended on March 17,1982. Nevertheless, the new trial date selected by the Assignment Office was April 15, 1982, 209 days after arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">On the morning of trial, the defendant filed a written motion to dismiss, claiming a violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. When the case was called for trial later on April 15th, there was argument on the motion plus the testimony of the Deputy Criminal Assignment Commissioner.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>argument and testimony, the trial judge granted the motion, concluding that there was a violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. The ruling was not based on a finding that the inability to try the case on January 6, 1982, was unsupported by good cause. Instead the trial judge was of the view that there was an absence of good cause for the length of the delay beyond January 6th, and that the Assignment Office should have selected a new trial date prior to the expiration of the 180-day deadline on March 17, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">No. 124, <em>State v. Richardson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Mark Richardson was charged in the Criminal Court of Baltimore on September 18, 1981, with storehouse breaking and being .a rogue and vagabond. On October 9, 1981, the appearance of Richardson\u2019s attorney was . entered and Richardson was arraigned, at which time he pled not guilty and elected a jury trial. The 180-day deadline under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 would, therefore, expire on April 7, 1982. A suppression motion under Rule 736 was filed, and a trial date of January 7,1982, was assigned. During the pre-trial period, the defendant was in the custody of the State Division of Correction, serving a sentence on an unrelated conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">On the morning of January 7, 1982, the court, the prosecuting attorney and the defense attorney were ready to try the case when it was discovered that the Division of Correction had sent the wrong Mark Richardson to the Baltimore City Courthouse. Inquiry at the Division of Correction disclosed that there were three Mark Richardsons in the Division\u2019s custody, that correction officials had \u201cbeen working on it all morning and they can\u2019t tell which Mark Richardson is which.\u201d The prosecuting attorney then appeared before Administrative Judge Karwacki and informed him of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the facts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Judge Karwacki directed that writs of habeas corpus be issued to bring all three Mark Richardsons to the courthouse in order that there could be a \u201cline up\u201d to identify the defendant. He also determined that, because the Division of Correction had still not identified the defendant, there was good cause for a postponement and the case would have to be postponed. Judge Karwacki signed the standard postponement form which recited that there was good cause for a postponement because the \u201cDivision of Correction brought [the] wrong Mark Richardson to court. There are three of them, and they can not figure out who is who.\u201d The form was delivered to the Assignment Office, and a new trial date of May 3, 1982, was assigned. This exceeded the 180-day deadline by 26 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The case could not be reached on May 3rd because of the unavailability of a judge and it was placed on the \u201cmove list.\u201d A judge was available on the next day, May 4th, and the case was called for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">At the beginning of the trial proceedings, the defense attorney made an oral motion to dismiss based upon an asserted violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. Richardson\u2019s attorney argued that the postponement on January 7, 1982, was not supported by good cause, asserting that the State \u201ccould easily have found the necessary information\u201d regarding the correct Mark Richardson because \u201cobviously it is on the computer.\u201d Alternatively, the defense attorney contended that \u201ceven if good cause was shown\u201d for the postponement on January 7th, there was insufficient cause for the length of the delay thereafter. The prosecuting attorney, in addition to arguing that there was good cause for the postponement until May 4th, suggested that the defendant\u2019s attorney had consented to a trial date beyond the 180-day period by \u201csit[ting] idly by while the case is set outside the <em>Hicks </em>limit.\u201d The prosecuting attorney indicated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>failure to object to the postponement, and the failure to object to the new trial date before the expiration of the 180-day period, precluded the defendant from obtaining a dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The trial judge rejected the State\u2019s argument that defense counsel had consented to the January 7th postponement or consented to a trial beyond the 180-day deadline. The judge held that under the <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Goins </em>opinions, such consent by the defendant or his counsel must be \u201cexpress\u201d in order to preclude the sanction of dismissal for a violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, and that Richardson\u2019s attorney had not \u201cexpressly\u201d consented. The judge rejected the defense contention that there was an absence of good cause for any postponement on January 7th, stating that the administrative judge's \u201creasons that existed on January 7th for postponing the case were adequate; these mistakes occur.\u201d Nevertheless the trial judge ruled that there was insufficient cause \u201cto wait until May 3rd, well outside the <em>Hicks </em>time, to schedule the case for trial.\u201d Consequently, the case was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In appealing the dismissals, the State makes the same two arguments in all four cases. First, the State contends that the authority to determine \u201cgood cause\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 is vested in the administrative judge, and that a trial judge deciding a motion to dismiss is not authorized to \u201coverrule\u201d the administrative judge\u2019s finding of good cause \u201cabsent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.\u201d According to the State, no such showing was made in these cases. Second, the State argues that, even if a trial judge is authorized independently to determine good cause, there existed good cause for all of the postponements in these cases and that there was no \u201cundue delay\u201d from the dates of the critical postponements until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>trial dates. Thus, the argument continues, there was full compliance with \u00a7 591 and Rule 746.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The defendants, on the other hand, argue that a judge hearing the motion to dismiss is entitled to make an independent assessment concerning good cause. The defendants\u2019 attorneys<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> go on to state in <em>Frazier </em>and <em>Shaw </em>that \u201c[t]he sole issue in [these two] case[s] is whether an overcrowded court docket may constitute good cause for postponing a case,\u201d and they assert that \u201cpostponement of [each defendant\u2019s] case due to an overcrowded docket was as a matter of law not based upon \u2018good cause.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Shaw, </em>they make the alternate argument that even if the crowded docket constituted good cause for the January 6, 1982, postponement, \u201cthe <em>extent </em>of the postponement was not justified by whatever cause existed on January 6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">With respect to <em>Weems and Patton </em>the defendants contend that, because of the failure of state personnel (both the prosecuting attorney and persons in the court system) to prepare and process the paperwork so that the case could be tried on the November 5, 1981, trial date, there was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>absence of \u201cgood cause\u201d for the November 5th postponement. In the <em>Richardson </em>case, the defense maintains that the failure of the State to produce the defendant for trial on January 7, 1982, was not good cause for the postponement on that date. Alternatively it is claimed that the extent of the postponement, to early May, was not supported by good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">As recognized in both the State\u2019s and the defendants\u2019 arguments in these cases, the requirement in \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 that there be \u201cgood cause\u201d for a postponement of the trial date to a new date beyond the 180 day deadline has two components: 1. there must be good cause for not commencing the trial on the assigned trial date; 2. there must be good cause for the extent of the delay. In fact, as previously discussed, the trial judges\u2019 dismissals in the <em>Shaw </em>and <em>Richardson </em>cases, and perhaps the dismissals in the other two cases, implicated the second component rather than the first. The rulings in <em>Shaw </em>and <em>Richardson </em>were based on the view that there was an unreasonable length of time between the old and the new trial dates.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In dealing with the issues in these cases, it is important to distinguish these two aspects of \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The threshold question in these cases concerns the authority of a judge, hearing a motion to dismiss based upon an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>asserted violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, to re-examine the administrative judge\u2019s finding of \u201cgood cause.\u201d For the reasons set forth below, we essentially agree with the State\u2019s position on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">As a general principle, one judge of a trial court ruling on a matter is not bound by the prior ruling in the same case by another judge of the court; the second judge, in his discretion, may ordinarily consider the matter de novo. <em>See Waugh v. State, </em>275 Md. 22, 35, 338 A.2d 268 (1975); <em>Foreman v. State, </em>182 Md. 415, 418, 35 A.2d 171 (1943); <em>Insurance Company v. Thrall, </em>181 Md. 19, 22-23, 27 A.2d 353 (1942); <em>Robinson, et al. v. Commissioners of Harford County, </em>12 Md. 132, 141-142 (1858); <em>Placido v. Citizens Bank &amp; Tr.

This general principle, however, is inapplicable if a statute or rule reflects a different intent in a particular situation. <em>See Insurance Company v. Thrall, supra, </em>181 Md. at 23, 27 A.2d 353; <em>Layman v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 215, 230, 286 A.2d 559 (1972). Section 591 and Rule 746 reflect a different intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Section 591, although amended occasionally in other respects, has consistently, since its initial enactment in 1971, required that the postponement of the trial date in a circuit court criminal case be done by or approved by \u201cthe administrative judge of the court.\u201d Rule 746 implements this provision by specifying that, \u201cfor good cause shown,\u201d only \u201cthe county administrative judge or a judge designated by him may grant a change of trial date.\u201d When a trial is postponed beyond the 180-day period, the failure of the administrative judge or his designee to grant or approve such postponement is a violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. <em>Goins v. State, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As pointed out by Judge Powers for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Guarnera v. State, </em>20 Md.App. 562, 573, 318 A.2d 243, <em>cert, denied, </em>272 Md. 742 (1974), quoted by us with approval in <em>Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 317, 403 A.2d 356, \u201cthe Legislature . . . has denied all judges but the administrative head of the court authority to exercise ... [the postponement] power.\u201d Judge Powers explained, 20 Md.App. at 572-573, 318 A.2d 243:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">\u201cFirst, we must understand whose exercise of discretion is being reviewed. Not the discretion of [the trial judge] for Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 591 took away his power to postpone the trial date of a criminal case. The rule we stated in <em>Jennings v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 321, 259 A.2d 547 (1969) when we said that \u2018The granting or denial of a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court\u2019 was modified by \u00a7 591, which vested the exclusive power to postpone the trial date of a criminal case in the administrative judge of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In <em>Hughes v. State, </em>288 Md. 216, 229, 421 A.2d 69 (1980), Judge Smith for this Court pointed out that, under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, it is the administrative judge who exercises the discretion to postpone a case and whose determination is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Consequently, with regard to the postponement of a criminal trial for good cause, it is the administrative judge\u2019s exercise of judgment with which those later reviewing the matter are concerned. Another nisi prius judge, ruling on a motion to dismiss for an alleged violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, has been deprived of the authority to exercise independent judgment concerning good cause for postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Although \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 transfer the authority to postpone a criminal trial from any trial judge to the administrative judge or his designee, the statute and rule do not purport to change the standards for reviewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>decision on a postponement application. The determination that there was or was not good cause for the postponement of a criminal trial has traditionally been viewed as a discretionary matter, rarely subject to reversal upon review.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As Chief Judge Brune stated for the Court in <em>Schroder v. State, </em>206 Md. 261, 265, 111 A.2d 587 (1955):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201cIt has long been a well settled rule in this State that the granting or refusing of a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be set aside on appeal unless the exercise of that discretion has been arbitrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Earlier, this Court dismissed an appeal from several criminal convictions where the only claim of error was that the trial judge had erroneously ruled on a request for a postponement, saying <em>(Harris v. State, </em>141 Md. 526, 530, 119 A. 154 (1922):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201cBut the established rule in this State, supported by an unbroken line of decisions, is that an application for a continuance of a case is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and unless that discretion is exercised arbitrarily, the action of the court on such an application <em>is not subject to review or appeal. 2 Poe, Pl. &amp; Pr. </em>sec. 178; <em>Cumberland Coal &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>McKaig, </em>27 Md. 258; <em>Dean v.

State, </em>193 Md. 596, 600, 69 A.2d 505 (1949), Chief Judge Marbury for the Court set forth the standard of review as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u201cThere is no question that the granting or refusal of a motion for a continuance or for fixing the date for a trial rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and will not be disturbed except for arbitrary action or <em>clear </em>abuse of judicial discretion.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Finally, the party challenging the discretionary ruling on a motion for a postponement has the burden of demonstrating a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>288 Md. at 229, 421 A.2d 69; <em>Jackson v. State, supra, </em>214 Md. at 459, 135 A.2d 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">As previously mentioned, neither \u00a7 591 nor Rule 746, as presently written, reflect an intent to change the established Maryland law concerning the review of a discretionary decision on the postponement of a criminal trial. While the discretionary authority over postponement is transferred from any trial judge to the administrative judge or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>designee, nothing in the language of the statute or rule authorizes a broader scope of review of the discretionary decision. Thus, when a criminal trial has been postponed beyond the 180-day period as a result of an order by the administrative judge, and when another judge is entertaining a motion to dismiss under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, the latter\u2019s review of the \u201cgood cause\u201d finding is subject to the limitations imposed by the above cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">There is another reason why the judgment of the administrative judge, concerning the need for a postponement and the rescheduling of a criminal case, should be accorded the greatest weight. As the above-cited cases illustrate, long before the enactment of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, the law required that there be good cause for the postponement of a trial. <em>See, </em>in addition, <em>Marsh v. Johns, </em>49 Md. 569, 571 (1878) (\u201cNo trial should be postponed unless there is some legal ground shown, or the Court is satisfied that justice requires a postponement\u201d); 3 WHARTON\u2019S CRIMINAL PROCEDURE \u00a7 423, at 161 (12th ed. 1975). The essential changes in the law effected by \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, as presently written and as construed in <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Goins, </em>are the provision for the 180-day deadline and the requirement that only the administrative judge can postpone a trial beyond that deadline. The major safeguard contemplated by the statute and rule, for assuring that criminal trials are not needlessly postponed beyond the 180-day period, is the requirement that the administrative judge or his designee, rather than any judge, order the postponement. This is a logical safeguard, as it is the administrative judge who has an overall view of the court\u2019s business, who is responsible \u201cfor the administration of the court,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> who assigns trial judges,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> who \u201csupervisefs] the assignment of actions for trial,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> who supervises the court personnel involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>assignment of cases, and who receives reports from such personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Consequently, the administrative judge is ordinarily in a much better position than another judge of the trial court, or an appellate court, to make the judgment as to whether good cause for the postponement of a criminal case exists. Moreover, with regard to the extent of a postponement, even though the administrative judge may not personally select or approve the new trial date in a postponed case, such selection is made by personnel operating under his supervision and reporting to him. When he postpones a case, he is generally aware of the state of the docket in the future, the number of cases set for trial, and the normal time it will likely take before the case can be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">This is not to say that a trial judge has no role when there is a motion to dismiss based upon an asserted violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. As the <em>Hicks </em>and <em>Goins </em>cases make clear, a trial judge entertaining such a motion must ordinarily grant it if the case was not tried within 180 days and if the trial was not postponed beyond that deadline in accordance with the statute and rule. But in making this determination, when reviewing a postponement beyond the 180-day deadline ordered by the administrative judge, deference must be accorded the judgment of the administrative judge and those assignment personnel acting under his supervision. We hold, therefore, as follows: with regard to both components of the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement in \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, the trial judge (as well as an appellate court) shall not find an absence of good cause unless the defendant meets the burden of demonstrating either a clear abuse of discretion or a lack of good cause as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Turning to the critical postponement orders in the cases at bar, we are unable to conclude that there was a clear abuse of discretion or an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">As previously indicated, the defendants\u2019 principal contention is that, \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d there is an absence of good cause when postponements are due to \u201can overcrowded docket.\u201d This argument relates to the orders of December 14,1981, and January 6,1982, in the <em>Frazier </em>and <em>Shaw eases, </em>as well as the length of the delays from the critical postponement orders to the new trial dates in all four cases.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In some jurisdictions having statutes or rules similar to \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, courts have indicated that, whereas chronic court congestion is ordinarily not regarded as good cause for postponement, nonchronic congestion does not preclude a finding of good cause. The Supreme Court of Iowa has stated very recently <em>(State v. Bond, </em>340 N.W.2d 276 (Iowa 1983)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">\u201cWhen the State contends \u2018court congestion\u2019 is the reason for delay, the trial court must distinguish between chronic court congestion and specific circumstances arising out of unique, non-recurring events which create a particular scheduling problem. <em>Compare State v. Leonard, </em>240 N.W.2d 690, 692-93 (Iowa 1976) (complexity of case and general docket congestion not good cause for continuance), and <em>State v. Hines, </em>225 N.W.2d 156, 158-59 (Iowa 1975) (failure to staff courtroom with sufficient jurors not good cause for continuance), <em>with State v. Jennings, </em>195 N.W.2d [351] at 355-56 [(Iowa 1972)] (illness and vacation of several judges and early rescheduling of trial of defendant out on bond constituted good cause). <em>Cf. State v. Hathaway, </em>257 N.W.2d 735, 736-37 (Iowa 1977) (good cause for late filing of trial information established because all judges out of town on required filing day).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\"><em>See Garrison v.

Alvarez, </em>189 Neb. 281, 289-290, 202 N.W.2d 604 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The basis for the distinction may relate to the purpose of the speedy trial rules or statutes. In states where the purpose is not only to protect the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial but, like \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, to further society\u2019s interest in the prompt disposition of criminal trials<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> by providing an impetus to remedy court conges<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>tion, some courts have found court congestion to constitute good cause for delay where either the courts or the legislature have acted to remedy the congestion. <em>See, e.g., People v. Schinzel, supra, </em>296 N.W.2d at 86-87; <em>State v. Alvarez, supra, </em>189 Neb. at 289-290, 202 N.W.2d 604. <em>Cf. People v.

Mack, supra, </em>576 P.2d at 47 (inefficient procedures, <em>inter alia, </em>preclude finding of good cause). <em>See also State v. Rogers, </em>402 So.2d 50 (Fla.App.1981) (riots constitute circumstances warranting delay); <em>State v. Lord, </em>63 Haw. 270, 625 P.2d 1038 (1981) (an unusually large number of indictments constitutes a circumstance justifying postponement).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The defendants\u2019 argument, that overcrowded dockets cannot as a matter of law constitute good cause for the postponement of a criminal case, is illogical. When overcrowded dockets are due in part to shortages of judges, prosecuting attorneys, public defenders, supporting personnel, or facilities, it must be remembered that public resources are not unlimited and there are many competing demands upon public funds. Moreover, even if there were no deficiencies in the number of judges, prosecutors, public defenders, etc., overcrowded docket situations are sometimes inescapable. As earlier explained, the nature of any reasonable scheduling system and the inherent lack of certainty concerning the number of cases which will be fully tried or the length of trials, will on occasions lead to overcrowded dockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>The Circuit Court for Baltimore City has implemented a thorough and entirely reasonable system for the scheduling of criminal cases. It has been a successful system. The average disposition time for a criminal case is 139 days after <em>filing. </em>Karwacki, <em>Countdown To Supreme Bench Consolidation, supra, </em>at 6. The average time from arraignment or the first appearance of counsel would be less. Moreover, the proportion of criminal cases which must be postponed by the administrative judge beyond the 180-day deadline, and in which the defendant did not seek or expressly consent to such postponement, is less than two percent. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City is not \u201cchronically congested.\u201d To the extent that there are overcrowded docket situations, the court has devised a workable system to deal with them. The situation in Baltimore City thus differs greatly from that involved in <em>State v. Mack, supra, </em>576 P.2d at 47, which led the Supreme Court of Washington to comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">\u201cInsofar as the record is concerned, neither court appears to have attempted to modify the current procedure or to adopt a more efficient one.... Self-created hardship is not an excuse for violating mandatory rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">From 1971 until 1980, when \u00a7 591 and later Rule 746 required \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d for the postponement of a criminal case, it was arguable that, as a matter of law, overcrowded dockets did not constitute sufficient cause for a postponement. In its 1980 legislative session, however, the General Assembly re-examined \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hicks. </em>Various bills were introduced at that session to change the statute and the rule. For example, one bill would have removed felony cases from the operation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, expressly providing that a felony case could not be dismissed if the trial date exceeded the statutory deadline.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Another bill would have changed the word \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 591 to \u201cmay.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> A different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>bill expressly stated that the provisions of \u00a7 591(a) \u201care directory only and not mandatory,\u201d and would have added a new section to \u00a7 591 embodying four factors to be considered in determining whether the accused was denied a speedy trial.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Another bill would have provided that the postponement of a criminal case beyond the deadline \u201cmay not be the sole reason for dismissal but may be a factor to be considered by the judge in determining whether the accused has been denied a speedy trial.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Finally, it was proposed that the \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d standard in \u00a7 591 be changed to \u201ccause\u201d or to \u201cgood cause.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Different groups advocated one or another of these proposals. For example, both the Maryland Chiefs of Police Association and the Baltimore City Police Department recommended \u201cmaking time frames for prosecution in criminal cases directory as expressed in [several] bills, rather than mandatory.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">All of these proposals were rejected by the General Assembly except for the one changing \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d to \u201cgood cause.\u201d Ch. 378 of the Acts of 1980. Consequently, while the Legislature chose to retain the scope and mandatory nature of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, it also clearly intended to expand those circumstances furnishing the requisite cause for postponing a trial date beyond 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The testimony before the House Judiciary Committee by a sponsor of one of the proposals to change \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d to \u201cgood cause\u201d is instructive. Delegate Pica, after reviewing the <em>Hicks </em>decision, testified as follows (testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, February 12, 1980, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>contained in the file of the Department of Legislative reference):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cWhat we are really doing here is attempting to amend the law in order to <em>offer the courts some leeway in the disposition of an extremely heavy case load. According to some estimates, the number of criminal cases in Baltimore City alone has increased 50% in the last few years. The strain on the courts and the strain on the prosecution is rising sharply.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">Sec. 591 of Art. 27 illustrates the legislative intent that a defendant be brought to trial within six months of his arraignment. Rule 746 further narrowed that period to 120 days. Subsequent to the <em>Hicks </em>case, and fearful of its effects, the Maryland Court of Appeals enacted an emergency amendment to Rule 746 changing the 120 day period to 180 days.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The witness then discussed the \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d requirement of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 \u201cwhich is really the culprit here.\u201d He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201cIt is the culprit because it confines the judgment of the court to postponing only those cases where extraordinary cause is shown to change the trial date. <em>The growth of the number of cases being brought into criminal court has dramatically increased, resulting in crowded and backlogged court dockets. </em>The <em>Hicks </em>decision suggests that a defendant\u2019s confinement out of state may be extraordinary cause <em>but that crowded court dockets may not. Hicks\u2019 </em>holding has created fear among prosecutors and judges alike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">\u201cThough the Court of Appeals, in a timely decision to prevent that possibility, enacted an emergency measure to amend the time limit to a 180 day period, I believe it is now time for the' Legislature to focus on providing the courts with the tools it needs to operate efficiently and constitutionally in a judicial environment wholly dependent upon the level of the case load.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u201cI have introduced three bills that I offer this Committee for deliberation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">\u201cThe third, and perhaps best alternative, H.B. 615, allows a court to do what they do best \u2014 to consider all the circumstances and grant delay of the trial based upon the facts of the case, and without harm or prejudice to the defendant. The bill accomplishes this result by removing the extraordinary cause requirements for a postponement and replacing it with the requirement of showing \u2018good cause\u2019 for a change in trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201cH.B. 615 maintains the original scope of Rule 746 in requiring that defendant be brought to trial within 180 days, a guideline that should be met unless good cause for not doing so is exhibited by one of the parties. The good cause requirement unbinds the hands of the Judiciary in having to choose between the dismissal of a case because it did not fall within the 180 day period, and the more rational choice of allowing the case to go forth upon a showing that good cause existed for its not being set within that period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\u201cWith our prosecutors\u2019 pressure to deal daily <em>with hundreds of new cases, and our courts burdened by a jamfilled docket, the necessity of granting to the courts the language they need to operate effectively in light of the Hicks decision becomes </em>imperative.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ath\">The House Judiciary Committee went on to report favorably upon the proposal to change \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d to \u201cgood cause,\u201d and the General Assembly enacted that proposal. This change, particularly in light of the testimony before the Committee, clearly indicated a legislative intent that crowded court dockets may constitute sufficient cause for trying a case beyond the 180-day deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">We therefore reject the defendants\u2019 argument that, as a matter of law, an overcrowded docket situation cannot justify either a change of trial date or the length of the delay until the new trial date. When the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>judge or his designee postpones a case beyond the 180-day deadline because of court unavailability, there is a violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 only if it is demonstrated that the change of trial date, or the period of time until a new trial date, represented a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">No such abuse of discretion was shown in the present cases. There is nothing in these records indicating that the administrative judge was not warranted in postponing the <em>Frazier </em>case on December 14, 1981, and the <em>Shaw </em>case on January 6,1982, because of the unavailability of a court and the number of cases on the move list. Moreover, there was no showing in any of the four cases that the lengths of the delays following the critical postponements represented a clear abuse of discretion by the administrative judge and/or the assignment personnel acting under his supervision. As far as the records show, the first available new dates for trials were assigned. There may arise cases in which the inordinate length of time until the new trial date will itself be prima facie evidence of undue delay, shifting the burden to the State to show justification. In our view, however, none of the cases at bar fall into this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The changes of the November 5, 1981, trial date in the <em>Weems and Patton </em>case and the January 7, 1982, trial date in the <em>Richardson </em>case, were not because of overcrowded dockets. Nevertheless, we do not believe that Judge Karwacki clearly abused his discretion in ordering either postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The <em>Weems and Patton </em>case obviously could not be tried on the November 5, 1981, trial date because of the absence of the defendants, the witnesses and one of the defense counsel. <em>See Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 319, 403 A.2d 356. That this inability was due to the courtroom clerk\u2019s mistake on October 14, 1981, in not assuring that the postponement form was filled out and transmitted to the Assignment Office, did not preclude Judge Karwacki from finding good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>cause for a postponement. In the finest assignment system, mistakes will sometimes be made. There is no indication that the mistake made here was anything but an isolated instance or that the postponement form procedure in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City fails to operate efficiently. An occasional human error by court personnel, leading to circumstances which prevent a case from being tried, does not represent the type of chronic delay which \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 were designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">The January 7, 1982, postponement in the <em>Richardson </em>case was similar. The absence of the defendant on the January 7th trial date necessitated a postponement. That this absence was caused by the Division of Correction\u2019s failure to identify in time which of three Mark Richardsons was the defendant, does not compel the conclusion that the postponement was unsupported by good cause. What happened also appears to have been an isolated instance rather than a recurring problem leading to chronic trial delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The 180-day deadline set forth in \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 is not absolute. As we stated in <em>Goins, </em>293 Md. at 112, 442 A.2d 550, the statute and rule contain their own mechanism for postponing a case beyond the 180-day limit, which is an order, based on a finding of good cause, by the administrative judge. In these cases, as in <em>Goins, </em>\u201cthe mechanism of the statute and rule was followed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The motions to dismiss in all four cases, insofar as they were grounded upon \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, should have been denied. As previously mentioned, however, there were other pre-trial motions and constitutional speedy trial arguments which were not considered by the trial judges and must be decided upon remand.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>JUDGMENTS OF THE CRIMINAL COURT OF BALTIMORE (NOW THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY) REVERSED, AND CASES REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

In addition, we take judicial notice of the operation and practices of the courts of this State, <em>Davidson v.

After a trial date is assigned, there is a computerized procedure for sending a notice and summons to the defendant 28 days and 9 days before trial, and if he is incarcerated a writ of habeas corpus is issued to the institution. The defense attorney receives a notice of the trial date as soon as it is placed in the computer, another notice 28 days before trial, and a third notice 9 days before trial. All witnesses receive a mailed summons 28 days prior to trial and a personal service summons from the Sheriff 9 days before trial, and if a witness is incarcerated a writ is issued to the institution. <em>See </em>Riggin, <em>Circuit Court for Baltimore City </em>\u2014 Criminal <em>Court Overview, supra, </em>at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b471-5\">. As Assignment Commissioner Riggin testified in the instant cases, in addition to the two regular \u201cmove courts,\u201d each judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City \u201cfunctions as a potential move court if he should complete his docket.\u201d Such judge is available for the purpose of absorbing an \u201coverflow\u201d of criminal cases or receiving them from an overburdened judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\">. When judges or other personnel in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City refer to the unavailability of a \u201ccourt\u201d or \u201ccourtroom,\u201d they are referring to the lack of a trial judge and not the absence of a physical facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\">. Under subsections c and d of Rule 736, a motion capable of determination before trial, which would ordinarily include a motion to dismiss for an alleged violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, may be filed at any time before trial and is required to be in writing \u201cunless the court otherwise directs.\u201d In light of the quoted language, the trial court in its discretion may entertain an oral motion to dismiss such as made in the <em>Frazier </em>case. Even if the quoted language had not been contained in the Rule, the trial judge\u2019s willingness to entertain an oral motion is the type of action which would not be reviewable on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion.

In addition, the postponement form incorrectly indicated that there had been no prior postponements, that there had been no requests for a speedy trial, and that one of the defense attorneys had consented to the postponement.

In addition to the two arguments made in all of the cases, the State in its brief in the <em>Richardson </em>case, as it did in the trial court, places some reliance on the defense attorney\u2019s failure to object to the postponement on January 7, 1982, and failure to object at the time a new trial date was selected. Nevertheless, the trial judge was clearly correct in holding that the defense attorney\u2019s failure to object would not preclude a dismissal if \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 were violated. The defense attorney\u2019s conduct in this case is not what was contemplated in <em>Hicks </em>when we stated that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u201ccircumstance where it is inappropriate to dismiss the criminal charges is where the defendant, either individually or by his attorney, seeks or expressly consents to a trial date in violation of Rule 746.\u201d 285 Md. at 335, 403 A.2d 356.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">And in <em>Goins, </em>with respect to certain allegedly dilatory conduct by defense counsel, we held (293 Md. at 108, 442 A.2d 550):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">\u201cAt best, it might arguably constitute an <em>implied </em>consent to a postponement of the trial date, depending upon the circumstances.

Once trial starts, stale cases are more easily challenged by defense attorneys on cross examination. Juries are often disenchanted with offenses that have occurred in the remote past. If prosecution witnesses become unavailable over long periods of time or prosecutorial ardor should wane, the guilty benefit at society's expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\u201cAside from affecting the probabilities of obtaining a conviction, the speedy trial right has significant impacts upon the quality of judicial action and the possibilities of future criminal conduct. The tendency to postpone trials adds to court congestion and the backlog of cases. To dispose of such backlog, plea bargaining is frequently utilized. In the interest of expediting matters accused persons receive lighter sentences than those they actually may have deserved. A second impact of delay is to weaken the deterrent effect that the criminal justice system should have on would-be criminals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">\u201cFinally, the speedy trial right is intricately related to the needs of a well ordered society in several other respects. Guilty persons released on bail for too long tend to commit other crimes or flee the jurisdiction of the courts altogether. Defendants who are not bailed must spend \u2018dead\u2019 time in local jails exposed to conditions destructive of human character. For those who are eventually found innocent, their potential to be contributing members of society through any kind of employment is lost during pre-trial incarceration. On the other hand, the possibility of rehabilitating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>those who are eventually found guilty is diminished since correction procedures cannot be started until after trial.

I do not agree. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\"><em>State v. Frazier </em>and <em>State v. Shaw</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aty\">The majority in <em>Frazier </em>and <em>Shaw </em>determines that \u201c[w]hen the administrative judge or his designee postpones a case beyond the 180-day deadline because of court unavailability, there is a violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 only if it is demonstrated that the change of trial date, or the period of time until a new trial date, represented a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d It concludes that \u201c[n]o such abuse of discretion was shown in the present cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In my view, court unavailability can, under certain circumstances, constitute good cause for postponement of a criminal case beyond the 180-day period prescribed by Art. 27, \u00a7 591 and Md.Rule 746. Unavailability of a court resulting from \u201cchronic court congestion,\u201d in and of itself, ordinarily does not constitute good cause; whereas unavailability of a court resulting from \u201cnonchronic court congestion\u201d ordinarily constitutes good cause. Because, in my view, in <em>Frazier </em>and <em>Shaw </em>the unavailability of a court resulted from \u201cchronic court congestion,\u201d there was no good cause for postponement. Therefore, I, unlike my colleagues, find that an abuse of discretion was shown in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The terms \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d and \u201cnonchronic court congestion\u201d are derived from the ABA, Standards for Criminal Justice, Speedy Trial (1980), and its accompanying Commentary. Standard 12-2.3 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0bR\">\u201cThe following periods should be excluded in computing the time for trial:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">\u201c(b) the period of delay resulting from congestion of the trial docket when the congestion is attributable to exceptional circumstances... . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The Commentary to ABA, Speedy Trial Standard 12-2.3(b) at 28-29 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u201cAlthough it is appropriate to allow added time under certain exceptional circumstances, such as those that result in the unavailability of the prosecutor or the judge at the time the trial is scheduled, delay arising out of the chronic congestion of the trial docket should not be excused. ... Under the Supreme Court balancing test, docket congestion may be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">\u201cAlthough it is fair to expect the state to provide the machinery needed to dispose of the usual business of the courts promptly, it does not appear feasible to impose the same requirements when certain unique, nonrecurring events have produced an inordinate number of cases for court disposition. Thus, when a large-scale riot or other mass public disorder has occurred, some leeway for additional time is required to ensure that the many resulting cases will receive adequate attention from the prosecutor's office, defense counsel (possibly a single defender office), and the judiciary.\u201d (Footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Thus, although the term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d has not been expressly defined, the Commentary describes \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d as congestion arising from unique, nonrecurring events that create a particular scheduling problem or produce an inordinate number of cases for court disposition. Events such as the illness or death of a prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>tor, defense counsel or judge on the day a trial is scheduled, or riots or other public disturbances are illustrative of such unique, nonrecurring events.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Courts in some jurisdictions having statutes or rules similar to Art. 27, \u00a7 591 and Md.Rule 746 that have considered the circumstances in which court congestion constitutes the requisite cause for postponement have determined, as stated by the majority, that \u201cchronic court congestion is ordinarily not regarded as good cause for postponement, [but] non-chronic congestion does not preclude a finding of good cause.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Illustrative is the case of <em>People v. Forrest, </em>72 Mich.App. 266, 273, 249 N.W.2d 384, 388 (1976), where the Court of Appeals of Michigan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cIn the case at bar the people have not made an affirmative showing of unavoidable delays which might justify this inaction. A mere recitation of the factor of a crowded docket, without more, cannot warrant visiting on the incarcerated defendant a longer imprisonment than might otherwise be in store. If congestion and delay result from inadequate court staffing or funding, the inevitable results of those delays must fall upon the people, who have the power to remedy court congestion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The rationale underlying the view that \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d does not ordinarily constitute good cause was expressed in the Commentary to ABA, Speedy Trial Standard 12 \u2014 2.3(b) at 29 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u201c... (1) the defendant can be prejudiced by delay, whatever the source; (2) such delays are contrary to the public interest in the prompt disposition of criminal cases; (3) <em>if congestion excuses long delays, there is insufficient inducement for the state to remedy congestion; </em>and (4) the calendar problems that arise out of trying to make maximum use of existing facilities do not ordinarily require time beyond that otherwise allowed. But, while delay because of failure to provide sufficient resources to dispose of the usual number of cases within the speedy trial time limits is not excused, the standard does recognize congestion as justifying added delay when \u2018attributable to exceptional circumstances.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Thus, it has been recognized that if \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d ordinarily constitutes good cause for delay, the purposes of statutory prompt trial requirements will be undermined. It is for this reason that I am persuaded that \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d ordinarily should not be regarded as good cause for postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">This conclusion is also supported by the historical development of Maryland\u2019s statutory prompt trial requirements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The requirement that criminal cases be tried promptly is deeply rooted in our English law heritage. <em>See Klopfer v. North Carolina, </em>386 U.S. 213, 223, 87 S.Ct. 988, 993, 18 L.Ed.2d 1 (1967). This requirement first appeared in the Magna Charta of 1215 and is presently embodied in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the constitutions of almost all of the 50 states. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md. Declaration of Rights, \u25a0 Art. 21. By 1960, court systems throughout the United States had become burdened by \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d manifested by overcrowded dockets, backlogs, and unavailability of courts, prosecutors, and defense attorneys. This \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d inevita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>bly caused delay in the trial of criminal cases. As stated by the American Bar Association in 1968:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\"><em>\u201cCongestion in the trial courts of this </em>country, <em>particularly in urban centers, is currently one of the major problems of judicial administration. </em>Notwithstanding the usual rule that criminal cases have priority over civil cases, this congestion has created serious difficulties for the administration of criminal justice. <em>The continued pressures upon existing resources have been such that it is extremely difficult to dispose of all criminal cases with promptness and with due regard for fair procedures.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">Several approaches to this problem are possible and desirable. The most obvious, but perhaps the most difficult, is that of finding means for reducing the amount of criminal conduct, such as by attacking poverty and other crime stimuli. Another is to overcome society's reluctance to provide the necessary resources \u2014 more prosecutors, judges, courtrooms, and court personnel \u2014 for prompt processing of all cases reaching the courts. <em>Still other approaches involve the structuring of improvements in criminal procedure, particularly by advancing the efficiency of the process while at the same time ensuring its fairness and </em>effectiveness.\u201d ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Speedy Trial at 1 (Approved Draft 1968) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Recognizing that \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d inevitably causes delay in the trial of criminal cases, Maryland, like many other states, adopted the approach of enacting statutes and promulgating court rules requiring that criminal trials be held within a prescribed period of time. <em>See </em>Note, <em>The Right to a Speedy Criminal Trial, </em>57 Colum.L.Rev. 846, 847 (1957). By ch. 212 of the Acts of 1971, the General Assembly declared a \u201clegislative policy designed to obtain prompt disposition of criminal charges. ... \u201d <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 316, 403 A.2d 356, 359, on motion for reconsideration, 285 Md. 334, 403 A.2d 368 (1979). That act required that all criminal cases be tried within six months unless the trial was postponed for \u201cextraordinary cause.\u201d These re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>quirements were subsequently embodied in former Md.Rule 740, effective 1 June 1972. Nevertheless, because these requirements were held to be \u201cdirectory,\u201d not mandatory, <em>Young v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 707, 292 A.2d 137, <em>summarily aff\u2019d, </em>266 Md. 438, 294 A.2d 467 (1972), the legislative policy, designed to obtain the prompt disposition of criminal charges, was \u201clargely unheeded\u201d and, therefore, not implemented. <em>Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 317, 403 A.2d at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In 1977, this Court promulgated Md.Rule 746 which required that all criminal cases be tried within 120 days unless the trial was postponed for \u201cextraordinary cause.\u201d Subsequently, in <em>Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 334-35, 403 A.2d at 369, we overruled <em>Young. </em>There, we made it clear that \u201c[t]he provisions of Rule 746 are of mandatory application, binding upon the prosecution and defense alike; they are not mere guides or bench marks to be observed, if convenient.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 318; 403 A.2d at 360. Additionally, we made it clear that \u201cdismissal of the criminal charges is the appropriate sanction where the State fails to bring the case to trial within the 120-day period prescribed by the rule and where \u2018extraordinary cause\u2019 justifying a trial postponement has not been established.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 318, 403 A.2d at 360. We expressly stated that the dismissal sanction was \u201ca prophylactic measure designed to insure compliance with the requirements imposed on the State regarding prompt trials of criminal cases.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 337, 403 A.2d at 370. By employing the sanction of dismissal in all criminal cases that are not tried within the statutorily prescribed time period, unless the requisite cause is shown, this Court attempted to create an incentive for trial courts to design and implement efficient and fair procedures that would eliminate delay caused by \u201cchronic court congestion.\u201d Thus, we \u201cput teeth\u201d into the requirements governing prompt trials. <em>Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 318, 403 A.2d at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Subsequently, considerable concern arose as to the practicability of the principles articulated in <em>Hicks. </em>In 1979, this Court amended Md.Rule 746 to prescribe a 180-day period, rather than a 120-day period, for the trial of all criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>cases. By ch. 378 of the Acts of 1980, the General Assembly amended Art. 27, \u00a7 591 to prescribe a 180-day, rather than a six-month, period for the trial of all criminal cases and a \u201cgood cause\u201d rather than an \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d standard for postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">As the majority recognizes, the legislative history of the 1980 amendment \u201cclearly intended to expand those circumstances furnishing the requisite cause for postponing a trial date beyond 180 days.\u201d Indeed, Delegate John A. Pica, Jr., a sponsor of one of the proposals to change \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d to \u201cgood cause\u201d said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">\u201cWhat we are really doing here is attempting to amend the law in order to <em>offer the courts some leeway </em>in the disposition of an extremely heavy case load.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">The growth of the number of cases being brought into criminal court has dramatically increased, resulting in crowded and backlogged court dockets. The <em>Hicks </em>decision suggests that a defendant\u2019s confinement out of state may be extraordinary cause but that crowded court dockets may not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">The third, and perhaps best alternative, H.B. 615, <em>allows a court to do what they do best </em>\u2014 to <em>consider all the circumstances and grant delay of the trial based upon the facts of the case, </em>and without harm or prejudice to the defendant. The bill accomplishes this result by removing the extraordinary cause requirements for a postponement and replacing it with the requirement of showing \u2018good cause\u2019 for a change in trial date.\u201d Testimony on H.B. 351, 614 and 615 before the House Judiciary Committee, 12 February 1980.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Although Delegate Pica indicated concern that under <em>Hicks </em>\u201ccrowded court dockets may not\u201d be regarded as \u201cextraordinary cause,\u201d he did not, however, suggest that \u201cchronic court congestion,\u201d in and of itself, should constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>I agree with the majority that the 1980 amendment \u201cclearly indicated a legislative intent that crowded court dockets may constitute sufficient cause for trying a case beyond the 180-day deadline.\u201d In my view, however, that amendment does not show that the General Assembly intended that \u201cchronic court congestion,\u201d in and of itself, should constitute good cause. Rather, particularly in light of Delegate Pica\u2019s testimony, that amendment shows that the General Assembly intended that the question whether court unavailability constituted good cause \u2014 whether it resulted from \u201cchronic\u201d or \u201cnonchronic court congestion\u201d \u2014 like every other question relating to \u201cgood cause,\u201d should be determined by the administrative judge\u2019s exercise of discretion based upon the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Finally, the legislative history of the 1980 amendment also reveals that the General Assembly consistently rejected the notion of restricting the application of the dismissal sanction or eliminating it entirely. Thus, the General Assembly evidenced its intent that the prophylactic sanction of dismissal be retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The basic approach adopted by the General Assembly is clear. All criminal cases were to be tried within the statutorily prescribed time period unless postponed for good cause. The administrative judge was authorized to determine on a case-by-case basis whether court unavailability constituted good cause \u2014 whether it resulted from \u201cchronic\u201d or \u201cnon-chronic court congestion.\u201d The sanction of dismissal was to be retained as an incentive for trial courts to continue to implement efficient and fair procedures that would eliminate delay caused by \u201cchronic court congestion.\u201d Manifestly, the 1980 amendment to the statutory prompt trial requirements did not alter the General Assembly\u2019s purpose of eliminating delay caused by \u201cchronic court congestion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In 1980, this Court amended Md.Rule 746 to conform to the statute. In 1982, in <em>Goins v. State, </em>293 Md. 97, 442 A.2d 550 (1982), we reaffirmed the principles established in <em>Hicks </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that \u201cput teeth\u201d into the requirements governing prompt trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">My review of the historical development and legislative history of Maryland\u2019s statutory prompt trial requirements compels me to conclude that \u201cchronic court congestion,\u201d in and of itself, ordinarily does not constitute good cause for postponement. This conclusion is also supported by the existing interrelationship between the Sixth Amendment prompt trial requirement and the statutory prompt trial requirements. I agree with the majority that \u201c\u00a7 591 and Rule 746 were not intended to be codifications of the constitutional speedy trial right but stand \u2018on a different legal footing.\u2019 \u201d Nevertheless, in my dissenting opinion in <em>Hicks </em>I expressed the view that the Sixth Amendment prompt trial requirement and the statutory prompt trial requirements are interrelated. There, I said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">\u201cIt is clear, therefore, that statutory prompt trial requirements are intended to, and do in fact, broaden the scope and applicability of the Sixth Amendment requirement and increase its effectiveness in reducing delay by mandating that trials be held more promptly than is required by the Sixth Amendment. Those statutory requirements implement, effectuate, and \u2018put teeth\u2019 into the Sixth Amendment. Given this interrelationship, it would be, in my view, incongruous to interpret a statutory requirement as being narrower in scope and applicability and, therefore, less effective than the Sixth Amendment requirement.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 327, 403 A.2d at 365 (Davidson, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">I adhere to the view that the statutory prompt trial requirements were intended to implement the Sixth Amendment prompt trial requirement and to increase its effectiveness in reducing delay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If this objective is to be effectuated, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>statutory prompt trial requirements must be interpreted as being broader in scope and applicability than the Sixth Amendment prompt trial requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">This Court has repeatedly recognized that under the Sixth Amendment prompt trial requirement the responsibility for delay caused by \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d manifested by overcrowded dockets, unavailability of courts, and scheduling problems rests upon the courts and, therefore, that unintentional delay caused by \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d is inexcusable and must be weighed against the State. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>281 Md. 640, 652, 382 A.2d 1053, 1063, <em>cert, denied, </em>439 U.S. 839, 99 S.Ct. 126, 58 L.Ed.2d 136 (1978); <em>Jones v. State, </em>279 Md. 1, 12, 367 A.2d 1, 8-9 (1976), <em>cert, denied, </em>431 U.S. 915, 97 S.Ct. 2177, 53 L.Ed.2d 225 (1977); <em>Smith v. State, </em>276 Md. 521, 529, 531, 350 A.2d 628, 633, 634-35 (1976); <em>Epps v. State, </em>276 Md. 96, 114-15, 345 A.2d 62, 74 (1975). Thus, in <em>Epps v. State, </em>276 Md. at 114-15, 345 A.2d at 74 (1975), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201c[A] delay in affording a criminal defendant a \u2018speedy trial\u2019 because of over-crowded court dockets and scheduling problems, the responsibility for which rests upon both the courts and the prosecutors, cannot be classified as wholly \u2018neutral\u2019 and must be included within the period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>delay in determining whether there has been a denial of this constitutional right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Consequently, this Court has recognized that under the Sixth Amendment prompt trial requirement, the State has a duty to provide a prompt trial even though \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d exists and its failure to do so is inexcusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Under the statutory prompt trial requirements, the State has a duty to provide a prompt trial unless there is good cause for postponement. If \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d is regarded as good cause then, under the statutory prompt trial requirements, the State has a duty to provide a prompt trial unless \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d exists. Such an interpretation leads to the conclusion that under the statutory prompt trial requirements the State has no duty to provide a prompt trial when \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d exists. Thus, its failure to provide a prompt trial is, excused. Indeed, that failure not only is excused, but is itself a justification for delay. Thus, the State\u2019s failure to comply with a standard of the Sixth Amendment requirement is transformed into a justification for delay. This transformation narrows the scope and applicability of the statutory prompt trial requirements and makes them less effective in reducing delay than the Sixth Amendment requirement. Such a result is incongruous. For this reason, too, I am persuaded that \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d ordinarily does not constitute good cause for postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The majority, without defining the term \u201cchronic court congestion,\u201d finds that in Baltimore City \u201cthe proportion of criminal cases which must be postponed by the administrative judge beyond the 180-day deadline ... is less than two percent\u201d and, therefore, that \u201c[t]he Circuit Court for Baltimore City is not \u2018chronically congested.\u2019 \u201d It concludes that under these circumstances the unavailability of a court, in and of itself, constitutes good cause for postponement beyond the statutorily prescribed time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">There is, however, nothing in the legislative history to indicate that the General Assembly intended that all crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>nal cases be tried within 180 days, except for two percent of the cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> More important, the record shows that in both <em>Frazier </em>and <em>Shaw </em>the only reasons assigned for the postponement beyond the statutorily prescribed time period were premised upon the unavailability of a court and the number of cases on the \u201cmove list.\u201d Thus, there is nothing to show that the unavailability of a court that caused the postponement in <em>Frazier </em>and <em>Shaw </em>resulted from unique, nonrecurring events. There is nothing to show that the unavailability of a court was caused by an abrupt and unexpected increase in the number of criminal cases filed, or by a sharp and unexpected decrease in the number of available judges. Rather, the unavailability of a court here resulted from the ordinary recurrent events associated with the regular procedures utilized to handle the usual business of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Therefore, there was nothing to show that the unavailability of a court was caused by anything other than what I define as \u201cchronic court congestion.\u201d Accordingly, there was nothing to show that the postponements in <em>Frazier </em>and <em>Shaw </em>were caused by anything other than \u201cchronic court congestion.\u201d Under these circumstances, the majority\u2019s application of the principle announced in these cases, in my view, establishes that \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d that causes delay, in and of itself, constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d for delay. Such a result is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In determining that the court unavailability, resulting from \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d in <em>Frazier </em>and Shaw, in and of itself, constitutes good cause for delay, the majority has, in my view, undermined the purpose of both the General Assembly and this Court \u2014 to eliminate the delay caused by \u201cchronic court congestion.\u201d It has obviated the necessity for the administrative judge to exercise his discretion in determining whether court congestion constitutes good cause for delay. It has impeded the right of society and the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>to have all criminal cases tried within 180 days, notwithstanding the existence of \u201cchronic court congestion.\u201d In so doing, it has restricted the applicability of the dismissal sanction, thus destroying the incentive for trial courts to comply with the statutorily prescribed time period. In short, the majority has extracted the \u201cteeth\u201d that this Court in <em>Hicks </em>inserted into the requirements governing prompt trials of criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Although I agree with the majority\u2019s principle that court unavailability can, under certain circumstances, constitute good cause for postponement, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s application of that principle here because it is both illogical and destructive of the purpose of the statutory prompt trial requirements. In my view, under the present circumstances, the unavailability of a court resulting from \u201cchronic court congestion\u201d did not constitute good cause for a postponement in either <em>Frazier </em>or <em>Shaw. </em>Consequently, there was an abuse of discretion in granting these postponements. Accordingly, I would affirm the trial courts\u2019 judgments dismissing these cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\"><em>State v. Weems and Patton </em>and <em>State v. Richardson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">In <em>Weems and Patton, </em>the majority determines that \u201cthe courtroom clerk\u2019s mistake on October 14, 1981, in not assuring that the postponement form was filled out and transmitted to the Assignment Office,\u201d constitutes good cause for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>delay because allegedly it was an \u201cisolated instance.\u201d In <em>Richardson, </em>the majority determines that \u201cthe Division of Correction\u2019s failure to identify . .. which of three Mark Richardsons was the defendant,\u201d in time to bring him to court on the day of his trial constitutes good cause for delay because allegedly it was an \u201cisolated instance.\u201d I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">This Court has frequently described negligence as a lack of ordinary care under all circumstances. It consists of a failure to do what a reasonably prudent person would have done under similar circumstances. <em>Eastern Shore Public Service Co. v. Corbett, </em>227 Md. 411, 426, 177 A.2d 701, 709 (1962); <em>Vickers v. Starcher, </em>175 Md. 522, 531, 2 A.2d 678, 682 (1938); <em>Geiselman v. Schmidt, </em>106 Md. 580, 584, 68 A. 202, 204 (1907). Moreover, in applying the Sixth Amendment prompt trial requirement, this Court has reiterated that it is the duty of the State to bring the accused to trial, <em>Wilson, </em>281 Md. at 642, 382 A.2d at 1055; <em>Jones, </em>279 Md. at 7, 367 A.2d at 6; <em>see also Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 527, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2190, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), and that \u201cdereliction on the part of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office or the assignment office,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>276 Md. at 530, 350 A.2d at 634, as well as the State\u2019s failure to locate a defendant, particularly one incarcerated in Maryland, constitutes a breach of that duty, <em>Brady v. State, </em>291 Md. 261, 267, 434 A.2d 574, 577 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">According to the majority, the record in <em>State v. Weems and Patton </em>shows, with respect to the 5 November 1981 trial date, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">\u201c[T]he Assignment Commissioner indicated that the Assignment Office clerk attending the administrative judge\u2019s hearing on October 14,1981, should have seen to it that the necessary data was placed on the form and delivered to the Assignment Office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">According to the majority, however, the Assignment Office clerk at the 14 October 1981 postponement hearing failed \u201cto follow the normal procedure of filling out the standard postponement form and submitting it to the Assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Office.\u201d Manifestly, the Assignment Office clerk\u2019s failure to follow established procedures evidences a lack of ordinary care. Thus, this conduct constitutes negligence and is a breach of the State\u2019s duty to bring an accused to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Additionally, the record in <em>Weems and Patton </em>shows, as the majority recognizes, that the supervisor in the Assignment Office who initially scheduled the case for trial beyond the statutorily prescribed time period testified that she chose the earliest available date but did not ascertain whether that date was within the prescribed period. She stated that she relied upon the postponement clerk who normally checks to determine whether the trial date is within 180 days. The postponement clerk, however, testified that she did not follow her normal procedure of checking to determine whether the trial date was within the statutorily prescribed time period. Rather, she assumed that the supervisor who had selected the trial date \u201cwould have already screened it.\u201d The Assignment Commissioner acknowledged that there had been a \u201cslip up\u201d in his office\u2019s checking of the matter. He indicated that if the personnel in his office had been aware that the trial date had been set beyond the statutorily prescribed time period, an earlier trial date might have been secured. Nevertheless, he said that it was the ultimate responsibility of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to monitor the trial dates and to notify the Assignment Office of a problem. For unexplained reasons, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office did not notify the Assignment Office of any problem. Manifestly, the failure of both the Assignment Office and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to follow established procedures evidences a lack of ordinary care. Thus, this conduct constitutes negligence and is a breach of the State\u2019s duty to bring the defendants to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The record in <em>Richardson </em>shows that before a trial set for 7 January 1982, the defendant, Mark Richardson, was in the custody of the State Division of Correction serving a sentence on an unrelated conviction. On the morning of trial, the Division of Correction failed to locate the defendant, then in its custody, and therefore failed to bring him to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Circuit Court for Baltimore City for trial. The only explanation offered was that there were three persons named Mark Richardson in the Division\u2019s custody; that the Division \u201ccan\u2019t tell which Mark Richardson is which\u201d; and that according to the State\u2019s Attorney, the Division of Correction \u201cinadvertently brought the wrong defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The administrative judge directed that all three persons named Mark Richardson be brought to the courthouse for a \u201cline up\u201d at which time the defendant could be identified. Additionally, the administrative judge found that the State\u2019s failure to locate the defendant constituted good cause for delay. The Assignment Office set a trial date beyond the statutorily prescribed time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The record shows that there was no reason offered to explain why the Division of Correction was unable to determine which of the three persons in its custody named Mark Richardson was the defendant. Nor was there any reason offered to explain why the Division failed to pursue the obvious alternative, pursued by the administrative judge, of bringing all three persons named Mark Richardson to the courthouse on the morning of trial. Moreover, there was no reason offered to explain why the case had been scheduled for trial beyond the statutorily prescribed time period. Indeed, there was no evidence to show that a date within the statutorily prescribed time period was not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In my view, in the modern age of numbering systems, data processing, computers, photographs, and fingerprints, it is inexcusable neglect on the part of the Division of Correction not to know at all times the name, identity, and whereabouts of a person entrusted to its custody. That inexcusable neglect, coupled with the Division\u2019s failure to pursue the alternative of bringing all three persons named Mark Richardson to the courthouse on the day of trial, exacerbated by the unexplained failure to schedule the trial within the statutorily prescribed time period, constitutes negligence and is a breach of the State\u2019s duty to bring a defendant to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>The record shows that in <em>Weems and Patton </em>negligence and a breach of duty on the part of the Assignment Office was the cause of the postponement, and negligence and a breach of duty on the part of the Assignment Office and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office was the cause of the length of the delay. In <em>Richardson, </em>negligence and a breach of duty on the part of the Division of Correction was the cause of the postponement, and negligence and a breach of duty on the part of the Assignment Office was the cause of the length of the delay. Under these circumstances, the majority\u2019s application of the principle announced in these cases, in my view, establishes that negligence and a breach of duty on the part of the State, in and of itself, constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">In my view, the concept that negligence and a breach of duty cannot constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d is too elementary to require explication. <em>E.g., Sanders v. Heise, </em>117 Ariz. 524, 526, 573 P.2d 924, 926 (Ariz.App.1978) (failure of prosecutor\u2019s office to be properly apprised of its trial schedule and availability of witnesses); <em>Johnson v.

In light of the statutory prompt trial requirement that mandates that all criminal cases be tried within 180 days, except for good cause, the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>negligence in <em>Weems and Patton </em>and in <em>Richardson </em>may have been isolated instances is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In my view, under the present circumstances, the negligence of the State did not constitute good cause for either the postponement or the length of the delay in <em>Weems and Patton </em>and in <em>Richardson. </em>Consequently, there was an abuse of discretion in these cases. Accordingly, I would affirm the trial courts\u2019 judgments granting the motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In my view, the majority establishes the following four principles today:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">1) All criminal cases are to be tried within 180 days except for two percent of the cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">2) \u201cChronic court congestion\u201d is \u201cnonchronic court congestion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">3) \u201cChronic court congestion\u201d that causes delay is \u201cgood cause\u201d for delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-12\">4) Negligence and a breach of duty on the part of the State is \u201cgood cause\u201d for delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">Even in the year 1984,1 cannot in good conscience subscribe to such principles.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-11\">. Art. 27, \u00a7 591 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">\u201c(a) Within two weeks after the arraignment of a person accused of a criminal offense, or within two weeks after the filing of an appearance of counsel or the appointment of counsel for an accused in <em>any criminal matter, </em>whichever shall occur first, a judge or other designated official of the circuit court in which the matter is pending, shall set a date for the trial of the case, which date shall be not later than 180 days from the date of the arraignment of the person accused or the appearance or the appointment of counsel for the accused whichever occurs first. The date established for the trial of the matter shall not be postponed except for good cause shown by the moving party and only with the permission of the administrative judge of the court where the matter is pending.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\">.

Additionally, in my view, in <em>Frazier </em>the unavailability of a court did not constitute good cause for the length of the delay. At the 23 March 1982 hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to comply with the statutory prompt trial requirements the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">\u201cI know my Court has been available on a number of occasions over the crucial period when this case was supposed to be tried____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">There was no reason offered to explain why, under these circumstances, the case had been scheduled for trial beyond the statutorily prescribed time period. Thus, there was nothing to justify the length of the delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
