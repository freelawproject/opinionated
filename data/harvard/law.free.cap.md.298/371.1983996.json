We referred the matter, pursuant to Maryland Rule BV9 b, to Judge Raymond G. Thieme, Jr., of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, Judge Thieme filed detailed findings and conclusions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">\u201cThe facts are not in dispute and have been admitted in Respondent\u2019s Answer. With minor modification, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>will adopt the Findings of Fact in Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 5, which show the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u201cOn March 8, 1974, Ms. [Beverly A.] Telfaire was involved in a minor auto accident in the District of Columbia. The driver of the other vehicle was one Raymond Chavis; the owner was the Darling Delaware Co., Inc. Ms. Telfaire was treated by her doctor, Dr. Thomas Dent, for back injuries, and missed at least twelve days from her part-time employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u201cShortly afterwards, Ms. Telfaire called Mr. Sheehy to discuss the accident. Mr. Sheehy asserted that he would send her an authorization form and a retainer agreement, and did so. Ms. Telfaire sent them back, although there was some question as to whether the Respondent received them or not. Nonetheless, as far as both parties were concerned, an attorney-client relationship had been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u201cFor various reasons, Respondent and Ms. Telfaire were rarely in communication. This lack of communication became sufficiently serious to cause Ms. Telfaire to complain to Bar Counsel. Contact between Mr. Sheehy and Ms. Telfaire was reestablished and Ms. Telfaire came to Mr. Sheehy\u2019s office for the first time on April 7, 1976. Ms. Telfaire executed both another retainer agreement and an authorization form, as well as provided a statement reflecting the period that she had missed work. At Respondent\u2019s urging, Ms. Telfaire asked Bar Counsel to close its investigation as she and Respondent had reached an understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u201cThe problems with communication re-commenced. In a January 26, 1977, letter, however, Respondent stated that \u2018[a]t the present time I am trying to move Mr. Dent toward a settlement so that we can avoid filing suit.\u2019 This was, of necessity, a misrepresentation, as Mr. Dent was, in fact, Dr. Dent, the physician who treated Ms. Telfaire and not a proper party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\u201cOn March 7,1977, Mr. Sheehy filed a personal injury and property damage action in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, asking $50,000 in damages against a Thomas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>M. Dent, who, Respondent alleged, was the driver of the vehicle that struck Ms. Telfaire. The matter was designated Civil Action 2175-77, and Respondent obtained a summons that same day to be served on Thomas M. Dent. Mr. Sheehy throughout this period was fully aware that the statute of limitations would expire on March 8, 1977. That Thomas Dent was Ms. Telfaire\u2019s doctor was readily discoverable; Mr. Sheehy had both his address and telephone number. Moreover, the police accident report, which was readily available, showed the owner of the other automobile involved to be Darling Delaware Co., Inc. and the driver to be Raymond Chavis.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u201cAs Mr. Sheehy submitted his complaint, he hand-lettered \u2018and John Doe\u2019 next to the typed name of the defendant in the caption. This hand-lettering apparently was written after the complaint had been accepted for filing; in any case, it is not included on the caption of the court jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u201cIn the first week of April 1977, Mr. Sheehy was successful in amending the civil complaint. The amended complaint named neither Thomas M. Dent, nor John Doe, but it did name as defendants Raymond Chavis and Darling Delaware Co., Inc. Mr. Sheehy intended to use employees of Alarm Masters Security Systems, Inc., a company Mr. Sheehy was defending in an unrelated case, to serve process, but process had not been served by April or May, 1977. In June, 1977, a dispute between Mr. Sheehy and Alarm Masters arose which culminated in the severance of their relationship. In late 1977, or early 1978, Respondent discovered that the defendants in Ms. Telfaire\u2019s suit had never been served.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u201cRather than pursue the suit any further in court, Respondent decided to reach an accommodation with Ms. Telfaire. Without consulting Ms. Telfaire, and without obtaining specific information regarding her medical expenses or lost wages, Mr. Sheehy valued her damages to be between $500 and $750, and selected a settlement figure of $1,200 which, after deduction of his one-third fee and court costs, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>net Ms. Telfaire $760. Although Mr. Sheehy spoke with Ms. Telfaire, at no time did he explain the situation to her, or tell her of his intention to pay her out of his own funds. Instead, he misrepresented the ease as still being actively pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u201cIn October, 1978, Mr. Sheehy was offered a position with the District of Columbia Government as Deputy Chief of the Office of Judicial Affairs to draft legislation and legal opinions and to act as liaison to the offices of the Corporation Counsel and the U.S. Attorney. He accepted, and began to wind up his private law practice. Ms. Telfaire, having again had problems making contact with Respondent, filed a second complaint with the office of Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u201cDeputy Bar Counsel, Edwin Yourman, obtained Mr. Sheehy\u2019s current office address and telephone number and called on February 27 and 28, as well as on March 1, 2 and 5, 1979, leaving the message that Mr. Sheehy should return his call. Mr. Sheehy did return the call March 5. He represented to Mr. Yourman that he had negotiated a $1,200 settlement on Ms. Telfaire\u2019s behalf. Mr. Yourman forwarded that information, along with Respondent\u2019s new address and telephone number, to Ms. Telfaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u201cAt about the same time, Mr. Sheehy directly contacted Ms. Telfaire by mail and reported a $1,200 settlement offer. When Ms. Telfaire telephoned to discuss the offer, she expressed her dissatisfaction, but reluctantly agreed to accept the purported offer. Several weeks later, since she had not received her money, Ms. Telfaire again called Respondent. During this conversation, Mr. Sheehy said \u2018as soon as the people would send him the money, that he would send it to [her].\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u201cCommunications again lapsed until May 21, 1979, when Mr. Sheehy told Ms. Telfaire that he would mail her a check for $760 that day. Meanwhile, Respondent had received a tax refund which was the actual source of funds for the check. In due course, Ms. Telfaire received and cashed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>$760 check drawn on an account labeled \u2018Donald J. Sheehy, Attorney-at-Law\u2019. At no time did Respondent ever disclose to Ms. Telfaire the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u201cIn late May or early June of 1979, Ms. Telfaire brought the situation to the attention of Bar Counsel. She explained her efforts to obtain what she thought were the proceeds of the settlement from Mr. Sheehy, she described the check, and pointed out that she had never authorized the Respondent to endorse the settlement check. Bar Counsel docketed Ms. Telfaire\u2019s February 24, 1977, complaint as Sheehy/Telfaire, number 507-78. In a letter dated June 4, 1979, Bar Counsel advised Respondent of the pending investigation, and asked him to address several issues concerning the purported settlement. The letter accurately reflected the information available at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u201cWhen Mr. Sheehy received Bar Counsel\u2019s letter, he drafted a deliberately ambiguous letter which deliberately failed to answer the specific questions posed. His intention was to mislead Bar Counsel into believing the settlement was legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u201cMr. Yourman sent another letter dated June 28, 1979, which repeated the previous request for details regarding the alleged settlement and disbursement. Respondent realized when he received the letter that he could not respond without further misrepresentations. He then scheduled a meeting with Bar Counsel. At this meeting, Mr. Sheehy explained fully and truthfully the events heretofore described. He attributed his failings to a variety of personal problems. At the conclusion of the meeting, Bar Counsel suggested that Respondent obtain counsel, and make a written reply to Mr. Yourman\u2019s June 28, 1979, letter. Mr. Sheehy did so, and gave essentially the same information provided at the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\u201cThe Court will now consider the specific violations with which the Respondent stands charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>\u201cDisciplinary Rule 7-102 </em>\u2014 Representing <em>a Client Within the Bounds of the Law</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">(A) In his representation of a client, a lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">3. Conceal or knowingly fail to disclose that which he is required by law to reveal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">4. Knowingly use perjured testimony or false evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">5. Knowingly make a false statement of law or fact. 8. Knowingly engage in other illegal conduct or conduct contrary to a Disciplinary Rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">\u201cDisciplinary Rule (DR) 7-102 concerns the conduct of an attorney in the representation of his client in an adversarial context. The situation in which a lawyer has made false representations to his client is not addressed by this provision. This interpretation of DR 7-102 is borne out by Ethical Considerations (EC) 7-25, 7-26, and 7-27. Ms. Telfaire\u2019s case never became adversarial in nature because the defendants were never served. No other work was done after the complaint was filed. Thus, the Court concludes that Donald Sheehy did not violate DR 7-102.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\"><em>\u201cDisciplinary Rule 6-102 </em>\u2014 Limiting <em>Liability to Client</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">(A) A lawyer shall not attempt to exonerate himself from or limit his liability to his client for his personal malpractice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">\u201cThere is no clear and convincing evidence as required by Rule BVlOd that Donald Sheehy\u2019s misrepresentations to Ms. Telfaire were made with the motive to limit his personal liability for malpractice. Respondent\u2019s testimony indicated that he settled with Ms. Telfaire with his own funds in an effort to correct his procedural mistakes by adequately compensating her as if she had gone to trial. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Donald Sheehy, </em>No. 3600008, p. 41. Since Mr. Sheehy\u2019s motive is ambiguous, the Court concludes that the evidence is inconclusive as to whether or not the Respondent violated Disciplinary Rule 6-102(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">\u201cThe Court now considers those Disciplinary Rules where there is no real issue as to whether Donald Sheehy committed the acts charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>\u201cDisciplinary Rule 6-101 </em>\u2014 Failing <em>to Act Competently </em>(A) A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">2. Handle a legal matter without preparation adequate in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">3. Neglect a legal matter entrusted to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u201cDonald Sheehy\u2019s inadequate preparation of Ms. Telfaire\u2019s case is evidenced by the complaint he filed. The suit originally named an obviously improper party (Ms. Telfaire\u2019s doctor, Dr. Dent) as the defendant; while the names of the proper defendants were readily discoverable. Moreover, the complaint was filed on the day before the statute of limitations was to run in the case. Although Mr. Sheehy later amended the pleadings to reflect the appropriate defendants, Respondent neglected to see that they were served. Donald Sheehy\u2019s conduct, as set forth on pages 2-3, clearly shows neglect from the inception of the attorney-client relationship. Thus, this Court finds Donald Sheehy violated Disciplinary Rule 6-101(A)(2), (3).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\"><em>\u201cDisciplinary Rule 1-102 </em>\u2014 Misconduct (A) A lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">4. Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">5. Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-11\"><em>\u201cDisciplinary Rule 7-101 </em>\u2014 Represent <em>a Client Zealously </em>(A) A lawyer shall not intentionally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">1. Fail to seek the lawful objectives of his client through reasonably available means permitted by law and the Disciplinary Rules, except as provided by DR 7-101(B). A lawyer does not violate this Disciplinary Rule, however, by acceding to reasonable requests of opposing counsel which do not prejudice the rights of his client, by being punctual in fulfilling all professional commitments, by avoiding offensive tactics, or by treating with courtesy and consideration all persons involved in the legal process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">2. Fail to carry out a contract of employment entered into with a client for professional services, but he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>withdraw as permitted under DR 2-110, DR 5-102, and DR 5-105.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">3. Prejudice or damage his client during the course of the professional relationship, except as required under DR 7-102.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u201cDonald Sheehy misrepresented to Ms. Telfaire that he was actively pursuing her law suit. Further, he falsely stated to the Deputy Bar Counsel and Ms. Telfaire that he negotiated a settlement offer with the defendants when Respondent in fact paid Ms. Telfaire out of his own funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u201cThe Court finds that Mr. Sheehy intentionally failed to pursue Ms. Telfaire\u2019s case through the court system. Further, Respondent\u2019s misrepresentations to Ms. Telfaire displayed his indifferent behavior to his client in the legal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u201cIt is not disputed that Mr. Sheehy was employed by Ms. Telfaire as her attorney under an employment contract. Respondent failed to carry out this contract by encouraging his client to accept a fictitious settlement offer without explaining to her the truth of the matter. As a result, Ms. Telfaire\u2019s case was compromised, and the administration of justice was inhibited. This Court is convinced that Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(4), (5) and 7-101(A)(l), (2), (3) were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\u201cHaving found the above violations, it follows that Donald Sheehy violated the blanket provision of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\"><em>\u201cDisciplinary Rule 1-102 </em>\u2014 Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">(A) A lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">1. Violate a Disciplinary Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\">6. Engage in any other conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">\u201cIn conclusion, the conduct engaged in by Donald Sheehy cannot be condoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">Bar Counsel did not except to any of Judge Thieme\u2019s findings. As to the sanction to be imposed, he recommended that we \u201cconsider the possible termination of the Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>dent\u2019s license to practice law in the State of Maryland or, in lieu thereof, a lengthy suspension.\u201d Bar Counsel pointed out that the incident which gave rise to the disciplinary proceedings in this case occurred in the District of Columbia and that the court there, a majority concurring, suspended Sheehy from practicing in that jurisdiction- for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Sheehy took no exceptions to Judge Thieme\u2019s findings but argues that the proper sanction is \u201cpublic censure or in the alternative a period of suspension coterminous with that imposed by the District of Columbia.\u201d In this latter regard, under Rule XI, \u00a7 21 of the Rules Governing the Bar of the District of Columbia, an attorney suspended from practice for more than one year may be reinstated only on petition. Readmission, therefore, is not automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Considering all the circumstances, we think that Sheehy\u2019s misconduct, while extremely serious, does not warrant disbarment. Instead, we shall suspend Sheehy from the practice of law in this State for two years, and he shall remain suspended beyond that time unless he has applied for readmission, and been readmitted, to the Bar of the District of Columbia following expiration of his suspension in that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Sheehy\u2019s suspension shall commence thirty days from the date of the filing of the opinion in this case. Prior to termination of the suspension, Sheehy shall pay all costs of the disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV15 c FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST DONALD JOSEPH SHEEHY.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b418-8\">CHARLES E.

I do not agree that it does not warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>disbarment. In view of his admitted acts and the disciplinary rules he concedes those acts violated, he has demonstrated that he is not fit to retain the privilege to practice law.
