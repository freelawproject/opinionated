Sealing (Sealing), a permanent classified State employee then serving as a correctional officer at the Maryland House of Correction, a constituent institution of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, Division of Correction, was suspended by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Warden of that institution pending the filing of charges with the Secretary for Sealing\u2019s removal from State service pursuant to Md.Code (1957, 1983 Repl.Vol.), Art. 64A, \u00a7 36,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Art. 64A, \u00a7 33,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Code of Maryland Regulations (CO-MAR) 06.01.01.48.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On 20 October 1980, the Warden filed written charges against Sealing alleging violations of CO-MAR 06.01.01.47 E and M, and then Division of Correction Regulation 50-2, Standards of Conduct, Rule 4 (DCR 50-2 IV.A.4.).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">COMAR 06.01.01.47 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201c.47 Causes for Removal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cAny employee in the classified service may be permanently removed from his position only for cause.... The following shall be sufficient cause of removal, though removal may be for causes other than those enumerated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201cE. That the employee has been wantonly offensive in his conduct toward fellow employees, wards of the State, or the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">\u201cM. That the employee has been guilty of conduct such as to bring the classified service into public disrepute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">DCR 50-2 IV.A.4. then provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">\u201cA. All employees . . . must abide by the following rules of conduct established by the Commissioner. . . . Violations of this regulation and the stated rules of conduct, whether through ignorance, carelessness, or willful action, will be considered grounds for disciplinary action, possible criminal action, and/or removal from State service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201c4. ... Employees on and off duty must conduct themselves in a manner which will maintain the respect of the public and the inmate body. Conduct which reflects unfavorably upon the division by causing embarrassment or criticism will constitute grounds for disciplinary action.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The specific incident precipitating these charges was described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">\u201cOn [10/16/80], Officer John Thomas Sealing brought a handout into this institution, that he had received in the mail, to show to his friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">\u201cThe handout contained racial slurs, nicknames and discriminatory remarks of the most explosive nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u201cThis type of material is considered to be racially inflammatory and could cause serious problems and possible riot, when circulated in a prison environment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Although the charges were filed for the purpose of removing Sealing from State service, an Unsatisfactory Report recommending that Sealing be given another chance in some other department was simultaneously filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Sealing appealed to the Secretary. On 17 November 1980, a hearing was held before a hearing officer designated by the Secretary. The evidence adduced at this hearing showed that in October 1980, Sealing was a permanent classified employee serving as a correctional officer at the Maryland House of Correction. At that time, 90 percent of the inmate population and 40 percent of the staff were black. Tension was present because the institution was then somewhat overcrowded.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The evidence further showed that on 15 October 1980, Sealing received an anonymous letter that read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aas\">\u201cMARYLAND GAME COMMISSION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">Department of Natural Resources Tawes Building Annapolis, Maryland 21401</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">Dear Fellow Maryland Hunters:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">The 1980-81 Big Game Season in the State of Maryland will be cancelled due to a shortage of Big Game animals. The following game animals will not be hunted: Bear, Deer and Turkey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">However, in the place of Big Game Animals, there will be an open season on Jungle Bunnies (known regionally as Negro, Nigger, Saucerlips or Pittsburg Pirates). The season will be open from Nov. 1 thru April 30, 1981. It must be remembered, fellow hunters, \u2018The only good nigger is a dead one.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">\n<em>It will be unlawful to:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">1.

Traps may not be set within 15 feet of a watermelon patch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">2. Traps may not be baited with pork chops, watermelon, cheap whiskey or wine, fried chicken or flashy clothes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">NOTE: A special permit may be issued for the use of Cadillac keys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">3. Traps may not be set in ghetto areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">4. All traps must have 400-lb. spring and 4-inch jaw spread.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">OTHER RULES AND REGULATIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\">1. It is unlawful to pick up or possess a road-killed Jungle Bunny. If you see one on the highway, you may hit it, but don\u2019t pick it up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-13\">2. It is unlawful to use any recorded or electronically amplified device to trap a Jungle Bunny, with exception of the following: a recording of Al Jolson\u2019s \u2018Swanee River\u2019 or \u2018Dixie\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-14\">NOTE: A special permit may be purchased to use: \u2018Mama\u2019s Little Baby Loves Shortening Bread.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-15\">HOW TO KNOW WHEN JUNGLE BUNNIES ARE IN THE AREA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-16\">Watermelon seeds on ground; smell of pork chops in air; Cadillacs, especially with white sidewalls; nigger wool in tree branches; a pile of carp bones next to your favorite fishing hole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-17\">LIMIT: 3 per day, 40 per season.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-18\">LICENSE FEE: Free to all whites.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-19\">Safe and Happy Hunting\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>On 16 October 1980, Sealing brought the letter to work and showed it to other staff members including some supervisory personnel. Although Sealing did not reproduce the letter or show it to any inmates, copies of it were made and left on a desk that was accessible to both inmates and correctional officers. Five or six copies were taken from the desk but it was unknown whether inmates or officers had taken the copies.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Later that day, a correctional officer, who \u201cthought it wasn\u2019t right for this type of document to be passed around in the institution,\u201d brought the letter to the attention of one of Sealing\u2019s immediate supervisors. That supervisor described the letter as \u201cinappropriate and inflammatory in the confines of a correctional institution where approximately 90%, 85-90% of the population is black, where correctional officers have to supervise these people and control them.\u201d He further stated that \u201cwith this type of document circulating through the institution, it could cause a hardship on white correctional officers that are trying to perform their job as far as if they have an incident with an inmate, the first thing the inmate would allege is that the officers instead of doing his job is doing it because he\u2019s a racist and refer back to that document being passed around.\u201d That supervisor informed yet another supervisor of the letter and its contents. The second supervisor felt \u201cthat the hand-out that was brought in was extremely racist, extremely dangerous in that type of situation\u201d and \u201cthat such a document was bound to cause some type of trouble between the officers and inmates.\u201d Although this supervisor had not observed any problems resulting from the dissemination of the letter, he nonetheless recommended that Sealing be disciplined.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">After the Warden suspended Sealing, an inmate, who was then serving as a representative on the Inmate Advisory Council,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> told one of Sealing\u2019s supervisors that a correctional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>officer other than Sealing had shown him the letter. The inmate indicated that there \u201cwould be no problem from the inmate population because the warden took action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">In his defense, Sealing testified that because hunting was one of his hobbies, he found the anonymous letter \u201crather amusing.\u201d He stated that his purpose in bringing the letter to work was to show it to friends with whom he hunted. He said that he had shown the letter to one black and several white members of the staff, including some supervisory personnel. According to Sealing, staff reactions were mixed \u2014 some staff members chuckled while others made no comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Although Sealing stated that at the time of the incident he was aware of his obligation to be extremely careful to avoid any conduct that might proliferate existing problems, he testified that he was not then aware that he was violating any institutional rule. He said that in the past, pictures with sexual and racial overtones had been posted in areas frequented by staff, minimum security inmates, and persons making deliveries to the institution. He asserted that racial epithets were frequently exchanged between black and white inmates and staff. Finally, Sealing pointed out that it was not until six days after his suspension that the Warden issued an informational bulletin indicating that printed materials containing racial slurs should not be brought into the institution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Based upon the evidence presented, the hearing officer made the following findings of fact, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u201c1. Mr. Sealing did bring the complained of document into the Maryland House of Correction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">2. \u2022 He distributed the document to a number of Correctional Officers while on duty at the institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">3. On its very face the document is odious and scurrilous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">4. The Division of Corrections, through the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, is by law charged with the management of the Maryland House of Correction and the safe custody of the inmates confined therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">5. Mr. Paul J. Davis is the legally appointed Warden of the Maryland House of Corrections and as such, is immediately responsible to higher level officials of the Division of Corrections to fulfill the mission stated above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">6. The Warden determined that the document could cause serious problems and possible riot when circulated in a prison environment, because, in his opinion, the document is racially inflammatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Additionally, the hearing officer determined that \u201c[p]ast practice within an institution cannot alter the provisions of Division, Departmental or Statewide regulations or policies.\u201d He concluded that Sealing had violated COMAR 06.01.01.47 E and M, as well as DCR 50-2 IV.A.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">On 16 December 1980, these findings and conclusions were approved by the Secretary who ordered that Sealing \u201cbe permanently removed from State service,\u201d but that \u201cin accordance with the recommendation of the appointing authority,\u201d Sealing \u201cbe given another chance in some other department of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">Sealing filed an appeal in the Circuit Court for Howard County pursuant to Md.Code (1957,1982 Repl.Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7 255(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a Memorandum Opinion, the trial court initial<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>ly found that the administrative determination that Sealing had violated COMAR 06.01.01.47 E was not supported by sufficient facts and inferences. More particularly, with respect to the alleged violation of that regulation, the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\">\u201cTo sustain disciplinary action under COMAR 06.01.01.-47(E) . . . facts have to be found from which a reasoning mind could conclude that Appellant\u2019s conduct had been \u2018wantonly offensive\u2019 toward fellow employees, inmates, or the public.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u201cThat the material was offensive is admitted. But the mere fact of its offensive nature does not, absent more, cause Appellant\u2019s conduct to be \u2018wantonly offensive\u2019. Inherent in wanton conduct is some act which is so reckless or grossly negligent, as regards the rights and feeling of others, that one of a reasoning mind may infer an intent to be offensive or to do harm. Wanton conduct goes beyond conduct which is merely careless or thoughtless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnE\">The trial court then found that the administrative determination that Sealing had violated COMAR 06.01.01.47 M was not supported by sufficient facts and inferences. Additionally, the trial court found that Sealing had not been charged with a violation of DCR 50-2 IV.A.4. The trial court concluded that the administrative action removing Sealing from State service was arbitrary and capricious. On 11 December 1981, the trial court entered an order remanding the case to the Secretary for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">An appeal was filed in the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported per curiam opinion, <em>Maryland State Department of Personnel v. Sealing, </em>No. 97, September Term, 1982, filed 8 October 1982, that Court determined that Sealing had been properly charged with a violation of DCR 50-2 IY.A.4. It found, however, that there was insufficient evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the record to support the finding of a violation of DCR 50-2 IY.A.4 or COMAR 06.01.01.47 E and M. More particularly, with respect to the alleged violation of COMAR 06.01.01.47 E, that Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">\u201cThe paper certainly is offensive, as testified to by Lt. Clay who thought it \u2018inappropriate and inflammatory,\u2019 and Major Dettler, who considered it \u2018extremely racist\u2019 in nature. To be violative of the regulation, however, it is not the paper itself but Sealing\u2019s \u2018conduct toward fellow employees, wards of the State, or the public ... \u2019 that must be judged as wantonly offensive. \u2018An offensive act that is \u201cwanton\u201d is brutally insolent or heedless of the rights and feelings of others.\u2019 <em>Thompson v. City of Minneapolis, </em>300 N.W.2d 763, 769 (Minn.1980).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">\u201cWhile Sealing was later told by a superior officer that the paper could be \u2018extremely dangerous\u2019 if circulated among the inmates, Sealing did not intend to circulate it among the inmates. As noted, he intended to show it only to a few of his fellow correctional officers who, he thought, might (and did) find it \u2018rather amusing.\u2019 Although Sealing admitted in retrospect that his limited distribution of the paper was in poor taste, his conduct \u2018toward fellow employees, wards of the State, or the public,\u2019 as such, cannot be characterized as wantonly offensive.\u201d <em>Sealing, </em>No. 97, September Term, 1982, slip op. at 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that the administrative action removing Sealing from his duties as a correctional officer was arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">A petition for a writ of certiorari was filed that we granted. We shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The applicable standard for judicial review of a decision of the Secretary of the Maryland State Department of Personnel is set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7 255(f). That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\">\u201c(f) <em>Affirmance, remand, reversal or modification of decision. </em>\u2014 The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision if the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201c(5) Unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201c(6) Arbitrary or capricious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The principles governing the application of that standard have been frequently articulated by this Court. <em>E.g., Courtney v. Board of Trustees of the Maryland State Retirement Systems, </em>285 Md. 356, 362, 402 A.2d 885, 889 (1979); <em>Resetar v. State Board of Education, </em>284 Md. 537, 553-54, 399 A.2d 225, 233-34, <em>cert, denied, </em>444 U.S. 838, 100 S.Ct. 74, 62 L.Ed.2d 49 (1979); <em>Oxon Hill Recreation Club, Inc. v. Water Resources Administration, </em>281 Md. 110,113-14, 375 A.2d 567, 569 (1977). Illustrative is <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 512-13, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123-24 (1978), in which this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201c \u2018Substantial evidence,\u2019 as the test for reviewing factual findings of administrative agencies, has been defined as \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 The scope of review \u2018is limited to whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">\u201cIn applying the substantial evidence test, we have emphasized that a \u2018court should [not] substitute its judgment for the <em>expertise </em>of those persons who constitute the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken.\u2019 We also must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, since \u2018decisions of administrative agencies are prima facie correct,\u2019 and \u2018carry with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>them the presumption of validity.\u2019 Furthermore, not only is it the province of the agency to resolve conflicting evidence, but where inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u201d (Citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAn\">We shall apply these principles here.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The petitioner initially contends that the record contains substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision that Sealing violated COMAR 06.01.01.47 E because his conduct toward fellow employees, wards of the State or the public was \u201cwantonly offensive.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Although this Court has not previously interpreted the term \u201cwantonly offensive\u201d conduct appearing in COMAR 06.01.01.47 E, we have frequently construed the term \u201cwanton\u201d in other contexts. <em>Griffin v. State, </em>225 Md. 422, 429, 171 A.2d 717, 720 (1961), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>378 U.S. 130, 84 S.Ct. 1770, 12 L.Ed.2d 754 (1964); <em>Dennis v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>189 Md. 610, 617, 56 A.2d 813, 817 (1948); <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Faulkner, </em>179 Md. 598, 602, 20 A.2d 485, 488 (1941); <em>Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore R.R. v. Hoeflich, </em>62 Md. 300, 309 (1884); <em>Moore v. Schultz, 31 </em>Md. 418, 423 (1869); <em>see St. Paul at Chase Corp. v. Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. of Toranto, </em>262 Md. 192, 238-39, 278 A.2d 12, 34, <em>cert, denied, </em>404 U.S. 857, 92 S.Ct. 104, 30 L.Ed.2d 98 (1971). Thus, as early as 1869, this Court in <em>Moore v. Schultz, </em>31 Md. 418, 423 (1869), defined \u201cwanton\u201d conduct as conduct committed in a manner indicating a \u201cdisregard of the rights of others.\u201d Thereafter, in <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Faulkner, </em>179 Md. 598, 602, 20 A.2d 485, 488 (1941), and <em>Dennis v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>189 Md. 610, 617, 56 A.2d 813, 817 (1948), this Court defined \u201cwanton\u201d conduct as conduct \u201ccharacterized by extreme recklessness and utter disregard for the rights of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The same definition was applied by this Court in a criminal case, <em>Griffin v. State, </em>225 Md. 422, 429,171 A.2d 717, 720 (1961), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>378 U.S. 130, 84 S.Ct. 1770,12 L.Ed.2d 754 (1964), in which we construed a predecessor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 577. That criminal statute, then entitled \u201cWanton trespass upon private land,\u201d Md.Code (1957), Art. 27, \u00a7 577<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">\u201cAny person ... who shall enter upon or cross over the land, premises or private property of any person ... after having been duly notified by the owner or his agent not to do so shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor ...; provided [however] that nothing in this section shall be construed to include ... the entry upon or crossing over any land when such entry or crossing is done under a bona fide claim of right or ownership ..., it being the intention of this section only to prohibit any <em>wanton trespass </em>upon the private land of others.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In determining that the trespass there involved was \u201cwanton\u201d conduct within the meaning of the statute, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201cAlthough there are almost as many legal definitions of the word \u2018wanton\u2019 as there are appellate courts, we think the Maryland definition, which is in line with the general definition of the word in other jurisdictions, is as good as any. In <em>Dennis v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>189 Md. 610, 56 A.2d 813 (1948), as well as in <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Faulkner, </em>179 Md. 598, 20 A.2d 485 (1941), it was said that <em>the word \u2018wanton\u2019 means \u2018characterized by extreme recklessness and utter disregard for the rights of others.\u2019 </em>We see no reason why the refusal of these appellants to leave the premises after having been requested to do so was not wanton in that their conduct was in \u2018utter disregard for the rights of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffin, </em>225 Md. at 429, 171 A.2d at 720 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We shall apply the traditional Maryland definition of the term \u201cwanton\u201d conduct here. Thus, under COMAR 06.01.-01.47 E, conduct by an employee that is characterized by extreme recklessness and utter disregard for the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>fellow employees, wards of the State or the public constitutes sufficient cause for removal from State service.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The record in this case shows that at the time of the relevant incident, 90 percent of the inmates and 40 percent of the staff at the Maryland House of Correction were black. Tension was present in the institution because of overcrowding. Sealing was then aware of his obligation to be extremely careful to avoid any conduct on his part that might proliferate existing problems. Nevertheless, Sealing intentionally brought a letter into the institution that called for \u201can open season on Jungle Bunnies,\u201d and admonished that \u201c[t]he only good nigger is a dead one.\u201d Sealing not only displayed this letter to staff members, but also negligently permitted it to be reproduced and negligently allowed copies to be left on a desk accessible to both inmates and correctional officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The record further shows that one correctional officer indicated that he \u201cthought it wasn\u2019t right for this type of document to be passed around in the institution.\u201d One supervisor described the letter as \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cinflammatory\u201d in a correctional institution in which 90 percent of the inmate population was black. He opined that such a document \u201ccould cause a hardship on white correctional officers that are trying to perform their job.\u201d Still another supervisor felt that the letter was \u201cextremely racist\u201d and \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d and that \u201csuch a document was bound to cause some type of trouble between the officers and inmates.\u201d The Warden determined that the letter \u201ccontained racial slurs, nicknames and discriminatory remarks of the most explosive nature.\u201d He concluded that \u201c[tjhis type of material is considered to be racially inflammatory and could cause serious problems and possible riot, when circulated in a prison environment.\u201d An inmate who was then a member of the Inmate Advisory Council explained that there \u201cwould be no problem from the inmate population because the warden took action,\u201d thus inferring that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>only reason there had been no inmate repercussions was the Warden\u2019s prompt suspension of Sealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">This evidence was adequate to support the conclusion that Sealing\u2019s conduct was characterized by extreme recklessness and utter disregard for the rights of fellow correctional officers and inmates. Thus, there was substantial evidence from which a reasoning mind reasonably could have concluded that Sealing\u2019s conduct toward fellow correctional officers and inmates was wantonly offensive and constituted sufficient cause for Sealing\u2019s removal from State service. <em>Cf. Resetar, </em>284 Md. at 554-55, 399 A.2d at 234-35 (use of racial epithets by school teacher constituted misconduct). Under the present circumstances, the Secretary\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals shall be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR ENTRY OF AN ORDER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\">.
