The District Court denied McDaniel\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the action on the ground that the State was entitled to prevail on a defense of prosecutorial immunity. McDaniel now appeals. For the reasons detailed below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">\u00b62 McDaniel pleaded guilty in June 2003 to the offense of burglary, a felony, and the District Court sentenced him in July 2003 to the Montana State Prison for a period of 20 years. The court suspended the entire 20-year sentence, subject to a number of conditions, and ordered McDaniel to submit to the supervision of the Adult Probation and Parole Bureau of the Montana Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d). \u00b63 On November 20, 2003, McDaniel\u2019s probation officer gave him a random drug test, which came back positive for cocaine. That same day, McDaniel signed a Substance Abuse Admission Form in which he admitted having used cocaine. But rather than file a report of violation with the Flathead County Attorney\u2019s Office, McDaniel\u2019s probation officer elected instead to initiate an intervention hearing under \u00a7 46-23-1015, MCA. That provision states that \u201c[a] probation and parole officer who reasonably believes that a probationer has violated a condition of probation may initiate an informal probation violation intervention hearing to gain the probationer\u2019s compliance with the conditions of probation without a formal revocation hearing under 46-18-203.\u201d Section 46-23-1015(1), MCA (2003). A hearings officer designated by the DOC conducts the intervention hearing. Section 46-23-1015(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">\u00b64 The intervention hearing in McDaniel\u2019s case was held December 9, 2003. At the conclusion of the hearing, McDaniel, his probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>officer, and the hearings officer signed an Intervention Hearing Agreement, which stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">This is an Agreement between The State of Montana, Department of Corrections Adult Probation &amp; Parole and Kenneth Glen McDaniel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">I[,] Kenneth Glen McDaniel[,] understand and agree to the following conditions in lieu of a formal violation being filed at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">1. You will immediately be placed on Level 1 supervision for a minimum of six (6) months and report as directed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">2. You will immediately begin court ordered anger management counseling. You will have no unexcused absences and you will participate as required in all sessions, homework, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">3. You will immediately begin attending AA/NA meetings and utilize an AA/NA log as directed by your P.O. You will attend a minimum of two (2) AA/NA meetings weekly for a minimum of one (1) year and thereafter as directed by your P.O.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">4. You will not be allowed any travel permits whatsoever until you have completed anger management counseling, maintained AA/NA meetings as directed, secured and maintained acceptable employment, and have shown a regular monthly payment record towards court ordered financial obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">\u00b65 Shortly thereafter, a Deputy Flathead County Attorney learned \u201cinformally\u201d that the DOC had conducted an intervention hearing with McDaniel. The prosecutor obtained McDaniel\u2019s file from the regional Probation and Parole Office and, on December 16,2003, filed a Petition for Revocation of Suspended Sentence in the District Court. The basis of this petition was McDaniel\u2019s admitted use of cocaine, i.e., the same probation violation upon which the Intervention Hearing Agreement was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">\u00b66 The District Court issued a bench warrant, and McDaniel was arrested and jailed. He then filed two motions to dismiss the petition for revocation. In the first, he argued that the intervention hearing and the Intervention Hearing Agreement constituted a final adjudication of his probation violation, including the appropriate sanction for the violation, and that the State, therefore, was barred by res judicata from relitigating the matter. In the second, he asserted that filing the petition for revocation constituted a breach of the Intervention Hearing Agreement. The prosecutor correspondingly filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>two briefs opposing McDaniel\u2019s motions. He argued that the elements of res judicata were not satisfied. Furthermore, he argued that \u201cthe State\u201d had not attended the intervention hearing and, consequently, that \u201c[i]t is absolutely false that the State ever entered into an agreement with [McDaniel] regarding [McDaniel\u2019s] violating the terms of his probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b67 The District Court held a hearing on McDaniel\u2019s motions in May 2004 and entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order on Motion to Dismiss on October 29, 2004. In brief, the court determined as follows: the State of Montana, acting through the DOC, was a party to the intervention hearing; the Intervention Hearing Agreement was \u201ca valid, binding agreement\u201d between McDaniel and the State; McDaniel agreed to comply with four conditions \u201cin lieu of a formal violation being filed at this time\u201d; and as of the May 2004 hearing, McDaniel had \u201cfully complied\u201d with these conditions. The court concluded that \u201cthe State got what it bargained for: compliance thereafter by [McDaniel] with the rules of probation, as amended in the agreement, and there is no valid argument that [McDaniel] is NOT entitled to get what he bargained for: that the intervention agreement was \u2018in lieu of a formal violation being filed.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the court granted McDaniel\u2019s motions to dismiss the petition for revocation. The State did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b68 McDaniel filed the instant action on December 30,2005, asserting two claims: first, that the State breached a written contract with McDaniel when it filed the petition to revoke his suspended sentence; and second, that the State deprived McDaniel of \u201chis property in the benefits of the written contract and administrative decision\u201d without procedural due process of law in violation of Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution. McDaniel alleged damages \u201cincluding 33 days loss of physical liberty, loss of income, $4,000.00 bondsman fee, $5,900.00 attorney fee, public obloquy, and emotional upset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u00b69 The State removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Montana in February 2006; however, the federal court determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and, thus, granted McDaniel\u2019s motion for remand to the Eleventh Judicial District Court in August 2006. The parties thereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Relying on collateral estoppel (issue preclusion), McDaniel asserted that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law respecting the State\u2019s liability on his breach of contract and procedural due process claims. He argued that this issue had already been adjudicated and resolved (in his favor) in the revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>proceedings. The State, however, argued that it was \u201cimmune from civil liability for conduct preformed by a prosecutor acting within the scope of his duties.\u201d Thus, the State concluded it was entitled to summary judgment on both of McDaniel\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b610 The District Court entered its Order and Rationale on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment on May 7, 2007. Agreeing with the State\u2019s theory of prosecutorial immunity, the court first reasoned that \u201c[ajlthough McDaniel\u2019s lawsuit is against the State of Montana and he argues that the State breached a contract with him, the basis of his complaint rests on actions taken by the Flathead County Deputy Attorney.\u201d The court then observed that \u201cprosecutors enjoy immunity for actions taken in the course of their official duties.\u201d Lastly, citing <em>Ronek v. Gallatin County, </em>227 Mont. 514, 740 P.2d 1115 (1987), the court stated that \u201csuch immunity extends to counties, the State and its agencies.\u201d Accordingly, on this basis, the court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied McDaniel\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b611 McDaniel now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\u00b612 McDaniel raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">1. Did the District Court err in granting the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on its prosecutorial immunity defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">2. Did the District Court \u00e9rr in denying McDaniel\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the State\u2019s liability?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the criteria set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Center Montana, </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 24, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111. The moving party has the initial burden of establishing both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25. The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn therefrom in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 12, 344 Mont. 540, 189 P.3d 615. If the moving party meets its initial burden, then the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish with substantial evidence, as opposed to mere denial, speculation, or conclusory statements, that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 13. If no genuine issue of material fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>exists, then the court determines whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25. This determination is a conclusion of law, which we review for correctness. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b614 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court err in granting the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on its prosecutorial immunity defense?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b615 There is no dispute in this appeal that the probation officer and the hearings officer were acting as agents of the State of Montana when they signed the Intervention Hearing Agreement; that McDaniel agreed to four conditions \u201cin lieu of a formal violation being filed at this time\u201d; and that the Deputy Flathead County Attorney was acting as an agent of the State of Montana when he filed the petition to revoke McDaniel\u2019s suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b616 In defending against McDaniel\u2019s breach of contract and procedural due process claims arising out of these events, the State asserted, among other things, that the Intervention Hearing Agreement was not an enforceable contract. The State still maintains that position; however, the State contends that we do not reach the questions of contract enforceability and breach because the State is, in any event, immune from suit. The State does not claim that it is always immune from suit on breach of contract and procedural due process claims. Rather, the State\u2019s position is that it is immune from suit on such claims when the state agent whose act constitutes the alleged breach of contract or deprivation of property is a prosecutor acting within the scope of his duties. While McDaniel challenges this theory on a number of grounds, we conclude that the following points are sufficient to resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b617 The foundation for the State\u2019s immunity analysis is the premise that the Deputy County Attorney is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity for filing the petition for revocation on December 16, 2003. <em>See Ronek v. Gallatin County, </em>227 Mont. 514, 516, 740 P.2d 1115, 1116 (1987) (\u201cThe prosecutor is a quasi-judicial officer who enjoys common law immunity from civil liability for conduct within the scope of his duties.\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Dept. of Justice v. District Court, </em>172 Mont. 88, 92, 560 P.2d 1328, 1330 (1976) (\u2018When a prosecutor acts within the scope of his duties by filing and maintaining criminal charges he is absolutely immune from civil liability, regardless of negligence, or lack of probable cause.\u201d). The State argues that it can assert this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>prosecutorial immunity as its own defense to McDaniel\u2019s claims. In other words, the State seeks to \u201cextend\u201d the Deputy County Attorney\u2019s immunity to itself. The State contends that prosecutorial immunity is not limited \u201cto those circumstances where a prosecutor faces personal liability for prosecutorial conduct,\u201d but also extends to the prosecutor\u2019s governmental employer. In short, the State advances a theory of derivative immunity. <em>Cf. Lutheran Day Care v. Snohomish County, </em>829 P.2d 746, 751 (Wash. 1992) (\u201cAny immunity the municipality might have is only derivative from or secondary to that individual [quasi-judicial] immunity [of its employees].\u201d (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b618 One of the flaws in this theory, as McDaniel points out, is that the State seeks to \u201cextend\u201d prosecutorial immunity that the Deputy County Attorney himself would never be in a position to assert in the first place. The State contends repeatedly that the Deputy County Attorney enjoys immunity for filing the petition for revocation. Yet, while that may be true in other circumstances, it is irrelevant with respect to the specific claims alleged by McDaniel-namely, breach of contract and deprivation of property arising out of that breach. N either of these claims has been-or could be-brought against the Deputy Comity Attorney for the simple reason that the prosecutor was not a party to the contract that McDaniel claims was breached. Indeed, McDaniel acknowledges that the prosecutor has no liability for breach of the Intervention Hearing Agreement. Rather, he contends, \u201cthe breach is the breach of the state, and not the breach of its agent.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZy\">\u00b619 McDaniel argued this point in the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">[Y]ou never reach the issue of immunity from breach of contract. You never get there because the prosecutor was not a party to this contract, the contract was made by the State. In order for a prosecutor-or in order for anyone to breach a contract that person must be a party to the contract. If the party-if that person is not a party to the contract then that person can have no liability for breach. And if there\u2019s no breach, no liability, then you never get to the issue as to whether or not there is immunity from liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG3\">\u00b620 For the State to \u201cextend\u201d the Deputy County Attorney\u2019s prosecutorial immunity to itself, the State must first establish that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Deputy County Attorney could raise prosecutorial immunity as a defense to McDaniel\u2019s claims if they were brought against him. <em>Cf. Lutheran Day Care, </em>829 P.2d at 755 (\u201c[I]t is apparent that if the immunity of individual officers is in question, then the immunity of the local government which employs them is certainly in question.\u201d). Yet, there is no factual or legal basis for McDaniel to bring his contract-based claims against the Deputy County Attorney. Thus, there being no possible occasion for the prosecutor to assert prosecutorial immunity to McDaniel\u2019s claims, there is no basis for the State to extend such immunity to itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b621 The State\u2019s arguments for extending prosecutorial immunity in this case reflect a misreading of McDaniel\u2019s claims. Those claims are not premised on any notion that the prosecutor\u2019s act of filing the petition for revocation was wrongful in itself. McDaniel does not contend that the prosecutor lacked probable cause; he does not contend that the prosecutor acted maliciously or defamed him; he does not contend that the prosecutor acted outside the scope of his duties; he does not seek to hold the State liable for the prosecutor\u2019s conduct under a theory of respondeat superior; and he does not seek to circumvent the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity by suing the State in lieu of the prosecutor. In short, the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s action vis-a-vis any duty or obligation the prosecutor himself may have owed to McDaniel is simply not implicated by McDaniel\u2019s breach of contract and procedural due process claims against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b622 Rather, McDaniel\u2019s claims are based on the alleged failure of the State itself to perform the terms of its alleged contract with McDaniel. Specifically, McDaniel claims that the State agreed not to file a formal violation, so long as he complied with certain conditions, but then, one week later, the State turned around and filed a formal violation, even though McDaniel was complying with the terms of their agreement. Restated, McDaniel claims that the State made him a promise, in writing, and then broke that promise, causing him damages. The State cites no authority for the proposition that the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity permits the State to avoid its contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u00b623 In this connection, although McDaniel raised the point in the District Court, the State has failed to reconcile its assertion of prosecutorial immunity in this case with the Legislature\u2019s unambiguous statement in \u00a7 18-l-404(l)(a), MCA (2003), that \u201c[t]he state of Montana is liable in respect to any contract entered into in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances . . . .\u201d The State proffers that sovereign immunity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>prosecutorial immunity are different concepts and are supported by different considerations of public policy. Yet, while this statement is correct, <em>see Dept. of Justice, </em>172 Mont. at 92, 560 P.2d at 1330, it is inapposite. The ultimate <em>result </em>of the State\u2019s exercise of prosecutorial immunity in this case would be functionally equivalent to the State\u2019s exercise of sovereign immunity: In either case, the State could not be held liable in respect to an alleged contract, contrary to the affirmative mandate of \u00a7 18-l-404(l)(a), MCA. <em>Cf. Orr v. State, </em>2004 MT 354, \u00b6 55, 324 Mont. 391, 106 P.3d 100 (observing that the defense of sovereign immunity does not mean there is no duty; rather, the breach of duty is simply not actionable against the sovereign). Thus, since \u201cthe legislature intended ... to waive the State\u2019s immunity as to express contracts,\u201d <em>Peretti v. State, </em>238 Mont. 239, 245, 777 P.2d 329, 333 (1989), it is incongruous for the State to assert immunity as a defense to an alleged express contract in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b624 The State relies on our observation in <em>Rosenthal v. County of Madison, </em>2007 MT 277, 339 Mont. 419, 170 P.3d 493, that \u201cwe have extended the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity to include county and state governments employing the prosecutors who find themselves named defendants in tort actions.\u201d <em>Rosenthal, </em>\u00b6 25 (citing <em>Ronek, </em>227 Mont. at 517-19, 740 P.2d at 1116-18, and <em>Koppen v. Board of Medical Examiners, </em>233 Mont. 214, 220, 759 P.2d 173, 176 (1988)). McDaniel counters that these cases are not on point or, alternatively, that we should \u201creexamine\u201d the cases. Based on our analysis above, however, we need not resolve these arguments. The Deputy County Attorney is not a named defendant to McDaniel\u2019s contract-based claims. Moreover, neither of these claims could be brought against the Deputy County Attorney, given that he was not a party to the contract that McDaniel claims was breached. Thus, as explained above, there being no possible occasion for the prosecutor to assert prosecutorial immunity to McDaniel\u2019s claims, there is no basis for the State to extend such immunity to itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b625  In conclusion, the State has provided no basis in law or in fact for the State to assert, much less prevail on, a defense of prosecutorial immunity to McDaniel\u2019s breach of contract and procedural due process claims. The District Court\u2019s contrary conclusion and the grant of summary judgment in favor of the State are, accordingly, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"AVQ\">\u00b626 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court err in denying McDaniel\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the State\u2019s liability?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u00b627 McDaniel argues that he is entitled to partial summary judgment with respect to the State\u2019s liability on his breach of contract and procedural due process claims. He bases this argument on principles of issue preclusion (collateral estoppel).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b628 Issue preclusion bars a party from reopening an issue that was litigated and determined in a prior suit. <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 281, 130 P.3d 1267. We apply a four-element test to determine whether relitigation of an issue is barred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">1. Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical to the issue raised in the action in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">2.

Was the party against whom preclusion is now asserted a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">4. Was the party against whom preclusion is now asserted afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue which may be barred?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\"><em>See Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Kubacki v. Molchan, </em>2007 MT 306, \u00b6 12, 340 Mont. 100, 172 P.3d 594; <em>Dowell v.

The issues to which McDaniel seeks to apply issue preclusion are whether the State breached an enforceable contract and whether the State deprived him of property without procedural due process of law. He clarifies that he is seeking judgment as a matter of law with respect to liability only and that damages remain to be determined on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">\u00b630 McDaniel lumps his breach of contract and deprivation of property claims into one analysis. With respect to the first element of the issue preclusion test, he argues that the question of the State\u2019s liability for breach of contract and violation of procedural due process were decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>within the context of his motions to dismiss the State\u2019s petition for revocation. He points to arguments made by the State in its briefs opposing McDaniel\u2019s motions, to proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by McDaniel and the State, and to the District Court\u2019s actual findings of fact and conclusions of law in its October 2004 order. Based on these, McDaniel contends that \u201ca contract, breach, and due process were at issue in the revocation proceeding. The issues were joined, briefed, argued, and resolved by the court.\u201d McDaniel further contends that the instant action involves the same contract, the same breach, the same due process violation, and the same issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b631 As for the second element, McDaniel argues that the District Court\u2019s order dismissing the State\u2019s petition for revocation constituted a final judgment on the merits of the State\u2019s liability for breach of contract and violation of procedural due process. Respecting the third element, McDaniel notes that the party against whom preclusion is asserted (the State) was a party to the prior adjudication. Finally, regarding the fourth element, McDaniel argues that the State, represented by counsel, \u201cparticipated fully\u201d in the revocation proceeding and had an adequate opportunity and incentive to litigate the breach of contract and procedural due process issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b632 In response, the State concedes the third element, i.e., that it was a party to the prior adjudication. The State argues, however, that McDaniel\u2019s argument fails on the first, second, and/or fourth elements. For the reasons which follow, we agree with the State as to McDaniel\u2019s procedural due process claim, but not with respect to his breach of contract claim. We address the breach of contract claim first.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">McDaniel\u2019s Breach of Contract Claim</p>\n<p id=\"Ak6_\">\u00b633 <em>Element 1. Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical to the issue raised in the action in question? </em>To determine whether the issue decided in the prior adjudication is identical to the issue raised in the present case, we compare the pleadings, evidence, and circumstances surrounding the two actions. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Holtman v. 4-G\u2019s Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>264 Mont. 432, 439, 872 P.2d 318, 322 (1994). But we do not equate an issue with \u201celements of a cause of action\u201d; rather, the bar that arises from collateral estoppel extends to all questions essential to the judgment and actively determined by a prior valid judgment. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 2<em>5; Haines Pipeline Constr., Inc. v. Montana Power Co., </em>265 Mont. 282, 288, 876 P.2d 632, 636 (1994). Moreover, collateral estoppel prevents relitigation of determinative facts which were actually or necessarily decided in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>prior action. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Haines, </em>265 Mont. at 288, 876 P.2d at 636. A litigant cannot avoid preclusion by reframing the issue or raising novel contentions. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 25. \u201c Tf a new legal theory or factual assertion put forward in the second action is related to the subject-matter and relevant to the issues that were litigated and adjudicated previously, so that it <em>could </em>have been raised, the judgment is conclusive on it despite the fact that it was not in fact expressly pleaded or otherwise urged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haines, </em>265 Mont. at 288-89, 876 P.2d at 636-37 (some internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>vol. IB, \u00b6 0.443[2], 760). Consistent with the purpose of promoting judicial economy, we apply collateral estoppel when the issues are so intertwined that to decide the issue before it, the district court would have to rehear the precise issue previously decided. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Martelli v. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, </em>258 Mont. 166, 169, 852 P.2d 579, 581 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b634 As to the issue of whether the State is liable for breach of an enforceable contract, we agree with McDaniel that this issue was decided in the prior adjudication. In his second motion to dismiss, McDaniel asserted that filing the petition for revocation constituted a breach of the Intervention Hearing Agreement-specifically, the clause stating that McDaniel \u201cagree [s] to the following conditions <em>in lieu of a formal violation being filed at this time\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The State responded that \u201c[t]he State did not attend the [intervention] hearing\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is absolutely false that the State ever entered into an agreement with the Defendant regarding the Defendant violating the terms of his probation.\u201d Following the District Court hearing in May 2004, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. McDaniel proposed a conclusion of law which stated: \u201cThe intervention hearing agreement is a contract by the state with defendant. The state\u2019s subsequent petition for revocation is a breach of contract.\u201d By contrast, the State offered the following: \u201cthe State was not represented at the [intervention] hearing\u201d; \u201cthe State of Montana and the Department of Corrections are not the same party nor are they a privy\u201d; and \u201cno agreement existed between the Defendant and the Department of Corrections or the State regarding admitting the alleged [probation] violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b635 The District Court did not agree with the State\u2019s position. Rather, it entered the following pertinent findings of facts and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u2022 \u201cThe State of Montana, acting through the Department of Corrections Adult Probation &amp; Parole, was clearly a party to the intervention hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u2022 \u201cThe contention of the Flathead County Attorney\u2019s Office that the State was not a party, nor was its interest represented, because the County Attorney\u2019s Office did not participate in the hearing, is simply not accurate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">\u2022 \u201c[T]he party in this litigation is the State of Montana, not the Flathead County Attorney\u2019s Office, and the officers involved [at the intervention hearing] had absolutely no authority or capacity to perform their job as they did herein other than as agents of the State of Montana.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\u2022 \u201cThere was a valid, binding agreement between the Defendant and the State of Montana with which the Defendant has fully complied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u2022 \u201cThe clear intent of the Legislature [expressed in \u00a7 46-23-1015(1), MCA,] is that if an intervention hearing is initiated, and if the probationer\u2019s compliance with the conditions of probation is \u2018gain[ed],\u2019 there would not then be a \u2018formal revocation hearing under 46-18-203,\u2019 for the same violation\u201d (second brackets in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">\u2022 \u201cBy the terms of the agreement, the State got what it bargained for: compliance thereafter by the Defendant with the rules of probation, as amended in the agreement, and there is no valid argument that the Defendant is NOT entitled to get what he bargained for: that the intervention agreement was \u2018in lieu of a formal violation being filed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">\u2022 \u201cThe State had the opportunity in the intervention hearing to address and resolve the issue of what consequences should be imposed upon the Defendant for his violation of the conditions of probation, and the issue was resolved. By the clear terms of the statute and the intervention hearing agreement, the State cannot now, for the same violation, initiate litigation intended to resolve that issue with a different result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">As noted, the State did not appeal from the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"AoO\">\u00b636  The conclusion that the State breached an enforceable agreement is inescapable in light of the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court determined that the State and McDaniel had entered \u201ca valid, binding agreement\u201d and that the terms of this agreement, when read in conjunction with the controlling statute (\u00a7 46-23-1015(1), MCA), precluded the State from initiating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>formal revocation hearing so long as McDaniel complied with the agreement. McDaniel did comply with the agreement; thus, the State had a contractual obligation not to initiate a formal revocation hearing arising out of the same probation violation. Nevertheless, the State initiated a formal revocation hearing. Accordingly, the terms of the agreement were breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b637 The State contends that the issue decided by the District Court in the revocation proceeding \u201cwas whether the State could revoke McDaniel\u2019s suspended sentence based on his admission to violating his probation by using cocaine when that admission was made during an informal probation violation intervention hearing.\u201d This is patently incorrect. The District Court did not even reach the question of whether McDaniel\u2019s admission during the intervention hearing was sufficient to revoke his suspended sentence. What the District Court decided, rather, was that the State had the opportunity at the intervention hearing to address and resolve the issue of what consequences should be imposed upon McDaniel for his probation violation; this issue was resolved at the intervention hearing; and \u201c[b]y the clear terms of the statute and the intervention hearing agreement, the State cannot now, for the same violation, initiate litigation intended to resolve that issue with a different result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b638 The State also asserts that the District Court \u201cdid not decide the issue raised by McDaniel in this case-whether he could recover damages from the State\u2019s alleged breach of contract.\u201d But this likewise misstates the relevant issue. McDaniel does not claim that he is entitled to partial summary judgment on the issue of damages. He claims that he is entitled to partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. We accordingly disagree with the State that the first element of the issue preclusion test is not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b639 <em>Element 2. Was there a final judgment on the merits in the prior adjudication? </em>To determine whether a final judgment on the merits has been reached, we look to see if the issue was actually litigated and adjudged as shown on the face of the judgment. <em>Lane v. Farmers Union </em>Ins., 1999 MT 252, \u00b6 41, 296 Mont. 267, 989 P.2d 309. Before giving preclusive effect to a judgment or order, \u201c \u2018the court should determine that the decision to be carried over was adequately deliberated and firm, even if not final in the sense of forming a basis for a judgment already entered[, and should refuse preclusion] if the decision was avowedly tentative.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 22 (brackets in <em>Baltrusch) </em>(quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 13 cmt. g (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u00b640 Here, the District Court\u2019s October 2004 decision in relation to the State\u2019s obligations and conduct under the terms of the Intervention Hearing Agreement was adequately deliberated. The parties were fully heard on this issue not only in their respective briefs and proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law, but also at the May 2004 hearing. The court supported its decision with a reasoned opinion, consisting of 11 Findings of Fact and 10 Conclusions of Law. The court\u2019s order conclusively determined the issue of the State\u2019s failure to abide by its obligation under the Agreement not to initiate a formal revocation hearing. The court dismissed the State\u2019s petition for revocation, and the revocation proceedings were thereby concluded. The court\u2019s decision was firm, not avowedly tentative, and it was subject to appeal, though the State did not avail itself of this option. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 1(b)(1) (2003); <em>State v. Finley, </em>2003 MT 239, \u00b6 29, 317 Mont. 268, 77 P.3d 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b641 The State contends that the second element is not satisfied because \u201cthere was no final adjudication of [McDaniel\u2019s] civil claim for damages in the probation revocation proceeding.\u201d Again, however, McDaniel is seeking partial summary judgment on liability, not damages. The State cites no authority for its single-sentence assertion that the District Court\u2019s October 2004 order was not a final judgment on the State\u2019s liability for breaching the Intervention Hearing Agreement because the court did not also address what damages McDaniel is entitled to. We conclude that the second element is met.</p>\n<p id=\"A_F\">\u00b642 <em>Element\u00e9. </em>Was <em>the party against whom preclusion is now asserted afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue which may be barred? </em>Because the State concedes Element 3, we proceed to the fourth. The burden is on the party attempting to defeat the application of issue preclusion to establish the absence of a full and fair opportunity to litigate. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 18. As the foregoing discussion reflects, the State was afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues of whether the Intervention Hearing Agreement was an enforceable contract and whether the State\u2019s filing the petition for revocation was in breach of that Agreement. Indeed, these are exactly the issues the State litigated in response to McDaniel\u2019s second motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the State contends that this element is not satisfied because \u201cthe State had no opportunity to raise its defenses ... to McDaniel\u2019s civil damage claims.\u201d The State identifies prosecutorial immunity, lack of consideration, invalid contract, and superseding and intervening cause as defenses it purportedly had no opportunity to raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u00b643 We disagree with the State\u2019s contention. First, the issues addressed by the District Court\u2019s October 2004 order and raised by McDaniel in his breach of contract claim are whether the State made an enforceable promise in the Intervention Hearing Agreement and whether it failed to fulfill that promise. The defense of prosecutorial immunity has nothing to do with these issues. Rather, this defense, if it applied, would entitle the State to dismissal of the action without ever reaching the issue of contract enforceability and breach, which the State itself acknowledges at the outset. <em>Cf. Orr v. State, </em>2004 MT 354, \u00b6 55, 324 Mont. 391, 106 P.3d 100 (\u201cImmunity is a matter of avoidance, an affirmative defense. .. . The sovereign immunity defense does not mean that there is an absence of duty; rather, at the time that the immunity defense exists, the breach of duty is simply not actionable against the sovereign.\u201d). Moreover, in any event, the State has raised and fully argued its prosecutorial immunity defense within the context of the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b644 Second, while the State claims that its other enumerated defenses \u201cwere not raised in the probation revocation proceedings,\u201d the fact is that the State did argue contract invalidity due to lack of consideration. Specifically, as recited in the District Court\u2019s order, the State argued that the Intervention Hearing Agreement did not contain \u201cany additional requirement of probation that the Defendant was not previously subjected to by the Judgment and Sentence dated July 28, 2003, nor any condition that the Department of Probation and Parole, prior to the occurrence of the alleged violation or the intervention hearing, did not have the authority to impose on the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b645  Lastly, the fact that a party did not raise certain defenses in the prior adjudication does not necessarily mean that the party has been denied a full and fair \u201copportunity\u201d to litigate the issue to be barred. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 18. Here, the issue of the State\u2019s liability for breach of an enforceable contract unquestionably was raised, briefed, and argued in the prior adjudication. That the State did not raise certain defenses to this issue at the time does not mean it did not have the <em>opportunity </em>to litigate its liability for breach of contract and to raise these defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\u00b646  In sum, all four elements of issue preclusion are satisfied with respect to the State\u2019s liability on McDaniel\u2019s breach of contract claim. There are no genuine issues of material fact, and McDaniel is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this specific issue. We accordingly reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment denying McDaniel\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>partial summary judgment on the State\u2019s liability for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">McDaniel\u2019s Procedural Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b647 With respect to McDaniel\u2019s due process claim, we agree with the State that McDaniel\u2019s argument fails on the first and fourth elements. While McDaniel portrays the District Court\u2019s inclusion of due process considerations in its analysis as an adjudication of the State\u2019s liability for a procedural due process violation, the fact is that the court referred to \u201cdue process\u201d as a requirement of <em>conducting revocation proceedings, </em>not <em>depriving a person of property. </em>Specifically, quoting <em>State v. Finley, </em>2003 MT 239, \u00b6 29, 317 Mont. 268, 77 P.3d 193, the District Court observed that \u201c[t]he minimum requirements of due process apply to sentence revocation hearings, and \u2018[tjhe foundation of the guarantee of due process is fairness, which calls for safeguards tailored to the demands of the particular legal context of probation revocation\u2019 \u201d (second brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b648 It is true the District Court also stated that \u201c[wjithin the due process guarantee of fairness, \u2018safeguards tailored to the demands of the particular legal context of probation revocation\u2019 include the requirement that the State also comply with its obligations under the agreement\u201d (quoting <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 29). However, we understand this to be a conclusion that allowing the revocation proceedings to proceed would contravene the requirement of fairness in such proceedings, not a conclusion that the State had \u201cdeprived Mr. McDaniel of his property in the benefits of the written contract and administrative decision without procedural due process of law,\u201d as McDaniel now alleges in his Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">\u00b649 But even aside from our interpretations of the District Court\u2019s statements, McDaniel\u2019s argument fails due to the fact that he never raised a due process argument in his motions to dismiss. Rather, he argued \u201cres judicata\u201d in one motion and breach of contract in the other. \u201cDue process\u201d is nowhere to be found in either motion. Nor is \u201cdue process\u201d mentioned in his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. As a result, the State did not address the due process issue that McDaniel now claims was adjudicated in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">\u00b650 In sum, McDaniel\u2019s argument in relation to his procedural due process claim fails on the first and fourth elements of the issue preclusion test. It does not appear that the State\u2019s liability for a procedural due process violation was decided in the prior adjudication. More importantly, McDaniel\u2019s suggestion that the State was afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the procedural due process issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>is not supported by the record. Accordingly, the District Court correctly denied his motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the State\u2019s liability on his due process claim-albeit, for the wrong reason. Nevertheless, we uphold a district court\u2019s judgment if the court reaches the correct result, regardless of the court\u2019s reasoning. <em>Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 21, 344 Mont. 540, 189 P.3d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b651  The State cannot prevail on a defense of prosecutorial immunity to McDaniel\u2019s breach of contract and procedural due process claims. Accordingly, the District Court erred in granting the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b652  McDaniel is entitled under the doctrine of issue preclusion to judgment as a matter of law on the State\u2019s liability for breach of an enforceable agreement (the Intervention Hearing Agreement). The District Court therefore erred in denying his motion for partial summary judgment on his breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\u00b653  However, McDaniel is not entitled by issue preclusion to judgment as a matter of law on the State\u2019s liability for deprivation of property without procedural due process of law. Thus, the District Court correctly denied his motion for partial summary judgment as to his procedural due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\u00b654 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-7\"> The State asserts that we should not consider McDaniel\u2019s \u201cagency argument\u201d because it is being raised for the first time on appeal. This assertion is without merit. Although this Court generally will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal, <em>In re T.C., </em>2008 MT 335, \u00b6 20, 346 Mont. 200, 194 P.3d 653, McDaniel made his \u201cagency argument\u201d during the summary judgment proceedings (some of which is quoted in \u00b6 19, <em>infra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-12\"> To promote clarity, the trend has been to use the terms \u201cclaim preclusion\u201d and \u201cissue preclusion\u201d in lieu of \u201cres judicata\u201d and \u201ccollateral estoppel,\u201d respectively. <em>See Gann v.

For purposes of establishing liability, the Court holds that the breach of contract was the determination \u201cto initiate a formal revocation hearing\u201d by the \u201cDeputy Flathead County Attorney [who] was acting as an agent of the State of Montana when he filed the petition to revoke.\u201d <em>Opinion, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15, 36. Thus, the State is liable because its agent, the prosecutor, filed a proceeding in breach of the contract. However, for purposes of immunity, the Court insists that McDaniel\u2019s claims \u201care not premised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>on any notion that the prosecutor\u2019s act of filing the petition was wrongful in itself,\u201d and that it is \u201cthe failure of <em>the State itself </em>to perform the terms of its alleged contract.\u201d <em>Opinion, </em>\u00b6 21 (emphasis added). In the Court\u2019s view, the State is not acting through its agent-prosecutor for purposes of immunity and prosecutorial immunity may therefore be bypassed. Thus, under the Court\u2019s analysis, the wrongful act by the agent which created the liability of the principal has been transformed for immunity purposes into an act which, first, was not actually wrongful, and second, did not legally involve the agent. I believe this is a faulty analysis on several grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b657 The Court reaches these conflicting conclusions by reasoning that because \u201cthe State\u2019s agents were not parties to the alleged contract... they cannot be liable to McDaniel for breaching.\u201d This is premised upon the Court\u2019s assertion, made without citation to authority, that \u201cthere is no factual or legal basis for McDaniel to bring his contract-based claims against the Deputy County Attorney.\u201d To the contrary, an agent\u2019s act in breach of the principal\u2019s contract may well be actionable against both the agent and the principal, even if the agent was not a party to the contract, because the principal for whom the agent acted was a party. <em>See Crystal Springs Trout Co. v. First State Bank, </em>225 Mont. 122, 129, 732 P.2d 819, 823 (1987) (\u201can agent is jointly and severally liable with his principal to third parties for wrongful acts committed in the course of his agency.\u201d) However, we need not resolve this joint liability issue to decide this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b658 Although liability and immunity are different concepts, nonetheless, the State here acted only by way of its agent, and could not have acted without its agent. The Court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe State itself\u2019 breached the contract is simply not true. The State did not \u201cact by itself.\u201d Had the prosecutor not acted, there would have been no breach of contract. Thus, only by accepting McDaniel\u2019s creative, yet impossible allegation that the State acted without an agent can the Court conclude that the State must stand apart from its \u00e1gent for immunity purposes. There is no authority for this proposition and it is legal fiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u00b659 Refocusing on what I believe is the factual reality of this case, McDaniel sued the State because the Deputy County Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>initiated a prosecution against him, which breached the contract. Neither party disputes that the prosecutor was acting as an agent of the State and within the scope of his duties when he filed the petition to revoke against McDaniel. As the Court correctly states, \u201cthe terms of the agreement were breached\u201d when \u201cthe State initiated a formal revocation hearing.\u201d <em>Opinion, </em>\u00b6 36. In other words, the \u201cact\u201d which forms the basis of McDaniel\u2019s complaint was committed by a State agent pursuant to the prosecutorial discretion afforded to him by law.</p>\n<p id=\"ATT\">\u00b660 Regarding immunity for this act, we have held that a prosecutor is \u201cabsolutely immune from civil liability\u201d when he acts within the scope of his duties. <em>Rosenthal v. Co. of Madison, </em>2007 MT 277, \u00b6 29, 339 Mont. 419, 170 P.3d 493. Notably, we did not qualify the immunity by holding that prosecutors are immune from \u201ccivil tort actions,\u201d but rather from \u201ccivil liability\u201d generally and absolutely, a broader definition. Further, we stated that initiating prosecutions and dismissing complaints are precisely the sorts of actions prosecutorial immunity was designed to cover. <em>Rosenthal, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b661 A proper analysis of this case would determine whether immunity defeats McDaniel\u2019s suit under the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cfunctional analysis.\u201d <em>Rosenthal, </em>\u00b6 29 (citing <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 429-30, 96 S. Ct. 984, 994 (1976)). \u201cThis approach examines the nature of the functions with which a particular official or class of officials has been lawfully entrusted, seeking to evaluate the \u2018effect that exposure to particular forms of liability would likely have on the appropriate exercise of those functions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Steele v. McGregor, </em>1998 MT 85, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 238, 956 P.2d 1364 (quoting <em>Forrester v. White, </em>484 U.S. 219, 224, 108 S.

Ct. at 544 (emphasis added). The judicial lens should focus upon the actions taken by the governmental agent, not the type of suit brought by the claimant, the political subdivision selected by the litigant, or any other crafty pleading technique. <em>Imbler, </em>424 U.S. at 429-30, 96 S. Ct. at 994-95; <em>see also Burns v. Reed, </em>500 U.S. 478, 486, 111 S. Ct. 1934, 1939 (1991); <em>Westfall v. Erwin, </em>484 U.S. 292, 296 n. 3, 108 S. Ct. 580, 583 n. 3 (1988); <em>Culpepper v. Smith, </em>792 S.W.2d 293, 300 (Ark. 1990) (holding the only condition to applying the immunity to prosecutors is the determination of whether the acts complained of were acts committed within the scope of their prosecutorial duties).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b662 Clearly, the prosecutor\u2019s filing of the revocation action was functionally within the scope of his normal duties. However, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>has mistakenly focused on the distinction between contract and tort claims, instead of on function. Any breach of the Intervention Hearing Agreement at issue here occurred singularly because the Flathead County Deputy Attorney exercised his discretion by filing a petition for revocation of McDaniel\u2019s sentence. As a prosecutor acting within the scope of the duties he is charged with administering, his actions are absolutely immunized from civil liability. This common, virtually daily prosecutorial task of filing a petition to revoke should not expose the State to civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b663 Once the challenged acts are functionally determined to be within the scope of the prosecutor\u2019s duties and immunized, immunity likewise extends to the State. <em>State ex. Rel. Dept. of Justice v. Dist. Ct., </em>172 Mont. 88, 560 P.2d 1328 (1976). The Court\u2019s suggestion that such an extension in this case could only occur through \u201cderivative immunity\u201d is not correct, given a proper application of the function analysis. In <em>Dept, of Justice, </em>we held that the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity must encompass the State as well as the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">The public policy which requires immunity for the prosecuting attorney <em>also requires immunity for both the state and the county </em>for acts of judicial and quasi-judicial officers in the performance of the duties which rest upon them; otherwise, the objectives sought by immunity to the individual officers would be seriously impaired or destroyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\"><em>Dept. of Justice, </em>172 Mont. at 92, 560 P.2d at 1330 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Creelman v. Svenning, </em>410 P.2d 606, 608 (Wash. 1966)). Thus, the State may raise the defense of prosecutorial immunity to shield itself from liability against claims founded upon the discretionary acts of a prosecutor within the scope of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u00b664 The Court has concluded, without the aid of primary authority, that the Deputy County Attorney must first be personally liable before the State can assert co-extensive immunity. <em>See Opinion, </em>\u00b6 20 (\u201cFor the State to \u2018extend\u2019... immunity to itself, the State must first establish that the Deputy County Attorney could raise prosecutorial immunity.\u201d). However, in addition to the contrary principles discussed above, we declined a similar proposition made in <em>Koppen v. Board of Med. Examrs., </em>233 Mont. 214, 759 P.2d 173 (1988). Justice Sheehy\u2019s separate opinion in <em>Koppen </em>took the position that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">No question is presented in this case that relates to the <em>personal liability </em>of the Board members who allegedly failed to act .... When there is no risk of personal liability for damages to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>government officials involved, the reason for common law official liability evaporates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><em>Koppen, </em>233 Mont. at 221, 759 P.2d at 177. The Court was not persuaded that immunity should only apply when Board members are subject to personal liability, holding that \u201cthe quasi-judicial immunity afforded to the Board must encompass the State. The Board\u2019s discretion would be equally subject to distortion by considerations of possible litigation against the State arising from its actions.\u201d <em>Koppen, </em>233 Mont. at 220, 759 P.2d at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b665 I believe the Court\u2019s analysis further errs by its application of \u00a7 18-l-404(l)(a), MCA, on which the Court premises the State\u2019s liability for breach of contract. This provision is from Title 18, the public contracting section of the Code, which regulates \u201cresident bidders\u201d and \u201cnonresident bidders,\u201d contracts for \u201cgoods,\u201d and \u201cconstruction, repair and public works,\u201d \u201chiring preferences,\u201d \u201cbid security,\u201d \u201ccontracting entities,\u201d \u201cadvertisement for bids,\u201d \u201cforfeiture of contracts,\u201d \u201cprepayment of public contractors,\u201d and such like. This statute has nothing to do with the criminal proceeding out of which McDaniel\u2019s claim arises, but is a civil statute. We have previously said that \u201c[t]his individual statute may not be read and properly understood in a vacuum.\u201d <em>Peretti v. State, </em>238 Mont. 239, 244, 777 P.2d 329, 332 (1989). Section 18-1-404, MCA, was enacted as part of \u201cAn Act Permitting Action on Express Contracts Against the State of Montana and Describing the Practice and Procedure Thereof.\u201d <em>Peretti, </em>238 Mont. at 245, 777 P.2d at 333. It provides \u201c[t]he state of Montana is liable in respect to any contract entered into in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, except the state of Montana is not liable for punitive damages.\u201d Section 18-1-404, MCA. Beyond having never been previously applied to claims arising out of the criminal law context, the plain wording of the provision demonstrates the Court\u2019s use is improper. Under what \u201clike circumstances\u201d could a private individual ever enter a contract to defer prosecution of a criminal offender? More critically, it is error for the Court to hold that \u00a7 18-l-404(l)(a), MCA, constitutes a waiver of prosecutorial immunity, when the provision does not even come close to doing so by its terms. \u201cAs with prosecutorial immunity, quasi-judicial immunity is not a subject of Montana statutory law.... where the law is not declared by statute, the common law shall be the rule of a decision.\u201d <em>Koppen, </em>233 Mont. at 218, 759 P.2d at 175. However, under the Court\u2019s holding, this statute has effectuated such a waiver of prosecutorial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"Aps\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u00b666 Though we have applied contract law generally in interpreting agreements concerning criminal defendants, intervention, plea, and other agreements are not conventional obligations, and we have never concluded that they would support a separate civil cause of action for damages upon a breach, consistent with the law generally in that regard. <em>See </em>17B C.J.S. <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 600 <em>(1999); Lewis v. La., </em>602 So. 2d 68, 75 (La. App. 1992). The intervention agreement is part of Montana\u2019s Criminal Procedure, Title 46, MCA. Could the State civilly sue a defendant for breach of contract for breaching a plea agreement, and collect damages? Under the Court\u2019s reasoning, it apparently could be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b667 Finally, the Court reasons that because application of prosecutorial immunity would affect the same result as sovereign immunity, it should similarly be disposed, citing the sovereign immunity cases of <em>Orr </em>and <em>Peretti. Opinion, </em>\u00b6 23. However, though prosecutorial immunity and sovereign immunity may reach a functionally equivalent result, these two immunities are distinct concepts supported by separate policy rationale. <em>Dept. of Just., </em>172 Mont. at 92, 560 P.2d at 1330. Sovereign immunity, or governmental immunity, stems from a state\u2019s classification as a sovereign entity. It prevents citizens from suing a state absent its consent regardless of the type of harm claimed. <em>Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, </em>205 U.S. 349, 353, 27 S. Ct. 526, 527 (1907) (\u201cthere can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends\u201d). Unlike sovereign immunity, which is premised upon a state\u2019s status, prosecutorial immunity depends upon the actions the prosecutor took when the alleged harm occurred, and applies only to acts committed within the scope of a prosecutor\u2019s official duties. <em>Imbler, </em>424 U.S. at 422-23, 96 S. Ct. at 991. We have cited and relied upon important policies supporting prosecutorial immunity, noting the potential influence upon a prosecutor\u2019s decision-making was precisely the catalyst for the adoption of prosecutorial immunity. As the Supreme Court stated over thirty years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">The common-law immunity of a prosecutor is based upon the same considerations that underlie the common-law immunities of judges and grant jurors acting within the scope of their duties. These include concern that harassment by unfounded litigation would cause a deflection of the prosecutor\u2019s energies from his public duties, and the possibility that he would shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>Imbler, </em>424 U.S. at 422-23, 96 S. Ct. at 991. The reason for extending immunity to public officials such as prosecutors and judges is not for the protection or benefit of a malicious or corrupt official, but for the benefit of the public, whose interest is that officials should be at liberty to exercise their functions with independence and without fear of retribution. <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 553-54, 87 S. Ct. 1213, 1218 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b668 The Court\u2019s decision today conflicts with these important policy considerations. As a practical consequence, prosecutors will now need to consider the potential for claims which could be brought against the State because of their actions-even those within the normal scope of their prosecutorial duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b669 I would affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing McDaniel\u2019s complaint and awarding summary judgment to the State on the grounds of prosecutorial immunity. I would not reach Issue Two.</p>\n<judges id=\"b470-7\">JUSTICE WARNER joins in the dissent opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\"> The Court also classifies the State\u2019s argument as one for \u201cderivative immunity,\u201d which the Court discusses at length and then dismisses. However, this is a \u201cstraw man\u201d analysis. For the reasons explained herein, there is no need for the State to seek derivative immunity, and it has not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
