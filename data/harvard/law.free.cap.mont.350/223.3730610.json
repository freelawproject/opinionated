We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Crosley\u2019s challenge for cause of potential juror H. J. Aronson (Aronson).</p>\n<p id=\"A8J\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court properly admitted evidence of other acts of incest outside of Ravalli County under the transaction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">\u00b65 Whether Crosley was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u00b66 Whether the District Court erred in sentencing Crosley pursuant to the law in effect at the time of sentencing rather than at the time of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b67 The evidence at trial indicated that Crosley abused his three oldest children from 1990 to 1998, while the family frequently moved residences, generally living in Ravalli County, Montana. Daughters, A.P. and J.P., were born in 1986 and 1988, and son, R.J., was born in 1991. Crosley was not charged with abusing his youngest daughters, R.P. and H.P., born in 1994 and 1997. Crosley\u2019s ex-wife, E.P., provided a chronology of where the family lived during this time. Crosley\u2019s children testified at trial about his escalating abuse, using the family\u2019s frequent moves and births of additional children to frame particular recollections of abuse. The charges against Crosley were similarly broken down by timeframes corresponding to residences where the abuse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b68 A.P. testified that Crosley began sexually abusing her when she was approximately four. Initially the abuse consisted of fondling and oral sex. When A.P. was six or seven, the abuse escalated to sexual intercourse, and by the time she was nine, the abuse included anal sex. A.P. testified that the abuse continued until she disclosed it in 1998 when she was 12. After A.P.\u2019s disclosure, J.P. recalled her father had touched her inappropriately as well. J.P. remembered fondling, but did not recall any instances of sexual intercourse or oral sex. A.P. testified that Crosley was the main disciplinarian in their house, and the primary form of discipline was spanking. Crosley initially spanked the children with his hands, but began using wooden spoons and an electrical cord as the children got older. Crosley hit both R. J. and J.P. with the plug end of a cord, sometimes on their bare skin. The children testified that Crosley shoved them, kicked them, and hung them upside down by their ankles. A.P. also testified that Crosley used pliers to twist her fingers until they cracked.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b69 Crosley\u2019s sexual abuse of A.P. started while the family lived in an apartment on Second Street in Corvallis, Montana. A.P. recounted that while she was playing dress up and pretending to be a bride, Crosley gave her a little gold ring, had her repeat marriage vows, and told her she was his wife. Crosley reminded A.P. that she was his wife throughout her childhood. The first instances of sexual abuse at the Second Street apartment involved Crosley putting A.P.\u2019s hand on his penis, Crosley touching A.P.\u2019s genitals, and Crosley forcing A.P. to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>perform oral sex on him at least three times. A.P. testified that the sexual contact continued when the family moved to Marcus Street in Hamilton, although her only vivid memory was Crosley teaching her how to \u201cFrench kiss.\u201d The family moved to Charlos Heights where Crosley fondled A.P.\u2019s genitals and had her stroke his penis. A.P. testified about being in the back seat of a car in the garage where Crosley forced her to perform oral sex on him. Crosley\u2019s sister-in-law, Tonya Crosley, testified that she walked into the garage on one occasion and found A.P. in the back seat of a vehicle with Crosley.</p>\n<p id=\"ANb\">\u00b610 Crosley had sexual intercourse with A.P. for the first time during a trip to California at the time the family was living in the Charlos Heights house. When A.P. tried to get away, Crosley slapped her across the face and knocked her off the bed. A.P. recalled bleeding and soreness in her vaginal area for several days. She was about seven years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b611 Crosley used religion and social isolation to keep his sexual abuse a secret. Crosley invoked the Bible numerous times to convince A.P. that there was nothing wrong with their sexual relationship and that she was his wife. Crosley assured A.P. that they should not tell her mother about their relationship because she did not think it was okay to have more than one wife, and she would be angry with A.P. and love her even less than she already did. Crosley convinced A.P. that her mother did not love her as much as she loved A.P.\u2019s siblings and that only he really loved her.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b612 The sexual abuse continued as the family moved around Montana, living outside of Ravalli County in Missoula and Ronan for several years. Crosley\u2019s sexual abuse of A.P. escalated to anal intercourse in Ronan. This caused A.P. extreme embarrassment and bleeding. During this time, Crosley and A.P. often visited her paternal grandparents in Corvallis where the sexual abuse continued. A.P. testified to multiple incidents of sexual intercourse, oral sex, and genital touching in an upstairs bedroom at her grandparents\u2019 house, as well as three occasions when Crosley made her perform oral sex on him in her grandparents\u2019 barn.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b613 While the family lived in Ronan, A.P. recalled seeing Crosley fondle J.P. and Crosley put J.P.\u2019s hand on his penis. Crosley began allowing J.P. to watch the sexual contact between him and A.P. A.P. recounted one incident when the girls were playing dress up with strips of cloth to mimic Indian princesses and Crosley tied J.P. up with some of the strips, forcing her to watch as Crosley had sex with A.P. While J.P. did not recall ever having intercourse with Crosley, she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>remember how he would fondle her under her dress while she sat in his lap.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b614 When the family moved to Fish Hatchery Road outside of Hamilton, the sexual abuse escalated to what A.P. described as a \u201ctorture stage.\u201d There was a small room in the basement that was reached through a hole in the foundation wall where Crosley\u2019s sexual intercourse with A.P. became a \u201cfairly regular occurrence.\u201d J.P. recounted at trial that she once found Crosley and A.P. naked on a mattress in the crawl space in the basement. Crosley also hung both A.P. and J.P. by their ankles from the ceiling in the basement. A.P. also testified that Crosley used pliers to twist her fingers until they cracked in this basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b615 Crosley physically abused his children on multiple occasions. He was particularly violent to R. J. Crosley repeatedly spanked him with the plug end of a lamp cord, shoved him into walls, and picked him up by the head. J.P. recounted being thrown to the ground and kicked repeatedly by Crosley once when she did not complete a task to his liking.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b616 The family moved to the Main Street house in Corvallis where all forms of sexual abuse continued. Crosley would drive down to their church parking lot where he had A.P. sit on his lap in a skirt or dress without underwear and fondle her as she read the Book of Psalms from the Bible. A.P. invited friends to spend the night to celebrate her 12th birthday when Crosley was scheduled to be out of town. Crosley returned unexpectedly and ordered A.P. to follow him to his bedroom where he had sex with her while her guests were in the living room. J.P. remembered that A.P. emerged from the bedroom looking sad and dejected. Crosley then called J.P. into the bedroom where he put his penis in her panties.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b617 A.P. finally disclosed Crosley\u2019s years of sexual abuse to her mother. On one prior occasion when she was about nine, her mother read her a \u201cGood Touch, Bad Touch\u201d book and A.P. disclosed that Crosley had \u201crubbed\u201d on her. This led her mother to confront Crosley and implement some \u201cmodesty rules,\u201d however the abuse resumed. A.P. effectively disclosed Crosley\u2019s abuse after her 12th birthday, when she began hearing Crosley telling her younger sister, R.P., the same things he used to tell her, that her mother did not love her anymore because R.P. was no longer the baby of the family. After A.P.\u2019s disclosure, E.P. initially tried to work things out with their pastor\u2019s help, however soon went to the authorities. Detective Peter Clarkson with the Ravalli County Sheriffs Office interviewed A.P. regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>sexual abuse in 1998, and again in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b618 On August 12, 1999, Crosley was charged by information with incest, involving sexual intercourse without consent with A.P. Crosley appeared with counsel and pled not guilty on August 25,1999. Crosley was released on his own recognizance, failed to appear for his omnibus hearing, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest on November 17, 1999. Crosley was a fugitive until his arrest in August, 2006. Following a renewed investigation, an Amended Information was filed charging Crosley with seven counts of incest. A second Amended Information was filed on December 11, 2006, charging Crosley with eight counts of incest, corresponding to time periods associated with where the abuse occurred and which child was the victim; three counts of assault on a minor, one for each child; and bail jumping.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b619 On November 30, 2006, the State filed a Notice of Intent to Introduce Evidence of Other Crimes, Wrongs &amp; Acts (Notice). The Notice indicated that the State would offer evidence of a \u201cvery significant trip to Sacramento, California, where Defendant first elevated his abuse from sexual assaults to sexual intercourse,\u201d in addition to evidence of sexual and physical abuse that occurred in Missoula and Lake Counties between 1993 and 1995. The State relied upon the transaction rule, \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, and in \u201can abundance of caution\u201d provided a Modified <em>Just </em>Notice under M. R. Evid. 404(b). On the first day of trial, March 5, 2007, defense counsel stated his belief that the Notice \u201cwould have met the legal standards.\u201d The judge noted that he had reviewed the Notice and \u201cthere being no objection, the notice is found to be sufficient and the State is allowed to inquire into the areas covered by that notice during the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b620 During voir dire, the prosecutor, Mr. Fulbright, questioned potential juror Aronson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">MR. FULBRIGHT: A detective with the Sheriffs Department by the name of Pete Clarkson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">Does anybody know Detective Clarkson or had occasion to have run in with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">Okay. I\u2019ve got to go to my cheat sheet here. Mr. Aronson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-11\">THE COURT: Do you know Detective Clarkson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-13\">MR. FULBRIGHT: How do you know him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-14\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Just professionally. I work for the Forest Service and he works for us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>MR. FULBRIGHT: So he had a long career here, you knew that, and you had a long career with the Forest Service, it looks like. You guys crossed path a few times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">MR. FULBRIGHT: So the question that\u2019s really relevant is this: Detective Clarkson is going to be up here for a few minutes testifying during this trial, was involved in this case. The question for you would be: Detective Clarkson\u2019s testimony versus other people\u2019s testimony and such, the fact that you know Detective Clarkson in whatever manner, or however little you know him, would that affect your ability to view his testimony the same as other people\u2019s testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I would give a lot of credibility to his testimony from knowing him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">MR. FULBRIGHT: Okay. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">Would you be able to listen his testimony and then some other witnesses, maybe even people that disagreed with him, let\u2019s suppose that happens, someone disagrees with Detective Clarkson, and be able to set aside the fact that one of those was Detective Clarkson and one is Witness B, and say let me look at the facts and weigh those out and keep an open mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Somewhat, yeah. I\u2019d tend to believe Mr. Clarkson, but I\u2019d try to keep an open mind, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">MR. FULBRIGHT: Could you keep an open mind, look at the facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-11\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-12\">MR. FULBRIGHT: I appreciate your candor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">\u00b621 Defense counsel, Mr. Eschenbacher, immediately questioned Aronson at the start of his voir dire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-14\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: Mr. Aronson, you said you know Detective Clarkson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-15\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-16\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: And you actually value his testimony very strongly, didn\u2019t you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-17\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes, I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-18\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: If it came down to Detective Clarkson saying A and an unknown witness saying B, who are you going to believe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-19\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Probably Mr. Clarkson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-20\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: And that\u2019s based on your knowledge of him. He\u2019s a decent gentleman. He\u2019s been around a long time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>But based on that, if it was totally neutral what the information was but they contradicted each other, you automatically would have to follow in line with Detective Clarkson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I would tend to believe him before I\u2019d believe somebody I didn\u2019t know because I know he\u2019s a very credible man in my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: We\u2019re not attacking his credibility. We\u2019re exploring testimony it\u2019s mostly when it comes down to if Detective Clarkson said something and you\u2019re going into the jury room to deliberate and someone else had another witness had said something, do you think you would be fair to the other jurors or would you just say Pete Clarkson said it, I don\u2019t need to worry about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: People can make mistakes on what they think they saw, too. I\u2019d consider that, of course, but I just don\u2019t think that Pete would lie on the witness stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: And again, I'm sorry, I don\u2019t want it misconstrued. I\u2019m not saying people would lie. I\u2019m saying maybe a difference of opinion or difference of observation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: Would that affect you, how you would look at it, that maybe Pete would look at it differently than somebody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I would look at it from what people have said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-11\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: Okay. But if you looked at it from what they both said, you give me the impression that you think that Detective Clarkson word would carry more weight; would that be fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-12\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Honestly, I guess I\u2019d have to say yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-13\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: With that in mind, do you think you can be absolutely fair to Richard if Detective Clarkson said something that was against Richard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-14\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: It would have to depend on what it was, what he said. If it was, I guess, an opinion versus something that \u2014 you have to weigh opinions versus facts, too, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-15\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: But if you had-if it came down to that hair breath\u2019s difference, do you really think you couldn\u2019t give a fair shake to both sides, do you think you\u2019d probably fall over on the side-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I think I would probably follow Pete\u2019s lead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: Again, I\u2019m not trying to pick on you, I\u2019m just trying to make sure that we get as fair a panel as possible, and Pete Clarkson is a great guy, but if you\u2019re biased towards Pete, you may not be as fair towards Richard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">Do you understand where I\u2019m going?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yeah, I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: Do you think you could be fair to Richard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I think so. I guess, you know, you really don\u2019t know until you know what they\u2019re both saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: But you realize you won\u2019t know what they\u2019re both saying unless you\u2019re picked for a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I realize that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: So if you\u2019re picked for a jury and you don\u2019t know until after Pete Clarkson testifies that that could be a problem for us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-12\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I would have to believe Pete, somebody I know, in all honesty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-13\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: Sure, sure. Based on that in mind, do you think it would be appropriate that you sat on this jury or would you rather not, because you might be called for another jury where Pete Clarkson might not be called, it might be easier for you to be totally fair to both sides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-14\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I would guess that. Obviously, if you don\u2019t know people, you\u2019re-I mean there\u2019s people I know that I would tend not to believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-15\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: Oh, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-16\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I\u2019d give a little more reasonable doubt, but Pete\u2019s not one of them. And I\u2019d try to be unbiased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-17\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: Would you have to work at it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-18\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: We\u2019re really splitting hairs here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-19\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: I know. I have a tremendous responsibility to Richard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-20\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: In all honesty, if Pete and somebody else that I didn\u2019t know stated two things differently, I would believe Pete. That\u2019s all can I really say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-21\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: Would you mind if I asked the judge if you can be excused? Would that be a problem for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-22\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: No, that\u2019s your prerogative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>MR. ESCHENBACHER: Your Honor, I would ask that Mr. Aronson be allowed to be excused for cause based on his giving extra weight, and fairly, I understand, but giving extra weight to a possible potential witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">THE COURT: Question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">MR. FULBRIGHT: Your Honor, I guess I heard Mr. Aronson say he could be fair, and he recognizes he knows people but a lot of people know people in the valley here, so I think he answered that he could be fair in weighing out the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">THE COURT: Well, sir, you understand that every witness is presumed to speak the truth once they\u2019re under oath, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I understand that people are presumed to speak the truth. I don\u2019t believe that they always do when they\u2019re under oath, so I would tend to take what I know, you know, about a person and weigh that in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">THE COURT: But you would be willing to, if there was some difference in the testimony, you would be willing to consider the opposing testimony and any of the surrounding circumstances that would be consistent with one or the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I would look for consistency, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">THE COURT: And if you found that, having done that, that perhaps another witness\u2019s testimony is more consistent with surrounding circumstances than Officer Clarkson, you would be willing to go where that leads you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I would look at that very heartily, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">THE COURT: And you would be willing to base any verdict on solely on the evidence as you find it and the jury instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-13\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-14\">THE COURT: Well, I don't believe that cause has been shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-15\">MR. ESCHENBACHER: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-16\">\u00b622 Later during voir dire, defense counsel noted how incest is different than other crimes. In particular, counsel relayed how many people would ask him whether he thought a defendant charged with murder was innocent, but when he mentioned representing a defendant charged with incest, people would ask, \u201chow could he?\u201d Defense counsel then asked the jury pool how many had that feeling, \u201chow could he?\u201d Counsel followed up with many jurors, including Aronson, who responded, \u201cI think it\u2019s a horrible thing and it\u2019s very distasteful, but we have to know whether a person did it or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u00b623 During the four-day trial, the State presented 22 witnesses. In addition to the children and their mother, witnesses included investigators, and friends and family who observed various incidents corroborating aspects of the children\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b624 The jury found Crosley guilty of all charges except for one count of incest alleging sexual contact between Crosley and J.P. occurring sometime between 1991 and 1995. For the incest convictions, the court sentenced Crosley to six concurrent life sentences and one consecutive 50-year sentence, with 25 years suspended, all to be served without parole eligibility until he completed all available phases of sexual offender treatment. Crosley appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b625 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause to a prospective juror for abuse of discretion. <em>State v.

In fact, a district court has considerable discretion in determining whether to excuse a juror for cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">When a juror makes conflicting statements, as in this case, the decision whether to grant a challenge for cause is within the discretion of the trial judge, who has the ability to look into the eyes of the juror in question, and to consider her responses in the context of the courtroom, and then determine whether serious doubts exist about the juror\u2019s ability to be impartial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-5\"><em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b636 Aronson never expressed a fixed opinion of Crosley\u2019s guilt or actual bias against Crosley. While there was much questioning about Aronson\u2019s ability to fairly weigh testimony from Detective Clarkson against other testimony, this is significantly different than the type of improper state of mind that raises serious doubts about a juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial. This Court has held that a district court abused its discretion by not denying a challenge for cause when a potential juror expressed difficulty affording a criminal defendant the presumption of innocence or cannot properly apply the law. Beyond that our review has been more deferential.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b637 Aronson admitted that he would give a lot of credibility to Clarkson\u2019s testimony because he knew him. But when further asked whether he could look at the facts, weigh them out, and keep an open mind, Aronson responded, \u201cSomewhat yeah. I\u2019d tend to believe Mr. Clarkson, but I\u2019d try to keep an open mind, I guess.\u201d The prosecutor followed up on this response by clarifying, \u201cCould you keep an open mind, look at the facts?\u201d Aronson replied affirmatively, \u201cUh-huh.\u201d While these answers perhaps lack the conviction that defense counsel would prefer, they do not raise serious doubts about Aronson\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b638 Defense counsel\u2019s questioning failed to raise any serious doubts about Aronson\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, despite persistent exploration of the impacts of weighing Clarkson\u2019s testimony strongly. Aronson consistently acknowledged valuing Clarkson\u2019s credibility, but when questioning shifted from abstract-evidence weighing to fairness, Aronson\u2019s answers did not reveal any actual bias. Defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>asked whether Aronson would be fair to other jurors during deliberations or whether he would just defer to Clarkson. Aronson replied, \u201cPeople can make mistakes on what they think they saw, too. I\u2019d consider that, of course, but I just don\u2019t think that Pete [Clarkson] would lie on the witness stand.\u201d Defense counsel attempted to clarify that the issue was not whether Clarkson would lie, but how differences of opinion between Clarkson and other witnesses would affect Aronson\u2019s judgment. Aronson responded, \u201cI would look at if from what people have said.\u201d These answers demonstrate that Aronson would not blindly accept Clarkson\u2019s testimony in the face of differences of opinion. In fact, when finally asked the dispositive question, whether he could be absolutely fair to Crosley, Aronson replied, \u201cIt would have to depend on what it was, what he said. If it was, I guess, an opinion versus something that-you have to weigh opinions versus facts, too, I guess.\u201d Defense counsel later repeated the dispositive question of whether he could be fair to Crosley, and Aronson answered, \u201cI think so. I guess, you know, you really don\u2019t know until you know what they\u2019re both saying.\u201d Later Aronson indicated he would \u201ctry to be unbiased.\u201d \u00b639 We cannot find any actual bias in Aronson\u2019s consistent responses regarding how he might weigh witness credibility when such responses never raise any serious doubts about his ability to be fair and impartial to Crosley. We agree with the prosecutor\u2019s response to defense counsel\u2019s challenge to Aronson for cause: \u201cI heard Mr. Aronson say he could be fair, and he recognizes he knows people, but a lot of people know people in the valley here, so I think he answered that he could be fair in weighing out the testimony.\u201d Indeed Aronson never said that he could not be fair or impartial to Crosley. While Aronson acknowledged that he would find Clarkson\u2019s testimony more credible than someone he did not know, he allowed that Clarkson could make mistakes and that he would weigh the evidence heartily. Later Aronson noted that he thought incest was a horrible thing, \u201cbut we have to know whether a person did it or not.\u201d This spontaneous response reinforces his impartiality. The District Court excused ten potential jurors for cause as a result of admissions that jurors could not be fair; would shift the burden of proof to the defendant; could not base a decision solely on the evidence; or had personal experiences that would affect their judgment. Aronson fell short of these improper states of mind and we defer to the discretion of the district court judge \u201cwho has the ability to look into the eyes of the juror in question, and to consider [his] responses in the context of the courtroom, and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>determine whether serious doubts exist about the juror\u2019s ability to be impartial.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b640 Additionally, Clarkson\u2019s importance as a trial witness should be placed in proper perspective. Clarkson did not interview Crosley during his investigation, and only testified regarding his investigation, including his interviews with A.P. The jury was never required to weigh Clarkson\u2019s testimony against an adverse party. In fact, to the extent that defense counsel cross-examined Clarkson regarding inconsistencies in A.P.\u2019s recollections between her interviews in 1998 and 2006, his credibility as a witness would actually support Crosley\u2019s defense. Clarkson was one of many witnesses who helped corroborate various aspects of the children\u2019s allegations. His credibility as a witness was not nearly as important as the credibility of the children, clearly the material witnesses. We cannot find any instances in the record where contradictory information was presented requiring the jury to weigh Clarkson\u2019s testimony against another witness\u2019 testimony. In this context, any tendency for Aronson to find Clarkson\u2019s testimony more credible than an unknown witness would not raise serious doubts about his ability to be fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b641 The final question regarding whether the District Court abused its discretion is whether the court improperly rehabilitated Aronson. \u201c[W]e have repeatedly admonished trial judges to refrain from attempting to rehabilitate jurors by putting them in a position where they will not disagree with the court.\u201d <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 54. \u201cCoaxed recantations in which jurors state they will merely follow the law, whether prompted by the trial court, the prosecution, or the defense, do not cure or erase a clearly stated bias which demonstrates actual prejudice against the substantial rights of a party.\u201d <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 18. However, a district court does not abuse its discretion when the judge attempts to clarify a juror\u2019s answers or explain unclear concepts. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b642  We find that the District Court here attempted to clarify Aronson\u2019s answers to a series of questions from counsel attempting to elicit different responses from his consistent acknowledgement that he would value Clarkson\u2019s testimony strongly. Far from putting jurors \u201cin a position where they will not disagree with the court,\u201d the District Court clarified whether Aronson would be willing to consider opposing testimony and surrounding circumstances for consistency. Aronson questioned whether people always speak the truth under oath, but acknowledged that he would \u201clook for consistency\u201d and \u201cvery heartily\u201d go where that led him. Since Aronson\u2019s answers did not denote a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u201cclearly stated bias,\u201d there was no way that the District Court could have coaxed him to recant. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s questioning of Aronson was a clarification of the juror\u2019s ability to properly weigh the evidence, not a \u201ccoaxed recantation of bias.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b643 Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Crosley\u2019s challenge for cause of potential juror Aronson.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b644 <em>Whether the District Court properly admitted evidence of other acts of incest outside of Ravalli County under the transaction rule </em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b645 Crosley argues that the District Court erred by failing to apply the procedural and substantive safeguards of M. R. Evid. 404(b), as interpreted by the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule, in order to insure that the jury did not use evidence of other acts of incest that occurred outside of Ravalli County to improperly convict him. In particular, Crosley contends that the District Court committed reversible error by deleting essential language from his proposed jury instruction regarding the proper use of other acts evidence. Crosley further contends that the District Court committed plain error by failing to give a contemporaneous admonition when other acts evidence was presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b646 The State argues that it did not present other acts evidence pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(b), but introduced evidence of other acts of incest under the transaction rule and only gave a 404(b) notice out of caution and to avoid surprise. The State notes that when evidence is admissible pursuant to the transaction rule, the procedural requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule are not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b647 M. R. Evid. 404(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">This Court\u2019s precedent, described as the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule, provides additional substantive and procedural criteria for the admission of other acts evidence. <em>State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6\u00b6 72-74, 331 Mont. 517, 134 P.3d 53 (citing <em>State v. Just, </em>184 Mont. 262, 268-69, 602 P.2d 957, 961 (1979) and <em>State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 142, 814 P.2d 52, 56 (1991)). Crosley claims that the District Court failed to fulfill two of the procedural requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule by not explaining to the jury the purpose of other acts evidence when introduced, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>inadequately instructing the jury of the limited purpose of other acts evidence. <em>See Buck, </em>\u00b6 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b648 However, the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule has an exception. This exception is codified as the \u201ctransaction rule,\u201d which provides: \u201c[wjhere the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d Section 26-1-103, MCA. Pursuant to the transaction rule, evidence of other acts that are \u201cinextricably linked to, and explanatory of, the charged offense is admissible notwithstanding the rules relating to \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Lozon, </em>2004 MT 34, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 26, 85 P.3d 753. The transaction rule acknowledges that \u201ca longstanding distinction exists between Rule 404(b) \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence and evidence of a defendant\u2019s misconduct which is inseparably related to the alleged criminal act <em>.\u2019\u2019Lozon, </em>\u00b6 12. Thus, the requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule are not applied to evidence that \u201cis not wholly independent or unrelated to the charged offense.\u201d <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b649 Evidence of Crosley\u2019s other acts of incest that occurred in California, Missoula, and Ronan are not wholly independent or unrelated to the charged offenses of incest in Ravalli County. Crosley began sexually abusing A.P. when she was four years old, and continued sexually abusing her until she finally disclosed the abuse at age 12. Crosley\u2019s sexual abuse of A.P. did not stop when the family left Ravalli County, and importantly, the first instance of sexual intercourse occurred in California, and early instances of anal sex occurred in Ronan. Crosley\u2019s sexual abuse escalated over time and A.P.\u2019s recollections of this escalating abuse were marked by the changing locations where the abuse occurred. All of these instances of sexual abuse, regardless of their location, are inextricably linked to, and explanatory of, the charged offenses in Ravalli County.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b650  The fact in dispute here is whether the various charged acts of incest occurred. Evidence of that fact includes uncharged acts of incest that occurred outside of Ravalli County since those acts are clearly related to and not independent of the continuous and escalating nature of Crosley\u2019s sexual abuse. Thus, evidence of Crosley\u2019s escalating sexual abuse form part of the transaction in dispute and are admissible under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b651  Crosley suggests that because the District Court gave a modified instruction on \u201cEvidence of Other Acts,\u201d the court must have concluded that the uncharged acts were not admissible pursuant to the transaction rule. Similarly, Crosley argues that the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>seemed to indicate that other acts evidence was admissible pursuant to the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule because the court found the State\u2019s notice sufficient. We disagree with this either/or argument. The State objected to Crosley\u2019s proposed jury instruction on other acts evidence, noting that the other acts were \u201cfirst offered and admitted as part of a continuous transaction.\u201d Further, the State provided notice that it intended to introduce evidence of other acts of incest in \u201can abundance of caution\u201d and to allow Crosley to fully prepare his defense. The Notice relied primarily on the transaction rule, and alternatively on the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. Indeed, we have encouraged courts to apply the safeguards of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule liberally to protect defendants from unfair surprise. <em>Buck, </em>\u00b6 82. While we conclude that the District Court correctly applied the transaction rule in admitting evidence of other acts of incest, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s other acts instruction nor its assessment of the State\u2019s Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b652  Accordingly, we hold that evidence of other acts of incest outside of Ravalli County was admissible under the transaction rule. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b653 <em>Whether Crosley was denied effective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b654 The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment, and Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel. To evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, this Court has adopted the two-prong test from <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095. Under the <em>Strickland </em>test, the defendant must establish that 1) counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and 2) a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b655 There is a strong presumption under the first <em>Strickland </em>prong that trial counsel\u2019s performance was based on sound trial strategy and falls within the broad range of reasonable professional conduct. <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 7, 317 Mont. 177, 75 P.3d 1268. Regarding the second <em>Strickland </em>prong, \u201c[a] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. When a defendant challenges a conviction, the defendant must show the fact finder\u2019s reasonable doubt respecting guilt could have been routed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the unprofessional errors of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 19, 306 Mont. 525, 36 P.3d 372 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b656  Crosley claims that his defense counsel was ineffective when he failed to object to other acts evidence and failed to request that the court provide a contemporaneous admonition at the time this evidence was admitted. Crosley further contends that his defense counsel\u2019s decision not to object to the State\u2019s Notice was not a strategic or tactical decision, but rather a decision based on a misunderstanding of the law. Crosley bases this contention on the fact that his defense counsel believed that the Notice \u201cwould have met the legal standards.\u201d We disagree with this characterization of defense counsel\u2019s actions. As discussed above, evidence of other acts of incest was admissible under the transaction rule, and therefore Crosley\u2019s defense counsel did not act based on a misunderstanding of the law. Crosley has not established that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under <em>Strickland. </em>Since evidence of other acts of incest was admissible under the transaction rule, any objections to that evidence or requests for contemporaneous admonitions would be futile. Therefore, we hold that Crosley was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b657 <em>Whether the District Court erred in sentencing Crosley pursuant to the law in effect at the time of sentencing rather than at the time of the offenses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b658 This Court has consistently held that a person has the right to be sentenced under the statutes which are in effect at the time of the offense. <em>Tracy, </em>\u00b6 16. Crosley notes that he was convicted of seven counts of incest in violation of \u00a7 45-5-507(1), (4), MCA, each pertaining to a different period of time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">Count 1, A.P., 1989-1991 (Second Street, Corvallis);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">Count 2, A.P., 1991-1992 (Marcus Street);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">Count 3, A.P., 1992-1993 (Charlos Heights, Roaring Lion Road);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACm\">Count 4, A.P., 1993-1995 (Honey House Lane, Corvallis (grandparents\u2019 house));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">Count 5, A.P., 1995-1996 (Fish Hatchery Road);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">Count 6, A.P., 1996-1998 (Main Street, Corvallis);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-12\">Count 8, J.P., 1995-1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">The legislature has amended the maximum penalty for an incest conviction several times. In 1989, the legislature raised the maximum term of imprisonment for incest, from ten to 20 years, when a victim is under 16 years old and the defender is three or more years older. In 1995, the legislature raised the maximum penalty to life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>imprisonment. In 2007, the legislature again amended the incest statute to provide particular punishments when an incest victim is 12 years old or younger. This version of the statute was in effect when the District Court sentenced Crosley on May 16,2007, but not necessarily when the offenses were committed. Crosley notes that the District Court\u2019s imposition of seven life sentences (actually six life sentences, and 50 years with 25 suspended for count 8) under \u00a7 45-5-507(4), MCA, was an unconstitutional ex post facto application of the law. We agree. Therefore, we vacate Crosley\u2019s sentences on incest counts 1, 2, 3, and 4, and remand for resentencing in accordance with the statutes in effect at the time of the offenses. We affirm Crosley\u2019s life sentences on counts 5 and 6, and 50 years with 25 suspended on count 8, which punish offenses committed after 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b659 Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-5\">JUSTICES WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b267-6\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"ApU\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b660 I concur in the Court\u2019s resolution of Issues 2, 3, and 4.

First, I do not believe that a veniremember must actually <em>say </em>that he cannot be fair or impartial before we can find actual bias (Opinion, \u00b6 39). \u201cBias can be revealed by a juror\u2019s express admission of that fact, but, more frequently, jurors are reluctant to admit actual bias, and the reality of their biased attitudes must be revealed by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Chastain, </em>285 Mont. 61, 64, 947 P.2d 57, 59 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 33, 316 Mont. 198, 70 P.3d 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">\u00b663 Second, I cannot join the Court\u2019s reasoning at \u00b6 40, which resembles aharmless error analysis (i.e., because Clarkson\u2019s testimony ultimately was not that \u201cimportant\u201d and may have even \u201csupported\u201d Crosley\u2019s defense, any error in not removing Aronson for cause was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>harmless). We have previously held that \u201cjury selection errors are \u2018structural\u2019 errors and as such, they are not amenable to harmless error review.\u201d <em>State v. Bird, </em>2002 MT 2, \u00b6 39, 308 Mont. 75, 43 P.3d 266. Even more to the point here, we have held that \u201cstructural error occurs if: (1) a district court abuses its discretion by denying a challenge for cause to a prospective juror; (2) the defendant uses one of his or her peremptory challenges to remove the disputed juror; and (3) the defendant exhausts all of his or her peremptory challenges.\u201d <em>State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 62, 309 Mont. 113, 43 P.3d 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b664 Notably, the dissenting opinion in <em>Good </em>argued for the same sort of analysis that appears in \u00b6 40 of today\u2019s Opinion. <em>Compare Good, </em>\u00b6 64 (\u201cThe dissent thus maintains that, in a criminal prosecution in which the State\u2019s evidence is uncontroverted, there are no disputed facts and thus no potential for prejudice arising from an erroneous denial of a challenge for cause.\u201d), <em>with </em>Opinion, \u00b6 40 (\u2018We cannot find any instances in the record where contradictory information was presented requiring the jury to weigh Clarkson\u2019s testimony against another witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d). The <em>Good </em>Court rejected the dissent\u2019s approach, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">in a criminal case, the accused is not obligated to put on any evidence or to disprove the State\u2019s case-rather, innocence is presumed. Thus, even if the State\u2019s case is uncontroverted, the matter is still presented to the jury and the jury has the prerogative of rejecting the State\u2019s case for any number of reasons including that the jurors find the State\u2019s witnesses not credible, its evidence improbable, or its proof insufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\"><em>Good, </em>\u00b6 65. For this reason, the Court\u2019s subjective analysis of \u201cClarkson\u2019s importance as a trial witness\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 40) is inapt.</p>\n<p id=\"AsL\">\u00b665 The question is whether, in light of his stated inclination to \u201cgive a lot of credibility to [Clarkson\u2019s] testimony from knowing him,\u201d Aronson should have been removed from the venire. While I consider this to be a close question, I conclude that on the record here (including the follow-up questioning of Aronson), Crosley has not established that Aronson would have been unable to determine Crosley\u2019s guilt or innocence fairly and impartially. Given our standard of review, therefore, I agree with the Court that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">ISSUES 2 AND 3</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b666 Issue 2 concerns the admission of evidence of prior uncharged misconduct by Crosley outside Ravalli County (specifically, in Missoula <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>County and Lake County and on the trips to California). Generally, the substantive and procedural requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule must be met before evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is admissible. <em>State v. Just, </em>184 Mont. 262, 269, 274, 602 P.2d 957, 961, 963-64 (1979); <em>State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 142-43, 814 P.2d 52, 56 (1991). The Court explains, however, that the so-called \u201ctransaction rule\u201d is an \u201cexception\u201d to these requirements. Opinion, \u00b6 48. Thus, although the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule indisputably was not complied with in this case, the Court holds that evidence of Crosley\u2019s prior bad acts was admissible under the transaction rule. Opinion, \u00b6 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b667 I have grave concerns about this Court\u2019s ever-expanding pronouncements concerning the scope of the transaction rule. Over the past 15 years, in case after case, we have broadened the transaction rule to encompass more and more evidence that otherwise would have fallen within the strictures of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule, and one cannot help but visualize the transaction rule as a sort of maverick Pac-Man that blips from case to case devouring \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence as quickly as it appears. We have read into the transaction rule language far beyond that used in the statute (\u00a7 26-1-103, MCA), and I believe that it is time we rein in this exception before it completely swallows the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule and the general prohibition against evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b668 In <em>State v. Hansen, </em>1999 MT 253, 296 Mont. 282, 989 P.2d 338, we decided that the better practice is' to abandon the use of amorphous doctrines of evidence such as corpus delicti and res gestae and \u201cto, instead, use the specific rule of evidence or statute that applies to the particular factual situation presented\u201d in order to determine the admissibility of the evidence at issue. <em>Hansen, </em>\u00b6 81; <em>see also Hansen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-84 (discussing corpus delicti and res gestae). Thus, our analysis must begin with an applicable statute or rule of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b669 The Court contends that \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, is applicable here. This statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">Where the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Yet, the Court does not apply the actual language of this statute. Instead, the Court applies a number of standards (articulated in \u00b6 48) which have been \u201cassociated\u201d with \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, but which are broader than the statutory language and have no place whatsoever in our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b670 Specifically, the Court states that \u201cevidence of other acts that are \u2018inextricably linked to, and explanatory of, the charged offense\u2019 \u201d is admissible under the transaction rule. Opinion, \u00b6 48 (quoting <em>State v. Lozon, </em>2004 MT 34, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 26, 85 P.3d 753). Yet, the words \u201cinextricably linked to, and explanatory of, the charged offense\u201d do not appear in \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. The Court goes on to state that \u201cthe requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule are not applied to evidence that \u2018is not wholly independent or unrelated to the charged offense.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 48 (quoting <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 12). Yet, if any \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence which is \u201cnot wholly independent or unrelated to the charged offense\u201d is admissible under the transaction rule, then I question why we retain the pretense of having a Modified <em>Just </em>Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b671 The standards articulated in <em>Lozon </em>and repeated in \u00b6 48 of the Court\u2019s Opinion evolved from this Court\u2019s jurisprudence under the doctrines of corpus delicti and res gestae. <em>See State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 32, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. Over the years, we have repeatedly associated those standards with \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. <em>See e.g. State v. Wing, </em>264 Mont. 215, 224-25, 870 P.2d 1368, 1374 (1994); <em>State v. Atkins, </em>277 Mont. 103, 110, 920 P.2d 481, 485 (1996); <em>State v.

Again, the statute states: \u201cWhere the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d Nothing in this language supports the proposition that evidence which is simply \u201cexplanatory of\u2019 a charged offense or \u201cnot wholly independent or unrelated to\u201d the offense is admissible pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. Such evidence may be admissible under another statute or rule,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but it is pure sophistry to hold that it is admissible \u2022under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. The critical language of the statute states that the declaration, act, or omission must \u201cform part of\u2019 the transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact. Merely being \u201cexplanatory of\u2019 or \u201cnot wholly independent or unrelated to\u201d the transaction is not the language of \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b673 We have previously observed that \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, \u201cis simply an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Payne v. Buechler, </em>192 Mont. 311, 316, 628 P.2d 646, 649 (1981) (citing <em>Callahan v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R.R. Co., </em>47 Mont. 401, 133 P. 687 (1913)). Indeed, insofar as the word \u201cdeclaration\u201d is concerned, \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, is nothing more than a statutory precursor to M. R. Evid. 803(1) and (2) (respectively, the \u201cpresent sense impression\u201d and \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exceptions to the hearsay rule). As this Court explained the statute 96 years ago in <em>Callahan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">This provision was not intended to embody the statement of a rule by which to determine the competency of such declarations as those in question, but to be a mere direction that they must be deemed competent <em>when they are so connected with the main transaction as to form a part of it. </em>It states one of the exceptions to the general rule recognized by all the courts in common-law jurisdictions which requires the exclusion of hearsay statements, <em>viz.: </em>that when declarations by the participant in or an observer of the litigated act are so nearly connected with it in point of time that they may be regarded as a spontaneous, necessary incident, explaining and characterizing it, they may be proved as a part of it without calling the person who made them. The principle upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>which the exception is founded is that the declarations were made while the mind of the speaker was laboring under the excitement aroused by the incident, before there was time to reflect and fabricate, and hence the solemnity of the oath is not necessary to give it probative value. . . . \u201cThe general rule is that the declarations must be <em>substantially contemporaneous with the litigated transaction </em>and be the instinctive, spontaneous utterances of the mind while under the active, immediate influence of the transaction, the circumstances precluding the idea that the utterances are the result of reflection or design to make false or self-serving declarations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><em>Callahan, </em>47 Mont. at 410-11, 133 P. at 689 (emphases added); <em>cf. </em>M. R. Evid. 803(1) (defining present sense impression as \u201c[a] statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter\u201d); M. R. Evid. 803(2) (defining excited utterance as \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b674 When these principles are applied to the \u201cact or omission\u201d language of \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, it is clear that the statute permits evidence of acts or omissions which are \u201csubstantially contemporaneous with the litigated transaction\u201d and are \u201cso connected with the main transaction as to form a part of it.\u201d For this reason, the standards \u201cinextricably linked to\u201d and \u201cinseparably related to\u201d (also recited by the Court in \u00b6 48 (citing <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 12)) may be plausible interpretations of \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA; however, such language cannot be interpreted as justifying the State\u2019s \u201ccomplete the picture\u201d argument in the present case. In this connection, I agree with the following observations of the Court of Appeals in <em>United States v. Bowie, </em>232 F.3d 923 (D.C. Cir. 2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">The \u201ccomplete the story\u201d definition of \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d threatens to override Rule 404(b). A defendant\u2019s bad act may be only tangentially related to the charged crime, but it nevertheless could \u201ccomplete the story\u201d or \u201cincidentally involve\u201d the charged offense or \u201cexplain the circumstances.\u201d If the prosecution\u2019s evidence did not \u201cexplain\u201d or \u201cincidentally involve\u201d the charged crime, it is difficult to see how it could pass the minimal requirement for admissibility that evidence be relevant. <em>See </em>FED.R.EVID. 401 and 402.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The district court invoked the <em>\u201cres gestae\u201d </em>doctrine in finding the April 17 evidence inextricably intertwined with the charged crime.

As we have said, all relevant prosecution evidence explains the crime or completes the story. The fact that omitting some evidence would render a story slightly less complete cannot justify circumventing Rule 404(b) altogether. Moreover, evidence necessary to complete a story-for instance by furnishing a motive or establishing identity-typically has a non-propensity purpose and is admissible under Rule 404(b). We see no reason to relieve the government and the district court from the obligation of selecting from the myriad of non-propensity purposes available to complete most any story.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Bowie, 232 F.3d at 928-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b675 Likewise here, the appropriate course of action with respect to the transaction rule is to apply the plain (and clearly narrow) language of \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, and to require the prosecution in all other instances to comply with the requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. I do not suggest that the State should be barred from ever introducing \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence. Rather, the State should simply comply with the substantive and procedural requirements for doing so and not seek to circumvent those requirements, in a mounting cascade of cases, by resorting to the transaction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b676 In the case at hand, the State introduced evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts committed by Crosley in California, Missoula County, and Lake County. None of those acts, however, \u201cform[ed] part of a transaction which [was] itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact.\u201d Section 26-1-103, MCA. The facts in dispute were whether Crosley committed specific incidents of incest and assault in Ravalli County during the discrete time intervals alleged in the Information.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Crosley\u2019s acts at other times and in other places, reprehensible as they were, simply were not the facts in dispute. Moreover, evidence of those acts which he committed at other times and in other places outside Ravalli County cannot be said to be evidence of what he did in Ravalli County, except in the sense that \u201cBecause he did it at other times and places, he must have done it on the occasions charged here.\u201d Such an inference, however, is not permissible for determining Crosley\u2019s guilt. M. R. Evid. 404(b) (\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b677 The State\u2019s argument that Crosley\u2019s actions were all part of one long \u201ctransaction\u201d might have had merit had the prosecutor charged a continuous course of conduct. But the prosecutor did not charge a continuous course of conduct, and the State\u2019s attempt to justify the evidence of uncharged misconduct committed in California, Missoula County, and Lake County as all being part of a \u201ctransaction\u201d is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b678 In sum, by reading into \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, language which is not there, we permit the introduction of evidence which M. R. Evid. 404 specifically proscribes-absent compliance with the substantive and procedural protections afforded by the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. And, indeed, that is how the \u201ctransaction rule\u201d is being utilized: to end-run M. R. Evid. 404, <em>Just, </em>and <em>Matt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b679 For these reasons, I would hold that the evidence of Crosley\u2019s misconduct and reprehensible acts in California, Missoula County, and Lake County were not admissible under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u00b680 This conclusion leads to the question of what, if any, remedy is appropriate here. Crosley concedes that he did not object to the introduction of any of this evidence. Indeed, defense counsel stated during the final pretrial conference that the State\u2019s Notice of Intent to Introduce Evidence of Other Crimes, Wrongs &amp; Acts \u201cmet the legal standards.\u201d Moreover, counsel offered no objections to the evidence when it was offered by the State during trial, and counsel participated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>in drafting the \u201cother acts\u201d instruction given by the District Court immediately prior to closing arguments (an instruction Crosley now claims was erroneous).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b681 Under these circumstances, Crosley contends that we should invoke our inherent power of plain error review to review his challenges to the \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence. Crosley contends that the District Court erred by not giving the instructions specifically required by the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. <em>See Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 143, 814 P.2d at 56 (\u201cAt the time of the introduction of such evidence, the trial court shall explain to the jury the purpose of such evidence and shall admonish it to weigh the evidence only for such purposes,\u201d and \u201cIn its final charge, the court shall instruct the jury in unequivocal terms that such evidence was received only for the limited purposes earlier stated and that the defendant is not being tried and may not be convicted for any offense except that charged, warning them that to convict for other offenses may result in unjust double punishment.\u201d). I am not persuaded, however, that failing to review these alleged errors would \u201cleave in question the fundamental fairness of the trial proceedings\u201d as Crosley contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b682 Alternatively, Crosley couches his challenge to the \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Specifically, Crosley argues that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to take appropriate steps to exclude this evidence, to object to its introduction, and to request appropriate cautionary instructions. This argument has facial appeal; however, given the prosecutor\u2019s notice, which was grounded in both M. R. Evid. 404(b) and \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, and given this Court\u2019s expansive-albeit erroneous-interpretations of \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, and the \u201ctransaction rule\u201d over the past 15 years, I cannot agree with Crosley that his counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow v.
