Did Green\u2019s trial counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to request that the jury be instructed to view accomplice testimony with distrust?</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b64 2.

Did the District Court abuse its discretion by overruling Green\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s offering a personal opinion on the credibility of a witness during closing argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">\u00b66 In the early morning hours of February 3, 2005, Troy McDonald shot and killed Gerald Sirucek and Catherine Madplume. Testimony elicited at Green\u2019s trial indicated that the previous day, Gerald Gardipee was staying at Green\u2019s father\u2019s house in rural Ronan when Green showed up in his jeep with Sirucek, Madplume, and Madplume\u2019s brother. They hung around for awhile drinking beer and shooting a .22 caliber pistol Green had with him, having stolen it from his cousin several weeks before. When the beer ran out in the early afternoon, the group left and returned to Ronan for more beer, dropping off Madplume\u2019s brother and picking up McDonald. They returned to the house and drank for several hours more, at which point Green, Sirucek and Gardipee drove back to Ronan for more beer. After returning to the house and drinking that 18-pack, Gardipee, Sirucek, and McDonald left again to get another 24-pack of beer. Green stayed behind at the house with Madplume.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">\u00b67 According to testimony from Gardipee, when the three men returned to the house with more beer, Sirucek remained in the jeep, passed out drunk. Gardipee testified that the door to the house was locked when they arrived, but that Green, wrapped in a sheet, eventually opened the door before returning to the back bedroom with Madplume. Gardipee then sat in the living room drinking beer alone for a couple of hours until he heard gunshots outside the house. Gardipee testified that when he stepped out of the house, he saw McDonald standing near the jeep, holding Green\u2019s pistol. McDonald had shot Sirucek nine times. Gardipee testified at trial that he then went back inside the house to tell Green and Madplume what he had seen. However, in contrast to his trial testimony, Gardipee told police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>shortly after his arrest that Green had been standing outside with McDonald, holding the gun, when Gardipee went outside. Regardless, McDonald then asked Gardipee to help him move Sirucek\u2019s body. The men lifted it out of the jeep and placed it behind a trailer home behind the house. Gardipee then returned to the house only to hear more gunshots from outside the house a few minutes later. Gardipee testified that he then passed out drunk, waking up the next morning to find Sirucek and Madplume\u2019s bodies lying outside on the ground near the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b68 McDonald testified at Green\u2019s trial, admitting that he shot both Sirucek and Madplume. The issue at trial was whether Green had aided McDonald in the killings. McDonald\u2019s description of the events differed significantly from Gardipee\u2019s story. According to McDonald, about two weeks before the shootings Green had told him that Sirucek had money and that he wanted McDonald\u2019s help in robbing Sirucek. On the night of the shootings, after McDonald returned from the final beer run, McDonald and Green allegedly discussed a plan in which McDonald would kill Sirucek and Green would kill Madplume. Green retrieved the gun from his jeep, opened the back door, and handed the gun to McDonald. McDonald testified that, with Green beside him, McDonald shot Sirucek nine times as he lay passed out in the back of Green\u2019s jeep. Green then stabbed Sirucek several times in the throat to make sure he was dead, then took Sirucek\u2019s wallet and took the gun from McDonald. The State Medical Examiner testified that the knife marks were not stab wounds and did not cause or contribute to Sirucek\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b69 McDonald further testified that he and Green returned to the house after shooting Sirucek, at which time Madplume started asking questions about Sirucek\u2019s whereabouts. McDonald and Green once again exited the house and developed a plan to lure Madplume into the trailer behind the house to kill her, eliminating her as a potential witness to their previous murder that evening. Green gave the gun back to McDonald and allegedly threatened to kill McDonald if he backed out. McDonald then shot Madplume several times in the back of the head as she looked for Sirucek in the trailer. McDonald and Green returned to the house, at which time Gardipee allegedly helped the men move Sirucek\u2019s body from the jeep to behind the trailer. They also removed the rear seat from Green\u2019s jeep and left it by the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"A9X\">\u00b610 At about 6:30 a.m., Green left for Ronan to clean out his jeep while the other two men stayed behind to sleep, agreeing to deal with the bodies later. Green drove to his Uncle Roy\u2019s house, then to his Aunt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Betty\u2019s. After Green gave his aunt a cursory explanation of what happened, she took him to the Tribal Law and Order office to speak with a tribal officer. On the way, Green admitted making the knife marks in Sirucek\u2019s throat, but claimed McDonald had forced him to do so while pointing a gun at his head. Green met with Tribal Officer Ben Asencio and told him that two people had been killed at his father\u2019s house, and that one of them was shot in the back of Green\u2019s jeep. Officer Asencio contacted the Lake County Sherriffs Office. Green retrieved the clothes he was wearing from his Aunt Betty\u2019s house and consented to a blood draw, search of his jeep, and search of his father\u2019s residence. Upon arriving at the house, police saw the two bodies behind the trailer and found McDonald and Gardipee inside the house. Both were arrested without incident, and both subsequently entered plea agreements with the State prior to Green\u2019s trial, agreeing to testify against Green. Gardipee received a ten-year suspended sentence for the offense of tampering with the evidence. McDonald was sentenced to the Department of Public Health and Human Services after the parties stipulated that he was developmentally disabled and was unable to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law. Green rejected the plea agreement offered by the State, and chose to go to trial on the count of tampering with the evidence and both counts of deliberate homicide by accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b611 Green\u2019s trial began on May 8, 2006, and continued for four days. In addition to the testimony of McDonald and Gardipee, Michael Pierce testified that he lived with Green and Green\u2019s father for a period of time in 2000 and 2001, approximately four years prior to the shootings. Pierce testified that during the time he was living with Green, Green made threats against Sirucek and solicited Pierce to help beat up Sirucek, though the two never did. Green also told Pierce that he would kill Sirucek someday if he had the chance. Shortly thereafter Pierce left Montana. The District Court admitted this testimony over defense counsel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b612 The jury found Green guilty of the two deliberate homicide charges and the tampering with evidence charge. The District Court sentenced Green to two consecutive life sentences on the two deliberate homicide convictions, and to a consecutive term of ten years on the tampering with evidence conviction. Green\u2019s sentences give him no opportunity for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b613 Green appeals. Additional facts will be discussed herein as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b614 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel present mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 14, 336 Mont. 17, 153 P.3d 591. We review a district court\u2019s ruling regarding the admission of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Buck, 2006 </em>MT 81, \u00b6 71, 331 Mont. 517, 134 P.3d 53; <em>State v. Aakre, </em>2002 MT 101, \u00b6 8, 309 Mont. 403, 46 P.3d 648. We also review a district court\u2019s ruling on an objection to closing arguments for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Ford, </em>278 Mont. 353, 361-62, 926 P.2d 245, 250 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b615 Did Green\u2019s trial counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to request that the jury be instructed to view the accomplice testimony of McDonald with distrust?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b616 Both the Montana Constitution and the Sixth Amendment guarantee a person the right to effective assistance of counsel. When reviewing ineffective assistance of counsel claims, this Court applies the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2025 (1984). The burden is on the defendant to show that defense counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell short of the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases and that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial to his case.\u201d <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 177, 75 P.3d 1268; <em>see also Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861 (clarifying that the appropriate standard for ineffective assistance claims is not one of neglect or ignorance, but whether counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness). \u201cThere is a strong presumption with regard to the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test that trial counsel\u2019s performance was based on sound trial strategy and falls within the broad range of reasonable professional conduct.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Upshaw, 2006 MT 341, \u00b6 32, 335 Mont. 162, 153 P.3d 579 (citing <em>Hendricks, </em>\u00b6 7); <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u00b617 However, before reaching the merits of an ineffective assistance claim we must first determine whether the claim is properly before the Court on appeal. <em>Upshaw, </em>\u00b6 33. \u201cThe test to determine if an ineffective assistance claim is properly brought on direct appeal is whether the record contains the answer as to \u2018why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense.\u201d <em>Upshaw, </em>\u00b6 33 (citation omitted). If the record does not document the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, the claim is not properly raised on appeal, but may be pursued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>in a petition for postconviction relief. <em>Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 60, 973 P.2d 233. If a merely \u201cplausible\u201d (but not necessarily \u201cactual\u201d) justification exists for counsel\u2019s conduct, postconviction proceedings are appropriate and the appeal should be dismissed without prejudice. <em>Upshaw, </em>\u00b6 35 (citation omitted). \u201cSituations when no justification will exist for counsel\u2019s action are \u2018relatively rare.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 16, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978 (quoting <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b618 Green\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is based on \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, which provides that \u201c[t]he jury is to be instructed by the court on all proper occasions that ... the testimony of a person legally accountable for the acts of the accused ought to be viewed with distrust,\u201d known as an \u201caccomplice instruction.\u201d Green\u2019s trial counsel did not request an accomplice instruction based upon \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, that McDonald\u2019s and Gardipee\u2019s testimony should be viewed with distrust. We have explained \u201c[wjhether a witness for the prosecution is an accomplice is generally a question for the jury, unless the fact is undisputed,\u201d <em>State v. Rose, </em>1998 MT 342, \u00b6 13, 292 Mont. 350, 972 P.2d 321, (citation omitted), but here it is undisputed that Green was being prosecuted as McDonald\u2019s and Gardipee\u2019s accomplice. However, we have recognized that requesting this instruction is not required in all cases. There may be tactical reasons that defense counsel does not want an accomplice instruction given, such as when the instruction would be inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s theory in the case. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>257 Mont. 157, 163, 848 P.2d 496, 499 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b619 In <em>Johnson, </em>the defense theory was that the defendant was not present at the scene of the crime. We held that the accomplice instruction could have been considered inconsistent with that defense and, thus, under those circumstances defense counsel\u2019s decision was tactical and did not amount to ineffective assistance. <em>Johnson, </em>257 Mont. at 163, 848 P.2d at 499. In contrast, when determining to reverse in <em>Rose, </em>we noted that there was \u201cno indication that counsel made a tactical decision not to request an instruction on accomplice testimony.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 18. The State had acknowledged in <em>Rose </em>that such an instruction would have been appropriate. We observed that no plausible explanation existed for failing to request an accomplice instruction under \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, when \u201cthe accomplice testifies that the accused came up with the idea for the burglary, identified the items to be taken, provided the tools with which to commit the offense, and provided transportation to the scene.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u00b620 Here, one of the two alleged accomplices actually provided favorable testimony for the defense. Although McDonald claimed Green was with him during the shootings, Gardipee testified that Green was in the bedroom when both victims were shot. Considering Gardipee\u2019s favorable testimony, Green\u2019s counsel may have decided to withhold a \u201cviewed with distrust\u201d instruction in order to prevent the casting of any unwanted doubt upon the testimony of a witness who supported the defense theory that Green had not actively participated in either murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b621 Additionally, Green initially indicated he would rely on the affirmative defense of compulsion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-2-212, MCA. Asserting a compulsion defense could be incompatible with the notion that Green was an \u201caccomplice\u201d in the crimes, and could explain why he did not request the instruction. Potentially inconsistently, however, Green\u2019s counsel did request an accomplice-related instruction under \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA, requiring McDonald\u2019s testimony to be \u201ccorroborated by other evidence that in itself... tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense\u201d in order to convict Green. Once again, there is no indication why defense counsel requested only this accomplice instruction, although Green\u2019s counsel could have believed the jury would view this instruction as placing an additional burden on the State to corroborate McDonald\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b622  Because \u201cplausible\u201d justifications, discussed above, exist for counsel\u2019s conduct, it is not appropriate to address this issue on appeal, where the record does not flush out the factual questions surrounding counsel\u2019s actions. <em>Upshaw, </em>\u00b6 35. Consequently, we dismiss Green\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without prejudice to raising the claim in postconviction relief proceedings, so the reasons for counsel's failure to request the accomplice instruction can be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b623 Did the District Court err by admitting evidence of Green\u2019s prior statement that he would like to kill the victim?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b624 On December 23, 2005, the State filed notice that it intended to introduce evidence that Green stole the .22 caliber pistol used in the homicides, had solicited Pierce to beat up Sirucek, and had stated that he would kill Sirucek someday if he had the opportunity. Defense counsel objected to the introduction of this evidence, specifically asserting that Green\u2019s statements were too remote in time to be admissible. Although Green\u2019s statements to Pierce were made in 2001, the State responded they were evidence of Green\u2019s intent and preparation, and thus were admissible pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(b). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The District Court overruled Green\u2019s objection, and Pierce was allowed to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b625 The admissibility of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is controlled by M. R. Evid. 404(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">A district court has broad discretion when determining whether other crimes evidence is admissible under M. R. Evid. 404(b). <em>State v. Ayers, </em>2003 MT 114, \u00b6 72, 315 Mont. 395, 68 P.3d 768. A court\u2019s decision to admit such evidence is guided by the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule, which requires four elements be met before the evidence is allowed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">(1) The other crimes, wrongs or acts must be similar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">(2) The other crimes, wrongs or acts must not be remote in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">(3) The evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity with such character; but may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">(4) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading of the jury, considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-11\"><em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 73 (citing <em>Aakre, </em>\u00b6 9); <em>State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 142, 814 P.2d 52, 56 (1991); <em>State v. Just, </em>184 Mont. 262, 602 P.2d 957 (1979) <em>(ioverruled on other grounds State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, 337 Mont. 326, 160 P.3d 511); M. R. Evid. 404(b). When such evidence is introduced, the trial court must \u201cexplain to the jury the purpose of such evidence and shall admonish it to weigh the evidence only for such purposes.\u201d <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 77 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">\u00b626 Green argues that neither the second nor the fourth requirement of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule was satisfied here. According to Green, the four-year gap between his statements and the shooting requires exclusion on remoteness grounds because there is no evidence that he engaged in a continuing course of conduct with respect to his threats. Citing <em>State v. Hansen, </em>187 Mont. 91, 608 P.2d 1083 (1980), Green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>argues that an event taking place three years prior to the crime charged is too remote unless the acts engaged in constitute a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct.\u201d Under the fourth requirement, Green argues the evidence was \u201chighly prejudicial and clearly violated the historical purposes for the rule[,] which include protecting the presumption of innocence and limiting the trial evidence to the act alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b627 In <em>Hansen, </em>we held that evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior rape of another woman two-and-a-half years prior should have been excluded because the circumstances of that charge were not sufficiently similar to those of the defendant\u2019s current rape charges and were too remote. <em>Hansen, </em>187 Mont. at 98, 608 P.2d at 1087. We also noted that, \u201c[ajthough a three year interval between a prior act and the charged crime is close to the limit of being too remote, other acts occurring three years prior to the crime have been held admissible when the acts engaged in by the defendant constitutes a continuing course of conduct.\u201d <em>Hansen, </em>187 Mont. at 97, 608 P.2d at 1087. Contrary to what Green urges, however, this statement was not intended to create a bright-line rule requiring the exclusion of evidence of all prior acts occurring more than three years prior to the charged crime unless there is evidence of a continuing course of conduct. In <em>State v. McKnight, </em>250 Mont. 457, 463, 820 P.2d 1279, 1283 (1991), for example, we held that a three-year period between incidents was not too remote because the incidents in question were sufficiently similar. \u201cMoreover, we consistently have declined to set arbitrary time limits defining the remoteness factor.\u201d <em>State v. Brogan, </em>272 Mont. 156, 167, 900 P.2d 284, 291 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b628 In the present case, while there may not be clear evidence that Green engaged in a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d between his statements in 2001 and the homicides in 2005, there is no dispute that Green\u2019s statement that he would like to kill Sirucek, and the ultimate killing of Sirucek, involve the same parties. More than being merely \u201csimilar,\u201d the prior act was a threat to carry out the very crime against the identical victim which ultimately occurred. The fact that Green\u2019s statements and the charged offenses were separated by a three to four year period is offset by the connected nature of these events. A threat to kill an individual is compelling, specific evidence with respect to charges for the subsequent killing of that same individual. The two events cannot be logically separated merely by the passage of a few years between the threat and the actual act.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b629 Pierce and Green had a falling out soon after Green made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>statements, and Pierce moved to another state shortly thereafter. There is no evidence of further efforts by Green to solicit help to commit an offense against Sirucek until several weeks before the killing, when he stole a gun from his cousin and allegedly realized he could manipulate McDonald into robbing and killing Sirucek with the gun. The fact that Green told Pierce he wanted to kill Sirucek if he had the opportunity, and that Sirucek was indeed killed four years later with a weapon Green had stolen only weeks before, is simply too similar to reject as being too remote under the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. Moreover, the strength in the similarity or connectedness of these facts demonstrates that their probative value was not \u201csubstantially outweighed\u201d by the danger of unfair prejudice, under the fourth factor of the Rule. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Green\u2019s prior statements to Pierce under M. R. Evid. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b630 Green also argues that the District Court erred by failing to instruct the jury, at the time the other crimes evidence was introduced, as to the purpose of the evidence and how to weigh it. <em>See Ayers, </em>\u00b6 77. Indeed, the court did not give the jury such an instruction until after the State Medical Examiner had testified and the court had recessed for lunch. At that time, counsel for both parties met in chambers, at which time the State presented the court with its proposed Rule 404(b) jury instruction. The court asked both counsel if they objected to the reading of the instruction at that time, and neither did. While counsel for the State suggested the court tell the jury that the instruction ordinarily would have been read at the time the other crimes evidence was introduced, defense counsel preferred a general statement that \u201cthis is the proposed time for me to give you this instruction ....\u201d The Court instructed the jury in accordance with defense counsel\u2019s request. Because defense counsel did not object to this procedure, this issue has been waived for purposes of appeal. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b631 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by overruling Green\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s offering a personal opinion on the credibility of a witness during closing argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b632 During closing argument, the prosecution discussed the fact that Gardipee had first told the investigating officer that he had seen Green standing beside McDonald after Sirucek was shot, but had later testified that Green was with Madplume inside the house when the shooting occurred. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">You heard from a number of witnesses. Only two of them were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>present and know firsthand what happened. [I\u2019m] going to start with Glen Gardipee. You might wonder why I had Glen testify. Well, I\u2019ll tell you why. There\u2019s two responses. One, I had some faint hope that being under oath and being in a trial situation and facing some sort of pressure he might actually blurt out the truth. The closest he came was admitting to you that he changed his story in order to remove himself as a witness in this case. Well, I didn\u2019t hold out much hope for that one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Green argues on appeal that this constituted an improper comment on Gardipee\u2019s credibility, although Green\u2019s trial counsel did not object at the time the statement was made. Rather, when the prosecutor later argued about Green\u2019s own credibility, defense counsel objected, stating \u201cit sounds to me like [the prosecutor] is interjecting his own personal opinion as to the credibility of the witnesses and that\u2019s the exclusive province of the jury.\u201d The District Court overruled the objection, and Green does not appeal the court\u2019s decision as it applied to the prosecutor\u2019s statements about Green. Instead, Green contends that the objection should have been sustained with respect to the prosecutor\u2019s statements about Gardipee. The State responds that Green waived his right to appellate review by failing to contemporaneously object when Gardipee\u2019s credibility was challenged, but that even if Green\u2019s objection is considered timely, the prosecutor\u2019s statements were not improper. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b633 During closing argument, a prosecutor may comment on \u201cthe gravity of the crime charged, the volume of evidence, credibility of witnesses, inferences to be drawn from various phases of evidence, and legal principles involved, to be presented in instructions to the jury....\u201d <em>State v. Staat, </em>251 Mont. 1, 10, 822 P.2d 643, 648 (1991) (quotations omitted). While it is generally improper for the prosecution to offer personal opinions as to the credibility of the accused or the witnesses, <em>State v. Stringer, </em>271 Mont. 367, 380, 897 P.2d 1063, 1071 (1995), \u201cit is proper for a prosecutor to comment on conflicts and contradictions in testimony, as well as to comment on the evidence presented and suggest to the jury inferences which may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>State v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6 15, 293 Mont. 1, 972 P.2d 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b634  Here, the prosecutor was primarily reminding the jury of the inconsistency between Gardipee\u2019s statement to the police after his arrest and his later testimony. In the first instance, Gardipee told investigators that Green had been outside the house with McDonald when Sirucek was shot. Later, Gardipee testified that Green was inside the house with Madplume. The prosecutor was entitled to point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>out the inconsistencies and to allow the jury to infer that Gardipee changed his story after having time to think about the consequences. The prosecutor was likewise entitled to argue which of the two versions provided by Gardipee was the truth. While that discussion lapped over into \u201cwhy\u201d the prosecutor had called Gardipee as a witness, a prosecutor is entitled to some latitude in his argument about a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See State v. Hanson, </em>283 Mont. 316, 326, 940 P.2d 1166, 1172 (1997). We conclude the prosecutor\u2019s statements do not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b176-5\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b176-6\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AV3\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b636 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision as to Issue 1. I would reverse and remand for a new trial on this issue and, therefore, would not address Issues 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u00b637 It is well-settled that proving an ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires the defendant to show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, i.e., that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances, and (2) that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, i.e., a trial whose result is reliable. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 20, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861 <em>(citing Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984)). I first address the performance prong of this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u00b638 The premise of the Court\u2019s Opinion is that there may be \u201cplausible\u201d justifications for defense counsel\u2019s failure to request the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction required by \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, and that these supposed justifications should be fleshed out in postconviction proceedings. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 22. Ordinarily, I would agree with this approach. In the present case, however, the record establishes that Green\u2019s counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction. Accordingly, under our caselaw, reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\u00b639 Section 26-1-303(4), MCA, states that \u201c[t]he jury is to be instructed by the court on all proper occasions that. . . the testimony of a person legally accountable for the acts of the accused ought to be viewed with distrust\u201d (paragraph break omitted). On one hand, the Court speculates that Green\u2019s counsel might not have requested this instruction because it would have been inconsistent with Green\u2019s theory in the case, Opinion, \u00b6 18, or with his asserted defense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>compulsion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Opinion, \u00b6 21, or because he did not want to cast doubt on the testimony of a potentially favorable witness, Opinion, \u00b6 20. On the other hand, however, the Court acknowledges that counsel did, \u201c[plotentially inconsistently,\u201d request an accomplice-related instruction under \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA, which states that a person may not be found guilty of an offense on the testimony of one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense (here, the testimony of McDonald) \u201cunless the testimony is corroborated by other evidence that in itself ... tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b640 I submit that defense counsel\u2019s action is more than just \u201cpotentially inconsistent.\u201d It is illogical and even \u201cimplausible\u201d to assume that counsel wanted the jury to be instructed that McDonald\u2019s testimony must be corroborated by other evidence independently connecting Green to the crimes but did not want the jury to view McDonald\u2019s testimony with distrust in the first place. Rather than having some tactical or even conscious purpose in mind, as the Court surmises, it is more likely that Green\u2019s counsel was simply unaware of the requirement in \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, and our caselaw, discussed below, that the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction must be given where the State\u2019s case is grounded on accomplice testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2V\">\u00b641 The District Court\u2019s instructions bear this out. First, the jurors were told in Instruction No. 4 that they were \u201cthe sole judges of the credibility, that is the believability, of all the witnesses testifying in this case, and of the weight, that is the importance, to be given their testimony.\u201d Furthermore, the jurors were told that they were \u201cnot</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>bound to decide any fact based upon the testimony of a larger number of witnesses whose testimony does not convince you against the testimony of a smaller number of witnesses (or against a presumption), or other evidence which does convince you.\u201d Indeed, the jurors were told that \u201c[t]he evidence presented by one witness whom you believe is sufficient for the proof of any fact in this case.\u201d Thus, under Instruction No. 4, if the jurors believed McDonald, his testimony was sufficient to establish Green\u2019s guilt of deliberate homicide by accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b642 Yet, under Instruction No. 17, the jurors were told that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[a] person may not be found guilty of an offense on the testimony of one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense unless the testimony is corroborated by other evidence that in itself and without the aid of the testimony of the one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Thus, under Instruction No. 17, McDonald\u2019s testimony was insufficient to establish Green\u2019s guilt. It had to be corroborated by other evidence tending to connect Green with the commission of the offense. In short, without the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction, the jurors were left with apparently conflicting instructions on whether McDonald\u2019s testimony itself was sufficient to prove a fact at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b643 In this connection, the corroboration instruction presumes that there was an accomplice, while the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction requires the jury to view that person\u2019s testimony with distrust. It is logical that a jury would consider the accomplice\u2019s testimony and view it with distrust <em>before </em>even reaching the requirement of corroboration. That is why the accomplice\u2019s testimony must be corroborated-because it is to be viewed with distrust by the jury in the first instance and because accomplice testimony (especially where, as here, codefendants cut deals with the State) is simply not reliable. If the jurors, as they are required, first view the accomplice\u2019s testimony with distrust and then find that corroborative evidence is lacking or weak, then the State may well be unable to convince the jury of the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the State\u2019s case hangs on the credibility of the accomplice, then the State may be unable to convict if the jurors do not find the accomplice\u2019s testimony credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u00b644 Here, McDonald was an accomplice as a matter of law. McDonald and Green were both charged in connection with the Sirucek and Madplume homicides, and we have held that the State\u2019s charging one person for the same crime for which the defendant is tried constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>an acknowledgement by the State that the person is an accomplice. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>276 Mont. 447, 451-52, 918 P.2d 293, 295-96 (1996). Indeed, Green was charged as McDonald\u2019s accomplice. McDonald admitted killing Sirucek and Madplume and testified against Green as part of his plea agreement with the State. The State\u2019s case hinged to a great extent on McDonald\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b645 In <em>State v. Rose, </em>1998 MT 342, 292 Mont. 350, 972 P.2d 321, on facts similar to those here, we observed that there was \u201cno indication that counsel made a tactical decision not to request an instruction on accomplice testimony.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 18. We concluded that defense counsel had nothing to lose by asking for this instruction, and we reversed, holding that there was no reasonable tactical or strategic reason for failing to provide an instruction on the jury\u2019s consideration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony when the accomplice testifies that the accused came up with the idea for the crime and provided the tools with which to commit the offense. <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b646 Likewise, in the case at bar, McDonald testified that Green came up with the idea for killing Sirucek and Madplume and that Green then provided McDonald with the means for doing so (the gun Green stole from his cousin). Gardipee\u2019s testimony that Green was in the house at the time of the shootings was of dubious credibility, given his admissions on the witness stand that he had not been honest with the police and that he had given a conflicting account of the incident 12 hours after the shootings. Thus, McDonald\u2019s credibility was critical to the State\u2019s case, and Green\u2019s defense hinged to a great extent on the jury not believing McDonald. Yet, Green\u2019s counsel did not request the one instruction that would have required the jury to view McDonald\u2019s testimony with distrust. The jury \u201cshould have been specifically instructed that it should view the testimony of [McDonald], an accomplice, with distrust.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b647 In <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095, we followed our decision in <em>Rose </em>and found deficient performance by defense counsel because counsel failed to request the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 21. Kougl had been charged with felony operation of an unlawful clandestine laboratory. As in the instant case, Kougl\u2019s accomplices testified against him at trial as part of their plea agreements with the State. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 7. In closing argument, defense counsel pointed out to the jury that the testimony of the accomplices should be viewed with suspicion because of their criminal conduct and the deals two of them had cut with the State. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 9. Notwithstanding, defense counsel did not ask for the \u201cview with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>distrust\u201d instruction under \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA. Kougl, \u00b6 9. Consistently, defense counsel also did not request the corroboration instruction pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b648 On appeal, Kougl raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which we held was properly before us on direct appeal, as opposed to requiring him to raise it in a postconviction proceeding. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 22. We stated that \u201c[generally, in addressing ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we ask \u2018why\u2019 counsel did or did not perform as alleged and then seek to answer the question by reference to the record.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. We then explained that \u201c[s]ometimes, however, it is unnecessary to ask \u2018why\u2019 in the first instance.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15. An example of this \u201cis when counsel is faced with an obligatory, and therefore non-tactical, action. Then the question is not \u2018why\u2019 but \u2018whether\u2019 counsel acted, and if so, if counsel acted adequately.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15 (citation omitted). Another example, which is present here, \u201cis the relatively rare situation where there is \u2018no plausible justification\u2019 for what defense counsel did.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15. We stated that \u201c[wjhether the reasons for defense counsel\u2019s actions are found in the record or not is irrelevant. What matters is that there could not be any legitimate reason for what counsel did.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15. We cited <em>Rose </em>as falling within this latter example, observing that defense counsel in <em>Rose </em>\u201chad nothing to lose in asking for the [\u2018view with distrust\u2019] instruction, and if counsel had asked for the instruction the trial court would have been obligated to grant the request.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b649 As with <em>Rose, </em>we observed that there was no reason for Kougl\u2019s counsel not to ask for the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction, given that the parties had agreed that the \u201caccomplices\u201d were, in fact, accomplices and given that the State\u2019s case against Kougl was based largely on the credibility of these witnesses. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 20. Indeed, we noted that counsel had \u201cnothing to lose\u201d in asking for this instruction, while Kougl, \u201chowever, risked losing his liberty.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 21. We determined that \u201c[b]y failing to ask the court to tell the jurors that the law demands they view the accomplices\u2019 testimony with distrust, trial counsel failed to use the law to strike at the heart of the State\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 20. Thus, we concluded that we could rule on the merits of Kougl\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim without asking \u201cwhy\u201d counsel had not requested the instruction. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 22. It was enough that she had not, and we held that her performance was deficient. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b650 These precedents are controlling here. In <em>Rose, </em>we held that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>request the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction. Rather than referring the case to a postconviction proceeding, we held on direct appeal that Rose\u2019s defense was prejudiced. <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Similarly, <em>in Kougl, </em>we held that Kougl\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim should be decided on direct appeal and that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22, 24, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b651 Likewise here, by failing to request the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction required by \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, defense counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under the prevailing professional norms established by our caselaw. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20. Counsel did not request the instruction although there was no plausible or legitimate justification for this course of action and although he had nothing to lose in asking the District Court to give it. McDonald was an accomplice as a matter of law; he testified against Green; and the State\u2019s case against Green was based almost entirely, if not exclusively, on McDonald\u2019s credibility as a witness. Therefore, as we determined in <em>Rose </em>and <em>Kougl, </em>Green\u2019s counsel made errors so serious that he was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed Green by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b652 Turning, then, to the prejudice prong of the analysis, we stated in <em>Rose </em>that \u201c[t]o support the prejudice element of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant need not demonstrate that he would have been found not guilty had his counsel taken different action\u201d; rather, he \u201cmust establish only that there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068). In considering whether counsel\u2019s failure to request the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction prejudiced Rose\u2019s defense, we observed that \u201cthe distinction between what the jury was told and what it should have been told is significant.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 19. The jury had been instructed \u201conly in general terms relative to the weight to be given the testimony of witnesses,\u201d though it \u201cshould have been specifically instructed that it should view the testimony of [the accomplice] with distrust.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 19. We further observed that a \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction \u201cwould have gone to the heart of the defense that [the accomplice] was not telling the truth when he said Rose was involved with him in the burglary.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 19. Having made these observations, we held that counsel\u2019s failure to request the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>instruction was prejudicial to Rose\u2019s defense. <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b653 Similarly, in <em>Kougl, </em>we determined that Kougl \u201cestablished prejudice because the [\u2018view with distrust\u2019 and corroboration] instructions would have conveyed to the jurors that the law commanded them to view the State\u2019s crucial evidence with distrust such that there is a reasonable probability they would have arrived at a different outcome.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 26. We noted that it is particularly important that the trial judge instruct the jurors in this regard, as opposed to the jurors hearing the law through argument by counsel. We explained that \u201cwhat the judge tells the jury necessarily carries the force of law, while what the adversarial counsel tells the jury does not.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 26. Moreover, written jury instructions may be \u201cread, reread, and reflected] on while in deliberation.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b654 In the present case, the jury was instructed in general terms relative to the weight to be given the testimony of witnesses and was told that \u201c[t]he evidence presented by one witness whom you believe is sufficient for the proof of any fact in this case.\u201d The jury was also told, however, that McDonald\u2019s testimony had to be corroborated in order to convict Green on the basis of that testimony, without any indication as to why such corroboration was necessary. The missing link was that McDonald\u2019s testimony had to be \u201cviewed with distrust\u201d from the outset, which the jury should have been told. Section 26-1-303(4), MCA. A \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction would have gone to the heart of the defense that McDonald was not telling the truth when he said that Green was involved with him in the shootings. <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 19. A \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction would have conveyed to the jurors that the law commanded them to view the State\u2019s crucial evidence with distrust. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 26. There is a reasonable probability, therefore, that but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of Green\u2019s trial would have been different. <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b655 As we held in <em>Rose </em>and <em>Kougl, </em>therefore, I conclude that defense counsel\u2019s failure to request the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction prejudiced Green\u2019s defense and draws into question the reliability of the result of his trial. There are no substantive differences between the case at bar and the cases we decided in <em>Rose </em>and in <em>Kougl. </em>We should follow our precedent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b656 Accordingly, I would reverse on Issue 1 and remand for a new trial. I respectfully dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-8\">JUSTICE COTTER joins the Dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-5\"> The Court states that Green\u2019s compulsion defense \u201ccould be incompatible with the notion that Green was an \u2018accomplice\u2019 in the crimes, and could explain why [defense counsel] did not request the [\u2018view with distrust\u2019] instruction.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21.1 disagree. As a matter of fact, this defense does <em>not </em>explain counsel\u2019s action at all, since counsel withdrew the compulsion defense with respect to Counts I and II (the homicide charges) in the midst of settling jury instructions. <em>See </em>Reporter\u2019s Transcript on Appeal at 12 (May 11,2006). As a result, the court, the prosecutor, and defense counsel then engaged in further discussion as to how the language of the compulsion instruction should be modified to reflect that it applied only to Count III (the tampering with evidence charge). <em>See </em>Transcript at 12-14. Assuming, arguendo, that defense counsel initially did not request the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction because it would have been incompatible with Green\u2019s compulsion defense, that rationale was mooted once counsel withdrew this defense to Counts I and II. Yet, counsel did not then request the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction, which he should have done, as explained below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\"> The placement of the \u201cview with distrust\u201d instruction in Title 26, as opposed to Title 46, of the MCA may be problematic for some inexperienced criminal defense counsel.
