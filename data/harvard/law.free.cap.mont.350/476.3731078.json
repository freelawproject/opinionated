(Dollar). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that the term \u201cbar or tavern\u201d as used in the lease agreement was unambiguous?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that Doc Holliday\u2019s was a \u201cbar or tavern\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that the doctrine of laches does not bar Dollar\u2019s claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it granted Dollar\u2019s summary judgment motion without holding a hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">\u00b67 R-Montana owns the Holiday Village Shopping Center (shopping center) in Missoula. Dollar leases space in the shopping center. The parties operate under a lease agreement originally executed in 1973 by the parties\u2019 respective predecessors in interest. The lease agreement provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cNo part of the Shopping Center other than the Leased Premises shall be used for ... [a] bar or tavern ... without Tenant\u2019s prior written consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">\u00b68 R-Montana leased a space in the shopping center to Max\u2019s Casino and Subs (Max\u2019s) from May of2004 until July of 2006. Max\u2019s possessed a Montana alcoholic beverage license that allowed it to serve beer and wine for on-premises consumption. Max\u2019s transferred its Montana alcoholic beverage license to Doc Holliday\u2019s Card Room and Casino (Doc Holliday\u2019s) when its lease expired. Doc Holliday1 s took over Max\u2019s location to operate a casino and live table card room.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">\u00b69 Dollar complained to R-Montana in June of 2006 that Doc Holliday\u2019s was a \u201cbar or tavern.\u201d Dollar argued that Doc Holliday\u2019s operation of a \u201cbar or tavern\u201d in the shopping center would violate the lease agreement. R-Montana ignored Dollar\u2019s complaint and completed the transfer of the lease to Doc Holliday\u2019s. Dollar filed an action on July 27, 2006, seeking specific performance of the \u201cbar or tavern\u201d provision of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\u00b610 The District Court\u2019s scheduling order stated that \u201c[i]t shall be the responsibility of the moving party to advise the court either that the motions are submitted on briefs or to request a hearing in accordance with Rule [6] of the Local Rules of the Fourth Judicial District.\u201d The parties engaged in discovery. Dollar filed a motion for summary judgment on August 9, 2007, along with a brief in support of the motion. R-Montana filed a response brief on August 24, 2007. R-Montana also filed three affidavits opposing the motion for summary judgment. Dollar filed a reply brief. Neither party requested a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"Az4\">\u00b611 R-Montana argued that the phrase \u201cbar or tavern\u201d as used in the lease was ambiguous. R-Montana contended that Doc Holliday\u2019s operated primarily as a casino and that any sales of beer and wine were incidental to the casino and live table card business. R-Montana argued that Doc Holliday\u2019s therefore was not a \u201cbar or tavern\u201d as those terms were intended by the parties to the 1973 lease agreement. R-Montana further alleged that the equitable application of laches barred Dollar\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b612 The District Court granted Dollar\u2019s motionfor summary judgment on October 29, 2007, without holding a hearing. The District Court determined that Doc Holliday\u2019s fell under the common and ordinary understanding of \u201cbar or tavern.\u201d The District Court determined that R-Montana had failed to provide reasonable or logical definitions, or persuasive legal authority, for the proposition that the common and ordinary understanding of the term \u201cbar or tavern\u201d would not include a gambling establishment. The court noted that the gambling establishment at issue serves beer or wine pursuant to a Montana beer and wine license for on-premises consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b613 The District Court further determined that R-Montana had failed to support its argument that the common and ordinary understanding of the term \u201cbar or tavern\u201d was ambiguous. The District Court also concluded that R-Montana\u2019s reliance on laches failed to raise a material question of fact that would preclude summary judgment. The parties stipulated to entry of a final judgment and to the amount of Dollar\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. The parties stipulated to stay the judgment pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b614 We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment, using the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Prosser v. Kennedy Enterprises, Inc., </em>2008 MT 87, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 209, \u00b6 10, 179 P.3d 1178, \u00b6 10. Summary judgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Prosser, </em>\u00b6 10. We review conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Hughes v. Lynch, </em>2007 MT 177, \u00b6 8, 338 Mont. 214, \u00b6 8, 164 P.3d 913, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s decision to forego a hearing on a summary judgment motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>SVKV, L.L.C. v. Harding, </em>2006 MT 297, \u00b6 19, 334 Mont. 395, \u00b6 19, 148 P.3d 584, \u00b6 19. A court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>SVKV, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b616 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that the term \u201cbar or tavern\u201d as used in the lease agreement was unambiguous?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b617 The initial determination of whether an ambiguity exists in a contract presents a question of law. <em>Wurl v. Polson School Dist. No. 23, </em>2006 MT 8, \u00b6 17, 330 Mont. 282, \u00b6 17, 127 P.3d 436, \u00b6 17. We deem a contract term ambiguous when the language of the contract, as a whole, reasonably may be subject to at least two different interpretations. <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b6 17. The mere fact that the parties disagree as to the meaning of a contract provision fails to create an ambiguity. <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b6 17. We generally interpret the words of a contract in their ordinary and popular sense unless the parties use the words in a technical sense or unless the parties give a special meaning to them by usage. Section 28-3-501, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b618 R-Montana argues that the ambiguous nature of the term \u201cbar or tavern\u201d precludes summary judgment. R-Montana contends that the ambiguity creates an issue of fact regarding the intent of the original parties to the contract. The District Court cited to the Webster\u2019s Dictionary definition of both \u201cbar\u201d and \u201ctavern.\u201d Webster\u2019s defines <em>\u201cbar\u201d </em>as \u201ca counter at which food or esp. alcoholic beverages are served.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>91 (Frederick C. Mish ed., 10th ed. 1993). Webster\u2019s defines \u201ctavern\u201d as \u201can establishment where alcoholic beverages are sold to be drunk on the premises.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s </em>at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u00b619 The District Court also noted the more detailed definition of \u201cbar\u201d adopted by the Legislature in 2005 as part of the Montana Clean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Indoor Air Act, \u00a7 50-40-103, MCA. Under \u00a7 50-40-103, MCA, a bar means: \u201can establishment with a [state liquor] license that is devoted to serving alcoholic beverages for consumption... on the premises.\u201d The statute further provides that a bar is an establishment \u201cin which the serving of food is only incidental to the service of alcoholic beverages or gambling operations, including but not limited to taverns, night clubs, cocktail lounges, and casinos.\u201d Section 50-40-103, MCA. The District Court recognized that this definition did not exist in 1973 when the original parties signed the lease. The District Court stated, however, that the definition reflected a common understanding of the historical conception of what constitutes a \u201cbar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b620 R-Montana asserts that the District Court\u2019s need to resort to three different definitions in determining the common understanding of bar or tavern supports its claim of ambiguity. The District Court used two separate dictionary definitions for \u201cbar\u201d and \u201ctavern.\u201d We consistently have used dictionaries when seeking to define the common use and meaning of terms. <em>See Ravalli County v. Erickson, </em>2004 MT 35, \u00b6 13, 320 Mont. 31, \u00b6 13, 85 P.3d 772, \u00b6 13. R-Montana cites no authority for its argument that the District Court incorrectly used the dictionary definitions to determine the common understanding of \u201cbar or tavern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALjP\">\u00b621 R-Montana also argues that the District Court improperly relied upon \u00a7 50-40-103, MCA. R-Montana contends that the 2005 statute is inapplicable to the 1973 lease. R-Montana further argues that the definition serves only the limited purposes of the Clean Indoor Air Act and does not cover commercial leases. R-Montana provides on appeal alternative definitions of \u201cbar or tavern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b622 R-Montana asserts that \u201cbar or tavern\u201d could mean an establishment with the primary purpose of selling alcohol to be consumed on the premises. R-Montana argues that the term alternatively could refer to establishments that sell alcoholic beverages pursuant to a state liquor license for consumption on the premises. R-Montana proposes that another alternative definition of bar or tavern \u201cis that it does not include casinos or card rooms.\u201d R-Montana provides no legal authority to show that its alternative definitions reflect the ordinary or popular meaning of \u201cbar or tavern.\u201d Section 28-3-501, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b623  R-Montana\u2019s attempts to create ambiguity fall short. R-Montana\u2019s disagreement with the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of the term \u201cbar or tavern\u201d fails to create ambiguity. <em>Csajkowski v. Meyers, </em>2007 MT 292, \u00b6 21, 339 Mont. 503, \u00b6 21, 172 P.3d 94, \u00b6 21. Ambiguity does not exist simply because R-Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>claims that it exists. <em>Phelps v. Frampton, </em>2007 MT 263, \u00b6 45, 339 Mont. 330, \u00b6 45, 170 P.3d 474, \u00b6 45. The District Court\u2019s citation to three different definitions merely illustrates that Doc Holliday\u2019s qualifies as a \u201cbar or tavern\u201d under any of the three definitions. The District Court correctly determined that no ambiguity exists regarding the common and ordinary understanding of a bar or a tavern. The District Court also correctly determined that the common and ordinary understanding of a bar or tavern would include a casino that serves alcohol pursuant to a state liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b624 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that Doc Holliday\u2019s was a \u2018bar or tavern\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b625 R-Montana alleges that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Doc Holliday\u2019s constitutes a \u201cbar or tavern.\u201d R-Montana argues primarily that the District Court adopted an overly broad interpretation of the \u201ccommon and ordinary\u201d understanding of the term \u201cbar or tavern.\u201d R-Montana provides no legal authority to support these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b626 We already have determined that the District Court correctly decided that the common and ordinary understanding of \u201cbar or tavern\u201d included a casino that served alcohol pursuant to a state liquor license. \u00b6 23. The question arises, therefore, whether R-Montana has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Doc Holliday\u2019s meets the common and ordinary understanding of \u201cbar or tavern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Avk\">\u00b627 The party opposing summary judgment must present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of its case to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Fielder v. Board of County Com\u2019rs, </em>2007 MT 118, \u00b6 12, 337 Mont. 256, \u00b6 12, 162 P.3d 67, \u00b6 12. R-Montana\u2019s argument instead consists primarily of attacking the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law. R-Montana argues that the District Court\u2019s overly broad definition of \u201cbar or tavern\u201d \u201cencompasses establishments not commonly or ordinarily thought of as bar or taverns.\u201d R-Montana lists a number of the establishments, such as sports stadiums and theaters, that it contends would fall within the District Court\u2019s overly broad definition. This argument distracts from the relevant issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b628 R-Montana has an affirmative duty to respond by affidavit or other testimony containing facts that raise a genuine issue about whether Doc Holliday\u2019s constitutes a bar or tavern. <em>Klock v. Town of Cascade, </em>284 Mont. 167, 174, 943 P.2d 1262, 1266 (1997). R-Montana points to the affidavit of William J. Nooney, the owner of Doc Holliday\u2019s. Nooney states that Doc Holliday\u2019s owns a Montana beer/wine license and sells customers alcoholic beverages and food <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>while they gamble. We already have determined, however, that the common understanding of bar or tavern encompasses a gambling establishment that serves alcohol for on premises consumption. \u00b6 23. Nooney\u2019s statement actually supports the District Court\u2019s conclusions. Nooney also states that Doc Holliday\u2019s does not intend to operate a bar or tavern and is not set up as a bar or tavern. R-Montana adds that, as Doc Holliday\u2019s landlord, it has \u201cnever considered Doc Holliday\u2019s to be a bar or tavern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b629 R-Montana\u2019s self-serving statements and assertions do not constitute facts that are \u201cmaterial and of a substantial nature\u201d that would prevent summary judgment. <em>Duncan v. Rockwell Mfg. Co., </em>173 Mont. 382, 388, 567 P.2d 936, 939 (1977). R-Montana must prove by more than mere denial and speculation that a genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Valley Bank of Ronan v. Hughes, </em>2006 MT 285, \u00b6 14, 334 Mont. 335, \u00b6 14, 147 P.3d 185, \u00b6 14. R-Montana has failed to meet its affirmative duty to respond by affidavit or other testimony containing material facts that raise genuine issues. <em>Klock, </em>284 Mont. at 174, 943 P.2d at 1266. The District Court correctly determined that Doc Holliday\u2019s constitutes a bar or tavern.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b630 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that the doctrine of laches does not bar Dollar\u2019s claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b631 R-Montana next argues that a question of fact exists as to whether the doctrine of laches bars Dollar\u2019s claim. R-Montana contends that Dollar sat on its rights under the lease agreement despite Dollar\u2019s knowledge that Max\u2019s had sold alcohol. The party asserting the defense of laches must first prove that the other party showed a lack of diligence in asserting its rights. <em>In re Marriage of Deist, </em>2003 MT 263, \u00b6 17, 317 Mont. 427, \u00b6 17, 77 P.3d 525, \u00b6 17. The party must also show that it was prejudiced as a result. <em>Deist, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b632 When a party brings a suit within the applicable statute of limitations, the defendant has the added burden of proving that extraordinary circumstances exist which requires the application of laches. <em>McGregor v. Mommer, </em>220 Mont. 98, 107, 714 P.2d 536, 542 (1986). Dollar waited at most two years to assert its rights. The Legislature essentially defined diligence in contract situations by setting the statute of limitations for contracts at eight years. Section 27-2-202(1), MCA; <em>McGregor, </em>220 Mont. at 107, 714 P.2d at 542. Dollar filed its claim well within the prescribed time frame. R-Montana thus must show extraordinary circumstances that require the application of laches. <em>McGregor, </em>220 Mont. at 107, 714 P.2d at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u00b633 R-Montana does not address expressly whether extraordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>circumstances existed. R-Montana merely asserts that it was prejudiced because it approved the assignment of the lease during the period when Dollar allegedly slept on its rights. R-Montana claims that it faces the loss of its tenant and the loss of lease revenue. R-Montana further contends that the District Court\u2019s order subjects it to a potential claim for breach of the lease agreement between R-Montana and Doc Holliday\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b634 R-Montana knew, or should have known, of the lease provision prohibiting bars or taverns. Dollar notified R-Montana of its objection before R-Montana had completed the transfer of the lease to Doc Holliday\u2019s. R-Montana nevertheless consummated the deal with Doc Holliday\u2019s without obtaining Dollar\u2019s written consent as required under the lease. Any alleged hardship that may result from R-Montana\u2019s knowing decision to transfer the lease despite Dollar\u2019s objection does not constitute prejudice or extraordinary circumstances. <em>Deist, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>McGregor, </em>220 Mont. at 107, 714 P.2d at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b635 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it granted Dollar\u2019s summary judgment motion- without holding a hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b636 R-Montana argues that the District Court erred by not allowing R-Montana an opportunity for a hearing on Dollar\u2019s motion for summary judgment. R-Montana does not dispute that it never requested a hearing on the motion. R-Montana contends that it would have requested a hearing, but the language of the District Court\u2019s scheduling order precluded it from doing so. The District Court\u2019s scheduling order stated that \u201c[i]t shall be the responsibility of the moving party to advise the court either that the motions are submitted on briefs or to request a hearing in accordance with Rule [6] of the Local Rules of the Fourth Judicial District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b637 A trial court may dispense with a hearing if the moving party is \u201cclearly entitled\u201d to judgment as a matter of law. <em>SVKV, </em>\u00b6 30 (citing <em>Cole v. Flathead County, </em>236 Mont. 412, 419, 771 P.2d 97, 101-02). We held in <em>SVKV, </em>\u00b6 35, that a district court can impose the burden on a party to request a hearing, but the court may not preclude or deter the parties from seeking a hearing. R-Montana attempts to distinguish <em>SVKV </em>on the grounds that the district court in <em>SVKV </em>had put the burden on either party to request the hearing. R-Montana further argues that the district court in <em>SVKV </em>specifically stated that the failure to request a hearing would waive the right to a hearing. <em>SVKV, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u00b638 R-Montana advances nothing, however, that suggests that the District Court precluded or deterred it from requesting a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Dollar\u2019s summary judgment motion. <em>SVKV, </em>\u00b6 35. The District Court\u2019s scheduling order required Dollar, as the moving party, to request a hearing. Nothing in the District Court\u2019s scheduling order precluded or deterred R-Montana from requesting a hearing. <em>SVKV, </em>\u00b6 35. In fact, R-Montana could have moved for a hearing under M. R. Civ. P. 56 or Rule 6 of the Local Rules of the Fourth Judicial District. R-Montana could have filed additional affidavits at any time to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b639  R-Montana did not request a hearing in its brief in opposition to Dollar\u2019s motion for summary judgment. R-Montana failed to request a hearing in the two months that elapsed after it had filed the brief. More importantly, R-Montana gives no indication of what evidence it would have presented at the hearing that would have helped it to establish a genuine issue of material fact. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by granting summary judgment to Dollar without first holding a hearing under these circumstances. <em>SVKV, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b640 Dollar requests attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal. The lease agreement entitles the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal. <em>See Chase v. Bearpaw Ranch Ass\u2019n, </em>2006 MT 67, \u00b6 25, 331 Mont. 421, \u00b6 25, 133 P.3d 190, \u00b6 25. We affirm the order of the District Court and remand to the District Court for a determination of Dollar\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
