Beasley (Beasley) appeals from an order of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, that granted the motion to dismiss filed by Flathead County, Flathead County Board of Adjustment and the Flathead County Zoning Administrator Jeff Harris (collectively Flathead County). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court properly granted Flathead County\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">\u00b64 We discussed the procedural and factual background concerning Beasley\u2019s dealings with Flathead County in <em>Beasley v. Flathead County Board of Adjustment (Beasley I), </em>2009 MT 120, 350 Mont. 171, 205 P.3d 812. We will repeat here only those procedures and facts necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>resolve this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b65 Beasley filed an eighteen count complaint for damages and demand for jury trial to the District Court on December 19, 2007. Beasley alleged negligence and multiple constitutional violations with regard to the Flathead County Board of Adjustments\u2019 (Board) denial of Beasley\u2019s request to transfer a conditional use permit (CUP) that allowed gravel operations on property that he had purchased. Beasley grounded his alleged constitutional violations on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Beasley alleged negligence by officers and employees of Flathead County in denying the transfer of the CUP. Beasley further alleged due process violations for Flathead County\u2019s failure to follow the Flathead- County Zoning Regulations (Regulations). Beasley also claimed an equal protection violation, taking of property without just compensation, and estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b66 Flathead County filed a motion to dismiss Beasley\u2019s complaint on res judicata grounds. Flathead County argued that Beasley already had appealed the Board\u2019s decision to deny the CUP transfer. The District Court dismissed Beasley\u2019s appeal with prejudice. Flathead County thus asserted that res judicata barred Beasley\u2019s attempt to re-challenge the same decision by the Board to deny the CUP transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"AqL\">\u00b67 The District Court took judicial notice of Beasley\u2019s 2006 appeal of the Board\u2019s decision to deny the transfer of the CUP to Beasley. <em>Beasley I, </em>\u00b6 8. Beasley had filed his appeal of the Board\u2019s denial of the CUP transfer pursuant to \u00a7 76-2-227, MCA. <em>Beasley </em>I, \u00b6 8. Beasley moved to dismiss the appeal with prejudice, however, after the Flathead Citizens for Quality Growth had intervened to defend the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Beasley I, </em>\u00b6 8. The court dismissed Beasley\u2019s appeal with prejudice. <em>Beasley I, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b68 Beasley defended against Flathead County\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds that the court had dismissed his 2006 appeal before the Board had issued a final decision on its denial of the CUP transfer. The District Court rejected this claim. The District Court determined that dismissal with prejudice, after the opposing party has filed an answer, constitutes adjudication on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u00b69 The District Court decided that Beasley\u2019s 2006 appeal of the Board\u2019s decision to deny the transfer of the CUP to Beasley involved the same issues as those raised in his 2007 complaint for damages. The District Court noted that Beasley satisfied all four elements to apply res judicata as set forth in <em>Kullick v. Skyline Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>2003 MT 137, \u00b6 17, 316 Mont. 146, 69 P.3d 225. The court determined that (1) the cases involved the same parties or their privies, (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>cases involved the same subject matter, (3) the issues related to this subject matter were the same, and (4) the same parties were acting in their same capacities in relation to the same subject matter. <em>Kullick, </em>\u00b6 17. As a result, the District Court concluded that res judicata barred Beasley\u2019s complaint. Beasley appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b610 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss. <em>Doty v. Mont. Com\u2019r of Political Practices, </em>2007 MT 341, \u00b6 9, 340 Mont. 276, 173 P.3d 700. A determination of whether a complaint states a claim presents a conclusion of law that we review for correctness. <em>Doty, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court properly granted Flathead County\u2019s motion to dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\u00b612 Beasley argues on appeal that all four elements essential to application of res judicata do not apply to his eighteen count complaint. He first cites the fact that his current complaint includes causes of action against Flathead County and the Zoning Administrator Jeff Harris (Harris). He notes that his 2006 appeal pursuant to \u00a7 76-2-227, MCA, applied only to the Board. He contends that Flathead County and Harris are not in \u201cprivy\u201d with the Board. The allegations in Beasley\u2019s complaint against Flathead County and Harris relate solely to Beasley\u2019s constitutional claims. Beasley seeks to vindicate these alleged constitutional violations through an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\u00b613 As we discussed in <em>Germann v. Stephens, </em>2006 MT 130, \u00b6 26, 332 Mont. 303, 137 P.3d 545, a plaintiff first must establish that he possesses a protected liberty or property interest to establish a viable \u00a7 1983 claim because the guarantees of the 5th and 14th amendments apply only when a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest is at stake. We further noted that federal due process and takings claims require a plaintiff first to demonstrate that it possesses a constitutionally protected property interest. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 27, citing <em>Gammoh v. City of La Habra, </em>395 F.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir. 2005). State due process and takings claims likewise require the plaintiff to first establish that it has a property interest. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 27, citing <em>Montana Media, Inc. v. Flathead County, </em>2003 MT 23, \u00b6 65, 314 Mont. 121, 63 P.3d 1129 (due process); <em>Seven Up Pete Venture v. State, </em>2005 MT 146, \u00b6 26, 327 Mont. 306, 114 P.3d 1009 (takings). Independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>sources, such as state law, create property interests. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 27, citing <em>Seven Up Pete, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b614 When a plaintiff claims a property interest under state law, we determine whether a reasonable expectation of entitlement exists based largely on the language of the statute relied upon and the extent to which the legislature couched the entitlement in mandatory terms. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 28, citing <em>Kiely Const., L.L.C. v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, \u00b6 27, 312 Mont. 52, 57 P.3d 836. Any significant discretion conferred upon a local agency, however, defeats a claim of entitlement. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 28, citing <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 28. Thus, a property interest exists only when the legislature has so narrowly circumscribed the issuing agency's discretion that it virtually assures the interest's approval. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 28, citing <em>Kiely, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b615 As we noted in <em>Beasley I, </em>a writ of mandamus was not available to Beasley, in part, because the decision whether to transfer the CUP rested in the discretion of the Administrator, in the first instance, and ultimately with the Board. <em>Beasley I, </em>\u00b6 18. Beasley had yet to obtain the Board\u2019s approval of the transfer of the CUP. Beasley likewise cannot claim an ultimate entitlement to the CUP in light of the discretionary nature of the Board\u2019s decision on the transfer application. <em>Beasley I, </em>\u00b6 18. The Regulations vested discretion with the Board to determine whether to grant a CUP. Any interest that Beasley may have possessed in the CUP did not rise to the level of a protected property or liberty interest under these circumstances. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"A22\">\u00b616  Beasley\u2019s inability to establish that he possessed a protected property interest in obtaining the transfer of the CUP precludes him from establishing his \u00a7 1983 due process and takings claims or his corresponding state claims. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 33. We may affirm the district court if we reach the same conclusion, but on different grounds. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 33. We conclude that the District Court properly granted the motion to dismiss Beasley\u2019s constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b617 We turn then to what Beasley couches as state law tort claims. A closer examination reveals, however, that Beasley generally alleges that the Board was negligent in its handling of his application to transfer the CUP. All of these claims address alleged misconduct solely by the Board. We agree with the District Court that these claims involve the same parties as Beasley\u2019s 2006 appeal of the Board\u2019s revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b618  Likewise all of Beasley\u2019s purported state law tort claims involve the same subject matter and the same issues as Beasley\u2019s 2006 appeal. Beasley asserts that the Board failed to issue a final decision; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>that the Board failed to draft written findings of fact; that the Board failed to follow the Regulations, and that the Board exceeded its authority in denying the CUP transfer. The capacities of the Board and Beasley with respect to these issues also are the same as those in Beasley\u2019s 2006 appeal. As this analysis indicates, the District Court correctly determined that the four elements of res judicata were present here. <em>Kullick, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b619  Section 76-2-227, MCA, allows judicial review of a board of adjustment\u2019s alleged illegal decision in whole, or in part, by any aggrieved person. This section allows an aggrieved party to raise a wide array of alleged improprieties. For example, we have determined that a board of adjustments\u2019 failure to make sufficient findings constitutes a basis for appeal pursuant to \u00a7 76-2-227, MCA. <em>Beasley I, </em>\u00b6 22, citing <em>Flathead Citizens v. Flathead County Bd., </em>2008 MT 1, \u00b6 49, 341 Mont. 1, 175 P.3d 282. Both Beasley\u2019s complaint and his 2006 appeal raised this identical issue. Beasley\u2019s opportunity to challenge the alleged illegality of the Board\u2019s decision to deny his transfer request ended with his own election to dismiss his action with prejudice. <em>Beasley I, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b620  Section 76-2-227, MCA, remains an available remedy for Beasley should he choose to apply for a CUP in his own right and the Board denies his application. Beasley no longer has that remedy available, however, for his current challenges to the Board\u2019s decision to deny his CUP transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b206-8\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Ax7\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">\u00b622 I concur in the result of the Court\u2019s Opinion, but not on the basis of the Court\u2019s analysis at \u00b6\u00b6 13-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">\u00b623 In its March 31, 2008 Order and Rationale on Motion to Dismiss, the District Court correctly held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">When he filed his broad-based appeal on June 30, 2006, Beasley alleged constitutional and statutory violations, a taking, a due process claim, and alleged the lack of authority of the Board of Adjustment to revoke his permit. In challenging the legality of that decision, Beasley raised, or had the opportunity to raise, all of the issues that he has raised in this case. The four elements of res judicata being present in this case, it is barred by res judicata.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alr\">I would affirm the District Court\u2019s decision on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">\u00b624 A district court\u2019s decision is presumed correct, and the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>bears the burden of establishing error by that court. <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 7, 311 Mont. 175, 53 P.3d 1266; <em>see also State v. Clausell, </em>2001 MT 62, \u00b6 48, 305 Mont. 1, 22 P.3d 1111 (\u201c[T]he obligation to establish error by a district court falls squarely on the appellant.\u201d). Beasley has failed to meet this burden in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b625 Beasley\u2019s arguments on appeal attack only the District Court\u2019s March 31, 2008 Order and Rationale on Motion to Dismiss-i.e., the court\u2019s conclusion that the four elements of res judicata barred his December 2007 complaint. He devotes one conclusory paragraph to the \u201csubject matter\u201d prong of res judicata (as he does, similarly, with respect to the other three prongs). He makes absolutely no argument regarding his constitutional and tort claims, or that he had a property interest in the CUP issued to the Hansons, as a basis for reversing the District Court\u2019s decision. Indeed, none of the legal issues discussed in \u00b6\u00b6 13-16 of the Court\u2019s Opinion was even mentioned by Beasley or the Appellees in their respective briefs on this appeal (or, for that matter, in <em>Beasley I</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>). </em>Appellees argue the District Court\u2019s decision; Beasley fails to demonstrate why the court\u2019s decision is in error. We need go no further than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b626 Accordingly, on the posture in which this case was decided in the District Court and on which it was argued on appeal, there is no need to render a decision on a rationale that differs from the District Court\u2019s. The District Court\u2019s decision was correct and should simply be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b627 On that basis, I specially concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\"> Beasely v.
