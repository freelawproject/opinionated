Cook (Robert) has appealed from an order entered in the Eighth Judicial District Court changing a parenting plan for his daughter, M.O.C., whereby her mother, Diana J. McClammy (Diana), would be the primary residential parent and which also ordered that he pay child support commencing December 1,2006. We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the appeal of the parenting plan is moot and reverse the child support order entered by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b62 A decree dissolving the marriage of these parties and establishing a parenting plan was entered February 4,2004, in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County. Under the terms of the decree, the parties\u2019 two minor children, C.J.C. and M.O.C., were placed in the primary custody of Robert. Neither party was required to pay any child support at that time. C.J.C. reached the age of majority before the issues presented herein arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b63 The children remained in Robert\u2019s legal custody. However, as time went on, M.O.C. began having more contact with Diana. After a misunderstanding with Robert in the fall of 2006, M.O.C. began living with Diana, and stopped returning Robert\u2019s phone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b64 In July of2007, Robert was served with documents from the Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED) indicating Diana was receiving assistance from CSED, and it sought reimbursement from Robert. In September of 2007, after an administrative hearing, Robert\u2019s child support obligation for M.O.C. was established at $391.00 per month. The record does not indicate that CSED, or anyone else, moved pursuant to \u00a7 40-5-277(8), MCA, for approval of the order modifying the District Court\u2019s February 4, 2004, decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u00b65 In October of 2007, Robert initiated this case by filing a motion in District Court praying for an order that M.O.C. be returned to his physical custody, for an order to show cause why Diana should not be held in contempt for failure to comply with the District Court\u2019s prior orders, and for custodial interference. Robert further prayed for an order that CSED cease any proceedings and terminate any child support orders it had issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u00b66 CSED was not made a party to this proceeding and was not served with Robert\u2019s motion. Diana responded to Robert\u2019s motion to require that M.O.C. be returned to his custody. However, at no time did she pray for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\u00b67 Following a hearing in October of 2007, the District Court issued an order modifying the parenting plan to provide that M.O.C. would primarily reside with Diana, and that Robert would have regular phone contact and visits. Citing \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, the District Court also ordered that Robert pay child support commencing December 1, 2006. M.O.C. became 18 years old in April of 2008 and was scheduled to graduate from high school in the spring of 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">\u00b68 Robert appeals the District Court order amending the parenting plan. An issue is moot when the controversy causing it ceases to exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>and any action this Court takes will have no effect on the situation of the parties. <em>In re the Guardianship of M.R.O., </em>2008 MT 280, \u00b6 19, 345 Mont. 309, 190 P.3d 1109. Issues related to the modification of the parenting plan are moot because M.O.C. is now an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b69 Robert also appeals the District Court order that he pay child support to Diana commencing December 1,2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the singular circumstances of this case, this order was entered in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b610  The District Court Decree of February 4,2004, which provided that Robert had no child support obligation, was in effect until it was modified by the District Court\u2019s order on November 13, 2007. Diana had not petitioned for child support. While Robert petitioned the District Court for relief from CSED\u2019s administrative order, CSED had not petitioned the District Court for approval of its order that he had a child support obligation. Section 40-4-208(1), MCA, provides that a decree may only modify support installments accruing subsequent to actual notice to a party of a motion for modification. As there had been no motion to modify child support, Robert received no notice that the decree would be modified to require him to pay child support. Section 40-4-208(1), MCA, is strictly construed. <em>Marriage of Widhalm, </em>279 Mont. 97, 101, 926 P.2d 748, 751 (1996). The portion of the District Court\u2019s order that Robert be required to pay child support commencing December 1, 2006, must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b611 Remanded to the District Court with instructions to vacate that portion of its order of November 13,2007, requiring Robert to pay child support commencing December 1, 2006.</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"> We note that the District Court did not set the amount of Robert\u2019s child support obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
