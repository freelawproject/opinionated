We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">\u00b62 McLeod is a certified real estate appraiser. He owns McLeod Realty in Butte, Montana, and is frequently hired to conduct appraisals in condemnation litigation. Of relevance to the present case, McLeod was hired by the landowners in <em>State of Montana, Dept. of Transp. v. The Lee Family Trust </em>and <em>State of Montana, Dept. of Transp. v. Treweek Family Partnership </em>to appraise their respective properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">\u00b63 Hoell is a licensed real estate appraiser employed by the Montana Department of Transportation. In August 2004, she filed two written complaints against McLeod with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry (DOLI). She alleged that McLeod had failed to comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) when preparing the <em>Lee </em>and <em>Treweek </em>appraisals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each complaint was lodged on a standardized complaint form provided by DOLI\u2019s Business Standards Division. This form contains blank spaces for the name and address of the person against whom the complaint is being made, the name and address of the complainant, the nature of complaint, and a list of witnesses and evidence. Additionally, the form asks the complainant: \u2018What action are you requesting of the Board or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Department?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">\u00b64 Hoell\u2019s first complaint referenced the <em>Lee </em>appraisal. Hoell stated that she had personally reviewed this appraisal and that \u201c[t]he deficiencies are readily apparent\u201d in the appraisal, a copy of which she attached to the complaint. She requested that DOLI (more specifically, the Board of Real Estate Appraisers) \u201cdetermine whether or not Mr. McLeod complied with USPAP, and if not, take appropriate action pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 37-54-105(9).\u201d Hoell\u2019s second complaint referenced the <em>Treweek </em>appraisal and contained the same request. In addition, she explained that while she had not personally reviewed this appraisal, her deceased colleague, Jerry Bratlien, had done so. Hoell stated that \u201c[u]pon information and belief, the deficiencies are readily apparent\u201d in the appraisal, a copy of which she likewise attached to the complaint. On both complaints, Hoell listed her address as \u201cMT Dept of Transportation, PO Box 201001, Helena, MT 59620-1001.\u201d Throughout this litigation, however, Hoell has maintained that she filed the complaints in her \u201cindividual capacity,\u201d not on behalf of her employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b65 Based on Hoell\u2019s complaints, the Board of Real Estate Appraisers requested a review of the <em>Lee </em>and <em>Treweek </em>appraisals by an independent appraiser. A year later, the appraiser notified the Board that he would not be able to complete the review due to time constraints. The Board then contracted with David Lennhoff to review the appraisals. In June 2006, the Board reviewed Lennhoffs findings and found \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that McLeod had violated certain USPAP provisions. However, it was later brought to the Board\u2019s attention that Lennhoff had relied on the 2002 version of USPAP, instead of the 2003 version. It is not clear from the record whether the Board asked Lennhoff to reevaluate McLeod\u2019s appraisals under the 2003 USPAP, but regardless, McLeod appeared before the Board in December 2006 and asked it to dismiss Hoell\u2019s complaints based on \u201cthe time passed since the complaints were filed.\u201d The Board granted his request and dismissed the complaints, but without prejudice. The Board stated that it \u201cmay revisit and/or take action on the complaints in the future if a similar complaint is received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b66 Meanwhile, in September 2006, McLeod filed the instant action against Hoell and the State in the District Court, alleging libel, slander, and malicious prosecution. He also alleged that Hoell had been directed by her employer (the Department of Transportation) to file the complaints regarding his <em>Lee </em>and <em>Treweek </em>appraisals. The State moved to dismiss McLeod\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; however, because matters outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the pleading were presented, the District Court decided to treat the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b67 Hoell and the State then filed formal summary judgment motions with accompanying briefs. Hoell argued that McLeod\u2019s defamation claims failed as a matter of law because the statements she made in her complaints to DOLI were privileged publications under \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA. Hoell also argued that the statements she made were, as a matter of law, not defamatory. As for McLeod\u2019s malicious prosecution claim, Hoell argued that McLeod could not meet two of the required elements of this claim because (1) Hoell had probable cause to file her complaints and (2) the proceedings on those complaints were not terminated in McLeod\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b68 The State, for its part, contended that Hoell was acting outside the course and scope of her employment with the State when she asked DOLI to investigate McLeod\u2019s <em>Lee </em>and <em>Treweek </em>appraisals. Alternatively, the State argued that her statements were privileged, constitutionally protected, and not defamatory for purposes of the defamation claim, and that McLeod could not establish <em>any </em>of the elements of a malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b69 The District Court held a hearing and subsequently granted Hoell\u2019s and the State\u2019s motions. Concerning McLeod\u2019s defamation claims, the court held that under <em>Skinner v. Pistoria, </em>194 Mont. 257, 633 P.2d 672 (1981), and \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, the statements in Hoell\u2019s complaints were privileged publications because they were made to the proper authorities responsible for investigating complaints about appraisers and imposing any necessary sanctions. With respect to McLeod\u2019s malicious prosecution claim, the court found a failure of two elements. First, regarding the probable cause element, the court observed that Hoell is a licensed real estate appraiser and that she based her complaints against McLeod on her personal review of the <em>Lee </em>appraisal and knowledge received from a colleague regarding the <em>Treweek </em>appraisal. Moreover, the court noted that the Board had ultimately found reasonable cause to believe that McLeod violated USPAP provisions. Second, regarding the termination element, the court reasoned that because the Board never adjudicated Hoell\u2019s complaints on the merits and left open the opportunity to revisit the complaints, the proceedings had not been terminated in McLeod\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b610 Given these conclusions, the District Court did not address whether Hoell was acting within the scope of her employment with the State. The court entered judgment in favor of both Hoell and the State on all of McLeod\u2019s claims. McLeod now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">\u00b611 The parties raise a number of issues on appeal; however, we conclude that the following two questions are dispositive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment on McLeod\u2019s defamation claims based on \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment on McLeod\u2019s malicious prosecution claim based on the \u201cprobable cause\u201d element of that claim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the criteria set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Center, </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 24, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111. Rule 56(c) states that the judgment sought \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of establishing both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25. The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn therefrom in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 12, 344 Mont. 540, 189 P.3d 615. If the moving party meets its initial burden, then the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish with substantial evidence, as opposed to mere denial, speculation, or conclusory statements, that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Klock v. Town of Cascade, </em>284 Mont. 167, 174, 943 P.2d 1262, 1266 (1997). If no genuine issue of material fact exists, then the court determines whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25. This determination is a conclusion of law, which we review for correctness. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b613 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment on McLeod\u2019s defamation claims based on \u00a727-1-804(2), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b614 Defamation is effected by libel or slander. Section 27-1-801, MCA. Libel and slander are defined by statute. Libel is \u201ca false and <em>unprivileged </em>publication by writing, printing, picture, effigy, or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>fixed representation to the eye which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy or which causes him to be shunned or avoided or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.\u201d Section 27-1-802, MCA (emphasis added). Slander is \u201ca false and <em>unprivileged </em>publication other than libel which,\u201d for purposes of the present case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">tends directly to injure [a person] in respect to his office, profession, trade, or business, either by imputing to him general disqualification in those respects which the office or other occupation peculiarly requires or by imputing something with reference to his office, profession, trade, or business that has a natural tendency to lessen its profit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Section 27-1-803(3), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b615 As emphasized in the statutory language quoted above, libel and slander exist only with respect to \u201cunprivileged\u201d publications. <em>See also Skinner v. Pistoria, </em>194 Mont. 257, 261, 633 P.2d 672, 675 (1981) (\u201cOne requisite of a defamation action is that the communication must be unprivileged.\u201d). Thus, ifHoell\u2019s statements in her complaints to DOLI were privileged, then McLeod cannot state a claim for libel or slander.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 27-1-804, MCA, in turn, defines what communications are privileged. Of relevance here, a privileged publication is one made \u201cin any legislative or judicial proceeding or in any other official proceeding authorized by law.\u201d Section 27-1-804(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b616 We interpreted the language of \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, in <em>Skinner. </em>Pistoria was a \u201cpolitical gadfly\u201d and outspoken critic of the Great Falls city government who made statements at a meeting of the Great Falls City Commission during the time reserved for public comment. His statements included an accusation that Skinner and other police officers had misused police department funds. Skinner sued for defamation, claiming that these statements were made with a malicious personal motive and that they exposed him to hatred, contempt, ridicule, and obloquy, caused him to be shunned and avoided, and injured him in his occupation. <em>See Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 259-61, 633 P.2d at 673-74. This Court, however, held that \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, confers an absolute privilege on publications made in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>\u201cofficial proceeding authorized by law,\u201d so long as the publications are made \u201cto the proper authorities responsible for the interest being expressed.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 262-63, 633 P.2d at 675-76. Thus, if Pistoria\u2019s statements about the conduct of certain police officers were made at a proper proceeding, then the question of whether the statements were maliciously motivated was irrelevant. <em>Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 263, 633 P.2d at 676. We concluded that the absolute privilege applied to Pistoria\u2019s statements for the following reasons: the meeting was an official meeting authorized by law; it was proper for Pistoria to address the commission because it was the governing body of the city; it was proper for him to address the city manager because the manager supervises the police department; and it was proper for him to address the chief of police because the police chief supervises all city police officers. <em>Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 264, 633 P.2d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\">\u00b617 Hoell and the State maintain, and we agree, that under <em>Skinner </em>and \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, the District Court correctly concluded that McLeod\u2019s defamation claims are based on privileged publications and, as such, must fail. The first question is whether Hoell\u2019s statements were made in an official proceeding authorized by law. We conclude they were. DOLI is authorized to \u201cinvestigate complaints ... of illegal or unethical conduct of a member of the profession or occupation under the jurisdiction of aboard within the department.\u201d Section 37-1-101(5), MCA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each licensing board allocated to DOLI is authorized to adopt rules specifying grounds for disciplinary action. Section 37-1-136(1), MCA; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2-15-1758(6), MCA (allocating the Board of Real Estate Appraisers to DOLI); \u00a7 37-54-105(8), (9), MCA (authorizing the Board to adopt standards of professional appraisal practice and to reprimand, suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew the license or certificate of a person who has violated the standards). Any disciplinary action by a board must be conducted as a contested case hearing under the provisions ofthe Montana Administrative Procedure Act. Section 37-1-136(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b618 To facilitate this scheme, \u00a7 37-1-308(1), MCA, specifically authorizes a person, government, or private entity to submit a written complaint to DOLI charging a licensee with a violation of Title 37, chapter 1, part 3, MCA, and specifying the grounds for the complaint-e.g., \u201cconduct that does not meet the generally accepted standards of practice\u201d (\u00a7 37-1-316(18), MCA). Here, Hoell filed complaints as she was authorized to do by \u00a7 37-1-308(1), MCA. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>used the standardized form provided by DOLI for making such complaints. She provided the specific information requested on the form and attached pertinent documentation. All of her statements pertained directly to her allegation that McLeod had failed to comply with USPAP. She asked DOLI, through the Board of Real Estate Appraisers, to determine whether her allegation was correct and, if it was, to take appropriate action under \u00a7 37-54-105, MCA. A properly filed complaint triggers and becomes an integral part of the investigative and disciplinary proceedings described above. Sections 37-1-101(5), -308(2), MCA. We thus conclude that Hoell\u2019s statements were made in an official proceeding authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b619  The second question is whether her statements were made to the proper authorities responsible for the interest being expressed. Again, we conclude they were. As just noted, all of her statements pertained directly to her allegation that McLeod had engaged in unprofessional conduct by failing to comply with USPAP. DOLI was the proper authority for receiving this complaint. Section 37-1-308(1), MCA. And this is one of the specific violations identified in the statutes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 37-1-316(18), MCA (\u201cThe following is unprofessional conduct for a licensee or license applicant governed by this chapter:... conduct that does not meet the generally accepted standards of practice.\u201d (paragraph break omitted)). Accordingly, we hold that Hoell\u2019s statements were privileged publications under \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, and that McLeod, therefore, cannot state a claim of libel or slander under \u00a7\u00a7 27-1-802 and -803, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b620 Before concluding, we address McLeod\u2019s arguments that summary judgment is inappropriate here. First, McLeod cites Article II, Section 7 of the Montana Constitution, which states that \u201c[i]n all suits and prosecutions for libel or slander the truth thereof may be given in evidence; and the jury, under the direction of the court, shall determine the law and the facts.\u201d Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 7. He also cites <em>Hale v. City of Billings, </em>1999 MT 213, 295 Mont. 495, 986 P.2d 413, where we held that \u201c[ujnless the evidence is so overwhelming that any other conclusion would be unreasonable, the issue of whether the [defendant\u2019s] statements were true or false is a determination for the jury alone to make.\u201d <em>Hale, </em>\u00b6 18 (internal quotation marks omitted). McLeod interprets these authorities as standing for the proposition that \u201cthe only way to take this case away from a jury is to be able to say that a jury would be <em>unreasonable </em>in finding defamation in this case.\u201d Here, he argues, \u201ca finding that Jack McLeod was <em>not </em>defamed would be unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b621 As Hoell and the State correctly point out, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>preliminary determination of whether a publication is privileged is a question of law for the court. <em>Hale, </em>\u00b6 35. Moreover, this determination may be reached by the court when material facts are not in dispute. <em>Hale, </em>\u00b6 35. Here, McLeod has not shown the existence of any genuine issues of material fact related to whether Hoell\u2019s statements were made in an official proceeding authorized by law and to the proper authorities responsible for the interest being expressed. <em>Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 263, 633 P.2d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">\u00b622 Second, notwithstanding \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, McLeod focuses on \u00a7 37-1-308(3), MCA, which states that \u201c[a] person or private entity, but not a government entity, filing a complaint under this section in good faith is immune from suit in a civil action related to the filing or contents of the complaint.\u201d According to McLeod, there are genuine issues of material fact which preclude Hoell and the State from prevailing under this statute-specifically, whether Hoell was acting as an agent of a government entity, and whether she acted in good faith. Yet, in their summary judgment briefing, Hoell and the State both state explicitly that they are relying on \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, and are <em>not </em>relying on \u00a7 37-1-308(3), MCA, and they reiterate this position on appeal. Thus, it appears that McLeod has simply identified a defense Hoell and the State could have raised and is arguing that summary judgment on that defense is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b623 Regardless, we conclude that \u00a7 37-1-308(3), MCA, is not applicable here. Since libel or slander claims exist only with respect to \u201cunprivileged publications,\u201d claims premised on \u201cprivileged publications\u201d (as defined in \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA) necessarily fail at their inception. Thus, \u00a7 37-1-308(3), MCA, simply does not apply to libel and slander claims where the communications at issue are privileged under \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA. It does apply, however, to civil actions that are not premised on privileged communications. Here, as explained above, McLeod\u2019s claims are premised on privileged communications; therefore, \u00a7 37-1-308(3), MCA, is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b624  In sum, Hoell and the State met their burden of establishing both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on McLeod\u2019s libel and slander claims. McLeod has not established that a genuine issue of material fact exists. We accordingly hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment on McLeod\u2019s defamation claims based on \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b625 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment on McLeod\u2019s malicious prosecution claim based on the \u201cprobable cause\u201d element of that claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\u00b626 In a civil action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiffs burden at trial is to introduce proof sufficient to allow reasonable jurors to find each of the following six elements: (1) a judicial proceeding was commenced and prosecuted against the plaintiff; (2) the defendant was responsible for instigating, prosecuting, or continuing such proceeding; (3) there was a lack of probable cause for the defendant\u2019s acts; (4) the defendant was actuated by malice; (5) the judicial proceeding terminated favorably for the plaintiff; and (6) the plaintiff suffered damage. <em>Hughes v. Lynch, </em>2007 MT 177, \u00b6 12, 338 Mont. 214, 164 P.3d 913. If one of these elements is not proven by prima facie evidence, judgment as a matter of law may be entered for the defendant. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b627 We focus here on the third element: whether there was a lack of probable cause for Hoell\u2019s acts of filing her complaints with DOLL In <em>Hughes, </em>we adopted the following definition of \u201cprobable cause\u201d for purposes of a malicious prosecution claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">One who takes an active part in the initiation, continuation or procurement of civil proceedings against another has probable cause for doing so if he reasonably believes in the existence of the facts upon which the claim is based, and either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">(a) correctly or reasonably believes that under those facts the claim may be valid under the applicable law, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">(b) believes to this effect in reliance upon the advice of counsel, sought in good faith and given after full disclosure of all relevant facts within his knowledge and information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-8\"><em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 675 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u00b628 In the present case, Hoell and the State point out that the Board of Real Estate Appraisers ultimately found \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that McLeod had violated certain USPAP provisions, while McLeod contends that Lennhoff s analysis (on which the Board relied) was flawed in numerous respects. However, as we indicated in <em>Plouffe v. Dept. of Public Health and Human Services, </em>2002 MT 64, 309 Mont. 184, 45 P.3d 10, probable cause is determined based on the facts known to the party at the time she initiated the proceedings. <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>accord Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 72, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561. We also note here that the issue of probable cause must be submitted to a jury for resolution when direct and circumstantial evidence related to the defendant\u2019s knowledge is susceptible to different conclusions by reasonable persons, but the issue of probable cause is a question of law when no evidentiary conflict exists and uncontroverted evidence admits only one conclusion. <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"AZd\">\u00b629 Here, \u00a7 37-1-308(1), MCA, authorizes a written complaint to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>filed with DOLI charging a licensee with unprofessional conduct and specifying the grounds for the complaint. Hoell and the State point out that she filed two such complaints, using the standardized form provided for this purpose and providing the specific information requested on the form. The nature of each complaint was that McLeod had failed to comply with the generally accepted standards of professional appraisal practice (i.e., USPAP). <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 37-1-316(18), 37-54-403(1), MCA. Hoell stated on one complaint that she had personally reviewed the <em>Lee </em>appraisal and that the deficiencies were readily apparent on the attached copy of that appraisal. On the other complaint, she stated upon information and belief that the deficiencies were readily apparent on the <em>Treweek </em>appraisal, a copy of which was likewise attached to the complaint. She signed a statement on each complaint that \u201c[t]he facts and matters contained herein are true, accurate and correct to the best of my knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\">\u00b630 Hoell and the State have presented substantial evidence that Hoell reasonably believed in the existence of the facts upon which her complaints were based and reasonably believed that under those facts the complaints may be valid under the applicable law. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 16. Their evidence is uncontroverted. Although McLeod opines that Hoell\u2019s motives were sinister, McLeod\u2019s speculation does not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Hoell had a reasonable belief in the validity of her complaints and the existence of the underlying facts. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 13. In addition, McLeod points to the supposed \u201cproblems with the investigation conducted by the Board of Real Estate Appraisers.\u201d But, again, our focus here is on the facts known to Hoell at the time she filed her complaints. <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b631  In sum, Hoell and the State met their burden of establishing both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on McLeod\u2019s malicious prosecution claim. McLeod has not established that a genuine issue of material fact exists. We accordingly hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment on McLeod\u2019s malicious prosecution claim based on the \u201cprobable cause\u201d element of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-13\"> The Board of Real Estate Appraisers has adopted USPAP, which is published by The Appraisal Foundation. <em>See </em>Admin.
