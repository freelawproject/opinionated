We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b62 At approximately 2:00 a.m. on May 25, 2007, Deputy J. Ellis (Deputy Ellis) of the Yellowstone County Sheriffs Office was driving in a marked patrol car on a public roadway in the Hillside Village Trailer Park in Yellowstone County. Deputy Ellis noticed a person driving a vehicle with license plate number \u201c3C-9387A\u201d affixed to the rear of the vehicle in plain view. Deputy Ellis ran the license plate number through a database and learned that the registered owner of the vehicle, Neil, had a suspended and/or revoked license.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b63 Deputy Ellis subsequently conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle. Prior to activating his emergency lights to initiate the stop, Deputy Ellis was unsure if he saw one or two occupants in the vehicle. Moreover, prior to making face-to-face contact with the occupants, Deputy Ellis was unable to determine their gender, race, or any other obvious characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\u00b64 Once Deputy Ellis stopped the vehicle and made direct contact with the occupants, he confirmed that Neil was driving while another man named Jeremy Weakely was riding as a passenger. During the stop, Deputy Ellis detected the smell of a strong-odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from the vehicle. Deputy J. Smith (Deputy Smith), also with the Yellowstone County Sheriffs Office, soon responded and assisted Deputy Ellis in conducting a DUI investigation. Neil was subsequently charged with DUI, driving while license is suspended or revoked, and operating a motor vehicle without proof of liability protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">\u00b65 Neil subsequently filed a motion to suppress the evidence gathered from the traffic stop. In his motion, Neil argued that: (1) Deputy Ellis ran an improper license plate check on the vehicle he was operating and lacked particularized suspicion for the stop; (2) Deputy Ellis\u2019 traffic stop constituted an impermissible fishing expedition; and (3) Deputy Ellis did not observe anything which would have caused him to believe that Neil was engaged in any wrongdoing and that the traffic stop was therefore unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">\u00b66 The District Court denied Neil\u2019s motion. Relying primarily upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>State v. Halvorson, </em>2000 MT 56, 229 Mont. 1, 997 P.2d 751, the District Court reasoned that Deputy Ellis was not required to have particularized suspicion to run the license plate check on Neil\u2019s car and that the subsequent traffic stop was lawful. After the District Court denied his motion, Neil pled guilty to felony DUI and received a 5 year sentence, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. Neil now appeals the District Court\u2019s decision, presenting the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Neil\u2019s motion to suppress?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>State v. Bieber, </em>2007 MT 262, \u00b6 20, 339 Mont. 309, 170 P.3d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\u00b69 In denying Neil\u2019s motion, the District Court reasoned that the license plate check run by Deputy Ellis did not qualify as a search under the Fourth Amendment, and thus did not evoke Neil\u2019s constitutional protections against unlawful searches. From this point, the District Court further reasoned under <em>Halvorson </em>that Deputy Ellis had particularized suspicion to stop Neil because: (1) the license plate check showed that Neil had a suspended/revoked license; and (2) Deputy Ellis was unaware of any facts which would render unreasonable the assumption that Neil was the person driving the vehicle at the time of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\u00b610 On appeal, Neil concedes that there is no expectation of privacy in a license plate. However, he argues that an officer must have some reasonable inference that the vehicle\u2019s owner is in fact driving the vehicle before the vehicle can be lawfully stopped. Neil asserts it would be unreasonable to allow officers to stop a vehicle every time a license plate shows that the owner of the vehicle has a suspended or revoked license. Instead, Neil argues, the officer must be able to make some kind of identification before he can lawfully stop a vehicle based solely on the results of a license plate check.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">\u00b611  In <em>State v. Thomas, </em>2008 MT 206, 344 Mont. 150, 186 P.3d 864, we held that license plates contain public information under Montana law and that individuals have no expectation of privacy in a license plate which is knowingly exposed to the public. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 13. In <em>City of Billings v. Costa, </em>2006 MT 181, 333 Mont. 84, 140 P.3d 1070, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>we stated that \u201can officer may rationally infer the driver of a vehicle is the vehicle\u2019s registered owner unless the officer is aware of any facts that would render that inference unreasonable.\u201d <em>Costa, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Halvorson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b612  Here, it is apparent that Neil knowingly exposed his license plate to the public. Thus, it did not constitute a search for Deputy Ellis to run a check on Neil\u2019s license plate. Second, Neil does not allege that Deputy Ellis was aware of any facts which would render unreasonable the assumption that Neil was the person driving the vehicle at the time of the stop. Thus, under <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Costa, </em>the stop was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b613 For these reasons, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Neil\u2019s motion to suppress and affirm Neil\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
