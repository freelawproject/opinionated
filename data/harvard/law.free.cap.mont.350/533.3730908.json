Nick contends on appeal that his conviction must be reversed because the District Court erred instructing the jury as to the definition of \u201cpurposely\u201d as an element of aggravated assault. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b62 About midnight on May 11, 2007, Nick accompanied Chelsea Dodd, his friend and neighbor, as she drove to Jason Switzer\u2019s house. Dodd and Switzer had been romantically involved for six years but that relationship had apparently ended. She entered Switzer\u2019s house to invite him to a camping party, and found him intoxicated and in bed with another woman. Nick waited in the car for twenty to thirty minutes, eating a burrito and using a Phillips head screwdriver to try to fix the stereo in Dodd\u2019s car. He never left the car, but honked the horn several times wanting Dodd to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u00b63 Dodd then came running out of the house closely followed by Switzer. She was yelling for Nick to roll up the car window and lock the door because Switzer was coming to attack him. Dodd got into the driver\u2019s seat of her car and started trying to leave, but Switzer dove into Nick\u2019s open window and began hitting him. Switzer pulled himself out of the window, or was pushed out by Dodd, and then dove into the car again. Dodd saw Nick swing at Switzer with his right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">\u00b64 Switzer immediately fell backward out of the car and dropped onto the ground. Dodd thought that she had run over Switzer and left the car to check on him. Dodd felt an object under Switzer\u2019s head and pulled on it, only to find that it was a Phillips head screwdriver. She cried \u201coh my God there\u2019s a screwdriver in his head,\u201d and began screaming hysterically for help. Nick fled the scene on foot and ran to his mother\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\u00b65 The screwdriver penetrated Switzer\u2019s skull and brain approximately four inches, causing him serious, permanent brain injury. Nick admitted to holding the screwdriver and to changing its position in his hand during the altercation, but claimed that Switzer impaled himself when he jumped back in the window. After the incident Nick told police officers that he had swung at Switzer or used his arms to defend himself. Nick told them that he lunged his arm forward toward Switzer and that it came back without the screwdriver. Nick also told the officers that when Switzer was coming back to the car a second time, he brought the screwdriver back \u201cto get ready\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>defend himself. Dodd told the police and testified that she saw Nick swing his arm at Switzer immediately before Switzer collapsed on the ground. At trial, Nick changed his description of the events. He claimed that he never swung at Switzer, that the account he gave to officers shortly after the incident was wrong, and that Dodd\u2019s testimony was mistaken. He said that when he gave interviews to the police after the incident he was not \u201cin the right state of mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b66 The State charged Nick with attempted deliberate homicide, assault with a weapon and aggravated assault. Nick filed a notice of reliance on the defense of justifiable use of force as provided in \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA. During settlement of instructions, Nick objected to the State\u2019s offered instruction on the definition of \u201cpurposely,\u201d but the District Court overruled the objection and gave the instruction. Nick offered and the District Court gave instructions on the defense of justifiable use of force. Nick\u2019s attorney argued to the jury, in part, that he should be acquitted based upon the theory of justifiable use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"AP_\">\u00b67 The jury returned a verdict of not guilty to the charge of attempted deliberate homicide and guilty of the charge of aggravated assault. The jury deadlocked on the charge of assault with a weapon, and that charge was subsequently dismissed at the request of the State. The District Court sentenced Nick to the custody of the Montana Department of Corrections for twenty years, with fifteen suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b68 The standard of review of jury instructions is whether the instructions taken as a whole fully and fairly instruct the jury as to the applicable law, and whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Grindheim, </em>2004 MT 311, \u00b6 17, 323 Mont. 519, 101 P.3d 267. If the instructions are erroneous in some aspect the mistake must prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in order to constitute reversible error. <em>State v. Archambault, </em>2007 MT 26, \u00b6 14, 336 Mont. 6, 152 P.3d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u00b69 Nick was convicted of aggravated assault, defined in the statutes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">A person commits the offense of aggravated assault if the person purposely or knowingly causes serious bodily injury to another or purposely or knowingly, with the use of physical force or contact, causes reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury or death in another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Section 45-5-202(1), MCA. \u201c[A] person acts purposely with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense if it is the person\u2019s conscious object to engage in that conduct or to cause that result.\u201d Section 45-2-101(65), MCA. A person acts \u201cknowingly\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">with respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when the person is aware of the person\u2019s own conduct or that the circumstance exists. A person acts knowingly with respect to the result or conduct described by a statute defining an offense when the person is aware that it is highly probable that the result will be caused by the person\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayv\">Section 45-2-101(35), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b610 The District Court instructed the jury that: \u201cA person commits the offense of Aggravated Assault if the person purposely or knowingly causes serious bodily injury to another.\u201d The District Court instructed that: \u201cA person acts purposely when it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result.\u201d The District Court also instructed that: \u201cA person acts knowingly when the person is aware there exists the high probability that the person\u2019s conduct will cause the specific result.\u201d Nick objected to the definition of purposely, but not to the definition of the offense or to the definition of knowingly. Nick admitted at trial that putting a screwdriver into someone\u2019s head would likely cause death or serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b611 The District Court\u2019s instruction defining \u201cpurposely\u201d was taken verbatim from Montana Criminal Jury Instructions (MC JI) No. 2-106. Nick objected on the ground that aggravated assault is a \u201cresult oriented\u201d offense. He contended that under the comment to MCJI No. 2-106, it was improper to allow the jury to find that he had acted purposely if he engaged in \u201cconduct of that nature\u201d rather than requiring a conclusion that he intended \u201cto cause such a result.\u201d The District Court overruled Nick\u2019s objection to the instruction, finding that the \u201ccentral issue on this case ... is the conscious object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">\u00b612  In <em>State v. </em>Patton, 280 Mont. 278, 930 P.2d 635 (1996), defendant was charged with deliberate homicide and claimed that an unknown third person had committed the crime. The District Court gave the same definition of \u201cpurposely\u201d that was given in the present case. This Court found error because it \u201callowed the jury to convict Patton solely on the basis that he consciously engaged in conduct without regard to whether harm was intended.\u201d <em>Patton, </em>280 Mont. at 291, 930 P.2d at 643. Even if an instruction is erroneous, however, there is no reversible error unless the defendant\u2019s substantial rights are affected. <em>Patton, </em>280 Mont. at 291, 930 P.2d at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u00b613 There was no such danger of an erroneous application of \u201cpurposely\u201d in the present case. Nick relied upon the defense of justifiable use of force, arguing that he was entitled to an acquittal on that basis. A defendant who relies upon the defense of justifiable use of force concedes that he acted purposely and knowingly. <em>State v. Houle, </em>1998 MT 235, \u00b6 15, 291 Mont. 95, 966 P.2d 147; <em>State v. Sunday, </em>187 Mont. 292, 306, 609 P.2d 1188, 1197 (1980); <em>People v. Joyner, </em>278 N.E.2d 756, 760 (Ill. 1972). Having conceded as a matter of law that he acted purposely or knowingly, Nick\u2019s substantial rights could not have been affected by any error in the definition of those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b614  The District Court recognized that the crux of the case was determination of Nick\u2019s \u201cconscious object\u201d to engage in that conduct. There was ample evidence, which must be viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>State v. Meckler, </em>2008 MT 277, \u00b6 9, 345 Mont. 302, 190 P.3d 1104, for the jury to have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that it was Nick\u2019s conscious object to grasp the screwdriver as a weapon and strike Switzer. Nick admitted that he held the screwdriver when Switzer attacked and that he turned it in his hand so that the blade pointed down, away from the direction of his thumb. He did so to defend himself. Nick admitted to investigating officers that he swung at Switzer, and that he lunged his hand with the screwdriver toward Switzer and that his hand came back empty. Even though he changed that story in his trial testimony, the jury was entitled to believe the earlier, contemporaneous account. Nick\u2019s friend Dodd testified that she saw his hand swing toward Switzer. And, Nick admitted that he had no injuries after the attack by Switzer other than a scratch on his forearm. If it were Nick\u2019s conscious object to strike Switzer with the screwdriver, or if he were aware at the time he did so that it could cause Switzer serious bodily injury, then the mental state element of the offense is satisfied. <em>Meckler, </em>\u00b6 12. There was ample evidence for the jury to reach those conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b615 The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b561-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
