The direct appeal has been fully briefed and submitted to the Court for classification. To save time and avoid duplication of effort by the Court and counsel, we have considered the briefs in the direct appeal in making this decision on Borgen\u2019s petition for habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"ARu\">\u00b63 Borgen\u2019s brief on direct appeal makes the same argument as in his petition for habeas relief. That is, the petition to revoke the suspended portion of his sentence was filed after his sentence had expired. In its response brief in the direct appeal, the State does not contest the facts as stated by Borgen, nor does it argue that his analysis of the law is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b64 The records referred to in the direct appeal, which are not challenged by the State, as well as those attached to the petition for habeas corpus, reveal that on July 21, 1993, the District Court sentenced Borgen, imposing ten years for felony assault, five years for carrying a concealed weapon, and added a sentence enhancement of five years because he used a weapon during the offense of felony assault. These sentences were ordered to run consecutively, for a total sentence of twenty years. Rather than sending him to Montana State Prison, the District Court committed Borgen to the custody of the Montana Department of Corrections and Human Services (now DPHHS) because at the time he committed the offenses he suffered from a mental disease or defect. The District Court later amended the sentences to give Borgen credit for 281 days served before he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b65 On October 9, 1998, upon the petition of the director of DPHHS, the District Court issued an amended judgment. Pursuant to the amended judgment, Borgen\u2019s remaining sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation for approximately fifteen years-the total time remaining on his three consecutive sentences after he was given credit for five years and two months served after July 21, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b66 On June 9, 2008, the State petitioned to revoke Borgen\u2019s suspended sentence. Borgen admitted the allegations of the petition and on July 31, 2008, he was re-sentenced. The District Court placed Borgen in the custody of DPHHS for an additional fourteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b67 As noted above, Borgen originally was charged with and pled guilty to the offense of felony assault, which requires that the defendant purposely or knowingly cause reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another by use of a weapon. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA (1991). In each of the three judgments against Borgen-in 1993, 1998, and 2008-the court included the five year weapons enhancement to the sentence for felony assault for the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>a weapon, even though a necessary element of the underlying offense, felony assault, was the use of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b68 In <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, \u00b6 16, 293 Mont. 224, 975 P.2d 312, we held that application of the weapon enhancement statute to felony convictions in which the underlying offense requires proof of the use of a weapon violates Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution, because it constitutes double jeopardy. The five year weapon enhancement portion of Borgen\u2019s sentences was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b69  The total time remaining on Borgen\u2019s suspended sentence after the October 9, 1998, amendment, excluding the illegal five year weapons enhancement, was nine years and less than one month. The petition to revoke his suspended sentence was filed June 9, 2008, or nine years and eight months after October 9, 1998. Thus, the legal portion of Borgen\u2019s sentence had expired before the petition to revoke was filed. A petition to revoke a suspended sentence must be filed before the sentence expires. Section 46-18-203(2), MCA. The July 31, 2008, revocation of Borgen\u2019s sentence is facially illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b610  Incarceration of an individual pursuant to a sentence which imposes a facially illegal sentence enhancement represents a grievous wrong and a miscarriage of justice warranting habeas corpus relief. <em>See Lott v. State, </em>2006 MT 279, \u00b6 22, 334 Mont. 270, 150 P.3d 337.</p>\n<p id=\"A72\">\u00b611 Borgen discharged the legal portions of his suspended sentences in Lewis &amp; Clark County Cause No. DC-92-157 before the petition to revoke the suspended sentence was filed. The District Court judgment of July 31, 2008, must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\u00b612 NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\u00b613 1.
