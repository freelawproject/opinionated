Beasley (Beasley) appeals from an order of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, that granted Flathead County Board of Adjustment\u2019s (Board) motion to dismiss. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AuT\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court properly grant the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss?</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u00b64 Did the District Court properly determine that \u00a7 76-2-227, MCA, provided Beasley an adequate remedy?</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">\u00b65 The Flathead County Board of Commissioners (Commissioners) created the Board pursuant to \u00a7 76-2-221, MCA. The Commissioners adopted the Flathead County Zoning Regulations (regulations or FCZR). The regulations, in turn, established the position of Zoning Administrator (Administrator).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">\u00b66 The Board granted a conditional use permit (CUP) to Arthur and Dorothy Hanson (the Hansons) on June 3, 1997. The Hansons owned real property located on Farm to Market Road in Kalispell, Flathead County, Montana. The CUP allowed a gravel pit operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">\u00b67 Beasley purchased the Hansons\u2019 real property on Farm to Market Road on April 7, 2005. The Administrator initially determined that a valid CUP for gravel extraction remained with the property. The Flathead Citizens for Quality Growth (Citizens) appealed the Administrator\u2019s decision to approve the transfer of the CUP to Beasley as the new owner. The Board denied the transfer of the CUP to Beasley on June 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">\u00b68 Beasley appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the District Court on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>June 30, 2006. Beasley filed a petition for writ of certiorari, pursuant to \u00a7 76-2-227, MCA. Citizens intervened to defend the Board\u2019s decision. Beasley, through his former counsel, moved to dismiss with prejudice the writ of certiorari on February 5,2007, before the District Court had issued any decision. The District Court dismissed with prejudice Beasley\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari on March 2, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\">\u00b69 Beasley eventually filed a petition for writ of mandamus on December 19, 2007. Beasley alleged that the Board had denied the transfer of the CUP without providing any grounds for its determination to deny the transfer and without authority to deny it. Beasley contended that the Board had no record of its proceedings and that the Board had failed to provide a record to Beasley. Beasley claimed that he had expended over $2 million in reliance upon his ability to extract gravel from the property. Beasley alleged that he had exhausted any and all available administrative remedies. Beasley further alleged that he had no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law other than the remedies sought by his mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b610 The Board filed a motion to dismiss on January 28, 2008. The Board argued that Beasley incorrectly had used a writ of mandamus for the relief that he had requested. The Board claimed that a mandamus petition did not lie to correct a previously made decision or to control discretion. The Board further alleged that Beasley had a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b611 The District Court granted the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court agreed with the Board that a writ of mandamus is not an appropriate mechanism for the relief that Beasley had requested. The court cited the fact that the Board already had denied the transfer of the CUP to Beasley and mandamus does not lie to correct or undo an action already taken. The District Court further pointed out that \u00a7 76-2-227, MCA, provides a remedy for the court\u2019s review of an alleged illegal decision by the Board. The absence of appropriate finding of fact, or any findings of fact, in support of the Board\u2019s decision did not preclude Beasley from pursuing a writ of review or certiorari under this statute. The court determined that Beasley had a plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law that rendered mandamus inapplicable. Beasley appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b612 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss. <em>Doty v. Mont. Com\u2019r of Political </em>Practices, 2007 MT 341, \u00b6 9, 340 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>276, 173 P.3d 700. Dismissal is proper if the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief based on any set of facts that could be proven to support the claim. <em>Doty, </em>\u00b6 9. A determination of whether a complaint states a claim presents a conclusion of law that we review for correctness. <em>Doty, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court properly grant the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b614 Beasley argues that a writ of mandamus represents the appropriate mechanism to compel the Board to perform its clear duty to carry out the express provisions of FCZR \u00a7 2.06.060. Beasley contends that the Board\u2019s 1997 approval of the CUP placed it in perpetual status pursuant to FCZR \u00a7 2.06.060(1). Beasley argues that, once granted, the CUP shall \u201crun with the lot, building, structure, or use and shall not be affected by change of ownership.\u201d FCZR \u00a7 2.06.060(1). Beasley thus claims that the CUP\u2019s perpetual nature made its transfer into Beasley\u2019s name a mere ministerial task.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b615 At the outset, we note that a writ of mandate will not lie to correct or undo an action already taken. <em>State ex. rel. Popham v. Hamilton City Council, </em>185 Mont. 26, 29, 604 P.2d 312, 314 (1979). An action already done cannot be undone by mandamus, however erroneous it may have been. <em>Popham, </em>185 Mont. at 29, 604 P.2d at 314. In <em>Popham, </em>the petitioner prayed for the district court to issue a writ of mandamus directing the city, among other things, to rescind its approval of a child care center. <em>Popham, </em>185 Mont. at 27-28, 604 P.2d at 313. The district court dismissed the petition and this Court affirmed. <em>Popham, </em>185 Mont. at 29, 604 P.2d at 314. The Court determined that the approval of the child care center as a permissible use, whether accomplished by an erroneous procedure, remained a past and completed act not reviewable by a writ of mandate. <em>Popham, </em>185 Mont. at 29, 604 P.2d at 314. <em>Popham </em>applies here. The Board\u2019s decision to deny the transfer of the CUP to Beasley is a completed act that is not reviewable by a writ of mandate. <em>Popham, </em>185 Mont. at 29, 604 P.2d at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b616  Beasley also has difficulty satisfying the two-part standard to qualify for the issuance of a writ of mandate. <em>Becky v. Butte-Silver Bow Sch. Dist. 1, </em>274 Mont. 131, 135, 906 P.2d 193, 195 (1995). The writ is available where the party who applies for it is entitled to the performance of a clear legal duty by the party against whom the writ is sought. Section 27-26-102(1), MCA; <em>Smith v. County of Missoula, </em>1999 MT 330, \u00b6 28, 297 Mont. 368, 992 P.2d 834. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>must grant a writ of mandate if a clear legal duty exists and no speedy and adequate remedy is available in the ordinary course of law. Section 27-26-102(1X2), MCA, <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 28. The clear legal duty must involve, however, a ministerial act. <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\">\u00b617 We consider an act to be ministerial where the law prescribes and defines the duty to be performed with such precision and certainty as to leave nothing to the exercise of discretion or judgment. <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 28. Where the act to be done involves the exercise of discretion or judgment, however, it is not deemed merely ministerial. <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 28. Beasley contends that FCZR \u00a7 2.06.060, required the Board to approve his transfer. He contends, therefore, that the Board\u2019s approval would be a ministerial act. Our review of the regulations shows that the Board exercised discretion in denying Beasley\u2019s CUP transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b618  FCZR \u00a7 2.01.010, provides that the Administrator shall administer, interpret, and enforce the zoning regulations. \u201cAny person ... may file an appeal when aggrieved by a decision or interpretation by the [administrator]....\u201d FCZR \u00a7 2.04.010. \u201cInterpretation\u201d implies the exercise of discretion. The regulations also specifically provide that the Board exercise discretion. In fact, the regulations state that the \u201cgranting of a [C]UP is a matter of grace, resting in the discretion of the [Board] and a refusal is not the denial of a right, conditional or otherwise.\u201d FCZR \u00a7 2.06.090. FCZR \u00a7 2.04.020(8), also allows the Board\u2019s sole discretion in granting a continuance. We cannot agree with Beasley that FCZR \u00a7 2.06.060, leaves the Board without the exercise of discretion or judgment. <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 28. The Board\u2019s decision to deny the transfer of the CUP to Beasley constitutes a discretionary act. A writ of mandate cannot be used to compel a discretionary act. <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b619 <em>Did the District Court properly determine that \u00a776-2-227, MCA, provided Beasley an adequate remedy ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b620 Beasley argues that the Board has failed to issue a \u201cfiling of decision\u201d or findings of fact in violation of FCZR \u00a7 2.04.020(10). Beasley contends that the Board\u2019s failure in this regard prevented him from invoking the review available under \u00a7 76-2-227, MCA. Section 76-2-227, MCA, allows judicial review of a board of adjustment\u2019s alleged illegal decision in whole, or in part, by any aggrieved person. The District Court determined that the absence of any findings of fact in support of the Board\u2019s decision did not preclude Beasley from pursuing a writ of review or certiorari under \u00a7 76-2-227, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b621 Our decision in <em>Flathead Citizens v. Flathead County Bd., </em>2008 MT 1, 341 Mont. 1, 175 P.3d 282, supports the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>determination. In <em>Citizens, </em>a number of important questions remained unanswered following the Board\u2019s decision to allow a gravel pit operation under a different provision of the same zoning regulations at issue here. <em>Citizens, </em>\u00b6 48. The Board never directly answered the questions with the level of detail required by principles of administrative law and the specific requirements of the regulations themselves. <em>Citizens, </em>\u00b6 48. The Citizen\u2019s nonetheless petitioned for review. We remanded for further proceedings to force the Board to come forward with findings of fact and conclusions to support its decision. <em>Citizens, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b622  The lack of adequate findings of fact issued by the Board did not render \u00a7 76-2-227, MCA, an unavailable remedy for Beasley. The Board\u2019s lack of \u201cfiling a decision\u201d similarly did not insulate the Board from judicial review and the requirements under \u00a7 76-2-227(2), MCA, to support its decision when directed by a district court. <em>Citizens, </em>\u00b6 49. Beasley had a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available thus rendering a writ of mandamus inapplicable. Section 27-26-102(2), MCA. The District Court correctly granted the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Doty, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b200-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
