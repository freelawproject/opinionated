A jury found in favor of Quebedeaux after a trial in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. The Willings appeal the jury verdict and order of the District Court denying their motion for a new trial. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b62 We restate the issues raised on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying the Willings\u2019 request for a trial continuance and by limiting the amount of time within which to present evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying the Willings\u2019 blanket challenge for cause of Quebedeaux\u2019s former patients and by denying the Willings\u2019 individual challenge to juror Stonehouse?</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion by denying Willings\u2019 motion for a new trial, which was based on asserted misrepresentations of an undisclosed textbook by defense counsel during closing arguments in violation of the court\u2019s order?</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\u00b66 Because we reverse on the third issue, determining that the Willings\u2019 motion for a new trial should have been granted, we decline to address the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">\u00b67 William Willing was referred to Dr. Quebedeaux, a podiatrist, in September 2001 because of right foot pain. When he first visited Quebedeaux, Willing had a large callus under the ball joint behind his big toe and had clawing of his middle three toes, to the extent that his toes were curling under themselves and his toenails were hitting the ground. Willing\u2019s toenails were thick and scarred as a result, causing him a great deal of pain. Quebedeaux provided conservative treatment to Willing for several years thereafter, which included trimming the nails, shaving calluses, administering injections, taping the second toe down to remove pressure, and padding the foot to prevent Willing\u2019s toes from rubbing on his shoe. Willing had undergone similar conservative treatment with another podiatrist since the late 1980s. Quebedeaux and Willing also discussed correcting the toes with surgery if conservative treatment failed to ameliorate the pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">\u00b68 There are surgical options for treatment of a clawed toe condition. Quebedeaux recommended arthrodesis for Willing, which fuses the joints of each clawed toe in order to straighten the toe and remove pain. When an arthrodesis is performed on a clawed toe, a Kirshner wire, or \u201cK-wire,\u201d is inserted through the middle of the phalanxes of the toe to keep it in position and allow the bones to fuse. Sizes of K-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>wire range from .028 inch diameter to .062 diameter. Willing consented to Quebedeaux\u2019s recommendation of arthrodesis and signed a form acknowledging possible complications from that surgery, such as loss of a toe and Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (\u201cRSD\u201d), also referred to as complex regional pain syndrome. An alternative treatment for clawed toes is arthroplasty, which involves removing bone at the head of the proximal phalanx of each clawed toe. Arthroplasties do not require use of K-wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b69 On January 22, 2004, Quebedeaux performed an arthrodesis on the three middle toes of Willing\u2019s right foot. Quebedeaux straightened the three toes using .062 inch diameter K-wire, the largest size available. Over the next week and a half, Quebedeaux saw Willing nearly every day. Each time, Willing noted that his pain was significant but was improving. Quebedeaux tested the toes for circulation and noted good blood supply to the tips of Willing\u2019s toes. On several occasions, Quebedeaux gave Willing the option of removing the K-wires due to the pain Willing was experiencing, but warned him that doing so may compromise the alignment of the toes. Willing apparently declined. Quebedeaux never observed any discoloration of Willing\u2019s toes during those initial post-procedure visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b610 On February 6, 2004, two weeks following the surgery, Willing reported for the first time that the pain in his right foot had increased. This concerned Quebedeaux, so he removed the K-wires. Quebedeaux testified that the toes \u201clooked great\u201d at that time, but when Willing returned three days later, on February 9, Willing\u2019s second toe had a darker discoloration, possibly caused by ischemia, or reduced blood flow to the second toe. On February 12, it was clear to Quebedeaux that Willing had some ischemia, as evidenced by a black tip covering the end of the toe. Quebedeaux treated the skin in an attempt to get it to heal as much as possible, and ultimately the ischemia ended and a boundary formed between the healthy and unhealthy tissue. On April 16, 2004, Dr. Peter Hanson, an orthopedist, performed a partial amputation on Willing\u2019s second toe to remove the dead tissue.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b611 Willing experienced RSD, or chronic pain, in his right foot after the K-wires were removed and continuing after the partial amputation. Due to the partial amputation and resulting complications, Willing was discharged from his position as Colonel in the Montana Army National Guard as physically unfit to serve on May 1,2005. The Willings filed this action on March 21,2005, alleging that the surgery performed by Quebedeaux was not the proper surgery for Willing\u2019s condition and that his treatment and follow-up care fell below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the standard of care applicable to podiatrists. The Willings alleged that as a result of Quebedeaux\u2019s negligence, Willing suffered permanent circulatory damage, permanent neurological damage, permanent deformities in his toes, and had suffered the loss of the remainder of his military career.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b612 At trial, the parties\u2019 expert witnesses presented conflicting testimony as to the proper course of treatment for Willing\u2019s condition. Willings\u2019 podiatry expert, Dr. David Widom, testified that arthrodesis was not appropriate for Willing and the K-wires used by Quebedeaux were too large. Likewise, Dr. Sigvard Hansen, Willings\u2019 orthopedic expert, testified by videotaped deposition that the actual cause of Willing\u2019s clawed toes was tightness in Willing\u2019s calf. According to Hansen, although the arthrodesis was \u201cill-advised,\u201d the use of the K-wire was more the cause of the ischemia in Willing\u2019s toe than the actual arthrodesis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b613 In contrast, Quebedeaux\u2019s podiatry expert, Dr. William Wilshire, testified that arthrodesis is the standard of care for clawed toes among orthopedic and podiatric surgeons and that Quebedeaux\u2019s preoperative treatment and disclosures, surgery, and postoperative care were within the standard of care. Wilshire testified that the .062 inch diameter K-wire used to fuse Willing\u2019s toes was within the spectrum of sizes that were appropriate for the type of surgery Quebedeaux had performed. Wilshire based this testimony on his own professional experience and training as a surgeon, as well as on his review of literature and textbooks over the course of his practice. In fact, one such textbook relied upon by Wilshire and referred to at trial was written by Willing\u2019s expert, Dr. Sigvard Hansen. Wilshire testified that Hansen\u2019s own textbook, which he had brought with him to trial, showed \u201chammertoe [or clawtoe] fusion far larger than .062 K-wire specifically graphically noted in his book, two and even three times the size of a .062 K-wire, and that\u2019s in Dr. Hansen\u2019s book ....\u201d Wilshire further testified that, contrary to Hansen\u2019s testimony that arthrodesis was inadvisable, Hansen\u2019s textbook indicated that he had performed arthrodesis to correct clawed toes, and had done so using screws far larger than the .062 inch K-wire used by Quebedeaux to fuse the joints.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b614 However, Hansen\u2019s textbook had not been identified by the defense during discovery as a basis for Wilshire\u2019s opinions. Willings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>had requested by interrogatory that the defense \u201cidentify all literature, including ... journals, texts or treatises upon which the Defendant intends to rely for any issue in this case.\u201d None of Quebedeaux\u2019s answers, including supplemental answers, identified Hansen\u2019s textbook. Quebedeaux\u2019s expert witness disclosure identified Wilshire and cited to two medical textbooks on which he would rely, but did not include Hansen\u2019s textbook. At his deposition, Wilshire was questioned extensively about the literature on which he intended to rely, and was served with a subpoena duces tecum requiring him to produce at the deposition each \u201cwriting, article, treatise, text or written authority\u201d upon which he relied, but Hansen\u2019s textbook was neither mentioned nor produced. Quebedeaux\u2019s list of witnesses and exhibits, which ultimately became part of the pretrial order, listed 34 exhibits, but Hansen\u2019s textbook was not listed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b615 Unable to recall during Wilshire\u2019s testimony whether Hansen\u2019s textbook had been previously disclosed, Willings\u2019 counsel checked the disclosures after trial had recessed for that day. Discovering that it had never been disclosed, Willings\u2019 counsel raised the issue prior to closing argument, notifying the District Court that Hansen\u2019s textbook had not been disclosed prior to trial. Willings\u2019 counsel noted that the textbook remained on defense counsel\u2019s table and requested that Quebedeaux\u2019s counsel be prohibited from referencing Hansen\u2019s textbook during closing arguments. Quebedeaux\u2019s counsel acknowledged that the textbook had not been disclosed and agreed not to refer to the book, but argued that he could still reference Wilshire\u2019s testimony about Hansen\u2019s book, to which Willings\u2019 counsel objected. The court then essentially ruled in Willings\u2019 favor, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">I\u2019m going to prohibit any reference to the textbook which you\u2019ve already agreed to. I\u2019m going to prohibit any reference by way of testimony of this one doctor about materials in that textbook. He can talk about the treatment. Also he can\u2019t refer back to that textbook. You cannot use him to refer back to that textbook.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b616 Nonetheless, Quebedeaux\u2019s counsel made the following statement during closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">My sense is they\u2019re going to be putting a lot of distance between themselves and Sigvard Hansen after he was truly exposed for what he was going to do, and his own credibility for the type of the surgeries he was recommending; in addition to the fact that <em>Dr. Wilshire told you that Sigvard Hansen also does arthrodesis. He also does arthrodesis. And he uses screws that are two to three times larger than the K-Wire ....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>(Emphasis added.) At that point, Willings\u2019 counsel objected: \u201cI object. There is no evidence of that, and we addressed it in the discussion prior to the closing arguments. And I would not normally interrupt a closing argument, but that\u2019s a direct violation of the Court\u2019s admonition.\u201d However, the District Court responded: \u201cWell, I think you\u2019ll have to address it in your closing argument.\u201d Willings\u2019 counsel did not mention the comment during his rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b617 The jury found in favor of Quebedeaux. After trial, Willings moved for a new trial, asserting that the defense had made numerous misrepresentations about the content of Hansen\u2019s textbook, including the frequency with which Hansen actually recommends arthrodesis and Hansen\u2019s method for fixing clawed toes. Hansen submitted an affidavit after the trial averring that the content of his textbook had been misrepresented by Wilshire and Quebedeaux\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b618 The District Court denied Willings\u2019 motion. They appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a M. R. Civ. P. 59 motion for a new trial on the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lopez v. Josephson, </em>2001 MT 133, \u00b6 16, 305 Mont. 446, 30 P.3d 326. The decision to grant or deny a new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of that discretion. Lopez, \u00b6 16. \u201cThe standard requires that the abuse of discretion be so significant as to materially affect the substantial rights of the complaining party.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\u00b620 Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion by denying Willings\u2019 motion for a new trial, which was based on asserted misrepresentations of an undisclosed textbook by defense counsel during closing arguments in violation of the court\u2019s order?</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">\u00b621 Willings argue that defense counsel\u2019s reference to Wilshire\u2019s testimony about Hansen\u2019s textbook during closing arguments warrants a new trial pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 25-11-102(1), (3), and (4), MCA, and that the District Court abused its discretion in denying their motion. They assert that the textbook\u2019s content was misrepresented by Wilshire during his testimony. Hansen\u2019s textbook had not been disclosed as an exhibit or at any time during discovery, and Willings argue that the disclosure during trial caught them by surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u00b622 In its order denying Willings\u2019 motion for a new trial, the District Court reasoned that \u201c[n]o reference was made by Defendant in closing about the textbook at issue. The argument made was factual and appropriate matter for Plaintiffs\u2019 rebuttal closing. Plaintiffs extrapolate argument beyond its context at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b623 Section 25-11-102, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">The former verdict or other decision may be vacated and a new trial granted on the application of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">(1) irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">(3) accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">(4) newly discovered evidence material for the party making the application which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Willings argue that all three bases for a new trial exist because: (1) Quebedeaux \u201cintroduced and mischaracterized an influential textbook which had not been disclosed prior to trial...;\u201d (2) \u201c[cjounsel for Plaintiff was surprised by the discussion and could not have done more to guard against that surprise considering repeated requests ... for identification of literature that would be relied upon;\u201d and (3) \u201cit was only after trial that counsel was in a position to review the textbook and consult with its author to determine that its contents had actually been misrepresented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">\u00b624 Quebedeaux responds that the Wilshire\u2019s testimony from Hansen\u2019s textbook was referenced \u201conly briefly\u201d in closing argument and defense counsel did not mention the textbook itself. Quebedeaux argues that a motion for new trial should only be granted in the case of \u201crepeated, egregious conduct by counsel,\u201d and defense counsel\u2019s action in the present case did not \u201crise to the level of \u2018blatant\u2019 or \u2018systematic\u2019 conduct requiring reversal.\u201d Moreover, Quebedeaux argues the reference to the material in Hansen\u2019s textbook during closing was not prejudicial and did not affect the outcome of the case, because Wilshire\u2019s opinion was supported by other treatises besides Hansen\u2019s textbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">\u00b625 We addressed the nature of surprise and the impact upon the trial necessary to warrant a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102(3), MCA, in <em>Buhr </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>v. Flathead County, </em>268 Mont. 223, 886 P.2d 381 (1994) (overruled on other grounds).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant thereto, we agree with Willings that they were surprised in the trial through no fault of their own, the facts were material to the outcome, they moved promptly for relief, and acted reasonably to remedy the problem. Quebedeaux argues that Willings waived their objection by failing to object during Wilshire\u2019s testimony, but Willings are not challenging the surprise testimony as much as they are challenging the defense\u2019s failure to heed the District Court\u2019s ruling entered to ameliorate the effect of the surprise testimony. Willings raised the issue before closing arguments, asking the court-not to strike the testimony from the jury s consideration-but to prohibit references in closing arguments to the textbook or testimony related to the textbook. The District Court granted that relief, but defense counsel violated that order. The violation of the court\u2019s order leads to another statutory basis for new trial, an \u201cirregularity in the proceedings\u201d preventing a fair trial pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA. Beyond the initial surprise, Willings also sustained the loss of the mid-trial remedy they had requested and obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b626 Although Quebedeaux argues that the violation consisted only of a brief comment, defense counsel\u2019s few words were well placed. He referred to the arthrodesis techniques Hansen describes in the textbook, implied to the jury that Hansen regularly performed arthrodesis on patients with Willing\u2019s condition, and in doing so used fixation devices three times the size of the K-wires Quebedeaux had used. Quebedeaux\u2019s argument that Willings were not prejudiced by the violation of the District Court\u2019s order because Wilshire\u2019s testimony was supported by other treatises fails to acknowledge the advantage obtained by the defense in offering Hansen\u2019s own work. Contradicting an expert\u2019s testimony, not by another\u2019s opinion, but by the expert\u2019s own writings, isa significant trial development with potentially devastating impact to the side offering that expert\u2019s opinion. Here, the testimony about Hansen\u2019s textbook directly contradicted Hansen\u2019s videotaped deposition testimony. Defense counsel found it irresistible to argue to the jury that Hansen \u201calso does arthrodesis ... [a]nd he uses screws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>that are two to three times larger than the K-Wire.\u201d The only source for these statements was Hansen\u2019s textbook, forcing Willings\u2019 counsel to object on the ground that \u201c[tjhere is no evidence of that, and we addressed it in the discussion prior to the closing arguments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u00b627 However, the District Court did not intervene. Requiring the Willings to respond to the defense comments during their closing rebuttal did nothing to resolve the prejudice to them, because they had nothing to respond with. The failure to disclose the textbook had deprived Willings of the opportunity to provide counter evidence during the trial, or to prepare cross examination about the textbook, leaving them with nothing to argue in rebuttal to defense counsel\u2019s closing. Only after the trial did they have the opportunity to summon resources in opposition to Wilshire\u2019s surprise testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u00b628  We believe the reference to the textbook was significant and that Willings were denied a fair trial by its surprise use, by the defense\u2019s violation of the court\u2019s order prohibiting further references, and by the District Court\u2019s failure to enforce its order upon Willings\u2019 counsel\u2019s objection during closing argument. We conclude the District Court manifestly abused its discretion by denying Willings\u2019 motion for a new trial. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> Willing was referred to Dr. Sigvard Hansen for evaluation by Dr. Peter Hanson following Willing\u2019s partial toe amputation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-5\"> Under <em>Buhr, </em>a party moving for a new trial under this subsection must show that: \u201c1) the moving party was actually surprised; 2) the facts causing the surprise had a material bearing on the case; 3) the verdict or decision resulted mainly from these facts; 4) the surprise did not result from the moving party\u2019s inattention or negligence; 5) the moving party acted promptly and claimed relief at the earliest opportunity; 6) the moving party used every means reasonably available at the time of the surprise to remedy it; and 7) the result of a new trial without the surprise would probably be different.\u201d <em>Buhr, </em>268 Mont. at 253, 886 P.2d at 399.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
