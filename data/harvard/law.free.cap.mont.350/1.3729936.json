(Liberty) appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>from the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s (WCC) March 27, 2008 order granting Dildine\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Liberty\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the WCC have jurisdiction to decide the issue of whether Dildine\u2019s counsel was entitled to attorney fees under <em>LockhartI</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">\u00b64 2. Did the work of Dildine\u2019s attorney lead to the payment of medical benefits to Dildine?</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\u00b65 Appellants also raise the issue of whether we should overrule our prior decision in <em>Lockhart v. New Hampshire Ins. </em>Co., 1999 MT 205, 295 Mont. 467, 984 P.2d 744 (holding that medical benefits recovered due to the efforts of an attorney in a workers\u2019 compensation case are benefits to which an attorney fee lien can attach). As is evident from the analysis below, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\u00b66 Both parties agree to the following stipulated facts, as contained in the WCC decision. Dildine was employed as a laundry worker by Hospital Laundry Services (HLS) in Billings, Montana. HLS was enrolled under Compensation Plan II of the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (MWCA) and was insured by Appellant Liberty. In March 2005, Dildine\u2019s employer filed a \u201cMontana First Report of Injury\u201d on her behalf. The section describing the accident provided \u201cRobin L. Dildine has pain in her left shoulder that has been going on for a while, but it has gotten worse. The repetitive use of her arm and muscles has caused tears in the rot[]ary cu[ff] of her left arm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">\u00b67 Liberty denied Dildine\u2019s claim in March 2005 in a letter from Liberty\u2019s adjuster, Chris Helmer (Helmer). Dildine filed a pro se request for mediation and a mediation conference was held in June 2005. That same month, Dildine retained attorney Paul Toennis to represent her. The Department of Labor and Industry (DOL) approved his attorney retainer agreement. Then in August 2005, Dildine retained attorney James Edmiston (Edmiston) and Toennis withdrew as Dildine\u2019s counsel. DOL also approved Edmiston\u2019s attorney retainer agreement. Later that month, Edmiston sent an initial letter to Liberty\u2019s adjuster, Helmer, which contained another claim for compensation for Dildine\u2019s \u201cleft shoulder, low back, CTS\u201d as a result of \u201crepetitive injury.\u201d Edmiston and Helmer exchanged additional correspondence regarding the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\u00b68 Edmiston next filed a \u201cPetition for Hearing\u201d with the WCC on Dildine\u2019s behalf, alleging Dildine suffered an injury arising out of, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>in the course of, her employment with HLS. The petition requested, in part, that Liberty pay medical benefits under the MWCA and requested that Liberty pay attorney fees, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-611, - 612, MCA. Edmiston also sent a letter to Liberty regarding the applicability of an attorney fee lien, pursuant to <em>Lockhart (Lockhart </em>lien). <em>Lockhart, </em>1999 MT 205, 295 Mont. 467, 984 P.2d 744. After originally disputing the claim, arguing it was an occupational disease, Liberty accepted liability for Dildine\u2019s claim. In doing so, Liberty stated its decision was based on discussions between Respondent\u2019s counsel and Helmer, and was also in light of the WCC\u2019s decision in <em>Mack v. Montana State Fund, </em>2005 MTWCC 48. Thus, because Liberty assumed liability for the claim, the only remaining issue concerned the payment of attorney fees to Edmiston. The parties submitted the issue of attorney fees, on agreed facts, to the WCC. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment and, in March 2008, the WCC ruled in favor of Dildine and awarded her <em>Lockhart </em>attorney fees. Liberty now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b69 Our standard of review of the WCC\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment is de novo. <em>Pinnow v. Montana State Fund, </em>2007 MT 332, \u00b6 13, 340 Mont. 217, 172 P.3d 1273. Whether a court has jurisdiction over the parties or the subject matter is a legal conclusion, which we review de novo, to determine whether it is correct. <em>Pinnow, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Gamble v. Sears, </em>2007 MT 131, \u00b6 20, 337 Mont. 354, 160 P.3d 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u00b610 <em>Did the WCC have jurisdiction to decide the issue of whether Dildine\u2019s counsel was entitled to attorney fees under Lockhart?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\u00b611 Liberty argues the WCC is a court of limited jurisdiction, only possessing the powers specifically conferred upon it by statute and therefore, because the statutes in effect at the time of Dildine\u2019s claim did not grant it specific jurisdiction over attorney fee disputes, the WCC lacked jurisdiction to award Edmiston attorney fees. According to Liberty, \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-611, -612, MCA (2003), govern the issue of attorney fees in this case. Liberty argues that these statutes \u201cdo not authorize the WCC to award <em>Lockhart </em>attorney fees and expressly prohibit[] an award of attorney fees under any theory in law or equity not expressly set forth in the attorney fee statutes; they overrule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>Lockhart.\u201d </em>Liberty concludes that \u201c[t]his Court should hold the WCC\u2019s jurisdiction to award attorney fees is strictly limited by the attorney fee statutes and that under those statutes it does not have jurisdiction to award <em>Lockhart </em>attorney fees <em>...\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b612 Dildine argues the WCC has exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the attorney fee dispute, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, and that \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-611, -612, MCA, are not the applicable statutes. She argues \u201c[t]here is a difference between the WCC enforcing a lien for attorney fees based upon an \u2018Attorney Retainer Agreement\u2019 approved by the [DOL] and this Court\u2019s <em>Lockhart </em>decision, and the WCC making an award of attorney[] fees pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-611 or -612, MCA, when a case is <em>adjudicated\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Dildine asserts \u201cLiberty is confusing the difference between these two concepts... which leads Liberty to the incorrect conclusion that the WCC had no subject matter jurisdiction to \u2018award\u2019 attorney fees under the <em>Lockhart </em>decision\u201d (emphasis omitted). Dildine argues the statutes do not apply because they clearly pertain to situations where there was \u201can award of additional attorney fees against the insurer by the court when cases have been <em>adjudicated </em>by the court at hearing... whereas <em>Lockhart </em>deals with the attachment of an attorney fee[] lien upon the claimant\u2019s medical benefits when those medical benefits have been initially denied by insurers and subsequently recovered by the claimant\u2019s attorney.\u201d Dildine also emphasizes that Liberty is not required to pay any additional money, but rather the <em>Lockhart </em>lien only requires that Liberty pay Dildine the 20% out of her own medical benefits that Liberty has already agreed to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b613 The WCC\u2019s jurisdiction is set out in \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA. That section provides that, upon satisfaction of the chapter\u2019s dispute resolution requirements and excluding certain exceptions not at issue here, \u201cthe workers\u2019 compensation judge has exclusive jurisdiction to make determinations concerning disputes under chapter 71 ....\u201d According to this Court in <em>Lockhart, </em>\u201cit is well settled that attorney fee liens attach to all compensation upon the filing of an attorney retainer agreement with the Department of Labor and Industry.\u201d <em>Lockhart, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>Kelleher Law Office v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>213 Mont 412, 416, 691 P.2d 823, 825 (1984)). And the term \u201ccompensation\u201d includes medical benefits paid. <em>Lockhart, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b614 <em>In Kelleher </em>this Court held that the jurisdiction of the WCC goes beyond \u201cthe minimum determination of the benefits payable to an employee\u201d and, furthermore, the \u201cextended jurisdictional authority of the [WCC] includes payment of attorney[] fees and related costs.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>Kelleher, </em>213 Mont. at 415, 691 P.2d at 824-25. In <em>Pinnow, </em>this Court reaffirmed the holding in <em>Kelleher </em>and held the WCC has jurisdiction to decide a question regarding attorney fees. <em>Pinnow, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b615  The \u201cAttorney Retainer Agreement\u201d drafted by the DOL and signed by Dildine and Edmiston provides that Edmiston\u2019s attorney fee shall be taken from \u201cthe amount of additional compensation payments the claimant receives due to the efforts of the attorney.\u201d An attorney fee lien is created by \u00a7 37-61-420(2), MCA, and attaches to all compensation benefits, including medical benefits, upon the filing of an attorney retainer agreement with the DOL. <em>Kelleher, </em>213 Mont. at 416, 691 P.2d at 825 (1984). The WCC has jurisdiction to decide a <em>Lockhart </em>lien issue because it is a dispute pertaining to benefits as contemplated in \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA. The attorney fee at issue is simply 20% of the medical compensation benefits already owed to Dildine. Thus, it is clear that the issue of payment of Edmiston\u2019s attorney fee is within the WCC\u2019s jurisdiction to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b616 Liberty also argues that \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA (2003), governs the instant case. We disagree. This statute applies to a situation where an insurer denies liability for a claim and \u201cthe claim is later adjudged compensable by the workers\u2019 compensation court....\u201d Here, Dildine\u2019s claim was not adjudged compensable by the WCC. Rather, Liberty accepted liability for the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b617 Because we conclude the WCC had jurisdiction to determine the issue of attorney fees, the remaining issue is whether the actions of Dildine\u2019s attorney led to the payment of medical benefits, as prescribed by <em>Lockhart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b618 <em>Did the work of Dildine\u2019s attorney lead to the payment of medical benefits to Dildine?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\u00b619 Liberty argues there are two conflicting standards contained within the <em>Lockhart </em>decision-one basing the attorney fee on the \u201cbenefits recovered due to the efforts of the attorney\u201d and the other basing the fee on the \u201camount of disputed medical benefits ultimately paid by the insurer.\u201d Liberty seems to argue, although it is not entirely clear, that Dildine is not entitled to attorney fees under either of these \u201cstandards,\u201d which, according to Liberty, are distinct. In reaching this conclusion, Liberty asserts Dildine is not entitled to attorney fees under the \u201cefforts of the attorney\u201d standard because \u201cLiberty accepted liability based on its own examination of the facts and case law\u201d (as opposed to efforts by Edmiston). Liberty argues Dildine is also not entitled to attorney fees under the standard of \u201cmedical benefits paid while there is a Department attorney fee agreement on file and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>approved\u201d because this standard is \u201cirrespective of the efforts of the attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b620 Dildine counters stating that her \u201cmedical benefits were obtained through her attorney\u2019s efforts, and he is entitled to charge the standard fee for those efforts based upon the approved Attorney Retainer Agreement.\u201d Dildine further argues that <em>\u201cLockhart </em>and the standard [DOL] approved attorney retainer agreement provide that receipt of attorney!] fees is contingent upon denial by the insurer of medical benefits which are then obtained due to the efforts of the attorney.\u201d Dildine concludes, \u201c[t]hat is exactly what occurred here, and the WCC was correct in finding those facts.\u201d Dildine further argues \u201cLiberty wants the attorney\u2019s right to charge fees to hinge <em>not </em>upon the attorney\u2019s efforts, but upon the insurer\u2019s motivations for first denying medical benefits.... The insurer\u2019s motivations are not a proper basis for deciding the attorney\u2019s entitlement to a fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b621 Edmiston\u2019s efforts in this case included corresponding with Helmer regarding Dildine\u2019s claims and providing him with the necessary information and documents, filing a petition for hearing with the WCC when Liberty denied Dildine\u2019s claim and corresponding with Liberty regarding the applicability of a <em>Lockhart </em>lien. Additionally, the stipulated facts state that \u201cRespondent accepted liability for Petitioner\u2019s claim, stating that its decision was based on discussions between Respondent\u2019s counsel and its claims adjuster, Helmer, and in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mack.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b622  Liberty attempts to argue that its reversal of its initial denial of Dildine\u2019s claim was not based on any efforts by Edmiston but rather \u201con its own examination of the facts and case law.\u201d We find this argument to be without merit and hold that Edmiston\u2019s efforts, if not exclusively then largely, led to Liberty\u2019s acceptance of liability for Dildine\u2019s claim. Liberty also analogizes the current facts to <em>Montana Contractor Comp. Fund v. Liberty Northwest Insur. Corp. (Rusco), </em>2003 MTWCC 54, \u00a7 24, where the WCC held that it was \u201cnot persuaded that the contribution of the claimant\u2019s attorneys was anything more than initiating a process ... and setting in motion a claim investigation necessary to determine liability and the benefits due claimant.\u201d Liberty made this same argument before the WCC and the WCC found that \u201c[ujnlike <em>Rusco, </em>it is clear that the efforts put forth by Edmiston in this case were more than simply \u2018initiating the process\u2019 or filling out the initial claim forms.\u201d We agree with the WCC that Edmiston\u2019s efforts went beyond just initiating a process or filling out claim forms. The WCC was correct in determining that, pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>to <em>Lockhart, </em>Edmiston was entitled to the 20% attorney fee currently being withheld by Liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b623 The WCC has jurisdiction to decide the issue of whether Dildine\u2019s counsel was entitled to attorney fees under <em>Lockhart. </em>Furthermore, it was the work of Dildine\u2019s attorney, rather than an independent decision by Liberty, which led to the payment of benefits to Dildine. Therefore, the District Court was correct in granting Dildine\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in denying Liberty\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b624 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b31-7\">JUSTICES RICE, NELSON, WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
