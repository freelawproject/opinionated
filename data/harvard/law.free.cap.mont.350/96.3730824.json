Wilkins appealed her conviction to the District Court for a trial de novo. She filed a motion to dismiss (later deemed a motion to suppress), arguing that the officer who stopped her did not have a particularized suspicion to justify the stop. The District Court denied her motion, concluding that the stop was justified both on the basis of particularized suspicion and under the community caretaker doctrine. Wilkins pleaded nolo contendere reserving the right to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b62 At approximately 1:30 a.m. on February 24,2007, Deputy Sheriff John Smith (\u201cOfficer Smith\u201d) was on patrol on North Frontage Road in Billings. Officer Smith noticed Wilkins\u2019s vehicle with its lights on parked halfway down a side street next to a salvage yard. The street on which Wilkins was parked, Scott Street, is a dark, remote street occupied mostly by industrial businesses, which were closed at that time. There are, however, a few houses in the area. Officer Smith drove past Wilkins\u2019s vehicle, and noticed that it was running. There were other vehicles parked on the street but none of them had lights on or were running.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b63 Officer Smith, who has 12 years of experience as a law enforcement officer, believed that Wilkins\u2019s vehicle was suspicious because it was unusual for a vehicle to be parked there with its lights on at that time of night, and burglaries had recently been committed in the area. Officer Smith was also concerned about the driver of the vehicle because it was a cold night, near or below freezing, and the vehicle was in a remote location. As a result of these concerns, Officer Smith stopped to investigate. Officer Smith approached Wilkins in her vehicle. While speaking to Wilkins, he smelled the odor of an alcoholic beverage and noticed that her speech was slurred. Officer Smith conducted a DUI investigation and arrested Wilkins for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u00b64 We review the denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous and whether it correctly applied the law to those findings. <em>State v. Graham, </em>2007 MT 358, \u00b6 10, 340 Mont. 366, 175 P.3d 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">\u00b65 Although the District Court concluded that the officer\u2019s encounter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>with Wilkins was justified due to the existence of particularized suspicion or justified under the community caretaker doctrine, we conclude that the Court reached the right result for the wrong reason.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak6\">\u00b66 Wilkins contends that there was no basis for particularized suspicion and that the community caretaker doctrine was not applicable. The State, on the other hand, contends that there is no need to analyze particularized suspicion or the caretaker doctrine since the District Court erred in the first instance in concluding that Wilkins was seized or stopped. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b67 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect persons from unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>State v. Hall, </em>2004 MT 106, \u00b6 8, 321 Mont. 78, 88 P.3d 1273. The inquiry into whether a \u201cseizure\u201d has occurred is the same under the federal and the Montana Constitutions. <em>State v. Case, </em>2007 MT 161, \u00b6 24, 338 Mont. 87, 162 P.3d 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b68 The United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>that \u201cnot all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u2018seizures\u2019 of persons. Only when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a \u2018seizure\u2019 has occurred.\u201d 392 U.S. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20 n. 16, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 1879 n. 16 (1968). \u201cThe central inquiry under the Fourth Amendment is the reasonableness under all the circumstances of a particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.\u201d <em>State v. Clayton, </em>2002 MT 67, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 215, 45 P.3d 30 (citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 19, 88 S. Ct. at 1878-79).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b69 To determine whether a \u201cseizure\u201d has occurred, this Court has followed the test set out by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 553-54, 100 S. Ct. 1870 (1980). <em>Clayton, </em>\u00b6 21. In <em>Mendenhall, </em>the Court concluded that \u201ca person has been \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d 446 U.S. at 554, 100 S. Ct. at 1877. The Court provided examples of circumstances that might indicate that a person was seized: \u201cthe threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u201d 446 U.S. at 554, 100 S. Ct. at 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b610 In his search and seizure treatise, Professor LaFave notes that, \u201cif an officer merely walks up to a person standing or sitting in a public place (or, indeed, who is seated in a vehicle located in a public place) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>and puts a question to him, this alone does not constitute a seizure. Wayne LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>vol. 4 \u00a7 9.4(a) 419-21 (4th ed. West 2004). Professor LaFave explains that, in order to make a basic inquiry, an officer may tap on the window of a car to get the person\u2019s attention or request that the person open the door or roll down the window without transforming the encounter into a seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b611 The Montana Supreme Court has not confronted the question of whether a person in a parked vehicle is necessarily seized when an officer stops behind the parked vehicle without activating the emergency lights on the patrol car and contacts the person in the vehicle. We did, however, hold in <em>Clayton </em>that a driver was not seized when an officer pulled up behind the driver\u2019s parked vehicle and shined a spotlight into his vehicle. <em>Clayton, </em>\u00b6 27. On the other hand, where an officer stops his or her patrol car behind a parked vehicle, activates the car\u2019s emergency lights, and then contacts the occupant of the parked vehicle, that person is seized because he would not feel free to leave. <em>Graham, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>State v. Reiner, </em>2003 MT 243, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 19, 317 Mont. 304, 77 P.3d 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b612 In the present case, the District Court concluded that a \u201cstop\u201d occurred because Wilkins \u201chad a reasonable belief that she was not free to leave Scott Street when [Officer] Smith approached her.\u201d In <em>Mendenhall, </em>the United States Supreme Court referenced certain factors as being indicative of a \u201cstop.\u201d Although the <em>Mendenhall, </em>factors are not exhaustive, we note that the District Court does not point to these factors or any other specific factors that support a finding of a seizure. Rather, our review of the record shows that officer Smith was the sole officer during the initial contact; he did not activate his emergency light, display a weapon or employ threatening tones. He simply approached Wilkins to find out why she was parked on a dark remote street late at night in cold weather.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b613 In <em>State v. Merrill, </em>2004 MT 169, \u00b6 3, 322 Mont. 47, 93 P.3d 1227 (2004), officers pulled over Merrill for making an improper lane change. Although Officer Hight was aware that the owner of the vehicle (not Merrill) was suspected of involvement with drugs, he gave Merrill a verbal warning and told her she was free to leave. As he stepped away from the car, Officer Hight noticed that Merrill was acting unusually nervous. Hight then asked Merrill if he could talk to her for a minute. She agreed. He then asked if he could search her car and her person. Again she agreed, and Hight discovered drugs. Merrill contended that Hight\u2019s questioning of her following his verbal warning about the traffic violation constituted an unlawful seizure of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>person; that no reasonable person would have felt free to leave with the patrol car\u2019s lights flashing and an armed officer on either side of her car. We agreed with Merrill that Hight had completed his investigation of the traffic offense. At that point, the investigatory stop had concluded. \u201cWhat followed, however, was neither a subsequent investigatory stop nor an extension of the first one. Rather, the subsequent encounter was a voluntary exchange, and no precept of law prevents an officer from engaging a citizen in such voluntary conversations.\u201d <em>Merrill, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b614 Here, the facts are less intimidating than those in <em>Merrill </em>and <em>Clayton </em>wherein we concluded that there was no seizure. Officer Smith did not initiate the stop of Wilkins\u2019s vehicle. She was already parked on a public road. He did nothing to impede her liberty by means of physical force or show of authority-he did not have his emergency lights or sirens on, nor did he shine a spotlight into her car. As in <em>Merrill, </em>he engaged Wilkins in a voluntary exchange. A reasonable person in Wilkins\u2019s situation would not have concluded that she was not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b615  We conclude, based upon a review of the record, that Officer Smith\u2019s contact with Wilkins, who was already stopped in a public place, did not amount to a seizure. Accordingly, Officer Smith did not have to have a particularized suspicion to justify the contact. In speaking to Wilkins, her slurred speech and the odor of alcohol led him to initiate a DUI investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b124-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
