We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b62 The State charged Child with three counts of vehicular homicide and one count of perjury. Child pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b63 On May 1, 2008, the District Court issued an Omnibus Order which was signed by defense counsel and the county attorney. The Omnibus Order set forth the following briefing schedule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">BRIEFING SCHEDULE AND MOTION HEARING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Dk\">All motions and issues identified herein which have not been resolved at the Omnibus hearing shall be addressed at a motion hearing which will take place on the <em>8^_ </em>day of September. 2008, commencing at the time of <em>2:30 </em>o\u2019clock <em>g.m. </em>Counsel anticipate that the time (hours or minutes) needed for the hearing is <em>2-3 hours. </em>Prior to the hearing, the parties shall file motions and briefs as follows: <em>Motions hearing to be held in Lewistown.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">Motions and briefs due on or before <em>July 29, 2008 </em>Responsive briefs due on or before <em>August 15, 2008 </em>Reply briefs due on or before <em>September 2, 2008</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">(_) (checked if applicable) If either counsel wishes to file any motion, the same shall be filed with sufficient time to allow full briefing and oral argument of such motion(s) to take place at least one week before trial. In this case, the time periods allowed by the Uniform District Court Rules shall apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">\u00b64 On June 27, 2008, Child filed a Motion to Dismiss alleging that the State failed to secure evidence in violation of his right to due process. On August 4, 2008, the State filed its response brief opposing the motion to dismiss. On August 7,2008, the District Court issued an order granting the motion to dismiss, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">Apparently, a Motion To Dismiss was filed on June 27, 2008. A Response was received by this Court dated August 1, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">Pursuant to Rule 2, U. Dist. Ct. R., \u201c[flailure to file an answer brief by the adverse party within ten days shall be deemed an admission that the motion is well taken.\u201d Rule 2(b), U. Dist. Ct. R[.] (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">\u00b65 On August 19, 2008, the State filed a Motion to Alter or Amend the Order of Dismissal, arguing that the District Court erred in dismissing the case pursuant to Uniform District Court Rule 2. The State pointed out that the court failed to consider that its Omnibus Order established a specific briefing schedule and that the State\u2019s brief was timely filed under the District Court\u2019s schedule; the order required that responsive briefs were \u201cdue on or before August 15,2008,\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>State had filed its response on August 4, 2008. The State explained that the Omnibus Order provided two alternatives regarding the filing of briefs. The first alternative, the one chosen by the court, set forth actual due dates for the briefs. The second alternative did not provide specific dates but provided that \u201cperiods allowed by the Uniform District Court Rules shall apply.\u201d The State contended that since the District Court had not chosen the second alternative, the application of the time periods set forth in the Uniform District Court Rules did not apply. The State requested that the court correct the error prior to expiration of the State\u2019s time for filing an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b66 The District Court, on August 19, 2008, issued an order recognizing the error and ruled that \u201cthe Order granting the Motion [t]o Dismiss is Rescinded.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b67 On August 20, 2008, Child filed a request for a hearing and argued that the court did not err when it granted the motion to dismiss and, further, that once the court granted the motion to dismiss, it did not have jurisdiction to reinstate the Information; that the State\u2019s only remedy was to file an appeal of the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b68 Since the State\u2019s time for appeal was fast approaching, the State could not wait for a decision from the District Court as to whether it had jurisdiction. Accordingly, on August, 26, 2008, the State filed its notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s August 7, 2008 order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b69 Child argues that the Omnibus Order\u2019s requirement that briefs be filed \u201con or before\u201d certain dates is not inconsistent with the requirement of Uniform District Court Rule 2 that responsive briefs are due within ten business days of the initial brief. In other words, a responsive brief would be due \u201cbefore\u201d the dates specified in the Omnibus Order when so required by Rule 2. We find this argument to be too facile. It would render the dates set in the Omnibus Order meaningless. If, as Child suggests, the court intended that Uniform District Court Rule 2 applied, then the court would not have set specific dates. Rather, it would have chosen the second alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"AeQ\">\u00b610  In light of the clear provisions of the District Court\u2019s Omnibus Order, the court erred in granting Child\u2019s motion to dismiss when the State failed to respond within the 10-day time frame set forth in Uniform District Court Rule 2. The briefing dates set forth in the Omnibus Order required that response briefs be filed on or before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>August 15, 2008, and the State\u2019s response brief was timely filed on August 4, 2008. Since the District Court did not choose the second alternate briefing schedule under the Omnibus Order, the Uniform Rules had no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b611 The District Court\u2019s August 7,2008 order of dismissal is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b396-5\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b396-6\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AVD\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b612 In my view, this appeal could have been dismissed under M. R. App. P. 12(l)f., which requires the argument section of the appellant\u2019s brief to \u201ccontain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, <em>with citations to the authorities, </em>statutes, and pages of the record relied on\u201d (emphasis added). Here, the State\u2019s argument in its opening brief consists of three paragraphs, none of which contains any citation to authority. Similarly, in its reply brief, the State goes on for six pages responding to arguments made by Child in his response brief-arguments which Child supports with citations to authorities-and although the State cites two cases, the State then (erroneously) characterizes those cases as distinguishable from the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b613 Time and again, the State has criticized defendants for failing to cite authority in support of their arguments and has asked this Court not to consider such arguments. <em>See e.g. State v. Condo, </em>2008 MT 114, \u00b6 20, 342 Mont. 468, 182 P.3d 57 (\u201cFurther, the State argues that we should simply not address Condo\u2019s claims under Article II, Section 25 because Condo has failed to properly support his argument with any relevant authority or legal analysis.\u201d); <em>State v. Gomez, </em>2007 MT 111, \u00b6 31, 337 Mont. 219, 158 P.3d 442 (\u201cCiting M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4), the State contends that Gomez\u2019s arguments are insufficiently supported with authority and that this Court should decline to consider the arguments.\u201d); <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 23, 309 Mont. 199, 44 P.3d 499 (\u201cThe State asserts that, as a consequence of Peterson\u2019s failure ... to cite authority on appeal, we should not consider this argument on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u00b614 As the State is well aware, \u201c[t]he appellant bears the burden to establish error by a district court,\u201d and \u201c[t]he appellant must establish such error with legal authority.\u201d <em>State v. Giddings, </em>2009 MT 61, \u00b6 69, 349 Mont. 347, 208 P.3d 363 (citing <em>State v. Bailey, </em>2004 MT 87, \u00b6 26, 320 Mont. 501, 87 P.3d 1032). The State should be expected to conduct itself pursuant to the same rules which the State consistently invokes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>against defendants filing appeals before this Court. Applying those rules here, this appeal should be dismissed. <em>See In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 7, 311 Mont. 175, 53 P.3d 1266 (\u201c[W]e hereby dismiss [Appellant\u2019s] appeal for failing to comply with the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure and affirm the decision of the District Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b615 That said, the Court has decided to address the merits of the State\u2019s appeal. While I agree with the Court that the District Court erred in granting Child\u2019s motion to dismiss based on Rule 2(b) of the Uniform District Court Rules (Title 25, chapter 19, MCA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I write separately to note the District Court\u2019s additional error in attempting to \u201crescind\u201d its dismissal order-an action which led to otherwise unnecessary expenditures of time and resources by the parties, not to mention avoidable delay in bringing Child to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b616 On May 16, 2008, the District Court issued an Omnibus Order which stated, among other things, that motions and briefs were due on or before July 29 and that responsive briefs were due on or before August 15. On June 27, Child filed a motion to dismiss this case \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d On August 4, the State filed a response. On August 7, the District Court entered an Order on Motion to Dismiss, stating: \u201cThe Motion To Dismiss is Granted.\u201d Although the court did not state explicitly that the case was being dismissed \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d dismissal with prejudice was clearly the outcome of the court\u2019s order, given that Child\u2019s motion specifically requested dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d and given that the court\u2019s order specifically granted Child\u2019s motion without qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b617 Next, on August 19, the State filed a \u201cMotion to Alter or Amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Order of Dismissal,\u201d arguing that the District Court\u2019s decision \u201cis in error\u201d and requesting that the court \u201cfix its mistake.\u201d The court then entered an order on August 19 purporting to \u201crescind\u201d its August 7 Order on Motion to Dismiss. Thereafter, over the next couple of weeks, Child filed a Response to State\u2019s Motion to Alter or Amend and several supporting briefs, while the State filed corresponding responses. Among other things, Child argued that the District Court lacked authority to rescind its dismissal order and reinstate the Information. He was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b618 When a criminal case is dismissed with prejudice, the dismissed information is no longer effective against the defendant and cannot be reinstated. <em>State ex rel. Torres v. District Court, </em>265 Mont. 445, 453, 877 P.2d 1008, 1012 (1994); <em>State v. Onstad, </em>234 Mont. 487, 490, 764 P.2d 473, 475 (1988). While a district court may correct clerical errors to make the record speak the truth of what was actually decided, the court may not change what was originally intended. <em>Torres, </em>265 Mont. at 453, 877 P.2d at 1012. Thus, in the present case, the District Court\u2019s purported \u201crescission\u201d of its dismissal order in an attempt to reinstate the Information was, in reality, \u201c \u2018a reversal of the court\u2019s decision on the motion to dismiss and [was] not permissible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Torres, </em>265 Mont. at 453, 877 P.2d at 1012-13 (quoting <em>Onstad, </em>234 Mont. at 490, 764 P.2d at 475).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b619 Likewise, the State\u2019s \u201cMotion to Alter or Amend Order of Dismissal\u201d was improper. As we stated in <em>Torres: </em>\u201c[0]n the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the information with prejudice on motion of the defendant, the appropriate remedy for the State was to appeal, not to request reconsideration of the court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Torres, </em>265 Mont. at 453, 877 P.2d at 1013 (citing \u00a7 46-20-103(2)(a), MCA, and <em>Onstad, </em>234 Mont. at 489-90, 764 P.2d at 475).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b620 As it turns out, although the District Court purported to reinstate the Information, the State prudently chose to err on the side of caution and file a notice of appeal, perhaps recognizing that the District Court\u2019s \u201crescission\u201d order was legally invalid. Thus, the State is now before us in the correct procedural posture; and, as noted, I concur in the Court\u2019s decision to reverse the District Court\u2019s August 7, 2008 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>order of dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b621 For these reasons, I specially concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> Child contends that the District Court could not \u201coverrule\u201d Rule 2(b)\u2019s filing deadlines; however, Child has not explained how the District Court\u2019s briefing schedule was in \u201cconflict\u201d with Rule 2(b). <em>See </em>Uniform District Court Rule 15 (\u201cNothing in these rules shall be construed as limiting the power of the district courts from promulgating rules that do not conflict with these rules.\u201d). Rule 2(b) merely states, in relevant part, that \u201c[flailure to file an answer brief by the adverse party within ten days shall be deemed an admission that the motion is well taken\u201d and \u201c[flailure to file briefs <em>may </em>subject the motion to summary ruling\u201d (emphasis added). Child cites no authority for the proposition that Rule 2(b) precludes a district court from considering an answer brief filed after the 10-day deadline or requires a district court to grant the motion based solely on the tardy filing of an answer brief. There is authority, however, for the contrary proposition. <em>See e.g. In re A.C., </em>2001 MT 126, \u00b6 25, 305 Mont. 404, 27 P.3d 960 (\u201cWe have interpreted Uniform District Court Rule 2 as allowing the trial court discretion to either grant or deny an unanswered motion.\u201d); <em>accord In re Marriage of Lundstrom and Scholz, </em>2007 MT 304, \u00b6 23, 340 Mont. 83, 172 P.3d 588; <em>State v. Loh, </em>275 Mont. 460, 466, 914 P.2d 592, 596 (1996); <em>State v. Fertterer, </em>260 Mont. 397, 400, 860 P.2d 151, 153 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-5\"> It is important to note that <em>Torres </em>involved a similar factual scenario: the district court dismissed the case with prejudice but then purported to rescind its dismissal order, <em>see Torres, </em>265 Mont. at 448, 877 P.2d at 1010. Yet, in contrast to the present case, we decided in <em>Torres </em>to remand the case to the district court \u201cfor entry of an order reinstating its [dismissal] order.\u201d <em>Torres, </em>265 Mont. at 453, 877 P.2d at 1013. This difference in outcomes derives from the differing procedural postures of the two cases: in <em>Torres, the defendant </em>appealed from the district court\u2019s <em>rescission order, </em>arguing that the district court had no authority to reinstate the information, and we agreed that the court did not have such authority, whereas here, <em>the State </em>is appealing from the District Court\u2019s <em>dismissal order, </em>arguing that the District Court erred in dismissing the charge under Rule 2(b) of the Uniform District Court Rules, and we agree that the court erred in doing so. A separate question arises where a dismissal with prejudice amounts, in substance, to an acquittal. The State could not appeal from such a dismissal, <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-20-103, MCA, and the State also could not re-file the charge, U.S. Const, amend V. Child, however, does not argue that the District Court\u2019s dismissal order constituted an acquittal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
