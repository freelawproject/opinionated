Anderson (Anderson) appeals from a partition order of the Seventeenth Judicial District Court, Valley County, that settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>interests in real property between Anderson and Nancy Lee Woodward (Woodward). The order determined that Anderson had gifted certain real property to Woodward. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that Anderson had gifted to Woodward real property located at 636 Mahon ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u00b64 Anderson filed suit against Woodward seeking partition of two separate real properties that the parties\u2019 had purchased during their eight-year relationship. The relationship began in January of 1999 and ended in February of 2007. The couple never married.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u00b65 Anderson and Woodward owned and lived in separate residences in Ridgecrest, California when their relationship began. Anderson moved into Woodward\u2019s California residence approximately six months after the relationship began. Anderson inherited his parents\u2019 home located at 511 Francis in Glasgow, Montana, when his father died in August of 2000. Anderson and Woodward began living half of the year at Anderson\u2019s Montana home and the other half of the year at Woodward\u2019s California home.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">\u00b66 Anderson and Woodward acquired as joint tenants a property adjacent to 511 Francis in August of 2004. Anderson and Woodward paid for 513 Francis with $10,000 borrowed from Anderson\u2019s home equity line of credit on the 511 Francis property. Anderson and Woodward agreed at the time of the purchase of 513 Francis that Woodward would clean up the property and pay for improvements to make it more attractive as a rental. Woodward also would pay $50 per month towards Anderson\u2019s loan until they were able to find tenants for the property. Anderson and Woodward planned to use the rental proceeds to pay off Anderson\u2019s loan. Woodward agreed to pay the real estate taxes. The agreement did not include payment for Woodward\u2019s labor in making improvements to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">\u00b67 Anderson and Woodward also acquired a property located at 636 Mahon in Glasgow in June of 2005. The deed listed the couple as joint tenants. Anderson paid $6,500 in cash for the property. The property is located within a block of the Francis Street properties and includes a house, shed, and garage. The house is uninhabitable. The property\u2019s current value is $5,300. The parties referred to the property as \u201cthe barn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">\u00b68 Anderson and Woodward separated in February of2007. Anderson filed an action for partition in October of 2007. Anderson sought partition of both 513 Francis and 636 Mahon. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>conducted a bench trial on May 29,2008. Anderson and Woodward each presented witnesses and other evidence. Both parties testified. The District Court considered detailed evidence of the relative contributions that Anderson and Woodward had made to 513 Francis, including acquisition costs, tax payments, and rental proceeds. The District Court distributed the 513 Francis property to Anderson and ordered him to pay Woodward $5,400 in recognition of Woodward\u2019s contributions to that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b69 The District Court also considered detailed evidence regarding 636 Mahon. Woodward testified that Anderson had bought the property as a gift for her. She testified that she had performed virtually all of the work on the property. Anderson attempted to rebut Woodward\u2019s testimony by cross-examining Woodward on her earlier statement at the pretrial conference that she \u201cassumed [636 Mahon] was a gift.\u201d Woodward responded that she had meant that she assumed that Anderson had told the truth when he told her that he bought the property for her as a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b610 Anderson testified that he had bought the property for Woodward \u201cto keep her busy.\u201d Anderson denied buying 636 Mahon as a gift for Woodward, although he admitted that he likely would have given Woodward the property as a gift if the couple had remained together. Anderson conceded that Woodward had paid property taxes for 636 Mahon until the couple separated. Anderson also conceded that Woodward had requested the tax bills for the property even after the couple\u2019s relationship had ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b611 The District Court admitted into evidence a series of e-mail correspondence between Anderson and Woodward from May of 2007. The e-mails included Anderson\u2019s statements that \u201cI bought the barn for you,\u201d and \u201cI thought I was being nice by letting you have the barn.\u201d The District Court determined that Woodward was the sole owner of 636 Mahon based on the fact that Anderson had gifted the property to her. The District Court ordered Anderson either to distribute the 636 Mahon property to Woodward as her sole property or pay Woodward $5,300 for the property within 30 days. Anderson appeals the District Court\u2019s partition of 636 Mahon.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact in an equitable action, including a partition action, to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Flood v. Kalinyaprak, </em>2004 MT 15, \u00b6 14, 319 Mont. 280, 84 P.3d 27; <em>In re Estate of Bradshaw, </em>2001 MT 92, \u00b6 11, 305 Mont. 178, 24 P.3d 211; M. R. Civ. P. 52(a). A finding is clearly erroneous if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>is not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been committed. <em>Talon v. State Dept. of Labor &amp; Industry, </em>2008 MT 376, \u00b6 20, 346 Mont. 499, 198 P.3d 213. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>In re Bradshaw, </em>\u00b6 11. The trial court determines the credibility of witnesses and the weight assigned to their respective testimony. <em>In re Bradshaw, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>Harding v. Savoy, </em>2004 MT 280, \u00b6 20, 323 Mont. 261, 100 P.3d 976. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Stearns, </em>2008 MT 356, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 348, 195 P.3d 794. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>Stearns, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that Anderson had gifted to Woodward real property located at 636 Mahon ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\u00b615 Anderson argues that the evidence does not support the District Court\u2019s determination that Anderson gifted 636 Mahon to Woodward. Anderson alleges that the trial record contains no evidence of a written transfer of636 Mahon from Anderson to Woodward. Anderson points to \u00a7 70-20-101, MCA, to support his contention that Montana law requires evidence of a written transfer for any transfer of real property by gift or otherwise. Anderson also argues that the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions contradict Montana\u2019s general law on gifts because the trial record is devoid of any evidence that Anderson had delivered 636 Mahon to Woodward as a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\u00b616  The District Court correctly stated that partition actions sound in equity. <em>See Flood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 21; \u00a7 70-29-209(2), MCA. The district court has \u201cgreat flexibility\u201d in a partition action in fashioning appropriate relief for the parties. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 17. The district court has the power to make compensatory adjustments between the respective parties according to the ordinary principles of equity. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing \u00a7 70-29-209(2), MCA). Partition actions should be fashioned to cause the least degree of harm to the cotenants and to confer no unfair advantage on any one cotenant. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">\u00b617  A rebuttable presumption exists that joint tenants own equal shares of the property. <em>See Flood, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>Rausch v. Hogan, </em>2001 MT 123, \u00b6 24, 305 Mont. 382, 28 P.3d 460; <em>Matter of Estate of Dern Family </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>Trust, </em>279 Mont. 138, 151-52, 928 P.2d 123, 131 (1997). When a party presents evidence of unequal contribution to an asset, however, the presumption shifts. Evidence of unequal contribution leads to the presumption that the cotenants own the asset in proportion to their contribution. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23, 28; <em>Dern Family Trust, </em>279 Mont. at 152-53, 928 P.2d at 132-33. The presumption where one contributes unequally to the purchase price does not necessarily apply \u201cwhere the relationship between the parties indicates that one might have intended to make a gift to the other.\u201d <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 23 (quoting <em>Dern Family Trust, </em>279 Mont. at 152, 928 P.2d at 132).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b618 The party who seeks to establish that the parties intended a division disproportionate to their contributions has the burden to demonstrate this intent. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23, 28; <em>Dern Family Trust, </em>279 Mont. at 151-53, 928 P.2d at 131-33. \u201c[A]ll relevant evidence of the parties\u2019 intent is admissible to sustain or rebut the presumptions.\u201d <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 23. The party may establish proof of a gift by parol evidence, such as conduct over the course of time, the relationship between the two parties, the sharing of expenses, labor, or any other admissible means. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-28; <em>Dern Family Trust, </em>279 Mont. at 151-53, 928 P.2d at 131-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\u00b619 The District Court allowed each party to introduce extensive evidence of the parties\u2019 intent as to 636 Mahon. The District Court concluded that Anderson was the sole owner of 636 Mahon. The District Court determined that Anderson had \u201covercome the presumption of joint ownership by proving a gift of this property.\u201d The District Court determined that Anderson\u2019s testimony regarding 636 Mahon was not credible \u201cin light of his acknowledgment in Exhibit 16 that he bought [636 Mahon] for [Woodward].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b620 Exhibit 16 consisted of a series of e-mail correspondences between Anderson and Woodward from May of 2007. The e-mails included discussions and arguments between the parties about how they should divide the various properties. The e-mails also contained personal accusations and recriminations. In the exchange emphasized by the District Court, Anderson stated to Woodward that he had bought the 513 Francis property and that he had put Woodward\u2019s name on the title because he thought that they would be together forever and that she should have the house \u201cif he went first.\u201d Anderson then declared \u201cI bought the barn for you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u00b621 Anderson argues that he sought to admit Exhibit 16 into evidence only to provide a more complete picture of the e-mail exchange after the District Court had admitted Woodward\u2019s Exhibit A over Anderson\u2019s objection. Exhibit A included selected e-mails from the May 2007 e-mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>correspondence. Woodward testified that she sought to admit the e-mails contained in Exhibit A in order to prove that Anderson had gifted 636 Mahon to her. She testified that she had included only a portion of the e-mails because of the ugly personal nature of the rest of the e-mails.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b622 Exhibit A included Anderson\u2019s statements that \u201cI bought the barn for you,\u201d and \u201cI thought I was being nice by letting you have the barn.\u201d Anderson argued that the e-mails were inadmissible as they constituted evidence of compromise made in anticipation of trial. Anderson contended that his statement that \u201cI bought 636 Mahon for you\u201d was \u201cnot the kind of statement that should be binding the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b623 Anderson does not mention that he testified about the statement he now disputes before Woodward sought to admit the statement into evidence. In Anderson\u2019s direct testimony, his counsel noted that \u201cthere\u2019s been some correspondence during the negotiation between you and Miss Woodward, and I believe some of that correspondence may state the words that you bought [636 Mahon] for her.\u201d Anderson\u2019s counsel then asked, \u201c[b]ut you didn\u2019t buy it for her to be a gift to her?\u201d Anderson responded that he had not bought the property as a gift for Woodward, but \u201cI did buy [636 Mahon] for her to keep her busy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b624 A district court possesses \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in its determination of what evidence is relevant and admissible. <em>State v. White, </em>2009 MT 26, \u00b6 7, 349 Mont. 109, 201 P.3d 808. The District Court in this partition action further possessed \u201cgreat flexibility\u201d in fashioning equitable relief for the parties. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 17. The e-mails between Anderson and Woodward constituted \u201crelevant evidence\u201d admissible to sustain or rebut the presumptions of ownership of joint tenants of property. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 23. The e-mails were evidence that the District Court properly could consider in determining whether the relationship between the parties indicated that Anderson \u201cmight have intended to make a gift\u201d to Woodward. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 23 (quoting <em>Dern Family Trust, </em>279 Mont. at 152, 928 P.2d at 132). We will not fault the District Court for using its \u201cbroad discretion\u201d and \u201cgreat flexibility\u201d to admit into evidence statements by Anderson to which Anderson himself earlier had testified. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 7; <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b625 The District Court considered extensive evidence and testimony from Woodward and Anderson regarding the parties\u2019 relationship, their conduct over the years, their labor toward improving the various properties, payment of taxes, sharing of expenses, and the parties\u2019 e-mail correspondence after the separation and before Anderson filed the partition action. <em>See Flood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-28; <em>Dern Family Trust, </em>279 Mont. at 151-53, 928 P.2d at 131-33. The District Court determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Woodward\u2019s version of events to be more credible than Anderson\u2019s version. The court further determined that Anderson had intended to gift the property to Woodward and that delivery of the property was complete before the parties\u2019 separation when Woodward accepted responsibility for the property and commenced payment of taxes on the property. The court thus concluded that Woodward had met her burden of rebutting the presumption that the couple held the property equally as joint tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b626 The District Court properly considered \u201call relevant evidence\u201d in considering whether Anderson had gifted 636 Mahon to Woodward. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 23. We review this evidence in the light most favorable to Woodward. <em>In re Bradshaw, </em>\u00b6 11. We will not disturb the District Court\u2019s determination that Anderson\u2019s testimony lacked credibility. <em>In re Bradshaw, </em>\u00b6 11. We are convinced, viewing the evidence in this light, that substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s partition of 636 Mahon. <em>Talon, </em>\u00b6 20. We do not believe that the District Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence. <em>Talon, </em>\u00b6 20. The District Court properly exercised its power to fashion appropriate relief for Anderson and Woodward according to the ordinary principles of equity. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 21; \u00a7 70-29-209(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b373-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
