Darrah entered the Mineral County Youth Drug Court program in September 2002, and those proceedings were subsequently transferred to Missoula County for both the drug offenses and the Youth Drug Court. In August 2002, Darrah was convicted of first offense DUI in Justice Court in Missoula.</p>\n<p id=\"AqS\">\u00b64 Darrah completed the Youth Drug Court program in Missoula and attended a graduation proceeding before the District Court on June 9, 2004. During that proceeding, the Youth Court Judge, the Hon. John W. Larson, asked prosecutor Halligan what she would recommend concerning the \u201cprior petition\u201d that had commenced the Youth Court proceedings. The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">Ms. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, I would recommend that the court approve Brandon-Brandon for completion of drug court and that his prior petition be dismissed and that his prior record be expunged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">THE COURT: Ms. Borg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">MS. BORG: We join in that request, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">THE COURT: Okay. So I\u2019ve signed-now signed the order for dismissing the case expunging your record. It takes care of any prior contact you\u2019ve had with the criminal justice system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">That same day, Judge Larson issued a written order that Darrah\u2019s previous Youth Court admissions were withdrawn and the pending petition was dismissed with prejudice. The order also required that all agencies \u201cexpunge ALL criminal records, Including MIP\u2019s. which relate to the offenses on or before June 9, 2004.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">\u00b65 In March, 2005, Darrah was convicted upon a guilty plea of DUI second offense in Mineral County and subsequently he was declared to be an habitual traffic offender, in part on the basis of the 2002 and 2005 DUIs. He did not appeal the designation of the 2005 DUI conviction as a DUI second offense. In 2006, Darrah was charged in Missoula County with a DUI third offense and other offenses. Montana law provides for increasingly higher penalties for successive DUI convictions. Section 61-8-722, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u00b66 Darrah moved the Justice Court to amend the charge from DUI third offense to second DUI, contending that his first DUI in 2002 had been expunged by order of the Youth Court and should not have been counted against him. In 2007, the Youth Court in Missoula County, sua sponte, issued an order confirming the expungement order of June 9,2004, and expressly stated that the order applied to DUI convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"Abb\">\u00b67 The Missoula County Justice Court denied Darrah\u2019s motion to amend the charge of DUI third offense to a charge of DUI second offense. Following that ruling, Darrah pled guilty to DUI third offense,, reserving his right to appeal on the issue of the expungement of his first DUI conviction. Darrah appealed the Justice Court\u2019s ruling to the District Court, which determined that the appeal presented only issues of law and ordered briefing. By order of February 14, 2008, the Hon. Robert Deschamps affirmed the order of the Justice Court, and subsequently denied a motion to reconsider. Judge Deschamps held that the Youth Court orders on expungement of a DUI conviction were unlawful under Montana law, that the State never made an express judicial declaration agreeing to expunge Darrah\u2019s 2002 DUI conviction, and that the principles of judicial estoppel did not apply. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b68 When an appeal from justice court to district court involves only issues of law, the standard of review of the district court\u2019s decision is whether the conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Boucher, </em>2002 MT 114, \u00b6 10, 309 Mont. 514, 48 P.3d 21; <em>City of Missoula v. Lesko, </em>2003 MT 177, \u00b6 7, 316 Mont. 401, 73 P.3d 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b69 <em>The issue on appeal is whether the District Court properly affirmed the holding of the Missoula Justice Court that Darrah\u2019s 2002 DUI conviction had not been expunged by the two orders of the Missoula County Youth Court. </em>Both Darrah and the State agree on appeal that the Youth Court lacked the power to issue the 2004 and 2007 orders, to the extent that they purported to expunge Darrah\u2019s 2002 DUI conviction. In <em>State v. Chelsey, </em>2004 MT 165, \u00b6 15, 322 Mont. 26, 92 P.3d 1212, we held that Montana courts lack the \u201cinherent authority to expunge criminal records\u201d and may not do so without specific statutory authorization. A youth court\u2019s power to order expungement extends only to its records \u201cof the underlying case.\u201d Section 46-1-1104(3)(d), MCA. Youth courts do not have jurisdiction over violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>of traffic laws. Section 41-5-203(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b610 Youth court records must be \u201cphysically sealed\u201d after the youth\u2019s 18th birthday, and any other agency having a copy of the sealed record, except for the Department of Corrections, must destroy the copies of those records. Section 41-5-216, MCA. However, that statute specifically excepts \u201cyouth traffic records\u201d from the sealing and destruction requirements. Section 41-5-216(4), MCA. The youth court is also bound by statutory restrictions regarding records of traffic offenses applicable to all courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">A court may not take any action, including deferring imposition of judgment, on a conviction that would prevent a conviction for any violation of a state or local traffic control law or ordinance, except a parking law or ordinance, in any type of motor vehicle, from appearing on the person\u2019s driving record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Section 61-11-101(5), MCA. It is therefore clear that both parties to this appeal are correct in concluding that the Youth Court orders on expungement that purport to affect Darrah\u2019s first DUI conviction in 2002, were beyond the power of that court and are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b611 In recognition of this state of the law, Darrah frames his contention on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">Darrah\u2019s argument in his motion to reconsider and now on appeal is not that Judge Larson\u2019s 2004 order actually expunged his 2002 DUI or that the 2002 conviction must now be removed from his driving record. Darrah is not seeking this Court to order performance of an illegal act. Rather, Darrah\u2019s contention is that judicial estoppel binds the State to apply its prosecutorial discretion to decline prosecutions that would be based on his pre2004 convictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Darrah\u2019s judicial estoppel argument is based on Ms. Halligan\u2019s statement at the Youth Drug Court graduation proceeding that she recommended to the court that the \u201cprior [Youth Court] petition be dismissed and that his prior record be expunged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">\u00b612 The purpose of judicial estoppel is to protect the integrity of the judicial process. It is an equitable doctrine intended to protect courts from being \u201cmanipulated by chameleonic litigants who seek to prevail, twice, on opposite theories.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Nelson, </em>2002 MT 151, \u00b6 20, 310 Mont. 329, 50 P.3d 139. Judicial estoppel precludes a party to an action from taking a position inconsistent with the party\u2019s prior judicial declarations. <em>Vogel v. Intercontinental Truck Body, Inc., </em>2006 MT 131, 332 Mont. 322, 137 P.3d 573. The party claiming judicial estoppel must show that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>(1) the estopped party had knowledge of the facts at the time he took the original position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">(2) the estopped party succeeded in maintaining the original position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">(3) the position presently taken is inconsistent with the original position; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">(4) the original position misled the party so that allowing the estopped party to change its position would injuriously affect the adverse party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\"><em>Vogel, </em>\u00b6 10. Each of these elements must be established by the party seeking to apply judicial estoppel. <em>In the Matter of Raymond W. George Trust, </em>1999 MT 223, \u00b6 51, 296 Mont. 56, 986 P.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\u00b613 The first step is to define the State\u2019s \u201coriginal position\u201d in this case. The only evidence of a judicial position is Ms. Halligan\u2019s statement to the Youth Court, quoted above, that she recommended that Darrah\u2019s prior petition be dismissed and that his prior record be expunged. This statement was made during the \u201cgraduation\u201d proceeding after Darrah\u2019s completion of the Youth Drug Court program. That program began with drug charges brought by petition in Youth Court. There is nothing in Halligan\u2019s statement to indicate a position on behalf of the State that Darrah\u2019s 2002 DUI conviction in Justice Court would be affected in any way by any expungement. There is also nothing in the statement to indicate a position that Darrah\u2019s 2002 DUI conviction would never be used again in any subsequent proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\u00b614 Darrah has therefore failed to show that the State\u2019s current position-that Darrah now has three DUI convictions-is inconsistent with its original position, as required by factor (3) to establish judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">\u00b615 In addition, for purposes of factor (4), Darrah has failed to show he was misled to his injury by the State\u2019s original position. Subsequent use of Darrah\u2019s 2002 DUI conviction would adversely affect him only if he committed additional DUI offenses, as he has done. It was Darrah\u2019s own unlawful conduct occurring after the Youth Court proceedings that has caused him detriment. Darrah cannot, as a matter of public policy, claim a judicial estoppel right to re-offend and receive a lesser penalty than the law provides. <em>See State v. Brander, </em>280 Mont. 148, 154, 930 P.2d 31, 35 (1996) (enhanced penalties for successive DUI convictions are not ex post facto but are the current punishment for a repetitive driving offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">\u00b616 Darrah attempts to bolster his judicial estoppel argument by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>asserting that he was misled by promises that were allegedly made at the time he agreed to participate in the Youth Drug Court process. He points to a \u201cdrug court contract\u201d that he agreed to which contained a statement that upon completion of the program \u201cmy criminal record will be expunged\u201d and that \u201c[i]n some cases charges in Municipal and Justice Court are included in the expungement order.\u201d This contract cannot support Darrah\u2019s judicial estoppel argument that arises from Halligan\u2019s subsequent statement to the Youth Court. The contract itself was not a judicial statement and since it pre-dated the Halligan statement to the Youth Court it is not evidence that Darrah was misled by the Halligan statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b617  In summary, we find that Darrah has failed to demonstrate that each of the elements of judicial estoppel was met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"ApG\">\u00b618  Significantly, to the extent that Ms. Halligan may have taken a position at the Youth Drug Court graduation proceeding supporting expungement of the DUI, that position was based upon an unlawful premise. Neither she nor Darrah\u2019s attorney nor the Youth Court could commit to expungement of a DUI record of the Justice Court. As discussed above, there was no authority under which the Youth Court could order expungement of DUI offenses, and a statement of support for an unlawful action can not be enforced by judicial estoppel or otherwise. It is \u201cappropriate to resist application of judicial estoppel\u201d where the party\u2019s prior position is based upon a mistake. <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 753, 121 S. Ct. 1808, 1816 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"AUZ\">\u00b619 For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b99-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, COTTER, MORRIS, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
