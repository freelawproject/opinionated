A jury sitting in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, found in favor of the Diocese. Following the verdict, Larchick filed several post-trial motions, including a motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence and for fees and costs or entry of judgment on liability. The District Court denied Larchick\u2019s motions. Larchick appeals. The Diocese cross-appeals from several of the District Court\u2019s rulings, including the District Court\u2019s award of partial summary judgment in favor of Larchick on the issue of intervening cause and comparative negligence. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">\u00b62 Larchick raises the following issues on appeal, restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">\u00b63 I.

Did the District Court err in granting Larchick\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of comparative negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\u00b612 On February 6,2004, Larchick was injured while participating in a lacrosse game during P.E. class as a freshman at Central. While the facts leading up to Larchick\u2019s injuries are somewhat disputed, it is undisputed that Larchick sustained immediate and permanent vision loss in his right eye when he was hit with a lacrosse stick by another student, Alex Powers (\u201cPowers\u201d). The Diocese alleged that Larchick precipitated the strike by hitting Powers on the shin with his lacrosse stick and that the incident occurred \u201caway from the play of the game.\u201d Powers disclaimed any intent to injure Larchick, although several students stated that it appeared to them as if Powers\u2019s actions were intentional. The game, described as \u201csoft lacrosse\u201d by the Diocese, was held in Central\u2019s gymnasium. Prior to participating in the game, students were instructed by P.E. teacher John Hardenbrook (\u201cHardenbrook\u201d) that physical contact (a.k.a. body checking) was not allowed. The students were not provided with helmets, face guards, or other protective equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">\u00b613 Larchick filed this negligence action in July of 2005, after the completion of his sophomore year at Central. The Diocese was not named as a defendant in the original complaint. Larchick subsequently moved to Wyoming to live with his grandparents and attend school. In February of 2006, the complaint was amended to include the current defendants. Larchick maintained that the school negligently supervised, negligently instructed, or negligently failed to provide protective equipment and requested punitive damages. The Diocese sought to defend, in part, on a theory that Larchick was comparatively negligent and that Powers\u2019s act of striking Larchick was an intervening cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">\u00b614 Central\u2019s Principal, Sheldon Hanser (\u201cHanser\u201d), was deposed in December 2005. During the deposition, Hanser stated that the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>did not blame Larchick for his injures. Hanser also stated that the school did not blame Powers for Larchick\u2019s injuries. Thereafter, Larchick moved for partial summary judgment on the Diocese\u2019s affirmative defenses of comparative fault and intervening cause. Larchick argued that there was no evidence to support a comparative fault theory. In support of this position, Larchick cited Hanser\u2019s statement that he did not blame Larchick for his injuries. The District Court granted Larchick\u2019s motion, concluding that there was no evidence that Larchick breached any duty owed to the defendants or acted negligently. The District Court also granted Larchick\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of intervening cause. The District Court concluded that it was \u201cforeseeable that intentional or reactive striking\u201d would occur and that Powers\u2019s strike of Larchick was not an intervening cause. In the same order, the District Court granted the Diocese\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on Larchick\u2019s punitive damages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b615 Prior to trial, Larchick filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence, argument, or suggestion at trial that Powers was at fault. Larchick cited Hanser\u2019s deposition testimony in which Hanser stated that the school did not blame Powers for Larchick\u2019s injuries. Larchick also noted that Hanser was deposed for a second time in February 2007, this time as the individual designated by the Diocese to speak on its behalf under M. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6). During this deposition, Hanser stated that his December 2005 testimony was still true and correct. The District Court granted Larchick\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>and thereby excluded evidence at trial that Powers was at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u00b616 A jury trial was held on February 22 through March 2, 2007. A key issue at trial was whether Hardenbrook was present in the gymnasium at the time Larchick was injured. Hardenbrook testified that he was present but that he did not see the incident occur because his back was turned when it happened. Several students in Hardenbrook\u2019s P.E. class on the day of the incident testified that he was in the gymnasium, although other students, including Larchick, testified that Hardenbrook was not. Also significant on appeal is defense counsel\u2019s alleged reference to a collateral source during the trial. On the fifth day of the trial, Angela Larchick (Larchick\u2019s mother) testified that she always thought Hardenbrook was not in the gym and that it troubled her and weighed on her and that she did not want her son in an environment she could not trust. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Angela Larchick the following question: \u201cWhen you filed your first lawsuit, you didn\u2019t even sue the school, did you?\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>response, Angela Larchick stated that she did not know anything about that. Larchick\u2019s counsel moved for an immediate mistrial, claiming that defense counsel, in alluding to superseded pleadings, impermissibly referenced a collateral source of recovery. Defense counsel suggested that the reference did not imply anything and that Larchick could have sued any number of people. The District Court denied Larchick\u2019s motion for a mistrial. On a separate matter, Larchick also claimed that the Diocese violated the District Court\u2019s Post Final Pre-trial Order excluding evidence, argument, or suggestion that Powers was at fault for Larchick\u2019s injuries. Larchick claimed the Diocese violated the order by suggesting at trial that Powers may have been responsible for Larchick\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\">\u00b617 On May 2, 2007, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Diocese. The jury did not reach issues of causation or damages, determining only that the Diocese was not negligent. Following the verdict, one of Larchick\u2019s attorneys, Elizabeth Halverson (\u201cHalverson\u201d), received a phone call from a man who identified himself as \u201cJohn Peterson.\u201d The man told Halverson that he was Hardenbrook\u2019s friend and that he was very concerned about Hardenbrook. He also told Halverson that Hardenbrook was upset about the trial and that Hardenbrook told him (\u201cPeterson\u201d) that he had lied under oath about his presence in the gymnasium when Larchick was injured. In sum, Hardenbrook evidently told Peterson who told Halverson that he had been pressured to say he was in the gymnasium when he was not. Halverson received the phone call from \u201cJohn Peterson\u201d on April 25, 2007. Halverson subsequently obtained a copy of the official telephone record, which indicated that the call had been placed from Hardenbrook\u2019s cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\u00b618 Halverson notified the District Court about the phone call shortly thereafter. The District Court held an emergency hearing on April 27, 2007. During the hearing, Halverson told the court about the phone call and produced a copy of the phone record. The District Court scheduled a hearing on the issue of Hardenbrook\u2019s testimony and issued subpoenas for Hardenbrook and \u201cJohn Peterson\u201d to testify. The District Court also granted the Diocese\u2019s motion for a protective order and sealed all information pertaining to the issues raised at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u00b619 A hearing on Hardenbrook\u2019s testimony was conducted on May 7, 2007. Hardenbrook was present and represented by his own counsel. Hardenbrook testified during the hearing but invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to the majority of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>questions. Essentially, Hardenbrook would only confirm that he was in possession of his cell phone the day Halverson received the phone call from \u201cMr. Peterson.\u201d These proceedings were also sealed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u00b620 Thereafter, Larchick filed an amended motion for a new trial \u201cbased upon the new evidence showing that contrary to all earlier evidence from Defendant, its teacher John Hardenbrook was not present in the gym when [Larchick] was injured, was pressured to testify falsely that he was present, and has told others since trial that his testimony was not truthful.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Larchick introduced an affidavit from Halverson in support of the motion for a new trial. Larchick also argued that defense counsel engaged in misconduct by soliciting false affidavits which stated that Hardenbrook was in the gymnasium at the time Larchick was injured. Although these affidavits were never introduced to the jury, Larchick argued that the defense relied upon them during the trial. Larchick also claimed that a negative inference could be drawn from Hardenbrook\u2019s refusal to testify at the hearing, and that independent evidence in the record supported the inference. In earlier post-trial motions, Larchick also requested fees, costs, and a new trial or entry of default judgment on liability on the basis of defense counsel\u2019s alleged misconduct. The District Court denied Larchick\u2019s post-trial motions on May 17, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"AJk\">\u00b621 Following the denial of the post-trial motions, Larchick filed an application for a writ of supervisory control to unseal the portions of the transcript relating to Hardenbrook\u2019s testimony at the hearing on May 7, 2007. We granted the application and ordered the District Court to vacate its order sealing the partial transcript. Larchick filed this timely appeal from the judgment entered on the jury verdict, the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion for a mistrial, the District Court\u2019s Order and Decision on May 17, 2007, denying Larchick\u2019s post-trial motions, and the District Court\u2019s October 27, 2006, order granting summary judgment to the Diocese on Larchick\u2019s punitive damages claim. However, we determined that the District Court\u2019s oral ruling on March 1, 2007, denying Larchick\u2019s motion for a mistrial and its May 17,2007, Ruling on Post-Trial Motions did not provide this Court with a sufficient basis to conduct a meaningful review of several of the issues raised by Larchick on appeal. Accordingly, we remanded this case to the District Court \u201cfor the limited purpose of allowing the District Court, at its earliest convenience, to enter specific findings of fact and conclusions of law\u201d on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">1. Is Larchick entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>discovered evidence under \u00a7 25-11-102(4), MCA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-3\">2. Is Larchick entitled to a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), (7), MCA, based on the District Court\u2019s exclusion of post-accident evidence which allegedly shows that defense counsel solicited and relied upon false affidavits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">3. Is Larchick entitled to costs, fees, and a new trial or entry of default judgment on liability based on defense counsel\u2019s alleged misconduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">4. Did the District Court err in denying Larchick\u2019s motion for a mistrial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\u00b622 The District Court addressed these issues in its Response to Remand on September 26, 2008. The District Court concluded that Larchick was not entitled to a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102(4), MCA, stating that the evidence was not material and that it was merely cumulative and impeaching. The District Court also concluded that Larchick opened the door to the question about why she did not sue the Diocese in her first lawsuit by expressing misgivings about Central from the beginning. Finally, the District Court concluded that defense counsel did not rely upon or solicit false affidavits or unreasonably multiply the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">\u00b623 Additional facts and proceedings will be addressed as necessary throughout the following Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">\u00b624 I. Did the District Court err in denying Larchick\u2019s motion for a new trial under \u00a725-11-102(4), MCA, on the basis of newly discovered evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">\u00b625 The decision to grant or deny a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence is within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Groves v. Clark, </em>1999 MT 117, \u00b6 32, 294 Mont. 417, 982 P.2d 446. We will not disturb that decision absent a showing of a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Groves, </em>\u00b6 32. Ultimately, the abuse of discretion must be so significant that it materially affects the substantial rights of the complaining party. <em>Graveley Simmental Ranch Co. v. Quigley, </em>2003 MT 34, \u00b6 20, 314 Mont. 226, 65 P.3d 225. To the extent the district court makes factual findings to determine whether a new trial is warranted, we review those findings for clear error. <em>State v. Clark, </em>2005 MT 330, \u00b6 39, 330 Mont. 8, 125 P.3d 1099 <em>(\u201cClark F).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">\u00b626 The circumstances in which a new trial may be granted are set forth in \u00a7 25-11-102(1) through (7), MCA. Subsection (4), the subsection relevant to the present appeal, provides a basis for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>trial when there is \u201cnewly discovered evidence material for the party making the application which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial.\u201d In <em>Clark I, </em>we clarified the five factors that must be satisfied before a party can prevail on a motion for new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. As articulated in <em>Clark I, </em>the moving party must satisfy each of the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">1. the evidence must have been discovered since the defendant\u2019s trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">2. the failure to discover the evidence sooner must not be the result of a lack of diligence on the defendant\u2019s part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">3. the evidence must be material to the issues at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">4. the evidence must be neither cumulative nor merely impeaching; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">5. the evidence must indicate that a new trial has a reasonable probability of resulting in a different outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-9\"><em>Clark I, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">\u00b627 On remand, the District Court found that factors (1) and (2) were established, stating that the events relating to the new evidence \u201cwere, obviously, discovered since the trial and could not have been discovered before trial.\u201d We agree with the District Court that factors (1) and (2) are clearly established in this case. The evidence provides that Halverson (Larchick\u2019s counsel) received the telephone call from \u201cJohn Peterson\u201d on April 25, 2007-nearly two months after the trial. Further, there is no evidence to suggest that there was any lack of diligence in the discovery of the evidence. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err in finding that factors (1) and (2) were established. However, while we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence is \u201cnew evidence\u201d sufficient to establish factors (1) and (2), we disagree with the court\u2019s conclusions on the remaining factors, which we address in turn below.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">\u00b628 In addressing factor (3), which requires the newly discovered evidence to be material to the issues at trial, the District Court focused on the difference between the trial testimony that Hardenbrook was in the gymnasium versus post-trial evidence that Hardenbrook was not present and concluded that factor (3) could not be established. In reaching this conclusion, the District Court determined that the newly discovered evidence put Hardenbrook only about eight to twelve feet further away from what the evidence suggested at trial. Therefore, according to the court, the newly discovered evidence was \u201cnot materially different from what Mr. Hardenbrook said at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u00b629 Larchick contends that the District Court erred in concluding that evidence Hardenbrook was not in the gymnasium at the time of the incident was not material to the issues at trial. Larchick argues that the Diocese hinged its entire case on Hardenbrook\u2019s presence in the gymnasium and that \u201cevery defense liability witnesses\u201d testified that the P.E. teacher must be present in order to \u201ccontrol the manner of play and prevent injury to the students.\u201d The Diocese, on the other hand, argues that evidence cannot be material if it is inadmissible. Here, the Diocese argues that Halverson\u2019s affidavit submitted in support of the motion for a new trial contains hearsay and is neither admissible nor material to the issues at trial. According to the Diocese, the evidence is merely a statement concerning Halverson\u2019s recollection of an alleged telephone conversation that she had with a \u201cMr. Peterson\u201d about Hardenbrook.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\">\u00b630 In this case, however, it is evident from the record that a significant issue at trial was whether the school provided adequate supervision of Larchick\u2019s P.E. class. The Diocese consistently maintained that the school provided such supervision and that Hardenbrook was present in the gymnasium at the time of the incident. At trial, Hardenbrook specifically testified that he was in the gymnasium when Larchick was injured. Evidence that Hardenbrook was not, in fact present is undoubtedly material to the issue of whether the school provided adequate supervision. The District Court erred in determining otherwise and we conclude that factor (3), requiring the newly discovered evidence to be material to the issues at trial, is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">\u00b631 Furthermore, despite the Diocese\u2019s argument to the contrary, the District Court did not err in determining that Halverson\u2019s affidavit was admissible even though it contained hearsay. Under the residual exception to the general prohibition on hearsay, a statement is admissible even though it is not specifically covered by the other exceptions on hearsay if it has \u201ccomparable circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d M. R. Evid. 803(24). This exception \u201clooks to the circumstances surrounding a hearsay statement when it is made-the circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness that lend reliability to the hearsay statement in lieu of cross-examination.\u201d <em>State v. Hocevar, </em>2000 MT 157, \u00b6 50, 300 Mont. 167, 7 P.3d 329. (Internal quotations omitted.) While the residual exception \u201cshould be used sparingly, and only in exceptional circumstances,\u201d we conclude that Halverson\u2019s affidavit was admissible as a trustworthy statement of an officer of Court under M. R. Evid. 803(24). <em>Hocevar, </em>\u00b6 50 (citing <em>State v. Brown, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>231 Mont. 334, 338, 752 P.2d 204, 207 (1988). Significantly, the Diocese does not necessarily dispute Halverson\u2019s description of the phone call from \u201cMr. Peterson\u201d or the phone record which indicates that the call was placed from Hardenbrook\u2019s cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\u00b632 As to factor (4), the District Court concluded that the newly discovered evidence was \u201csomewhat cumulative to other testimony\u201d that put Hardenbrook off the gymnasium floor. Although the District Court agreed that Hardenbrook would be subject to being impeached, it reasoned that \u201cnew evidence that is merely impeaching is not [a] sufficient basis for a new trial.\u201d Thus, the District Court concluded that Larchick could not establish factor (4), which requires the evidence to be neither cumulative nor merely impeaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\u00b633 Under \u00a7 26-1-102(4), MCA, evidence is \u201ccumulative\u201d when there is \u201cadditional evidence of the same character to the same point.\u201d Evidence is \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d when \u201cit is collateral in nature and does not have a direct bearing on the merits of the trial under review.\u201d <em>State v. Clark, </em>2008 MT 391, \u00b6 25, 347 Mont. 113, 197 P.3d 977 <em>(\u201cClark IF). </em>On remand, the District Court did not elaborate on what it considered to be \u201cother testimony.\u201d Presumably the court was referring to the testimony of those students who stated that Hardenbrook was not in the gymnasium when Larchick was injured. In this case, however, we do not agree that the newly discovered evidence is simply \u201cadditional evidence of the same character to the same point\u201d or that is it \u201ccollateral in nature.\u201d The newly discovered evidence that Hardenbrook was not in the gymnasium is noncumulative given Hardenbrook\u2019s crucial role in the litigation and the potential significance of the evidence. Unlike a casual observer witness, Hardenbrook was employed by the Diocese as the responsible teacher on duty at the time Larchick was injured. As the record demonstrates, Hardenbrook was in charge of selecting the P.E. activities and ensuring a safe and appropriate environment for those activities to occur. Both the Diocese and Larchick argued throughout the proceedings that Hardenbrook\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the incident was significant, seeking to establish that Hardenbrook was either in or outside the gymnasium. It follows that Hardenbrook\u2019s version of the events carries added weight and is more significant to the present issues than the version set forth from the student witnesses. Further, Hardenbrook\u2019s whereabouts has a direct bearing on Larchick\u2019s claim that the school failed to provide adequate supervision and on the Diocese\u2019s defense that it did. Notably, evidence from Hardenbrook himself that he was not present in the gymnasium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>at the time of the incident now runs counter to his employer\u2019s position in the litigation regarding adequate supervision. Therefore, we conclude that the newly discovered evidence regarding Hardenbrook\u2019s whereabouts is non-cumulative, and that the District Court erred in determining that factor (4) was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\">\u00b634 We now turn to a discussion of the fifth and final factor of the five-part test for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. Under factor (5) \u201cthe evidence must indicate that a new trial has a reasonable probability of resulting in a different outcome.\u201d <em>Clark I, </em>\u00b6 34. We have stated that this factor \u201cis most likely to be the crux of any district court\u2019s evaluation of new trial motions based on new evidence.\u201d <em>Clark I, </em>\u00b6 36. When making this determination, the trial judge should evaluate the weight and credibility of the newly discovered evidence and \u201cconsider what impact, looking prospectively at a new trial with a new jury, this evidence may have on that new jury.\u201d <em>Clark I, </em>\u00b6 36. In addressing this factor on remand, the District Court noted that while the evidence \u201ccould have some impact on Mr. Hardenbrook\u2019s credibility,\u201d there was no reasonable probability of it producing a different outcome. The District Court found that \u201c[e]ven if Mr. Hardenbrook had been on the gym floor itself, Jordan Larchick was injured away from the ball and the flow of play.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">\u00b635 The Diocese argues that the District Court properly evaluated the evidence and its probable impact on a new jury. Nevertheless, based on our analysis with respect to factors (3) and (4) above, we cannot reasonably conclude that the outcome would not be different in a new trial with a new jury. As noted above, a significant issue at trial was whether Hardenbrook was present in the gymnasium at the time Larchick was injured. The Diocese introduced considerable evidence at trial that Hardenbrook was present, including testimony from a number of students who stated that Hardenbrook was in the gymnasium when Larchick was injured. Further, the Diocese\u2019s expert witness Arthur Miller relied on student affidavits stating that Hardenbrook was present. Most importantly, however, Hardenbrook himself testified that he was present. Given the relevance of the new evidence to the issue of whether the school provided adequate supervision, we conclude that there is at least a reasonable probability that the newly discovered evidence would produce a different outcome at a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">\u00b636  To summarize, we conclude that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion in denying Larchick\u2019s motion for a new trial under \u00a7 25-11-102(4), MCA. The five-factor test for a new trial on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>basis of newly discovered evidence is satisfied. Thus, we reverse and remand for a new trial. Since we reverse and remand for a new trial under Issue I, we need not address Larchick\u2019s Issues II, III, and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"AhU\">\u00b637 V. Did the District Court err in denying Larchick\u2019s motion for costs and fees on the basis of defense counsel\u2019s alleged misconduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\u00b638 Larchick argues on appeal that the District Court erred in denying her motion for costs and fees under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, and under Rule 56(g) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. Under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, \u201c[a]n attorney or party to any court proceeding who, in the determination of the court, multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorney fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.\u201d Under Rule 56(g) a party may obtain costs and fees when affidavits have been \u201cpresented in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay ....\u201d If a court determines that Rule 56(g) applies, the offending party is required to pay \u201cthe amount of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused the other party to incur ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\u00b639 We review a district court\u2019s determination to award costs and fees under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, or Rule 56(g) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Tigart v. Thompson, </em>244 Mont. 156, 159-60, 796 P.2d 582, 584 (1990); <em>see also Denton v. First Interstate Bank of Com., </em>2006 MT 193, \u00b6 19, 333 Mont. 169, 142 P.3d 797. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>In re G.M., </em>2009 MT 59, \u00b6 11, 349 Mont. 320, 203 P.3d 818. The party seeking to reverse a ruling carries the burden to demonstrate the abuse of discretion. <em>In re G.M., </em>\u00b6 11. Because the district court is in the best position to know the nature and extent of any alleged violation, we generally defer to the district court\u2019s discretion in addressing costs and fees under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. <em>McKenzie v. Scheeler, </em>285 Mont. 500, 506, 949 P.2d 1168, 1172 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\u00b640 On remand, the District Court determined that \u201cdefense counsel did not multiply the proceedings in this case at all, much less unreasonably, vexatiously, or otherwise.\u201d Consequently, the District Court determined that Larchick was \u201cnot entitled to costs, expenses or fees pursuant to [\u00a7 37-61-421, MCA] or any other law.\u201d The District Court also concluded that attorney conduct in this case \u201cwas well within the bounds of normal and usual adversarial proceedings.\u201d The District Court did not specifically address whether Larchick was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>entitled to costs or fees under Rule 56(g), although the court noted in its Ruling on Post-Trial Motions that Larchick\u2019s contentions with respect to the affidavits were not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\">\u00b641 Larchick argues on appeal that defense counsel engaged in numerous acts of unreasonable conduct, including that defense counsel submitted false affidavits from two students who were present at the time Larchick was injured, Patrick Macpherson (\u201cMacpherson\u201d) and Nicholas Watson (\u201cWatson\u201d). Specifically, Larchick contends that Macpherson and Watson signed affidavits stating that Hardenbrook was in the gymnasium when Larchick was injured and that both students later refuted these statements in depositions taken prior to trial. Macpherson stated during his deposition that he twice told defense counsel that Hardenbrook was not in the gymnasium at the time of the incident but that defense counsel nonetheless insisted that he sign affidavits stating that Hardenbrook was present. As with Macpherson, Watson also signed an affidavit stating that Hardenbrook was in the gymnasium. He too later refuted this statement in a deposition, maintaining that he told defense counsel prior to signing the affidavit that Hardenbrook was in the weight room, not the gymnasium. While these affidavits were not introduced at trial, Larchick claims that defense counsel\u2019s actions needlessly multiplied court proceedings in violation of \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. Larchick also alleges that defense counsel\u2019s actions justified costs and fees under Rule 56(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">\u00b642  Larchick\u2019s arguments fail to convince this Court that the District Court acted arbitrarily or without conscientious judgment when it denied Larchick\u2019s motion for costs and fees under \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. While Larchick argues that defense counsel\u2019s conduct was questionable, even inappropriate, Larchick does not demonstrate how those alleged actions multiplied the proceedings in a vexatious or unreasonable manner. Moreover, we note that that the District Court is in the best position to determine whether costs and fees are appropriate. Here, the District Court determined that the proceedings in this case were \u201cwell within the bounds of normal and usual adversarial proceedings.\u201d Because Larchick does not present evidence to demonstrate how the proceedings were multiplied either unreasonably or vexatiously, we conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Larchick\u2019s motion for costs and fees pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\u00b643 In addition, we are not persuaded by Larchick\u2019s argument that costs and fees are justified under Rule 56(g) of the Montana Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Civil Procedure. A party may obtain costs and fees under Rule 56(g) if, in the context of a motion for summary judgment, affidavits have been \u201cpresented in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay.\u201d Costs and fees include the \u201camount of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused the other party to incur, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">\u00b644  Here, defense counsel does not dispute that Macpherson\u2019s and Watson\u2019s affidavits were submitted to the court in the context of a motion for summary judgment. Larchick, however, has failed to demonstrate that defense counsel submitted the affidavits in bad faith or solely for purposes of delay. According to the record, Macpherson admitted during Larchick\u2019s offer of proof at trial that defense counsel allowed him to read the affidavits and make any necessary changes prior to signing them. Macpherson also admitted that he did not request any changes to the affidavits prior to signing them and that his father was present when defense counsel conducted the interview about the incident. Similarly, at trial, Watson could not remember exactly where Hardenbrook was located when Larchick was injured; Watson equivocated, testifying that he remembered \u201cseeing [Hardenbrook] in the gym-or I mean the weight room\u201d and that he did not \u201cknow where exactly he was.\u201d In addition, defense counsel submitted numerous other affidavits from students who consistently maintained throughout the proceedings that Hardenbrook was in the gymnasium. Most significantly, Larchick has failed to point to any specific evidence in support of the contention that defense counsel knowingly submitted these affidavits in bad faith. Accordingly, we conclude that Larchick is not entitled to costs and fees pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">CROSS-APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\u00b645 VI. Did the District Court err in concluding that Powers\u2019s act of striking Larchick was foreseeable as a matter of law and not an intervening force that severed the causal chain?</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">\u00b646 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Fisher v. Swift Transp. Co., Inc., </em>2008 MT 105, \u00b6 12, 342 Mont. 335, 181 P.3d 601. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). To avoid summary judgment after the moving party has met this burden, the non-moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>party must present substantial evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Fisher, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">\u00b647 On appeal, the Diocese contends that Powers\u2019s \u201cact of purposefully and spontaneously striking [Larchick] with his lacrosse stick, away from the play of the game and in contravention of class rules\u201d was unforeseeable as a matter of law. Thus, according to the Diocese, Powers\u2019s act was an independent, intervening cause which cut off its liability for Larchick\u2019s injuries. The Diocese contends that Larchick must establish something more than a mere possibility of occurrence in order to establish foreseeability, and that while the specific injury need not be foreseeable, an objectively reasonable person must be able to expect it. Here the Diocese claims that Powers\u2019s act was a \u201cfreakish,\u201d \u201cbizarre,\u201d \u201cspontaneous,\u201d and \u201cunpredictable\u201d act that Central could not have foreseen. Finally, the Diocese claims that \u201c[a]t minimum, the question should have been left to the jury.\u201d Larchick, however, argues that the Diocese \u201cforesaw injury when it gave 4\u2019 metal sticks to a group of freshman PE students\u201d and that the Diocese \u201cknew ahead of time that the students could hit and injure each other.\u201d Larchick maintains that the District Court did not err in determining as a matter of law that intentional or reactive striking would occur. Larchick also argues that the Diocese is bound by previous admissions by Principal Hanser that it did \u201cnot blame\u201d Powers for Larchick\u2019s injuries-a statement Hanser made during a deposition in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">\u00b648 We have held in prior opinions that an intervening act is a force that comes into motion after the defendant\u2019s negligent act which combines with the negligent act to cause injury to the plaintiff. <em>Cusenbary v. Mortensen, </em>1999 MT 221, \u00b6 26, 296 Mont. 25, 987 P.2d 351. An intervening act may sever the chain of liability for the defendant in certain situations. However, an intervening act will not sever the chain of liability if the \u201cintervening act is one that the defendant might reasonably foresee as probable or one that the defendant might reasonably anticipate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>\u00b6 41. Therefore, the ultimate focus in determining whether the chain of liability has been severed is foreseeability. In determining foreseeability, the inquiry is whether the \u201cdefendant could have reasonably foreseen that his or her conduct could have resulted in an injury to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>\u00b6 40. The defendant need not have foreseen the specific injury to the plaintiff. <em>Fisher, </em>\u00b6 40. Typically, determinations of foreseeability in the context of intervening cause involve questions of fact properly reserved for the jury. <em>Fisher, </em>\u00b6 42; <em>see also Prindel v. Ravalli County, </em>2006 MT 62, \u00b6 45, 331 Mont. 338, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>133 P.3d 165. However, a district court may properly award summary judgment and determine foreseeability as a matter of law on issues of intervening cause when reasonable minds may reach but one conclusion. <em>Fisher, </em>\u00b6 42; <em>Prindel, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">\u00b649 In awarding partial summary judgment in favor of Larchick on the issue of intervening cause, the District Court determined that \u201c[s]ome incidental contact between bodies and between bodies and sticks was expected[,]\u201d and that at least part of the activity involved \u201cstriking another\u2019s [ljacrosse stick to dislodge the ball.\u201d The District Court also determined that some physical contact was foreseeable and that students would \u201chit and be hit with sticks.\u201d According to the court, the existence of penalties indicated that \u201cexceeding the bounds of the game was contemplated and expected to occur, at least occasionally.\u201d The District Court also noted that the majority of Larchick\u2019s P.E. class \u201cwas made up of teenage, male, high school-age freshman with little, if any, experience with P.E. [Lacrosse.\u201d Based on the foregoing, the District Court concluded that \u201c[sjince it was or should have been foreseeable that intentional or reactive striking of another with a [l]across[e] stick would occur, when it did come to occur, it was not a superseding, intervening cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u00b650  We agree with the District Court that it was clearly foreseeable that intentional or reactive striking between students would occur during the P.E. class which primarily consisted of 14-year-old freshman boys. As the District Court noted in its order granting partial summary judgment in favor of Larchick, the game involved running and required the students to attempt to dislodge the ball from the net on an opposing player\u2019s lacrosse stick. By the very nature of the game, physical contact was not only foreseeable but clearly expected. While Hardenbrook evidently instructed the students that \u201cbody checking\u201d was not allowed, obviously one could foresee that some physical contact, if not more, would occur under the circumstances. The existence of penalties for those who broke the rules of the lacrosse game is additional evidence that Hardenbrook expected that there would be instances where students would exceed the bounds of the game. By the Diocese\u2019s own admissions at trial and through its expert witness Arthur Miller, it was imperative for students to be supervised during the lacrosse activity. While there are numerous reasons why students should be supervised during P.E. activities, the most logical reason is to ensure that a safe and appropriate environment exists and that students are not injured while participating. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that it was reasonably foreseeable that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>intentional or reactive striking could occur under the circumstances. Thus, Powers\u2019s act of striking Larchick was not an intervening cause sufficient to break the causal chain. The District Court did not err in awarding partial summary judgment in favor of Larchick on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AEO\">\u00b651 VII. Did the District Court err in granting Larchick\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude all evidence, argument, or suggestion at trial that Powers was at fault for Larchick\u2019s injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\">\u00b652 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>for an abuse of discretion. <em>Grover v. Cornerstone Constr. N.W., Inc., </em>2004 MT 148, \u00b6 10, 321 Mont. 477, 91 P.3d 1278. As stated above, a district court abuses its discretion when it \u201cacts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Grover, </em>\u00b6 10. In this regard, the question is \u201cnot whether the reviewing court agrees with the trial court, but rather whether the trial court acted arbitrarily.\u201d <em>In re G.M., </em>\u00b6 11. Again, the party seeking to reverse a ruling carries the burden to demonstrate the abuse of discretion. <em>In re G.M., </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">\u00b653  In granting Larchick\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude all evidence, argument, or suggestion at trial that Powers was fault for Larchick\u2019s injury, the District Court focused on the 2005 deposition testimony provided by Principal Hanser in which he stated that the school did not blame Powers for Larchick\u2019s injury. According to the District Court, it would have been confusing and legally inconsistent in light of this testimony to allow the Diocese to argue that Powers, a non-party to the proceedings, was at fault. However, in <em>Faulconbridge v. State, </em>2006 MT 198, 333 Mont. 186, 142 P.3d 777, we clarified when non-party conduct is admissible at trial. Under our decision in <em>Faulconbridge, </em>\u201ca defendant may introduce non-party conduct only for the purpose of demonstrating that the non-party conduct was a superseding intervening cause of plaintiffs damages.\u201d <em>Faulconbridge, </em>\u00b6 81. As we noted above, an intervening cause is \u201can unforeseeable event that occurs after the defendant\u2019s original act of negligence ... [which] will generally serve to cut off defendant\u2019s liability.\u201d <em>Faulconbridge, </em>\u00b6 81. In <em>Thayer v. Hicks, </em>243 Mont. 138, 793 P.2d 784 (1990), we concluded that a \u201cdefendant\u2019s liability for his wrongful act will not be severed by an intervening cause if the intervening cause is one that the defendant might reasonably foresee as probable or one that the defendant might reasonably anticipate under the circumstances.\u201d In our analysis of the preceding issue, we concluded that Powers\u2019s act of striking Larchick was not an intervening cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>sufficient to break the causal chain. In other words, we concluded that Powers\u2019s act was not unforeseeable. Since Powers\u2019s conduct was not unforeseeable under the circumstances and thus, not a superseding intervening cause, the presentation of any evidence, argument, or suggestion at trial that Powers was at fault for Larchick\u2019s injury would have been improper. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it granted Larchick\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence at trial that Powers was at fault for Larchick\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">\u00b654 VIII. Did the District Court err in granting Larchick\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of comparative negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\u00b655 In Montana, a plaintiffs contributory negligence may be raised as a defense to a negligence claim. However, contributory negligence does not bar a plaintiff from recovering damages \u201cif the contributory negligence was not greater than the negligence of the person or the combined negligence of all persons against whom recovery is sought.\u201d Section 27-1-702, MCA. The recovery of damages will be barred only if the plaintiff is more than fifty percent negligent. <em>Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 31-33, 344 Mont. 540, 189 P.3d 615. As with foreseeability in0 the context of intervening cause discussed above, \u201cthe issue of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff and the degree of comparative negligence, if any, is normally an issue for the jury or fact-finder to resolve.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 32. However, as we have noted in previous opinions, summary judgment on the issue of comparative negligence is appropriate when reasonable minds \u201ccould not draw different conclusions from the evidence.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 32. We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a party\u2019s motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Fisher, \u00b6 </em>12.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u00b656 In this case, the District Court found that some incidental contact between the players and sticks was anticipated and that there was \u201cno evidence to suggest that when Jordan Larchick struck Alex Powers on the shin with his [ljacrosse stick, it was anything other than expected, incidental contact.\u201d The District Court also stated that there was no evidence that Larchick \u201cbreached any duty owing to the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5S\">\u00b657 The Diocese argues that that the District Court erred in reaching this conclusion. It contends that Larchick actively participated in unreasonable conduct immediately before Powers hit Larchick with his lacrosse stick and that a disputed issue of fact exists as to whether Larchick was comparatively negligent. Specifically, the Diocese claims that Larchick hit Powers \u201cin the ankle area with his lacrosse stick, and shoved and pushed [Powers] immediately preceding, if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>precipitating, [Powers\u2019s] strike of [Larchick].</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\">\u00b658  However, despite these claims, the Diocese identifies no material issues of fact to preclude summary judgment on the issue of comparative negligence. The only substantive argument made by the Diocese on appeal regarding this issue is that it offered evidence to the District Court that Larchick shoved or hit Powers in the ankle before Powers hit Larchick in the face with his lacrosse stick. We fail to see how this presents a material issue of fact precluding summary judgment on the issue of comparative negligence. Even assuming that Larchick hit Powers in the ankle, as the Diocese argues, the District Court found no evidence to suggest that Larchick\u2019s actions were anything other than incidental conduct which occurred during a P.E. activity. After reviewing the record and evidence in this case, we agree with the District Court that there is no evidence to suggest that Larchick acted negligently during the activity. We note that the Diocese\u2019s argument is particularly unpersuasive given that Principal Hanser stated that the school did not blame Larchick. We conclude that reasonable minds could not reach a different conclusion in light of the evidence presented in this case. The District Court did not err in granting Larchick\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">\u00b659  In sum, the District Court erred by denying Larchick\u2019s motion for a new trial under \u00a7 24-11-102(4), MCA, on the basis of newly discovered evidence. In light of this decision, we do not address Larchick\u2019s Issues II, III, and IV. The District Court did not err in denying Larchick\u2019s motion for costs and fees on the basis of defense counsel's alleged misconduct. With respect to the Diocese\u2019s cross-appeal issues, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that Powers\u2019s act of striking Larchick was not an intervening cause sufficient to sever the causal chain, in granting Larchick\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of non-party fault, or in granting Larchick\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of comparative fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\u00b660 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b581-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
