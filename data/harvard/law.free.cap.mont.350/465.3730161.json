In that case, the Honorable Susan P. Watters issued an order on February 2, 2009, wherein she ruled that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied. In its petition, the State requested that this Court exercise its supervisory control pursuant to M. R. App. P. 14(3) and reverse the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"AYq\">\u00b62 We issued an Order on March 31, 2009, ordering the District Court, or counsel for the defendant in the underlying case on behalf of the District Court, to respond to the State\u2019s petition. A response was filed by defendant\u2019s counsel on April 10, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b63 Having now considered the parties\u2019 arguments, we grant the State\u2019s Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control, reverse the decision of the District Court, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">\u00b64 1. Is the issue presented by the State appropriate for resolution by this Court through a writ of supervisory control?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">\u00b65 2. Did the District Court err in concluding that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">\u00b66 The following factual background has been alleged by the State; is subject to proof at trial; and is not intended to establish the law of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">\u00b67 In the early morning hours of May 19,2008, Christopher Steglich and his girlfriend, Mary Ryan, were involved in a motorcycle accident in Billings. Ryan, who had been riding on the back of the motorcycle, was fatally injured in the crash. Steglich left the scene of the accident before law enforcement officers arrived and walked to his house approximately a mile away. When he arrived home, Steglich told his friends that Ryan had been hurt, handed them the keys to his van, and asked them to go and get her. Steglich remained behind where he put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>his bloody clothes into the washing machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\">\u00b68 Steglich\u2019s friends could not find Ryan or the site of the wreck, so they returned to Steglich\u2019s house to get more specific directions. By then, Steglich was in the shower. The friends returned to where Steglich told them the accident had occurred to continue to look for Ryan. When they finally located her, one of the friends ran to a nearby house, which was within sight of the accident, and obtained a phone to contact 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b69 Although Steglich had a phone in his house, he did not call 911 or contact any law enforcement agency until almost twenty hours after the accident. When Steglich did finally talk with law enforcement officers, he told them that he and Ryan had been at a casino earlier in the evening where he had had several drinks. He also told officers that he had taken a \u201ccouple of hits\u201d from a meth pipe before going to the casino, and that after returning home from the casino with Ryan prior to the accident, he had \u201ctwo or three pulls\u201d off a bottle of tequila.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b610 The accident occurred when Steglich and Ryan left the house after 1:00 a.m. to go to Wal-Mart. Steglich told officers that Ryan was \u201cgurgling and still alive\u201d when he left her. He also acknowledged that she was unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b611 The State charged Steglich with negligent homicide, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-104, MCA, and failure to stop or remain at the scene of an accident involving death or personal injuries, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA. Steglich filed a motion to dismiss the \u201cfailure to remain\u201d charge arguing that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, was unconstitutionally vague. The District Court granted Steglich\u2019s motion concluding that the statute was vague both facially and as applied to Steglich. Thereafter, the State filed its Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control with this Court. The State also filed a protective, direct appeal of the District Court\u2019s order (this Court\u2019s Cause No. DA 09-0088). The negligent homicide charge remains pending against Steglich.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">ISSUE 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">\u00b612 <em>Is the issue presented by the State appropriate for resolution by this Court through a writ of supervisory control ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u00b613 This Court has general supervisory control over all other courts. Mont. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 2(2). Supervisory control is, however, an extraordinary remedy that we exercise only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>J.C. v. Eleventh Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2008 MT 358, \u00b6 12, 346 Mont. 357, 197 P.3d 907 (citing <em>Miller v. Eighteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 16, 337 Mont. 488, 162 P.3d 121). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>exercise supervisory control on a case-by-case basis and only when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtV\">urgency or emergency factors exist making the normal appeal process inadequate, when the case involves purely legal questions, and when one or more of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">a. The other court is proceeding under a mistake of law and is causing a gross injustice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">b. Constitutional issues of state-wide importance are involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">c. The other court has granted or denied a motion for substitution of a judge in a criminal case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">M. R. App. P. 14(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u00b614 The State argues in its Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control that the criteria required for supervisory control exist in this case because the District Court\u2019s ruling implicates constitutional issues of statewide importance and because the ruling is legally incorrect resulting in a gross injustice. The State maintains that because there are similar cases currently pending before courts throughout Montana, the urgency requirement is also satisfied. To that end the State points out that if other trial courts agree with the decision of the District Court in this case, then the District Court\u2019s error grows. However, if other courts disagree with the District Court\u2019s decision, then conflicting rulings would exist throughout the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b6 15 In responding to the State\u2019s petition, defendant\u2019s counsel concedes that the question here is purely legal and that this case does involve constitutional issues of state-wide importance. Defendant\u2019s counsel contends, however, that even though the State has no appeal remedy at this moment, such an appeal is possible in the future. Consequently, defendant\u2019s counsel maintains that, in this case, the normal appeal process is adequate making supervisory control inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u00b616 Section 46-20-103, MCA, limits the State to appealing orders or judgments in criminal cases that have the substantive effect of dismissing a case, modifying or changing a verdict, granting a new trial, quashing an arrest or search warrant, suppressing evidence, suppressing a confession or an admission, granting or denying a change of venue, and imposing a sentence that is contrary to law. The plain language of \u00a7 46-20-103, MCA, does not permit the State to appeal from an order that dismisses one count but leaves the case still pending. Consequently, in the instant case, the State does not have an immediate right of appeal because the District Court did not dismiss the entire case, it only dismissed one count. The negligent homicide count remains to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u00b617 In addition, while defendant\u2019s counsel argues that the State could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>dismiss the negligent homicide count without prejudice and then appeal the dismissal of the failure-to-remain count, or appeal the dismissal of the failure-to-remain count after trial on the negligent homicide count, these solutions are impractical. The State has the right to charge a defendant with any provable crime that defendant may have committed and a defendant has the right to a speedy trial on all charges. Adopting the approach proposed by defendant\u2019s counsel would unnecessarily complicate the trial process. If the State were to dismiss the negligent homicide count in order to appeal the dismissal of the failure-to-remain count, or try the defendant on the failure-to-remain count subsequent to a trial on the negligent homicide count, there could be double jeopardy and speedy trial issues. The better course is to accept supervisory control and rule on the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\">\u00b618  On that basis, we conclude that urgency or emergency factors do exist which make the normal appeal process inadequate; that this case involves purely legal questions as well as constitutional issues of state-wide importance; and that the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law causing a gross injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b619 Accordingly, we assume supervisory control over this matter to consider the issue raised by the State\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">ISSUE 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b620 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that \u00a761-7-103, MCA, is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b621 The District Court concluded that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, was vague on its face because the criminal intent element of the statute is based upon a reasonableness determination made by the fact-finder, thus it lacks a specified standard of conduct that is required under Montana law. The court also determined that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, is vague as applied to Steglich because Steglich could not have reasonably understood that returning to his home to obtain help for Ryan was prohibited, and because the statute fails to provide sufficient guidelines to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement with regard to Steglich\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b622 The State argues that the District Court erred in finding \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, void on its face because the statute is not vague in all of its applications. The State points out that even Steglich conceded that a person could be charged with failing to remain at the scene of an accident if the person offered no assistance. The State also argues that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, is not vague as applied to Steglich because an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ordinary person would have fair notice that the law applies to a person who leaves someone unconscious, but \u201cgurgling and still alive,\u201d while the person walks home past several houses where he could have called 911, and gives his keys to his friends to go back to the accident scene while he launders his bloody clothes and takes a shower.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b623 This Court presumes that all statutes are constitutional. <em>State v. Stanko, </em>1998 MT 321, \u00b6 15, 292 Mont. 192, 974 P.2d 1132. Thus, we will, if possible, construe a statute in a manner that avoids unconstitutional interpretations. <em>Stanko, </em>\u00b6 15. When the constitutionality of a statute is challenged, the party challenging the statute bears the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statute is unconstitutional, and any doubt will be resolved in favor of the statute. <em>Stanko, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b624 A vagueness challenge to a statue may be raised on two different bases: (1) because the statute is so vague that it is rendered void on its face; or (2) because it is vague as applied in a particular situation. <em>Stanko, </em>\u00b6 17. Moreover, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that criminal statutes define offenses with \u201csufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>State v. Samples, </em>2008 MT 416, \u00b6 16, 347 Mont. 292, 198 P.3d 803 (citing <em>State v. Turbiville, </em>2003 MT 340, \u00b6 18, 318 Mont. 451, 81 P.3d 475; <em>State v. Britton, </em>2001 MT 141, \u00b6 6, 306 Mont. 24, 30 P.3d 337).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\n<em>void on its face</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b625 A statute is \u201cvoid on its face if it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden.\u201d <em>State v. Dixon, </em>2000 MT 82, \u00b6 20, 299 Mont. 165, 998 P.2d 544 (citing <em>State v. Nye, </em>283 Mont. 505, 513, 943 P.2d 96, 101 (1997)). A person challenging the statute bears the burden of showing that the statute is \u201cimpermissibly vague in all of its applications.\u201d <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 18. Thus, a challenger must prove that the statute is vague \u201c \u2018not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Martel, </em>273 Mont. 143, 151, 902 P.2d 14, 19 (1995) (quoting <em>Monroe v. State, </em>265 Mont. 1, 4, 873 P.2d 230, 231 (1994)). Furthermore, \u201c \u2018[t]he fact that a statute is difficult to apply to some situations does not render it unconstitutionally vague.\u2019 \u201d Martel, 273 Mont. at 151, 902 P.2d at 19 (quoting <em>Monroe, </em>265 Mont. at 3, 873 P.2d at 231).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">\u00b626 The statute in question here, \u00a7 61-7-103(1), MCA, requires that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6r\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>[t]he driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident or as close to the accident as possible but shall then return to and in every event remain at the scene of the accident until the driver has fulfilled the requirements of 61-7-105.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-3\">And, \u00a7 61-7-105, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">Duty to give information and render aid. The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person or damage to any vehicle which is driven or attended by any person shall give his name, address, and the registration number of the vehicle he is driving and shall upon request and if available exhibit his driver\u2019s license to the person struck or the driver or occupant of or person attending any vehicle collided with <em>and shall render to any person injured in such accident reasonable assistance, including the carrying, or the making of arrangements for the carrying, of such person to a physician, surgeon, or hospital for medical or surgical treatment </em>if it is apparent that such treatment is necessary or if such carrying is requested by the injured person. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFxr\">\u00b627 Contrary to the District Court\u2019s conclusion, \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, is not unconstitutionally vague on its face because it does provide persons of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the conduct it prohibits. Ordinary persons reading the statute would know that if they were involved in an accident resulting in death or injury, they should remain at the scene until they have provided information to those involved in the accident and render reasonable assistance if it appears that assistance is necessary or if the injured person requests assistance. Furthermore, \u00a7 61-7-105, MCA, provides an example of reasonable assistance: \u201cthe carrying, or the making of arrangements for the carrying, of such person to a physician, surgeon, or hospital for medical or surgical treatment....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b628 The District Court determined that the failure-to-remain statute was unconstitutionally vague because a person\u2019s criminal liability hinged, at least in part, upon a determination of reasonableness. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s view, a criminal statute is not rendered unconstitutionally vague solely because a jury determines the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s actions. Criminal culpability often hinges on whether a jury later determines that a person acted reasonably. For example, a jury determines whether a victim\u2019s apprehension was reasonable when deciding whether a defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>committed an assault or stalking offense based on reasonable apprehension. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-5-201, -202, -206, -210, -211, -213, -220, and -221, MCA. Similarly, whether a defendant may be convicted of mitigated deliberate homicide turns on whether the jury finds that the defendant was \u201cunder the influence of extreme mental or emotional stress for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse\u201d as \u201cdetermined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s situation.\u201d Section 45-5-103, MCA. Additionally, a jury must determine the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s belief that force was necessary when a defendant claims the defense of justifiable use of force. Sections 45-3-103 and -104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b629 This Court has recognized that the reasonable person standard is an objective standard, and we have refused to hold statutes unconstitutionally vague simply because they rely on the reasonable person standard. <em>See Martel, </em>273 Mont. at 150, 902 P.2d at 19 (refusing to hold the stalking statute void for vagueness and rejecting the argument that \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d is vague because it employs a subjective standard); <em>State v. Campbell, </em>219 Mont. 194, 203, 711 P.2d 1357, 1363 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1127, 106 S. Ct. 1654 (1986) (the term \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d does not render aggravated assault statute unconstitutionally vague).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b630  Furthermore, the District Court applied the wrong standard in determining that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, was unconstitutional. Rather than indulging every possible presumption in an effort to uphold the statute as constitutional, <em>Stanko, </em>\u00b6 15, the District Court speculated about hypothetical situations that could potentially render the statute void. The proper inquiry is whether the statute is impermissibly vague in every application, not whether the statute is vague as applied to some, but not all, hypothetical scenarios. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b631  A person challenging a statute as facially void must demonstrate that the statute is vague \u201cin the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all.\u201d <em>Martel, </em>273 Mont. at 151, 902 P.2d at 19. Even Steglich conceded that a person who offered no assistance could be prosecuted under this statute. Hence, we hold that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, is not impermissibly void on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\n<em>vague as applied</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\u00b632 When faced with a vague-as-applied challenge to a statute, we determine whether the challenged statute provides a person with actual notice and whether the statute provides minimal guidelines to law enforcement. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 27. To determine whether the statute provides actual notice, we examine the statute in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>defendant\u2019s conduct to determine if the defendant reasonably could have understood that the statute prohibited such conduct. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 28. \u00b633 In this case, Steglich was involved in a motorcycle accident in which Ryan was fatally injured. The nature of the accident triggered Steglich\u2019s statutory duty to render reasonable assistance to Ryan if it was apparent that Ryan required assistance. Steglich told law enforcement officers that Ryan was \u201cgurgling and still alive\u201d but unconscious when he left her. Clearly Ryan required assistance, thus under \u00a7\u00a7 61-7-103 and -105, MCA, Steglich was required to provide reasonable assistance to her. The State contends that Steglich\u2019s actions, rather than indicating that he was obtaining aid for Ryan, indicate that he was attempting to dispose of evidence and elude law enforcement officers until the effects of alcohol and meth had dissipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\">\u00b634 In determining that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, was vague as applied to Steglich, the District Court found that Steglich \u201ccould not have reasonably understood that returning to his home in order to obtain help for [Ryan] was prohibited.\u201d However, even assuming that Steglich was obtaining aid for Ryan when he walked home, the failure-to-remain statute is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to his actions. An ordinary person would have fair notice that the statute applies to a driver who, after an accident, leaves someone \u201cgurgling and still alive\u201d; walks home past several houses where he could have called 911; gives his keys to his friends to go back to the accident scene while he launders his bloody clothes and takes a shower; and does not call 911 for help or to report the accident until after twenty hours have elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b635 Central to the District Court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, is vague as applied to Steglich was the court\u2019s view that it conflicted with \u00a7 61-7-105, MCA. According to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">Nothing in \u00a7 61-7-103 says it is ok for the uninjured person to leave the scene as long as he is working to comply with \u00a7 61-7-105, it says he cannot leave in every event until he has fulfilled the requirements of \u00a7 61-7-105. Thus, if the uninjured party leaves the scene to procure help because none is available at the scene, the -uninjured party has violated \u00a7 61-7-103. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Thus, under the court\u2019s interpretation, a driver who leaves the scene before satisfying the requirements of the failure-to-remain statute, even if the driver is leaving to comply with the statute, has committed a <em>per se </em>violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AgP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u00b636 Courts have an \u201cobligation to interpret individual statutes within a legislative act so as to ensure that those sections coordinate with each other.\u201d <em>State v. Farmer, </em>2008 MT 354, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 335, 195 P.3d 800. This Court has recognized that \u201can unreasonable interpretation and dissection of a statute will not render it void for vagueness.\u201d <em>Broers v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, </em>237 Mont. 367, 371, 773 P.2d 320, 323 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b637 A fair reading of \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, requires a driver who is in an accident that results in injury or death, to remain at the scene until the driver has rendered \u201creasonable assistance\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 61-7-105, MCA. \u201cReasonable assistance\u201d includes taking an injured person to a hospital or making arrangements to take an injured person to a hospital. Section 61-7-105, MCA. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s interpretation, this language does not create an impossibility; rather, it simply recognizes that a person may have to leave the scene to obtain help-i.e., \u201cmake arrangements\u201d-for someone who has been injured. Thus, an ordinary person could reasonably understand that the failure-to-remain statute applied to Steglich\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b638 Furthermore, we noted in <em>Stanko </em>that \u201c \u2018[a] vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stanko, </em>\u00b6 23 (quoting <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-09, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 2298-99 (1972)). The State points out that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, is drafted in a manner that avoids arbitrary enforcement. To be charged with violating \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, a person must have driven a vehicle that has been in an accident; someone must have been injured or died as a result of the accident; the driver must have left the scene; and the driver must have failed to provide assistance to an injured person who obviously needed, or requested, assistance. In light of these requirements, law enforcement officers cannot charge individuals on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis for failing to remain at the scene of an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b639  Because \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, provides actual notice to citizens of what conduct is prohibited, and because \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, provides minimal guidelines to ensure that law enforcement officers will not arbitrarily and discriminatorily charge citizens with failing to remain at the scene of an accident that involves injury or death, we hold that this statute is not impermissibly vague as applied to Steglich.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\">\u00b640 Based on the foregoing, we hold that the District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA, is void for vagueness on its face and as applied to Steglich. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b641 IT IS ORDERED that the State\u2019s Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b642 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the District Court\u2019s order granting Steglich\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge of failure to stop or remain at the scene of an accident is reversed. This matter is remanded to the Thirteenth Judicial District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b643 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this Court serve a copy of this Opinion and Order upon all counsel of record, and the Hon. Susan P. Watters, District Judge Presiding, under Cause No. DC 2008-360.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">DATED this 13th day of May, 2009.</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
