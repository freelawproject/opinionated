We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b62 The Worleys present the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b63 Issue One: Whether the District Court erred in finding that the Worleys exercised undue influence over Josephine Marsden.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred in imposing a constructive trust on certain parcels of real property, in favor of the Estate of Josephine Marsden.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">\u00b65 Issue Three: Whether the District Court erred in finding that the Worleys converted the property of Josephine Marsden.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">\u00b66 Issue Four: Whether the District Court erred in awarding damages against the Worleys and in favor of the Estate of Josephine Marsden.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">\u00b67 Issue Five: Whether the District Court erred in awarding attorney fees and costs to Robert Monroe and Leatha Cancelosi.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">\u00b68 Josephine Marsden was the mother of Robert Monroe, Leatha Cancelosi, Melissa Marsden (Worley) and Jody Connell. Jody was not a party to this litigation. Josephine died at the age of 84 on June 5, 2004, after several years of steadily declining health.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>\u00b69 In October and again in November, 1999, Josephine was hospitalized as a result of numerous serious health impairments including diabetes, hypertension, acute renal failure, digestive disorder and depression. Upon her discharge from the hospital she could no longer care for herself and live alone in her own home. Her four children met and Melissa offered that she, her husband John, and her daughter could move into Josephine\u2019s home and care for her. The siblings did not discuss whether Melissa should be compensated for caring for Josephine. Melissa did not expect to get paid for her services and offered her help because Josephine had taken care of her and it was her turn to repay her mother. Josephine\u2019s physical and mental health declined steadily until her death and she was bedridden and confined to her bedroom for the last year and a half of her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b610 Up until the time Melissa and John moved into Josephine\u2019s house, they had lived for some time rent free in another house owned by Josephine. Melissa had worked part time at a casino and the highest gross yearly income she could recall was just over $10,000. She only sporadically filed income tax returns. John did occasional construction jobs and worked on cars, and had never filed an income tax return in his life. Neither of them had a checking account, credit card or any material assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b611 Throughout her life Josephine Marsden was frugal and independent, took great care in her financial transactions and was a meticulous record-keeper. At the time of her 1999 hospitalizations she owned several pieces of unencumbered real estate; including her home, the house that Melissa was living in, land near Ovando and land in Florida. She had monthly income from Social Security, a pension and an annuity that typically exceeded her monthly expenses by several thousand dollars. In 1999 the balance in her checking account was over $17,000 and her medical expenses were covered by Medicare and a private supplemental policy. Josephine kept collections of stamps, silver dollars and dolls in her house, and had varying amounts of cash on hand in an envelope, often running into the thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"AcF\">\u00b612 When Melissa moved in to care for her mother in late 1999 or early 2000, she also assumed all control over her mother\u2019s financial affairs. She controlled Josephine\u2019s checking account, her mail and payment of bills and expenses. By the time of Josephine\u2019s death in 2004, Melissa had obtained title to all of Josephine\u2019s real property; had sold the Ovando and Florida land; had encumbered the remaining property with over $175,000 in loans taken out in Josephine\u2019s name; and had used part of the loan proceeds to buy property in Missoula and Las Vegas. The Las Vegas property was a condominium unit that John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>bought from his family. Melissa had exhausted all the cash in J osephine\u2019s house and had repeatedly overdrawn J osephine\u2019s checking account. Melissa had fraudulently cashed one of Josephine\u2019s certificates of deposit, established for the designated benefit of her children and grandchildren, by forging Josephine\u2019s name to it. She attempted to cash a second of Josephine\u2019s certificates of deposit by forging her signature but was stopped by the credit union. Melissa and John obtained and used credit cards in Josephine\u2019s name and charged the account to the credit limit of $9,000. They exhausted all of Josephine\u2019s savings, social security, retirement and annuity income. Melissa and John retained for their own use all rental income from Josephine\u2019s two rental units and never accounted for it. They destroyed years of Josephine\u2019s financial records and kept very few records of Josephine\u2019s financial affairs after Melissa assumed control. Melissa fabricated lease documents and forged signatures on them to obtain loans in Josephine\u2019s name. Melissa lied about the lease forgeries and other forgeries at the trial in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b613 After moving to Josephine\u2019s home, Melissa used Josephine\u2019s money to pay all of her and John\u2019s personal bills and obligations, and in doing so repeatedly overdrew Josephine\u2019s checking account. Melissa made no attempt to separate Josephine\u2019s bills and expenses from those incurred by her family and has never provided any accounting of the expenditures of Josephine\u2019s income and assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b614 Melissa undertook the real estate transactions involving Josephine\u2019s property and assets during Josephine\u2019s deteriorating illnesses. Melissa obtained control over Josephine\u2019s assets without ever telling her siblings and all the transactions benefitted only Melissa and John. Shortly after their mother died, the siblings met and asked Melissa about a will and about the assets of Josephine\u2019s estate. Robert knew that he had been designated the personal representative of the estate by his mother\u2019s will. Melissa told them that Josephine\u2019s residence was now hers, that the land near Ovando had been given to a conservation organization, that there were no other assets, and that there was no will. She refused to provide any other information or to answer questions. Further attempts by Robert and Leatha to obtain information from Melissa were fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u00b615 Robert obtained Josephine\u2019s will from the attorney who prepared it. The will left to Melissa the rental property that she had lived in before moving in with Josephine. The remainder of her assets were left equally to Robert, Leatha and Melissa. There was no distribution to Josephine\u2019s daughter Jody.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b616 Robert and Leatha commenced this action to recover assets of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Josephine\u2019s estate from Melissa and John. The District Court heard several days of testimony from numerous witnesses and on December 14,2007, entered Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order. The District Court found that there was a confidential relationship between Melissa and Josephine based on Josephine\u2019s trust of Melissa and Melissa\u2019s control over all aspects of Josephine\u2019s finances. The District Court found that Melissa was an agent and fiduciary as to Josephine, owing her the duty of loyalty, prudence and utmost good faith that required her to account for the use of Josephine\u2019s funds and property. The District Court found that Melissa had failed to account for Josephine\u2019s funds and property, had breached her fiduciary duties and had committed constructive and actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b617 The District Court concluded that Melissa and John had exercised undue influence over Josephine and by so doing had obtained control and ownership of Josephine\u2019s real estate, loan proceeds, rental income, social security and retirement benefits and savings. The District Court found that this transfer of all of Josephine\u2019s assets to Melissa and John was at odds with Josephine\u2019s desires for the transfer of her estate as set out in her will and that the purported transfer of all the assets to Melissa was unnatural.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b618 The District Court imposed a constructive trust in favor of Josephine\u2019s estate on all the real property that Melissa and John had obtained from Josephine or that they had purchased with loan proceeds obtained in Josephine\u2019s name. Those properties were Josephine\u2019s home, two rental units in Missoula and a condominium in Las Vegas. The District Court also entered a money judgment against Melissa and John for the $177,000 in proceeds they obtained by taking loans in Josephine\u2019s name; for all rental income not accounted for; and other items, totaling nearly $400,000. The court further awarded Robert and Leatha their costs and attorney fees based on Melissa\u2019s extraordinary efforts to conceal her use of Josephine\u2019s assets and the substantial effort that Robert and Leatha had to expend to uncover the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b619 Melissa and John appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u00b620 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s findings of fact is whether they are clearly erroneous, and the standard of review of conclusions of law is whether the interpretation of the law is correct. <em>In the Matter of the Estate of Bradshaw, </em>2001 MT 92, \u00b6 11, 305 Mont. 178, 24 P.3d 211. The evidence is reviewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, and the credibility of witnesses and the weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>assigned to their testimony are for the determination of the trial court. <em>In the Matter of the Guardianship of Mowrer, </em>1999 MT 73, \u00b6 36, 294 Mont. 35, 979 P.2d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b621 <em>Issue one: Whether the District Court erred in finding that the Worleys exercised undue influence over Josephine Marsden. </em>Undue influence is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">(1) the use by one in whom a confidence is reposed by another and who holds a real or apparent authority over him of such confidence or authority for the purpose of obtaining unfair advantage over him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">(2) taking an unfair advantage of another\u2019s weakness of mind; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">(3) taking a grossly oppressive and unfair advantage of another\u2019s necessities or distress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Section 28-2-407, MCA. A court determining whether there has been undue influence may consider relevant factors including (1) any confidential relationship between the donor and the person allegedly exercising influence; (2) the physical condition of the donor as relevant to his ability to withstand influence; (3) the mental condition of the donor as relevant to his ability to withstand influence; (4) the unnaturalness of the disposition, as it relates to showing an unbalanced mind or a mind easily susceptible to undue influence; and (5) the demands and importunities as they affect the donor, considering the relevant circumstances. <em>In the Matter of the Estate of Harms, </em>2006 MT 320, \u00b6 21, 335 Mont. 66, 149 P.3d 557. These factors are not exclusive or mandatory, but are available to guide a court in applying the statute, which controls. <em>Estate of Bradshaw, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\u00b622 The District Court entered detailed and specific findings and conclusions in this case that illustrate the confidential relationship between Melissa and Josephine and how that relationship allowed Melissa to manipulate Josephine and her finances. Josephine was seriously ill the entire time Melissa cared for her, steadily declining to the condition of a bed-ridden invalid. Josephine was totally dependent upon Melissa for her care. Josephine developed short term memory loss, and became increasingly inactive, depressed and withdrawn. She refused or resisted most medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">\u00b623 Josephine and her children trusted Melissa with control of Josephine and her finances. Melissa repeatedly acted as Josephine\u2019s agent in financial and real estate transactions and controlled all aspects of her finances and assets. By the time of her death, Josephine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>was in a state of total helplessness and her mental state was fragile and feeble. Her doctor testified that she had lost short term memory, likely had suffered a stroke, had become progressively more isolated from others, had lost all interest in her former hobbies, and demonstrated a desire to die.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b624 While Josephine became steadily more withdrawn, depressed and uninterested, Melissa took complete control. She deposited all funds that came to Josephine, paid all bills, and initiated and negotiated loans on Josephine\u2019s real estate, forging documents and signatures as required. Despite the number and significance of the real estate and financial transactions that Melissa entered on Josephine\u2019s behalf, Melissa never sought power of attorney, appointment as conservator, advice of counsel, or advice or consent of any of Josephine\u2019s other children. She never disclosed these transactions to anyone except to the extent that she has been forced to do so since the initiation of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b625 The disposition of Josephine\u2019s assets was unnatural in the context of her known desire, expressed in her will that was executed prior to her 1999 hospitalizations. That will appointed Robert as her personal representative and left the bulk of her estate equally to Robert, Leatha and Melissa. Melissa and John\u2019s use of Josephine\u2019s assets to support a lifestyle they had never previously enjoyed, and their incurring long-term debt in Josephine\u2019s name were completely inconsistent with the way Josephine had lived her entire life.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b626  There was ample evidence, demonstrated in the District Court\u2019s detailed findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous, that Melissa and John exercised undue influence over Josephine, as defined in \u00a7 28-2-407, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b627 <em>Issue two: Whether the District Court erred in imposing a constructive trust on certain parcels of real property, in favor of the estate of Josephine Marsden. </em>The District Court imposed a constructive trust in favor of Josephine\u2019s estate on Josephine\u2019s house (that had been transferred to Melissa); on Josephine\u2019s former rental property (that had been transferred to Melissa); on another rental property, and on the condo in Las Vegas. The latter two properties had been purchased by Melissa and John with funds obtained from fraudulent loans obtained in Josephine\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u00b628 \u201cA constructive trust arises when a person holding title to property is subject to an equitable duty to convey it to another on the ground that the person holding title would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to retain it.\u201d Section 72-33-219, MCA; <em>Estate of Bradshaw, </em>\u00b6 36. A constructive trust may be imposed with or without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>proof of fraud or other wrongful acts. <em>In the Matter of the Estate of McDermott, </em>2002 MT 164, \u00b6 25, 310 Mont. 435, 51 P.3d 486. Establishment of a constructive trust depends only upon a showing that the title holder would be unjustly enriched if permitted to retain title. <em>In the Matter of the Marriage of Moss, </em>1999 MT 62, \u00b6 29, 293 Mont. 500, 977 P.2d 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b629  In this case there were ample reasons for the District Court to impose the constructive trusts. It is clear from the facts discussed above that Melissa and John obtained the properties through undue influence, depriving Melissa\u2019s siblings of their devises under the will. Melissa and John would have been unjustly enriched if allowed to retain title to the real property and a constructive trust was a proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b630 <em>Issue three: Whether the District Court erred in finding that the Worleys converted the property of Josephine Marsden. </em>Melissa and John make a brief and conclusory argument that the District Court incorrectly found that they had converted Josephine\u2019s property to themselves. The basis of this argument is that Melissa and Josephine were both signatories on a checking account, and so both were equal owners, precluding conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b631 Whatever the merit of that argument, it means nothing here in light of their \u201cplundering of Josephine\u2019s property,\u201d as it was described by the District Court. Melissa and John took much more than just the contents of the checking account. The District Court\u2019s reference to conversion was in its conclusions of law, prefatory to imposing the constructive trust with regard to the parcels of real property. It did not deal with the checking account. Melissa and John make no substantial argument on this point and there was ample ground for finding conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b632  <em>Issue Four: Whether the District Court erred in awarding damages against the Worleys and in favor of the Estate of Josephine Marsden. </em>The District Court found that Melissa and John, in the span of their four or so years caring for Josephine, had looted and dissipated what should have been, under proper care, an estate worth about $500,000. The real property that could be reached (the Ovando and Florida properties had been sold, with the proceeds going to Melissa and John) was materially indebted. Josephine\u2019s positive cash flow, which should under proper care have accumulated value at the rate of several thousand dollars a month for over four years was nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b633 The District Court\u2019s decision to award damages was based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u00b634 <em>Issue Five: Whether the District Court erred in awarding attorney fees and costs to Robert Monroe and Leatha Cancelosi. </em>The District Court awarded costs and attorney fees to Robert and Leatha based \u201cupon the extraordinary efforts by Melissa to conceal her use of Josephine\u2019s property and money, which has required Robert and Leatha to make substantial efforts to uncover and prove Melissa\u2019s wrongful conduct....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b635 A party can ordinarily recover attorney fees in an action only if empowered to do so by contract or statute. <em>Walters v. Luloff, </em>2008 MT 17, \u00b6 33, 341 Mont. 158, 176 P.3d 1034. However, a district court has equitable power to award attorney fees when justice requires. <em>Walters, </em>\u00b6 33; <em>Estate of McDermott, </em>\u00b6 34. In this case there is ample evidence that Melissa went to great lengths to hide her transactions from her siblings, who were the people directly impacted. She destroyed records and forged documents and signatures. The District Court found that Melissa and John had a history of \u201cnot leaving a financial paper trail\u201d and failing to file tax returns to avoid John\u2019s child support obligations from another state. Melissa consistently refused to provide information to her siblings as to what had happened to their mother\u2019s estate and lied to them about what had happened to the Ovando property. Melissa continued to obviously lie even at the trial in District Court. Melissa, during her testimony, testified that a lease for one of J osephine\u2019s properties was genuine and had been signed by the tenant, but upon questioning had to acknowledge that was not true and that the entire document was a forgery and a \u201clie.\u201d Judge Harkin characterized her as a \u201cblatant liar\u201d who had hurt her own case \u201creally, really bad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b636  Robert and Leatha were confronted with the decision to either walk away with nothing from their mother\u2019s estate, or hire counsel and engage in the long and expensive process of discovering and righting the wrongs perpetrated by Melissa. They chose the latter course and have prevailed. Again, Melissa and John provide only a conclusory three-sentence argument on attorney fees and provide no substantial argument or authority as to why the decision should be reversed. The District Court was within its equitable powers to award attorney fees and costs in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b637 For the reasons stated above, the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
