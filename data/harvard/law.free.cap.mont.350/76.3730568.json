Intervenors\u2019 motion to stay the judgments. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">\u00b62 In December 2006, the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) filed a petition for emergency protective services, adjudication as youths in need of care and temporary legal custody for two children, one-year-old E.B. and three-week-old M.B. In September 2007, DPHHS filed another such petition for four-day-old B.B. The first petition was based on a report that the mother tested positive for methadone when she gave birth to M.B. and the second was based on the mother\u2019s admitted drug use while pregnant with B.B. All three children were placed in foster care with the Rawsons, who live in Whitehall, Montana. E.B. was born in May 2005 and was nineteen months old when placed with the Rawsons, M.B. was bom in November 2006 and was nineteen days old when placed with the Rawsons, and B.B. was born in November 2007 and was removed from his mother\u2019s care at birth and, after a month in the hospital, was placed with the Rawsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">\u00b63 After the children were placed in temporary foster care with the Rawsons, DPHHS designed a number of treatment plans for the birth mother and birth father, which provided remedial services and rehabilitative programs, with the hope of eventually returning the children to their parents. Both parents repeatedly failed the treatment plans and in April 2008, DPHHS filed a \u201cPetition for Permanent Legal Custody and Termination of Parental Rights with Right to Consent to Adoption or Guardianship\u201d for each of the three children. The parents then signed affidavits waiving all parental rights, relinquishing the children and consenting to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">\u00b64 In May 2008, the Rawsons filed motions to intervene \u201cto enable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>them to be heard for the purposes of permanency and placement\u201d for the three children. The motions stated that \u201c[i]mportantly, this matter involves an Indian Child as defined in the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) of 1978 (25 U.S.C. chapter 21.). Accordingly, the parent[s\u2019] wishes as to permanent, adoptive placement should be considered especially in this situation where a non-ICWA compliant home is being contemplated by DPHHS out of the state of Montana.\u201d The motion continued by stating it was the Rawsons\u2019 understanding \u201cthat both parents desire that [the children] remain with and be adopted by the foster family ....\u201d The District Court granted the Rawsons\u2019 motion to intervene. The District Court held a termination hearing in June 2008, based on DPHHS\u2019 April 2008 petitions. Following the hearing the court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order terminating the parental rights and granting DPHHS permanent legal custody of the children, with the right to consent to adoption or guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b65 All three children are eligible for enrollment as members of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians (Little Shell Tribe). The tribe is recognized in Montana but is not a federally recognized tribe. Their enrollment status is due to their father being an enrolled member of the Little Shell Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b66 A DPHHS adoption selection committee, tasked with securing permanent adoptive placement of the three children, selected Doug and Trudie Nesbitt (the Nesbitts), a non-Indian family, in Spokane, Washington, as the best option for permanent placement. The committee determined that adoptive placement with the Nesbitts would more closely achieve the purposes and policies of ICWA than placement with the Rawsons because the Nesbitts are the adoptive parents of A.B. (now age 7), one of the children\u2019s full-blood siblings. The birth parents previously had their parental rights terminated on three children in the state of Washington and the Nesbitts adopted A.B. The two other full-blood birth siblings, A.B. (now age 5) and N.B. (now age 11) were adopted by another family who also live in Spokane, Washington. And, Spokane is where at least four paternal aunts and their children (natural cousins of this sibling group) reside and where the birth mother and birth father presently reside. The Nesbitts have developed and maintained, for the benefit of their adopted daughter A.B., a family-like relationship with the adoptive mother of N.B. and A.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b67 After the termination hearing, the Rawsons filed a motion to continue the placement hearing. The motion stated, among other things, that the court had failed to comply with ICWA\u2019s requirement to notify the Little Shell Tribe of its rights to intervene in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>proceedings. The motion stated there is \u201csome concern with ICWA issues that could pose future problems.\u201d The Rawsons noted that they \u201cdid not intend or want undue delay in effectuating the permanency of these children\u201d but that \u201cit would be the children who would suffer the most ill effects of any challenge or invalidation of an adoption ....\u201d The motion also pointed out that the standard of proof ICWA required for the termination of parental rights is \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d rather than the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard the court used. Based on the Rawson\u2019s motion the court held a supplemental hearing and applied the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard and heard testimony from an ICWA expert. The District Court then again awarded DPHHS legal custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b68 In July 2008, the court held a hearing on the Rawson\u2019s motion for an order restraining DPHHS from removing M.B., E.B. and B.B. from their care and also on the issue of whether the Rawsons could demonstrate good cause to deviate from the adoptive placement preferences set forth in ICWA. The Rawsons presented a number of witnesses including an occupational therapist for the children, a family support specialist who has worked with the children, an ICWA qualified expert in the area of Indian culture, and testimony from foster mother Roberta Rawson. DPHHS presented testimony from a child protection specialist and an ICWA qualified expert in the area of Indian culture. The children\u2019s guardian ad litem was present and did not testify but submitted a report concerning placement. The court also noted that the Little Shell Tribe was given notice of the July 2008 hearing, as well as notice of numerous prior hearings, and that no representative of the Little Shell Tribe appeared or otherwise indicated an interest in having the tribe represented in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b69 In August 2008, the District Court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order concluding that the Nesbitts qualified as \u201cextended family members\u201d under ICWA, placing the children with the Nesbitts satisfied the purpose of ICWA and the Rawsons failed to show good cause to deviate from ICWA\u2019s preferred placements. The Rawsons then filed motions for new trials or for amended judgments, and also for the court to stay the adoptive placement of the children, pending the disposition of their motions or any appeal in these matters. The District Court denied the Rawson\u2019s motions in September 2008 and held that DPHHS\u2019s \u201cplacement of the children with the proposed adoptive parents most closely meets the ICWA placement preferences.\u201d The court also stated that its August 2008 findings of fact and conclusions of law \u201csupport a determination that placement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the proposed adoptive parents is in the children\u2019s best interests, and allows the children the greatest opportunity for continued contact with their other full-blood birth siblings and extended family members.\u201d The Rawsons now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b610 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion when it approved DPHHS\u2019s adoptive placement of M.B., E.B. and B.B. with Doug and Trudie Nesbitt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b611 The same standard of review applies to both termination of parental rights and custodial determinations. In both instances, the District Court\u2019s decision is afforded \u201call reasonable presumptions as to the correctness of the determination\u201d and therefore such decision will not be disturbed on appeal \u201cunless there is a mistake of law or a finding of fact not supported by substantial credible evidence that would amount to a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Matter </em>of S.P., 241 Mont. 190, 194, 786 P.2d 642, 644 (1990) (citation omitted). Our review for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>In re T.S.B., </em>2008 MT 23, \u00b6 17, 341 Mont. 204, 177 P.3d 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u00b6 12 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it approved DPHHS\u2019s adoptive placement ofM.B., E.B. and B.B. with Doug and Trudie Nesbitt?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">\u00b613 The Rawsons argue the District Court erred when it found there was not substantial credible evidence to show \u201cgood cause\u201d to deviate from the adoptive placement preferences as set forth in ICWA. The Rawsons also argue the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law were incorrect. More specifically, the Rawsons argue they meet all three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>factors in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) guidelines that demonstrate a \u201cgood cause\u201d exception to the adoptive placement preferences set forth in ICWA. First, the Rawsons argue the District Court should have deviated from the placement preferences because \u201cboth biological parents indicated directly to the district court their desires to have their three children remain with the Rawson[s].\u201d They also maintain that the State\u2019s argument that it was not appropriate for the court to consider the parents\u2019 wishes in this case, was based on the BIA guidelines being \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d Second, the Rawsons argue the District Court abused its discretion when it did not consider the physical or emotional needs of the children. Third, the Rawsons argue the District Court erred in its legal conclusion that ICWA defines \u201cextended family\u201d as adult persons who have adopted other siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b614 DPHHS asserts that \u201c[substantial credible evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings\u201d and DPHHS urges this Court to affirm the placement of the children with the Nesbitts. DPHHS argues that the \u201cgood cause\u201d exceptions in the BIA guidelines do not apply because the exception regarding the request of the biological parents \u201cis inapplicable in this case and provides no grounds to deviate from ICWA\u2019s placement preferences.\u201d Furthermore, DPHHS argues that the exception regarding the children\u2019s extraordinary physical or emotional needs does not apply because \u201cthe witnesses\u2019 testimony does not indicate that the children have \u2018extraordinary physical or emotional needs\u2019 that require \u2018highly specialized treatment.\u2019 \u201d Finally DPHHS claims that \u201c[c]ontrary to the [Rawsons\u2019] assertion, the court\u2019s conclusion that the [Nesbitts] qualified as \u2018extended family members\u2019 does not amount to a new definition of extended family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b615 The policies behind the passage of ICWA include the finding that \u201cthere is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and that the United States has a direct interest ... in protecting Indian children who are members of or are eligible for membership in an Indian tribe <em>...\u201d 25 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1901(3). Also, \u201can alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies and [] an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions ....\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901(4). Furthermore, Congress declared the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">[I]t is the policy of this Nation to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9E\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902. To implement these policies, ICWA establishes a preferred order for the adoptive placement of an Indian child, based on the presumption that following the preferred placement order is in the best interest of the child. A court must follow the preferred order unless it concludes good cause exists to deviate from the preferences. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). ICWAmandates that \u201c[i]n any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with (1) a member of the child\u2019s extended family; (2) other members of the Indian child\u2019s tribe; or (3) other Indian families.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(l)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"AFl\">\u00b616 Following the passage of ICWA, the BIA promulgated guidelines to assist state courts in the interpretation and application of ICWA. 44 Fed. Reg. 67,584-67,595 (Nov. 26, 1979). This Court has determined these guidelines are persuasive and that we apply them when interpreting ICWA. <em>In re </em>C.H., 2000 MT 64, \u00b6 12, 299 Mont. 62, 997 P.2d 776 (citations omitted). According to the guidelines, a party asking a court to deviate from the preferred placement order above has the burden of showing good cause exists to justify the deviation. 44 Fed. Reg. at 67,594. As explained in the guidelines, a determination of good cause shall be based on one or more of the following considerations: \u201c(i) [t]he request of the biological parents ... (ii) [t]he extraordinary physical or emotional needs of the child as established by testimony of a qualified expert witness, (iii) [t]he unavailability of suitable families for placement after a diligent search has been completed for families meeting the preference criteria.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. at 67,594, Fn. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b617 The Rawsons make three separate arguments as to why ICWA\u2019s adoptive placement preferences should not be followed. We will address each in turn. First, the Rawsons argue that the first of the criteria for establishing good cause is met because \u201cboth biological parents indicated directly to the district court their desires to have their three children remain with the Rawson[s].\u201d The text in the Federal Register contains a footnote with commentary elaborating on the three \u201cgood cause exceptions.\u201d In reference to the first exception, the footnote reads: \u201c[paragraph (i) is intended to permit parents to ask that the order of preference not be followed because it would prejudice confidentiality or for other reasons.\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. at 67,594, Fn. 3. This text indicates the purpose of this exception is to protect the biological parents\u2019 confidentiality, if they so choose. In this case, the biological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>parents were not seeking to protect their confidentiality. The Rawsons interpret the language \u201cthe request of the biological parents\u201d to mean that their request that the children be placed with the Rawsons should be considered in determining good cause. This interpretation, however, does not fit within the plain language contained in the guidelines. Thus, this exception does not apply, and the Rawsons did not argue any \u201cother reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b618  Second, the Rawsons argue the District Court \u201cabused its discretion when it did not consider the physical or emotional needs of the. children.\u201d In support of this assertion, they point to testimony by the occupational therapist and family support specialist who had worked with the children. The Rawsons assert these specialists \u201cexpressed concerns about potential problems with developmental delays and emotional harm with long term consequences to each child\u201d based on \u201cthe children\u2019s emotional and developmental set backs and delays they witnessed each time the children were returned from a visit with the Nesbitts.\u201d The BIA guidelines specify that the second exception applies \u201c[i]n a few cases [where] a child may need highly specialized treatment services that are unavailable in the community where the families who meet the preference criteria live\u201d and the guidelines recommend that \u201csuch considerations be considered as good cause ....\u201d 44 Fed. Reg. at 67,594, Fn. 3. This Court has held that, absent testimony showing it is <em>certain </em>that a child will experience trauma from a transfer of custody or develop an attachment disorder, \u201c[t]he risk that a child might develop such problems in the future is simply too nebulous and speculative a standard on which to determine that good cause exists to avoid the ICWA placement preferences.\u201d C.H., \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b619 In this case, the testimony of both the occupational therapist and the family support therapist indicated that overall the children were doing well. The occupational therapist had \u201cterminatefd] services\u201d to the children unless something came up and she agreed that the \u201ckids are doing pretty well.\u201d The family support therapist said that E.B. has made \u201cgreat gains,\u201d M.B. is \u201cdoing great now\u201d and no longer qualifies for her services, and B.B. still receives some therapy to help with his motor skills, but his other skills have developed well.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b620 While the therapists spoke to the gains the children had made, both expressed concerns about possible regression if the children were moved to a different home and were required to begin anew with forming trust bonds with caregivers. They based these concerns on their observations of the children after they had returned from visits to the Nesbitts. The occupational therapist testified that when she met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>with E.B. after such visits, E.B. exhibited \u201csevere tantrums,\u201d had \u201cregressed in all of her motor skills and in her sensory issues, was not able to self-regulate, was a very angry child, at times became mute ....\u201d The occupational therapist noted M.B. showed \u201c[v]ery clingy behavior\u201d and that in general the children exhibited \u201cclinginess\u201d and \u201canger\u201d and an \u201cinability to self-regulate and feel safe.\u201d She also concluded that her ongoing concern was with \u201cconsistency.\u201d The family support therapist indicated her concerns about the children, E.B. in particular, being removed from the Rawsons\u2019 care because she is \u201cconcerned about disrupting this bond that [E.B.] has created that\u2019s very strong with [the Rawsons], and that that could cause regression in so many of those skill areas\u201d that she has worked on with E.B. And, with M.B. and B.B. she is concerned because \u201cthey have created a bond and they\u2019re young, and if that bond was broken, then exhibiting similar characteristics [as E.B. did when she first began working with the therapists].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b621 While the concerns expressed by the therapists certainly show potential impacts on the children if ICWA\u2019s placement preferences are followed, these needs do not rise to the level of \u201cextraordinary physical or emotional needs\u201d requiring \u201chighly specialized treatment services that are unavailable in the community where the families who meet the preference criteria live,\u201d which, according to the guidelines, is what is required to demonstrate good cause to deviate from the preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"Aae\">\u00b622 Third, the Rawsons did not address the third good cause exception but argue the District Court erred in its legal conclusion that ICWA\u2019s definition of \u201cextended family\u2019 includes adult persons who have adopted other siblings. The Rawsons assert that \u201c[s]ibling connections are important but they do not rise to making new definitions of extended family.\u201d ICWA states that an \u201c \u2018extended family member\u2019 shall be as defined by the law or custom of the Indian child\u2019s tribe or, in the absence of such law or custom, shall be a person who has reached the age of eighteen and who is the Indian child\u2019s grandparent, aunt or uncle, brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, niece or nephew, first or second cousin, or stepparent ....\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b623 The District Court made the following conclusion of law: \u201c[a]bsent case law to the contrary, and in light of the testimony of the Little Shell Tribe ICWA expert witness, it is reasonable and logical to conclude that the adoptive parents of a Little Shell Indian child\u2019s full-blood birth sibling qualify as \u2018extended family members\u2019 within the meaning of the Act.\u201d Before the District Court made this conclusion, each side presented testimony from a qualified ICWA expert as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>interpretation of the definition of \u201cextended family member.\u201d The witness for the Rawsons testified that, in her knowledge of ICWA as well as tribal culture, the Nesbitts would not fall under the definition of \u201cextended family member\u201d in ICWA. She testified that even though sibling relationships are important, that doesn\u2019t mean all the siblings have to be in the same home. She also indicated that it was preferable for the children to be closer to their own tribal heritage in Montana rather than being placed in Washington. The witness for DPHHS, a member of the Little Shell Tribe, was asked whether \u201ca group of siblings, a sibling unit, is an important group in a child\u2019s life\u201d and she testified \u201c[v]ery much so, yes.\u201d She also testified that in the Little Shell culture, the tribe \u201cwould consider other persons as extended family\u201d beyond the list contained within ICWA\u2019s definition of \u201cextended family member.\u201d She concluded that placement with the Nesbitts \u201cwould be the best placement for the children ... because they need to be with their siblings. They need to grow up together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b624  The District Court determined this testimony was sufficient to support the conclusion that the Nesbitts would be considered \u201cextended family member[s]\u201d under ICWA. Absent caselaw to the contrary and because we afford a district court\u2019s decision \u201call reasonable presumptions as to the correctness of the determination\u201d we agree there exists substantial credible evidence to determine the Nesbitts fit within ICWA\u2019s definition of \u201cextended family member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b625 The District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining good cause did not exist to deviate from the placement preferences in ICWA and in placing the children with the Nesbitts. The District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions were supported by substantial credible evidence that there was not good cause to deviate from ICWA\u2019s placement preferences or to conclude the Nesbitts did not fit into the definition of \u201cextended family member\u201d as contemplated by ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b109-8\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-11\"> This case proceeded through the trial court as if ICWA applied. Indeed, the Rawsons pressed that argument on the District Court throughout these proceedings.
