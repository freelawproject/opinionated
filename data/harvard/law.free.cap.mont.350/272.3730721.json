We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court prejudice Price when it conducted eleven in-chambers conferences without Price present?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">\u00b64 Price comes before this Court for a third time. We affirmed Price\u2019s conviction in <em>State v. Price (Price </em>I), 2003 MT 373N, 319 Mont. 424, 82 P.3d 37 (Table), 2003 WL 23028878. We reversed the District Court\u2019s denial of Price\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief in <em>Price v. State (Price II), </em>2007 MT 307, 340 Mont. 109, 172 P.3d 1236. We remanded for an entry of an order by the District Court granting Price an opportunity to appeal based on his absence from eleven in-chambers meetings during his original trial. <em>Price II, </em>\u00b6 20. We derive from <em>Price I </em>and <em>Price II </em>the facts pertinent for this appeal. We will discuss additional facts as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">\u00b65 The State charged Price on August 21, 2001, with forcing his 14-year-old niece, C.W., to engage in sexual intercourse without her consent. C.W. lived in Lewistown with her mother and father, Cathy and Steve, and her 24-year-old half brother, Clint. Price lived in Lewistown with his wife, Faye, and two of their three daughters. Price and C.W.\u2019s mother are siblings and they have three other sisters, two of whom testified: Melinda \u201cMind/\u2019 Riehl (Mindy) and Shannon Rausch. At the time of the incident, Steve and Cathy were traveling to Colorado to return Clint\u2019s two small children to their mother, Clint\u2019s former wife. Clint could not personally transport his children home due to a conviction on a sexual offense that he had committed in Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">\u00b66 On August 10, 2001, Price, Faye, two of their daughters, C.W., and Clint decided to go boating on a nearby lake. When they returned to town, C.W. and Clint went to the store so that Clint could buy beer. C.W. wanted to attend a party with Clint. Price testified that he and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Faye were concerned for C.W.\u2019s safety and insisted that C.W. return to the Price residence rather than attend the party with Clint.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b67 After arriving at the Price residence, Price\u2019s daughter gave C.W. one of Price\u2019s dirty shirts to wear because C.W.\u2019s clothing was wet from the boating excursion. Clint and Price got into a physical altercation about where C.W. was going to stay that night. Clint ultimately left the residence. Price and C.W. went to look for Clint. C.W. was concerned about Clint\u2019s safety due to the amount of alcohol that he had consumed. They found Clint, but another argument soon erupted between Clint and Price. Witnesses to the altercation called the police. The police arrested Clint when they arrived at the scene and took Clint into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b68 C.W. and Price returned to Price\u2019s house. C.W. testified that she, Price, and Faye reclined on an air mattress to watch television. Price testified that only the women were on the air mattress and that he was on the floor. C.W. stated that Price began to rub her sides and chest after Faye fell asleep. C.W. claimed that Price eventually moved his hands below her waist under her clothing. Price woke Faye and took her upstairs. He then returned to the air mattress.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b69 C.W. testified that she told Price \u201cno\u201d at least 30 times, but he persisted with his touching. Price penetrated her vagina with his fingers and tongue and licked her breasts. Price eventually stopped touching C.W. He left the room. C.W. dressed and ran to a neighbor\u2019s house to get help. The neighbor called several of C.W.\u2019s friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u00b610 C.W. took a shower at her friend\u2019s house because she felt \u201cdirty and disgusting.\u201d C.W. went home and washed all of her clothing except her swimsuit top. Clint called C.W. from jail. C.W. told Clint that Price had molested her. Clint called C.W.\u2019s mother Cathy. Cathy had just returned home from Colorado. Clint told Cathy that Price had molested C.W. Cathy called the police. C.W. told Cathy what had happened in the presence of several police officers. Cathy took C.W. to the hospital. Doctors examined C.W. and completed a rape kit that included vaginal swabs. Cathy gave the swimsuit top to the police during the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\u00b611 Michelle Griffin, a forensic scientist at the Montana State Crime Lab, testified that she found trace amounts of saliva on C.W.\u2019s vaginal swabs. The sample did not contain sufficient amounts of saliva, however, to develop a DNA profile. Griffin further testified that she found four saliva stains on the inside of C.W.\u2019s swimsuit top. The DNA analysis of this saliva excluded Steve, Cathy, and Clint. Price\u2019s DNA profile proved consistent with the saliva stains. Price attributed the presence of his DNA on C.W.\u2019s swimsuit to his dirty shirt that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>daughter had loaned to C.W. C.W. had worn the shirt over her swimsuit top after returning from the lake. Price claimed that his nasal discharge on the shirt had transferred onto C.W.\u2019s swimsuit top.</p>\n<p id=\"AJz\">\u00b612 Timothy J. Whalen (Whalen) served as Price\u2019s trial counsel. Twelve in-chambers conferences took place throughout the trial. The District Court, counsel for the State, and counsel for Price discussed legal and procedural issues at the second and third conferences. The court excused a prospective juror at the fourth conference. The prospective juror felt that he could not be objective because his daughter had been a rape victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b613 The District Court and Whalen both questioned Juror Cantrell at the eighth conference. The court granted Whalen\u2019s motion to remove Juror Cantrell based on possible bias against Price. The District Court, Whalen, and the State discussed, and the court ruled on, evidentiary issues at the first, fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth conferences. The evidentiary issues involved Price\u2019s primary defense theories: 1) that Clint, not Price, had committed the crime, and 2) that C.W.\u2019s family had framed Price.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b614 Whalen attempted at these conferences to persuade the District Court to allow Price to introduce evidence of Clint\u2019s criminal history and other past acts. Whalen requested the court to allow Price\u2019s sister Mindy to testify that Clint had tried to rape one of her daughters. Whalen argued that Mindy\u2019s testimony would establish \u201ca strong possibility\u201d that C.W. and Clint had engaged in a sexual relationship. Price and his wife would testify, alternatively, that C.W. was afraid of Clint and that she was not afraid of Price. Mindy further would testify that C.W. had told her that C.W.\u2019s parents, Steve and Cathy, previously had interfered with the physical evidence from a rape that Clint allegedly had committed in Colorado. Steve and Cathy apparently had hoped to \u201cconfuse the DNA results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b615 Price was present for only one of the twelve conferences. Whalen purported to waive Price\u2019s right to be present at eight of the eleven conferences, after the court questioned him about Price\u2019s absence and prompted Whalen to waive Price\u2019s right. Whalen did not waive Price\u2019s right to be present in the other three conferences. Price was present at the ninth of the twelve conferences, and Whalen purported to have Price retroactively waive his right of presence at the preceding eight conferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u00b616 After the jury convicted Price, he retained Gary Wilcox (Wilcox) to handle his direct appeal. Price raised two evidentiary issues in that appeal. Price first argued that the District Court improperly had excluded evidence that would have established that Clint had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>committed the crime rather than Price. <em>Price I, </em>\u00b6 15. Price also contended that the court improperly had excluded evidence that would have demonstrated that C.W.\u2019s family had framed Price. <em>Price I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 19. We agreed with the District Court\u2019s decision to exclude the proposed evidence on the grounds that it was irrelevant and \u201chighly inflammatory.\u201d <em>Price I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b617 Price retained new counsel and filed a petition for post-conviction relief in the District Court. Price challenged several alleged errors by his trial counsel. Price also alleged that his appellate counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to appeal the issue of Price\u2019s absence from the in-chambers meetings and Whalen\u2019s waiver of Price\u2019s right to be present. The District Court found that Wilcox\u2019s failure to challenge Price\u2019s absence from the in-chambers meetings fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. The District Court concluded, however, that Whalen\u2019s errors did not prejudice Price. Price appealed the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for post-conviction relief. <em>See Price II, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b618 We agreed that Wilcox\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Price II, \u00b6 </em>14. We determined that Wilcox\u2019s failure to raise the issue of Price\u2019s absence from the in-chambers meetings created a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d of Price\u2019s appeal. <em>Price II, \u00b6\\ </em>15-16,19. We emphasized that the District Court had focused only on the three in-chambers meetings at which Whalen had not waived Price\u2019s right to be present. <em>Price II, \u00b6 </em>16. The District Court had not analyzed the other eight conferences from which Price was absent. <em>Price II, \u00b6 </em>16. We reversed the District Court\u2019s denial of the post-conviction petition. We remanded for an entry of an order by the District Court granting Price an opportunity to appeal based on his absence from the eleven in-chambers meetings. <em>Price II, \u00b6 </em>20. Price filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u00b619 We conduct a plenary review to determine whether a district court has violated a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at all critical stages of the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>State v. Roedel, </em>2007 MT 291, \u00b6 35, 339 Mont. 489, 171 P.3d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u00b620 <em>Did the District Court prejudice Price when it conducted eleven in-chambers conferences without Price </em>present?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\u00b621 Price argues that the District Court violated his state and federal constitutional rights when the court conducted eleven separate in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>chambers conferences without Price present. The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to be present at all criminal proceedings against him. <em>State v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, \u00b6 14, 307 Mont. 428, 41 P.3d 305. The defendant also has a due process right to be present \u201cwhenever his presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.\u201d <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, \u00b6 16, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244 <em>(citing Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2658, 2667 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b622 Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution expressly guarantees a defendant the right to appear and defend a criminal prosecution in person. The defendant has the legal right to be present during the proceeding of the trial whenever \u201canything is done which in any manner affects his right.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 17. A defendant\u2019s fundamental right to be present at the proceedings applies without exception to those stages deemed critical. <em>Roedel, </em>\u00b6 59; <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 37; <em>State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52, 327 Mont. 196, 113 P.3d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahz\">\u00b623 When considering whether a district court has violated the defendant\u2019s right to be present, we generally first have considered whether the court excluded the defendant from a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceeding. <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>2009 MT 60, \u00b6 25, 349 Mont. 335, 203 P.3d 834 (citing <em>State v. Mann, </em>2006 MT 160, \u00b6 15, 332 Mont. 476, 139 P.3d 159; <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 18). We also have considered whether the defendant waived his right to presence through a voluntary, intelligent, and knowing waiver. <em>See Tapson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26; <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b624 A district court\u2019s violation of a defendant\u2019s right to be present does not constitute automatic reversible error. <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 15. If we determine that the court has violated the defendant\u2019s right to be present, we consider \u201cthe effect the violation has on the defendant to determine whether the defendant suffered any conceivable prejudice.\u201d <em>Godfrey,</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWAk\">\u00b6 25 (citing <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 15). Where the record shows that the defendant was not prejudiced, we have affirmed. <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 25 (citing <em>Kennedy, </em>2004 MT 53, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 34, 320 Mont 161, 85 P.3d 1279). We have reversed where the lack of a complete record makes it impossible to say that there was no prejudice to the defendant. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b625  We conclude that Price\u2019s absence from the in-chambers conferences did not cause him prejudice, so we will not consider the initial questions of whether the conferences constituted \u201ccritical stages\u201d of the trial or whether Price validly waived his right of presence. We will assume for the purposes of our analysis that the conferences constituted critical stages, and that Price did not validly waive his right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\u00b626 In <em>Kennedy, </em>we determined that the district court had violated the defendant\u2019s right to be present when it excluded him from a conference in which the court questioned and ultimately removed a juror. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 27. We concluded that \u201csuch exclusion did not cause Kennedy prejudice\u201d because any opportunity that Kennedy missed to question the juror was mooted when the court took corrective action by removing the juror from the jury panel. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 34. We also emphasized the fact that we readily could assess the record for prejudice because it was not ambiguous with regard to the District Court\u2019s conversations with the excused juror. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-33 (distinguishing <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-33).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b627 In <em>Tapson, </em>the court entered the jury room during deliberations without the defendant, counsel for the defendant, or counsel for the State present. The court did not return for eleven minutes. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 11. We stated that \u201cthe general rule, \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, requires the defendant to, among other things, establish that the claimed error was prejudicial.\u201d <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 35. We did not require Tapson to meet this burden, however, as \u201cthe only means to meet that burden-the court record-was not preserved by reason of the commission of the error itself.\u201d <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 35. We determined that the deficit in the record made it impossible to conclude that Tapson did not suffer prejudice. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b628 The district court in <em>Riggs </em>twice spoke with jurors outside Riggs\u2019s presence. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42-45. Counsel for the State and counsel for the defendant attended both conferences. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43, 45. The first juror, a professor, had recognized a witness as one of his students. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 43. The court questioned the juror in an effort to confirm that the juror\u2019s knowledge of the witness would not affect his ability to be fair and impartial. Both counsel agreed that the juror could continue to serve. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b629 The court met with the second juror on the last day of the trial after the settlement of jury instructions. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 45. The juror expressed concern that he might have to forfeit non-refundable airline tickets if deliberations continued beyond that day. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 45. The court met separately with the juror and assured the juror that he would not need to forfeit his airline tickets, even if it meant that the jury would be required to deliberate into the night. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 45. We considered the record and determined that \u201cthe defendant has made no persuasive claim of prejudice arising out of the episodes under consideration.\u201d <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\u00b630 We likewise determined that the defendant had failed to prove prejudice in <em>DuBray v. State, </em>2008 MT 121, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 342 Mont. 520, 182 P.3d 753 (citing <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 54). DuBray claimed that the district court had violated his right to be present at all critical stages when it met with the jury foreman without DuBray present. <em>DuBray, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-35. The jury foreman reported that one of the jurors had claimed to be a psychic. The court met with the jury foreman, counsel for the State, and counsel for the defendant. <em>DuBray, </em>\u00b6 35. The jury foreman assured the court that the juror, who had informed two other jurors that she was psychic, was not the reason the jury had yet to reach a verdict. The court then discussed the issue with counsel outside the presence of the jury foreman. <em>DuBray, </em>\u00b6 35. The court met again with counsel and the jury foreman and instructed the jury foreman to return to the jury room and allow the deliberations to move forward. DuBray\u2019s counsel waived DuBray\u2019s presence at each of these on the record discussions. <em>DuBray, </em>\u00b6 35. We emphasized that DuBray\u2019s counsel had consented to the court\u2019s approach in addressing the jury foreman\u2019s concerns. We dismissed as \u201cpure speculation\u201d DuBray\u2019s claim that, if he had been present, he might have demanded that his counsel act differently. <em>DuBray, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b631 This Court recently addressed in <em>Matt </em>the issue of prejudice within a harmless error analysis. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 29. The Court stated that Matt\u2019s absence from an in-chambers conference did not affect the framework within which Matt\u2019s trial proceeded or necessarily render the trial fundamentally unfair. Matt\u2019s absence therefore constituted trial error, rather than the type of structural error that would require automatic reversal. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 43. The <em>Matt </em>Court then stated that we presume that such trial error prejudices the defendant, and that \u201cthe State has the burden to rebut the presumption by demonstrating there is no reasonable possibility the violation prejudiced the defendant in light of the interests the right of presence was designed to protect.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b632 We have referred, at times, to \u201charmless error\u201d in the context of critical stages cases and the potential for prejudice. <em>See e.g. Kennedy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-35; <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-31. We have not applied, before <em>Matt, </em>the type of harmless error analysis prescribed by <em>Van Kirk </em>for situations involving the admission of prejudicial evidence. <em>See State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 47, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. We have not required the State to satisfy a burden of proof. We have determined that the defendant did not make a persuasive claim of prejudice, <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 54; <em>DuBray, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36-38, or we have required no burden and simply examined the record to determine whether the violation caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>defendant to suffer prejudice. <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-21; <em>see also Kennedy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33-35; <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-33. This latter approach comports with our duty as an appellate court to review the entire record to determine whether the defendant has suffered prejudice. Section 46-20-701(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b633  The record is not ambiguous as to what occurred at the in-chambers conferences throughout Price\u2019s trial. Unlike the situation in <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 31, where no record existed of the court\u2019s foray into the jury room, we readily can assess for prejudice the District Court\u2019s actions at the conferences. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 33. Nothing that occurred at the conferences concerned or affected the framework within which Price\u2019s trial proceeded or necessarily rendered the trial fundamentally unfair. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 43. The conferences did not \u201ccontaminate!] the trial mechanism.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 43. The District Court\u2019s failure to include Price in the conferences at worst constituted trial error, rather than structural error that would require automatic reversal. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"AlI\">\u00b634 Price argues that his absence from the eighth conference, in which the District Court removed Juror Cantrell, \u201cis dispositive of this appeal.\u201d The State contends that the court\u2019s corrective action in removing Juror Cantrell benefited Price and did not deprive him of a fair trial. The court conducted a conference with Juror Cantrell after Juror Cantrell revealed that she previously had worked with Price\u2019s mom, Donna Givan. Givan later would testify as a defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"ARO\">\u00b635 Juror Cantrell informed the District Court that as she had walked out of the courtroom at the end of the previous day\u2019s proceedings, she had heard someone exclaim \u201cWell, what is she doing here?\u201d Juror Cantrell realized that the speaker was Givan. Juror Cantrell approached the court because she felt uncomfortable and did not want \u201csomeone coming up later and ... want[ing] a mistrial or something.\u201d Price\u2019s counsel, Whalen, asked Juror Cantrell if she might view Givan\u2019s testimony differently, \u201cconsidering the way [the comment] was said.\u201d Cantrell said \u201cNo,\u201d but then stated that \u201cI think it would make me really think about... what she says ....

I think it would make me feel like I would want to make sure that everything she said was the truth.\u201d Juror Cantrell continued \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that she is going to lie ... but... I think that you can kind of tell sometimes when people really aren\u2019t telling the truth.\u201d WTialen asked Juror Cantrell if she would view Givan\u2019s testimony with more skepticism after she heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the comment. Juror Cantrell initially responded \u201cNot really.\u201d Juror Cantrell then reconsidered and said \u201cSort of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b637 Whalen announced that \u201ceven though Juror Cantrell is reticent to state that she couldn\u2019t be objective,\u201d he had \u201cdeveloped a strong feeling that she took offense at the comment that Donna Givan made.\u201d Whalen demanded that the District Court remove Juror Cantrell from the jury because he felt she would view \u201cone of our key witness\u2019s ... testimony with skepticism.\u201d The District Court granted Whalen\u2019s request. The District Court stated that it also had the \u201cdistinct sense that there was a heightened scrutiny that [Juror Cantrell] was going to apply to this particular testimony.\u201d The court noted that \u201cif we had heard [Juror Cantrell\u2019s statements] initially in the voir dire it is likely that we would have struck her for cause.\u201d The prosecutor did not object to Juror Cantrell\u2019s removal. He too sensed that Juror Cantrell was \u201creally nervous and ... uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b638 Whalen, the District Court, and counsel for the State listened to Juror Cantrell\u2019s explanation and observed her demeanor. They all agreed that the court should remove Juror Cantrell based on her possible bias towards Price. The District Court mooted the potential prejudice towards Price when it removed Cantrell. <em>See Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"AMa\">\u00b639 Price claims for the first time on appeal that if he had been present he might have convinced his counsel to keep Juror Cantrell on the jury. Price entirely failed to mention Juror Cantrell at the post-conviction hearing at the District Court. Price\u2019s assertion contradicts his testimony at his post-conviction hearing regarding his feelings toward Juror Finkbeiner. The court seated Juror Finkbeiner after it removed Juror Cantrell. Juror Finkbeiner had failed to disclose during voir dire that he knew Price. Price failed to express any dissatisfaction with Whalen\u2019s motion to remove Juror Cantrell or with the court\u2019s decision to replace Juror Cantrell with Juror Finkbeiner. Price in fact conceded that he was not \u201ccomplaining that [Juror] Finkbeiner was on the jury panel that convicted [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b640 The State convincingly argues that \u201cit is unlikely that Price would have argued against his attorney\u2019s request to remove a juror whose knowledge of a key defense witness would cause the juror to view that witness\u2019s testimony with skepticism.\u201d Price\u2019s testimony at his post-conviction hearing regarding his satisfaction with the District Court\u2019s decision to seat a new juror bolsters the State\u2019s argument. Price\u2019s absence from the meeting with Juror Cantrell did not cause him prejudice. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33-35; <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b641 The State argues that Price\u2019s presence at the other in-chambers conferences in which the parties discussed evidentiary issues would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>have conferred, at most, a \u201cshadow benefit.\u201d <em>State v. Schenk, </em>151 Mont. 493, 499, 444 P.2d 861, 864 (1968). Price states that defense counsel in these conferences \u201cfrequently sought to present new facets on the defense theories: [Clint] was the real perpetrator; he was the source of the salivary amylase; the victim\u2019s family previously had tampered with evidence.\u201d Price emphasizes the same defense theories, however, that we previously rejected as irrelevant and \u201chighly inflammatory\u201d in <em>Price I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b642 We determined that Price\u2019s proffered evidence regarding the previous alleged evidence tampering \u201cwas irrelevant to the two theories in which the defendant asserted.\u201d <em>Price I, \u00b6 </em>19. We added that \u201cmore importantly, the Colorado evidence tampering in an unrelated case bears no relevance to the present offense.\u201d <em>Price I, \u00b6 </em>20. We stated that the proffered evidence would have confused the jury and was inadmissible under M. R. Evid. 403. <em>Price I, \u00b6\u00b6 </em>19-20. We likewise rejected Price\u2019s attempt to introduce evidence designed to show that Clint, not Price, committed the crime. <em>Price I, \u00b6 </em>26. We stated as a preliminary matter that we agreed with the State\u2019s observations that it would have been impossible for Clint to have sexually assaulted C.W., because he was in police custody when that incident occurred. <em>Price I, </em>\u00b6 19. We concluded that the District Court properly had excluded the proffered evidence under M. R. Evid. 404(b). <em>Price I, \u00b6\u00b6 </em>25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b643 Price failed to convince this Court in <em>Price I </em>that the evidence offered to support his defense theories was relevant or admissible. Price now claims that his absence at conferences in which his counsel attempted to introduce this same evidence to bolster these same theories caused him prejudice. Price\u2019s arguments on appeal in <em>Price I </em>were more cogent than anything he could have contributed during the in-chambers conferences. Price\u2019s ability to confer with his attorney would not have benefited him when the evidence Price sought to admit was inadmissible because of its highly inflammatory nature and the fact that it was irrelevant to his primary defense theories. <em>Price I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b644  We are convinced, based on our review of the complete record, that Price\u2019s absence from the conferences did not cause him any conceivable prejudice. <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 15. The District Court did not deprive Price of a fair and impartial trial. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 35. Price\u2019s absence from the in-chambers conferences did not constitute reversible error. <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u00b645 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-8\">JUSTICES WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"AiW\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b646 I concur in the result reached by the Court. However, I would reach that result by concluding that the State, although it did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244, satisfied the standard articulated in <em>Matt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b647 In <em>Matt </em>we held that where there has been a denial of the right to be present, prejudice is presumed. <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 38. \u201cIf the violation is not structural, then the State has the burden to rebut the presumption by demonstrating there is no reasonable possibility the violation prejudiced the defendant in light of the interests the right of presence was designed to protect.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b648 Our decision in <em>Matt </em>was issued on December 30, 2008, after the briefing on appeal had been completed in the present matter. Thus the parties and the District Court did not have the benefit of <em>Matt\u2019s </em>holding that the State has the burden to rebut the presumption of prejudice. Having reviewed the briefs and the record, I conclude the State did, nonetheless, demonstrate that there is no reasonable possibility that Price was prejudiced by his absence from the proceedings at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u00b649 Since the State satisfied the <em>Matt </em>burden, I would not, in the context of this case, engage in an analysis of whether <em>Matt </em>correctly imposes a \u201cburden\u201d on the State to rebut the presumption of prejudice (see the discussion in \u00b6 32 of the Court\u2019s Opinion).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b307-8\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u00b650 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">\u00b651 Inexplicably, the Plurality refuses to follow our recent decision in <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244. The Plurality\u2019s approach is not based on any new arguments or any intervening change in the law. Indeed, we reaffirmed <em>Matt\u2019s </em>analytical framework last month in <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>2009 MT 60, 349 Mont. 335, 203 P.3d 834. Nevertheless, the Plurality chooses not to follow this Court\u2019s precedents and instead applies the analysis argued by one of the <em>Matt </em>dissents. That approach and the rationale for it were considered and rejected by the <em>Matt </em>Court, and nothing has occurred during the last three months to justify the Plurality\u2019s refusal today to apply the holding of <em>Matt </em>to Price\u2019s right-of-presence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">\u00b652 In <em>Matt, </em>we held that if a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to be present has been violated, \u201cprejudice is presumed.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 38. Furthermore, we stated that if the right-of-presence violation does not constitute a \u201cstructural defect\u201d in the trial framework, \u201cthen <em>the State has the burden to rebut the presumption </em>by demonstrating there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>reasonable possibility the violation prejudiced the defendant in light of the interests the right of presence was designed to protect.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6 38 (emphasis added). We based this approach on the Supreme Court\u2019s well-established rule that \u201c \u2018[t]he State bears the burden of proving that an error passes muster under [the <em>Chapman </em>harmless-error] standard.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Matt, </em>\u00b6 35 <em>(quoting Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 630, 113 S. Ct. 1710, 1717 (1993), and citing <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 828 (1967)). As noted, we recently reaffirmed this burden in <em>Godfrey. See Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 33 (\u2018With this backdrop, we consider whether the State has met its burden.\u201d); <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 37 (\u201cSimilarly, here, based upon the record of these proceedings relative to the jurors\u2019 questions and the District Court\u2019s responses, we conclude that the State has demonstrated there is no reasonable possibility that Godfrey\u2019s exclusion from these proceedings prejudiced him in light of the interests his presence was designed to protect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b653 Today, however, the Plurality reverts to a simple analysis of the record without imposing any burden on the State. Plurality, \u00b6 32. This is the approach advocated by one of the <em>Matt </em>dissents. <em>See Matt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 51-52 (Warner, J., &amp; McKinnon, J., dissenting) (\u201cRather than place some sort of burden on the State at the appellate level, this Court should carefully examine the record to determine if the denial of the right to be present could have reasonably contributed to a conviction. . . . [A] defendant must make a persuasive claim to the appellate court that he was prejudiced.\u201d (paragraph break omitted)). Yet, this approach was implicitly rejected by the <em>Matt </em>Court and was explicitly rejected by those same Justices in Chief Justice Gray\u2019s concurring opinion. <em>See Matt, </em>\u00b6 64 (Gray, C.J., and Cotter, Nelson, &amp; Leaphart, JJ., specially concurring) (\u201c[W]e simply cannot-in the face of a violation of the constitutional right to be present at critical stages-ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s determination that the State bears the burden of proving that a constitutional error passes muster under the <em>Chapman </em>standard.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Ams\">\u00b654 Although the Plurality does not speak for a majority of this Court, today\u2019s Opinion nevertheless sends very confusing signals to the bench and bar. We need one clear test, which the majority of this Court already endorsed in <em>Matt, </em>and we need to apply it consistently.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b655 I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b308-6\">JUSTICE COTTER joins the Dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
