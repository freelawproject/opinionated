(Open A) appeals from two orders of the Fifth Judicial District, Madison County. The District Court granted Scott D. Hagedorn, Dawn M. Hagedorn, Imperial Ranches, Inc., Thomas R. Hughes, and Walsh W-Bar Ranch, Inc. (collectively Petitioners) summary judgment on their petition to extend the East Bench Irrigation District (EBID) boundaries. The District Court also denied Open A\u2019s motion to consolidate the boundary extension petition with a confirmation hearing on a new contract between EBID and the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). We affirm the judgment for the reasons stated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court provide Open A with sufficient opportunity to be heard on its objection to the petition to expand the EBID boundaries?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court properly grant Petitioners summary judgment on their petition to expand the EBID boundaries?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court properly deny Open </em>A\u2019s <em>motion to consolidate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A0M\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">\u00b66 The Missouri River rises in southwest Montana and flows 2,500 miles before it joins the Mississippi River near St. Louis, Missouri. The Missouri River ran almost completely uncontrolled before 1940, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) completed the 140-mile-long Fort Peck Reservoir in eastern Montana. The uncontrolled river flooded frequently. The floods caused substantial damage, especially in the states along the lower section of the river. Massive flooding in March, May, and June of 1943 inundated the Missouri River Basin and riveted public attention to the flooding problems. The June flood left the streets of Omaha and Kansas City navigable by boat. The 1943 floods prompted Congress to appropriate money for public works projects along the Missouri River and its tributaries. <em>See </em>Marian E. Ridgeway, <em>The Missouri River Basin\u2019s Pick-Sloan Plan </em>(U. Ill. Press 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b67 The Corps developed the \u201cPick Plan,\u201d named for its director Colonel Lewis Pick, to harness the Missouri. The Pick Plan emphasized flood control and navigation. The plan placed a lesser emphasis on hydroelectric power production at the major dams. The plan called for the construction of a nine-foot-deep, 300-foot-wide navigation channel from Sioux City, Iowa, to the mouth of the river. The plan also proposed 1,500 miles of levees on the lower river and five enormous reservoirs in the upper basin. Ridgeway, <em>The Missouri River Basin\u2019s Pick-Sloan Plan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b68 The BOR quickly completed the \u201cSloan Plan,\u201d its own Missouri River plan, after hearing about the Pick Plan prepared by the Corps. The Sloan Plan emphasized reclamation and irrigation. The plan proposed a catch basin of ninety dams and several hundred individual irrigation projects concentrated in the upper basin states of Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The BOR planned to build 17 power plants in order to offset the costs of its project. Ridgeway, <em>The Missouri River Basin\u2019s Pick-Sloan Plan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b69 Rather than choose between the competing plans, Congress ultimately opted to combine the two plans into a comprehensive \u201cPick-Sloan\u201d Plan for development of the entire basin. The combined Pick-Sloan Plan consisted of all the components of both plans. The BOR and the Corps each would construct and operate those portions of the project that it favored. Ridgeway, <em>The Missouri River Basin\u2019s Pick-Sloan Plan. </em>Congress approved the Flood Control Act of 1944, which included both the Pick and Sloan plans for comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>development of the Missouri River Basin. Flood Control Act of 1944, Pub. L. 78-534,-58 Stat. 887 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b610 BOR eventually developed the East Bench Unit of the Missouri River Basin Project in the late 1950s and early 1960s. BOR built the Clark Canyon Dam at the head of the Beaverhead River to impound surplus water flows from the Red Rock River and Horse Prairie Creek, which join to become the Beaverhead River. BOR planned for the water from the Clark Canyon reservoir to fully supply water for EBID. The reservoir also provides supplemental water for use within the Clark Canyon Water Supply Company (CCWSC). An order of the Madison County District Court formed EBID in 1957. The majority of the owners of existing water rights in the Beaverhead Valley formed the CCWSC the same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b611 EBID supplies irrigation water to its users pursuant to a contract executed between EBID and BOR. A district court decree ratified the initial contract in 1958. EBID and BOR recently negotiated a new contract. Under the new contract, BOR will allow only lands within EBID\u2019s boundaries to receive contract water. Confirmation of the new contract currently is pending in the Beaverhead County District Court in Cause No. DV-06-12986.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The Proposed Expansion of the East Bench Irrigation District</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b612 Petitioners are members of EBID and also own land inside the original EBID boundaries. Petitioners sought to expand the boundaries of EBID in January and February of 2007. The petitions requested that the District Court extend the boundaries of EBID to include approximately 585 acres that Petitioners have irrigated with water delivered through EBID irrigation works, but fall outside the original irrigation district boundaries. The canals, ditches, pipelines, and works of the EBID physically are capable of irrigating all of the land described in the petitions. Petitioners have in fact irrigated the lands described in the petitions for decades. The EBID Board of Commissioners and BOR both support the petitions to expand the EBID boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b613 Open A irrigates lands in the Beaverhead Valley with water rights diverted from the Beaverhead River. Open A holds a water right senior to the water rights held by EBID. Open A is not a member of CCWSC or EBID. Open A filed a Notice of Appearance on February 21, 2007, in the boundary extension proceeding. Open A objected to the EBID boundary extension. Open A\u2019s motion also sought to consolidate the boundary extension hearing with the pending contract confirmation hearing. Open A objects to the renegotiated contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>between EBID and BOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">\u00b614 The District Court scheduled a hearing for February 26, 2007, on the petitions to extend the boundaries of EBID. Open A appeared at the hearing and stated its objection to the boundary extension. The District Court noted that Open A\u2019s motion to consolidate also was before the court. The District Court deferred resolution of the EBID boundary extension until after it had resolved the question of whether to consolidate the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b615 Petitioners filed answer briefs to Open A\u2019s motion to consolidate. Open A filed a reply brief. The District Court denied Open A\u2019s motion to consolidate on April 25,2007. Open A filed an objection on May 15, 2007, to the petitions to expand the boundaries of EBID. Petitioners requested a scheduling conference before the District Court. Petitioners noted that the statute governing the extension of an irrigation district boundary provided \u201cno specific procedure for addressing the objections.\u201d Petitioners stated that they \u201canticipate asking the Court to dismiss the objections and respectfully request the Court\u2019s guidance in establishing the procedure and schedule to follow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWC\">\u00b616 The District Court conducted the scheduling conference on July 23, 2007. The parties engaged in extensive discovery. Petitioners filed motions for summary judgment on December 5, 2007. Petitioners argued that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether they had established the statutory elements to extend the EBID boundaries. Petitioners also contended that Open A had no standing to object to the boundary extension, as Open A had produced no evidence showing that it would be injured or in any way affected by the EBID boundary extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b617 Open A filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on December 6, 2007. Open A argued that the District Court should dismiss the petitions to extend the EBID boundaries. Open A argued that Petitioners had not established the legal requirements to expand the boundaries. Open A also claimed that the District Court did not have the authority to extend the EBID boundaries. Open A contended that a determination to expand the boundaries necessarily would involve a determination of existing water rights, and that such a determination rests exclusively with the Montana Water Court. Open A also argued that the District Court\u2019s approval of the boundary extension would ratify the Petitioners\u2019 past illegal irrigation of land outside the EBID boundaries with EBID water. Open A and Petitioners filed answer briefs and reply briefs to the respective summary judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u00b618 The District Court conducted a hearing on February 4, 2008, on the petition to extend the EBID boundaries. Petitioners and Open A argued their motions for summary judgment and argued the merits of the petitions to extend the EBID boundaries. The District Court granted Petitioners\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied Open A\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b619 The District Court concluded that Petitioners had met their burden to establish the absence of any genuine issue of material fact that would allow Open A to prevail. The court determined that Open A had not presented substantial evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact that would preclude summary judgment. The District Court concluded that Open A had not established that it would suffer injury or threatened injury as a result of the EBID boundary extension. The District Court filed an order, judgment, and decree on March 24, 2008, that extended the EBID boundaries to include the lands of the Petitioners. Open A appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b620 We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment, using the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Tin Cup Water and / or Sewer Dist. v. Garden City Plumbing &amp; Heating, </em>Inc., 2008 MT 434, \u00b6 21, 347 Mont. 468, 200 P.3d 60. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). If we reach the same conclusion as the district court, but on different grounds, we may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>Germann v. Stephens, </em>2006 MT 130, \u00b6 21, 332 Mont 303, 137 P.3d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b621 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to consolidate for an abuse of discretion. <em>Environmental Contractors, LLC v. Moon, </em>1999 MT 178, \u00b6 35, 295 Mont. 268, 983 P.2d 390. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or so exceeds the bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice. <em>McCormack v. Andres, </em>2008 MT 182, \u00b6 22, 343 Mont. 424, 185 P.3d 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">\u00b622 <em>Did the District Court provide Open A with sufficient opportunity to be heard on its objection to the petition to expand the EBID </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>boundaries?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">\u00b623 Section 85-7-1810, MCA, confers standing to be heard on petitions to extend irrigation district boundaries to all \u201cpersons whose rights may be affected by the proposed extension.\u201d Open A irrigates with water appropriated from the Beaverhead River. EBID also appropriates water from the Beaverhead River and supplies this water to Petitioners for irrigation. Open A, as an appropriator of a shared water supply with EBID, had standing to be heard in proceedings that potentially would affect the boundaries of EBID. <em>See Matter of Water Rights No. 101960-?41S, </em>249 Mont. 425, 430, 816 P.2d 1054, 1059 (1991); <em>Holmstrom Land Co. v. Meagher Cty. Newlan Creek, </em>185 Mont. 409, 425, 605 P.2d 1060, 1069 (1979), <em>superseded in part by statute. </em>We cannot agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Open A did not have standing to object to the petition to expand the EBID boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"AtH\">\u00b624 Section 85-7-1810, MCA, requires the district court to conduct a public hearing on a petition to extend the boundaries of an irrigation district. The district court then \u201cshall make an order either granting or denying said petition.\u201d The extension of such boundaries shall not deprive the lands already in the district of an adequate supply of water for irrigation purposes. Section 85-7-1810, MCA. The statute provides no further guidance on the factors that the district court should consider in deciding whether to extend the irrigation district boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b625 The District Court conducted the required public hearing on February 26,2007. Open A appeared at the hearing and objected. The District Court deferred resolution of the petitions to extend the EBID boundaries until after it had resolved Open A\u2019s motion to consolidate. The District Court denied the motion to consolidate on April 25, 2007. Petitioners requested a scheduling conference on the petition to expand the EBID boundaries. Petitioners noted that the statutes prescribed no specific procedure. Open A did not object to the motion for a scheduling conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b626 The District Court set a schedule for discovery and briefing. After extensive discovery, the parties filed joint motions for summary judgment. Open A filed a consolidated answer to Petitioners\u2019 motions for summary judgment, and a response brief to Petitioners\u2019 answer to its motion for summary judgment. Open A attempted in each brief to convince the court that it should deny the petitions to extend the EBID boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b627  The District Court also conducted a hearing on February 4, 2008. The District Court considered all pending motions regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>boundary extension. The court permitted Open A to argue extensively the substantive reasons that the court should deny the petition. We disagree with the District Court\u2019s determination that Open A lacked standing to object to the petition to extend EBID\u2019s boundaries. We conclude, however, that the District Court in fact provided Open A with ample opportunity to object to the petition to extend the EBID boundaries. Section 85-7-1810, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b628 <em>Did the District Court properly grant summary judgment to Petitioners on its petition to expand the EBID boundaries ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b629 We turn next to the narrow question of whether the District Court correctly interpreted the statutory requirements for expanding the boundaries of an irrigation district in granting summary judgment in favor of Petitioners. Sections 85-7-1808 to 1810, MCA, provide the limited statutory requirements for the extension of irrigation district boundaries. Section 85-7-1808, MCA, states that \u201cthe boundaries of any irrigation district may be extended at any time to include lands susceptible of irrigation by the works of the district.\u201d The proponent of the boundary extension must present to the district court a petition signed by the title holders of at least two-thirds of the lands proposed to be included in the irrigation district. Section 85-7-1808, MCA. The district court then must appoint a day for a public hearing and publish notice of the hearing. Section 85-7-1809, MCA. At the public hearing, the district court shall hear from those who may desire changes made in the proposed extension, all those whose lands are included or sought to be included in the district, and \u201call other persons whose rights may be affected by the proposed extension.\u201d Section 85-7-1810, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b630 Open A objects to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Petitioners\u2019 land is \u201csusceptible of irrigation.\u201d Section 85-7-1808, MCA. The District Court noted that the parties had argued \u201cat great length\u201d about the susceptibility of the lands in question to irrigation. The court considered Open A\u2019s argument that the lands were not susceptible of irrigation because Petitioners allegedly had no legal right to irrigate the lands. The District Court concluded, however, that \u201cthere is no persuasive authority ... to suggest that \u2018susceptible [of] irrigation\u2019 has any other meaning than its common meaning.\u201d The District Court noted that Petitioners had irrigated the land for decades with the works of EBID, and concluded that the land therefore was susceptible of irrigation for the limited purposes of the petition to extend the EBID boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b631 We construe a statute to ascertain the legislative intent and to give effect to the legislative will. <em>State v. Letasky, </em>2007 MT 51, \u00b6 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>336 Mont. 178, 152 P.3d 1288. We interpret a statute first by looking to its plain language. <em>Letasky, </em>\u00b6 11. We may not insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. Open A argues that the District Court incorrectly concluded that the lands were susceptible of irrigation because \u201cthe Petitioners\u2019 lands are not legally susceptible to irrigation with the EBID water supply.\u201d Open A provides no authority for the proposition that we should insert the word \u201clegally\u201d before \u201csusceptible of irrigation.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Open A also argues that the Petitioners\u2019 land is not susceptible of irrigation because it does not meet the definition of \u201cirrigable lands\u201d in \u00a7 85-7-2205, MCA. Open A provides no authority for its substitution of the term \u201cirrigable lands\u201d for the term \u201csusceptible of irrigation.\u201d Open A fails to establish that the legislature said \u201csusceptible of irrigation\u201d when it meant \u201cirrigable lands.\u201d <em>Letasky, </em>\u00b6 11; \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">\u00b632  We agree with the District Court that the term \u201csusceptible of irrigation\u201d means land that physically can receive irrigation water from the EBID works. Open A has provided no evidence to refute Petitioners\u2019 contention that the EBID works physically can irrigate the land. Open A in fact implicitly concedes that the land physically is susceptible of irrigation when it argues that Petitioners illegally have irrigated the land with EBID water in the past. The District Court correctly concluded that Petitioners had satisfied the statutory elements required for the petition to extend EBID and that Open A had not presented substantial evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment. <em>Tin Cup, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b633 Open A also argues that the District Court\u2019s decision to extend the EBID boundaries acted as a de facto adjudication of water rights in violation of the Montana Water Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction to interpret and determine existing water rights. Open A contends that the District Court\u2019s decision effectively approved the Petitioners\u2019 allegedly illegal past irrigation practices. Our decision to affirm the District Court determines only that the Petitioners\u2019 land physically is susceptible of irrigation by EBID works and that the Petitioners\u2019 land may be included in EBID boundaries and may be taxed by EBID.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b634  We do not determine whether the Petitioners legally may irrigate the land in question using EBID water. We do not approve any change in use, or increase in use, by the Petitioners or by EBID. We do not approve any change in point of diversion or place of use by the Petitioners or EBID. We do not pass judgment on the legality of Petitioners\u2019 past, present, or future irrigation of the land in question. All of these questions must be determined in the first instance by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Montana Water Court. <em>In re Petition of Deadman\u2019s Basin Users, </em>2002 MT 15, \u00b6 15, 308 Mont. 168, 40 P.3d 387. The District Court has no authority to issue a final adjudication of water rights. <em>Deadman\u2019s Basin, </em>\u00b6 15. Open A still may attempt to establish through the Montana Water Court that Petitioners\u2019 irrigation of the land using EBID water is illegal or infringes upon Open A\u2019s senior water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"At9\">\u00b635 We conclude only that the District Court properly granted summary judgment to the Petitioners on their petition to expand the EBID boundaries. We base our conclusion on Open A\u2019s failure to present substantial evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the narrow statutory elements required to extend the boundaries of an irrigation district. <em>Tin Cup, </em>\u00b6 22. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to extend the EBID boundaries, although we arrive at this conclusion based upon different grounds than the District Court. <em>Germann, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b636 <em>Did the District Court properly deny Open A\u2019s motion to consolidate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b637 Open A argues that the District Court should have granted its motion to consolidate the petitions to extend the EBID boundaries with the contract confirmation proceedings in the Fifth Judicial District, Beaverhead County. EBID filed a petition on November 20, 2006, for court approval pursuant to \u00a7 85-7-1957, MCA, of a renegotiated contract between EBID and BOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b638 Open A contends that the petitions to extend the EBID boundaries directly relate to the contract confirmation case. Open A asserts that the contract between BOR and EBID illegally extends the boundaries of EBID, as the contract foresees allowing EBID to irrigate approximately 28,000 acres. The 1957 contract authorized EBID to irrigate only 21,800 acres. Open A likewise challenges as illegal the petitions to extend the EBID boundaries in the Madison County case. Open A argues that both cases therefore raise common issues of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u00b639 M. R. Civ. P. 42(a) provides that a district court may consolidate cases when actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court. We will not overturn a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to consolidate absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Environmental Contractors, </em>\u00b6 35. The district court may deny a motion to consolidate even where two cases appear to involve common issues of law and fact if other factors convince the court not to consolidate. <em>Ass\u2019n of Unit Owners v. Big Sky of Mont., </em>245 Mont. 64, 86, 798 P.2d 1018, 1031-32 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u00b640 After reviewing both cases, the District Court determined that Open A had not established a nexus between the two cases and that there was no danger of conflicting or duplicative judgments. The court concluded that the two cases therefore did not involve common questions of law or fact. The court noted that the Petitioners were not parties to the contract or the confirmation hearing. The court emphasized that the procedures and issues that a court considers in a boundary extension are distinct from those considered in a contract confirmation. The court concluded that consolidation would force Petitioners to follow procedures and be involved in issues that did not involve them and thereby would cause Petitioners unnecessary delay and expense. The court stated that consolidation provided no advantage to anyone except, perhaps, Open A.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">\u00b641 The District Court properly considered M. R. Civ. P. 42(a) in its analysis of Open A\u2019s motion to consolidate. The District Court clearly delineated its reasons for denying Open A\u2019s motion. The record does not indicate that the District Court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or so exceeded the bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice. <em>McCormack, </em>\u00b6 22. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Open A\u2019s motion to consolidate. <em>Environmental Contractors, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b642  We emphasize again, however, that neither the petition to expand EBID\u2019s boundaries at issue in this appeal, nor the contract proceeding in Beaverhead County, can be used as a vehicle to circumvent the authority of the Montana Water Court to determine the priority of water rights, to determine the availability of water for irrigation in a particular area, and the appropriateness of any attempts to change the point of diversion or place of use of any water for irrigation. The Montana Water Court can address these matters in due course in any proceeding brought by an affected party.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b643 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
