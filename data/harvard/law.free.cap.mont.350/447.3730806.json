He appeals. We restate and discuss the issues raised as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b62 1. Did the District Court commit plain error by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>declare a mistrial or change the place of trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\u00b63 2. Did the District Court err in denying Taylor\u2019s challenge to a prospective juror?</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">\u00b64 3. Does the record on direct appeal show that Taylor\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective?</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">\u00b65 Taylor is the former sheriff of Petroleum County, which is Montana\u2019s least populated county. According to a newspaper article in the record which is dated January 23,2007, Petroleum County had 314 registered voters and a jury selection pool of approximately 100 citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">\u00b66 In July of 2006, a neighbor of rural Petroleum County resident Dennis Carmony, reported that Carmony\u2019s car-hauler trailer, which had been parked at Carmony\u2019s farm, was missing. Carmony, who was then out of state, contacted Taylor in Taylor\u2019s capacity as Petroleum County Sheriff and reported his trailer had apparently been stolen. However, at that time, Taylor did not make a report that the trailer was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">\u00b67 Taylor was terminated as sheriff on October 5, 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 20, 2006, his successor entered the missing trailer into a national stolen vehicle database. Shortly thereafter, Taylor was arrested in Utah driving a U-Haul truck which was towing Carmony\u2019s missing trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">\u00b68 Taylor was charged by information with theft for stealing Carmony\u2019s trailer. He was arraigned and pled not guilty. Taylor moved for change in the place of trial on the ground that he was well known as the previous sheriff of Petroleum County who had been fired and that there was substantial local prejudice against him. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u00b69 The case was tried to a Petroleum County jury on April 23 and 24, 2007. Among others, Taylor challenged prospective juror Meserve for cause. The District Court denied the challenge to prospective juror Meserve and Taylor exercised a peremptory challenge to remove him. Taylor exercised all of his peremptory challenges. The jury found Taylor guilty of theft by unauthorized control, a violation of \u00a7 45-6-301(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b610 Upon request, Taylor\u2019s trial counsel withdrew on August 13,2007. Taylor was sentenced September 10, 2007. Taylor is represented by new counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b611 This Court may in its discretion review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made, where failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>State v. Davis, </em>2003 MT 341, \u00b6 19, 318 Mont. 459, 81 P.3d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u00b612 We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Herman, </em>2009 MT 101, \u00b6 17, 350 Mont. 109, 204 P.3d 1254; <em>State v. Normandy, </em>2008 MT 437, \u00b6 13, 347 Mont. 505, 198 P.3d 834. If a district court abuses its discretion in denying a challenge for cause, the defendant uses a peremptory challenge to remove the challenged juror, and also exercises all of his peremptory challenges, we will reverse the judgment and order a new trial. <em>Herman, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>State v. Robinson, </em>2008 MT 34, \u00b6 7, 341 Mont. 300, 177 P.3d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u00b613 A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents mixed questions of law and fact which we review <em>de novo. State v. Russell, </em>2008 MT 417, \u00b6 32, 347 Mont. 301, 198 P.3d 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">\u00b614 <em>Issue 1: Did the District Court commit plain error by failing to </em>sua sponte <em>declare a mistrial or change the place of trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">\u00b615 Taylor claims on appeal that it was plain error for the District Court not to declare a mistrial or change the place of trial because of prejudicial comments made by prospective jurors which were heard by the entire venire panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">\u00b616 Taylor first points to a comment by prospective juror Meserve:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>PROSECUTOR: Well, that will be a conclusion, I suppose, that the jury as a whole has to make as well but specifically what you have heard do you think that there is anything about that that has made an impression upon you or set your mind in a certain fashion that you don\u2019t believe you could be fair and impartial and judge this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">MESERVE: I cannot answer that honestly because I know from what I understand from Dennis that the man perjured himself and-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b617 Taylor argues the prejudicial effect of this statement was then compounded by \u201copinions and references\u201d made by two prospective jurors who were also county commissioners. These two prospective jurors said they had discussed the case with witnesses who were expected to testify and that because of those conversations they felt they might not be fair jurors. These prospective jurors did not state what they had heard or what their opinions were.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b618  No motion for a mistrial was made. Nor was the motion to change the place of trial renewed. The plain error doctrine is to be employed sparingly, on a case-by-case basis, considering the totality of the circumstances of each case. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 19. We conclude that the comments made during voir dire did not result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u00b619 <em>Issue 2: Did the District Court err in denying Taylor\u2019s challenge to a prospective juror?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\u00b620 A juror may be challenged for cause if the juror has a state of mind in reference to the case or to the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party. Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. In determining whether to grant a challenge for cause, the court must examine both the statutory language and the totality of the circumstances. <em>Normandy, </em>\u00b6 22. If voir dire raises serious doubts about the ability to be fair and impartial the juror should be removed. <em>Herman, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Normandy, </em>\u00b6 22. However, a district court does not have to remove a prospective juror for cause just because the juror has heard something about the case or expresses concerns about remaining impartial but believes that he or she will fairly weigh the evidence. <em>Herman, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>State v. Braunreiter, </em>2008 MT 197, \u00b6 10, 344 Mont. 59, 185 P.3d 1024. To determine whether a serious question has arisen regarding a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>review his or her responses as a whole. <em>State v. Harville, </em>2006 MT 292, \u00b6 9, 334 Mont. 380, 147 P.3d 222; <em>State v. Golie, </em>2006 MT 91, \u00b6 10, 332 Mont. 69, 134 P.3d 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b621 Taylor complains the District Court erred in denying his challenge for cause to prospective juror Meserve. He argues the record shows Meserve was biased because he had talked with Carmony about the missing trailer. The prosecutor questioned him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">PROSECUTOR: Mr. Meserve, the same question for you. Do you think there is anything about your dealings with Mr. Taylor that would make it difficult for you to sit in judgment here today in this trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">MESERVE: Not if that\u2019s what the evidence said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">PROSECUTOR: Well, that will be a conclusion, I suppose, that the jury as a whole has to make as well but specifically what you have heard do you think that there is anything about that that has made an impression upon you or set your mind in a certain fashion that you don\u2019t believe you could be fair and impartial and judge this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">MESERVE: I cannot answer that honestly because I know from what I understand from Dennis that the man perjured himself and-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">PROSECUTOR: Now-now, we don\u2019t want to get into anything specifically but I guess my only response, Mr. Meserve, is, as I-and I will keep harping on this, that the only thing that we will be able-that any of us will be able to rely upon in this case is what you hear in the Courtroom. It doesn\u2019t matter what you have heard. It doesn\u2019t matter what the rumor was or even anything about that, anything you have read-only what you hear in the Courtroom and what the Judge instructs you on the law. Do you think you can do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">MESERVE: Well, I guess if you are doing your job I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATu\">PROSECUTOR: I will try. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I don\u2019t want to be coy about this. It\u2019s real important. It\u2019s very important for the State that we have jurors come into this thing with an open mind. We don\u2019t want anybody with a preconceived notion about guilt or innocence and so that\u2019s why my questions to Mr. Meserve and I appreciate him bringing that up and I will come back to you in a little bit and we will-we will iron that out but if you don\u2019t feel because of what you know that there is any way you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>can be fair and impartial either to the Defendant or to the State then I-I need to know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">You think you can be fair and impartial and render a verdict on the evidence, Mr. Meserve?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">MESERVE: If that\u2019s what the evidence shows I can be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">PROSECUTOR: .... We have covered a lot of ground. Is there anybody that\u2019s in that situation where they don\u2019t feel that they could be fair and impartial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">PROSECUTOR: Mr. Meserve?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">MESERVE: I guess so if that\u2019s what the evidence says. It\u2019s going to be a little tough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">\u00b622 Defense counsel also questioned potential juror Meserve:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: You also indicated earlier, I think, in response to the prior questions that you had some concerns about your discussions!-]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">MESERVE: A little bit, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: And would you agree with me that it would be a little bit-would you want to be-have Mr. Taylor on the same jury if you were charged with this offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-13\">MESERVE: I don\u2019t believe it would make much difference. Depends on what comes out of that box up there where the people are talking out of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-14\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Mr. Meserve, you are a friend of Dennis Carmony; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-15\">MESERVE: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-16\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: I hate to beat the same horse but I want to know whether or not you can truly put aside your friendship for him and make an independent non-biased decision based on what you hear from that chair right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-17\">MESERVE: Well, it ain\u2019t like we are married. I am not!-] If the evidence comes out I can do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-18\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: You would do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-19\">MESERVE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-20\">\u00b623 Meserve stated he had heard from Carmony that Taylor had perjured himself. He did not say he had formed an opinion that Carmony was correct. Meserve consistently stated he would make an independent, non-biased decision based on what the evidence showed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>He made a commitment to consider only the evidence introduced at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b624  Considering Meserve\u2019s responses as a whole, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Taylor\u2019s challenge for cause to juror Meserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b625 <em>Issue 3: Does the record on direct appeal show that Taylor\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b626 To determine whether there was constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, we apply the two-prong test adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984). The test requires the defendant to prove (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. To determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, we must determine \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u00b627 Before applying the <em>Strickland </em>test, however, we must determine whether the claim for ineffective assistance of counsel is record-based. \u201cClaims involving \u2018omissions of trial counsel frequently are ill-suited for direct appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting <em>State v. Meyers, </em>2007 MT 230, \u00b6 10, 339 Mont. 160, 168 P.3d 645).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">Generally, in addressing ineffective assistance of counsel claims we ask \u2018why\u2019 counsel did or did not perform as alleged and then seek to answer the question by reference to the record. If the record on appeal explains \u2018why,\u2019 we will then address the issue on appeal. If the claim is based on matters outside the record on appeal, we will refuse to address the claim and allow the defendant to file a postconviction proceeding where a record can be developed as to \u2018why\u2019 counsel acted as alleged, thus allowing the court to determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective or merely a tactical decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-9\"><em>State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 34, 336 Mont. 17, 153 P.3d 591 (citing <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, 30 P.3d 340).</p>\n<p id=\"AVI\">\u00b628 Taylor claims trial counsel was ineffective for numerous reasons: failure to renew a motion to change the place of trial, ineffective voir dire, failure to move to suppress evidence, failure to argue certain issues at trial, failure to adequately cross-examine witnesses, improperly conceding the value element of the offense charged, and failing to offer an additional jury instruction. From the record before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>us, we cannot determine why Taylor\u2019s trial counsel acted as he did and whether counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective or merely a tactical decision. Thus, we will leave Taylor\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel to a postconviction proceeding, should he choose to commence such under Title 46, Chapter 21, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b629 Affirmed, without prejudice to the assertion of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a postconviction proceeding.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, RICE, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-15\"> Petroleum County utilizes the commission-manager form of county government.
