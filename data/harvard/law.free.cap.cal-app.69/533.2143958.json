H. Nielsen is \u201cthe duly appointed, qualified and acting county superintendent of schools of the County of Butte\u201d and respondent is the county auditor thereof. August 31, 1923, C. H. Nielsen, as such county superintendent, and petitioner executed the following instrument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cI, C. H. Nielsen, Superintendent of Schools, Butte County, State of California, hereby appoint Mrs. Josie E. M. Nielsen as supervising teacher in the schools of Butte County, for the term ending June 1, 1924, at an annual salary of Three thousand three hundred ($3300) Dollars ($2700 of which is designated as salary and $600 as traveling expenses), one-ninth of which salary shall be payable on the first of each calendar month following the first of September until nine payments shall have been made. The above payments shall be made in requisitions drawn upon the county auditor by me upon the Supervision fund of Butte County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201c (Signed) C. H. Nielsen,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">\u201cSuperintendent of Schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">\u201cDated Sept. 1, 1923.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">\u201cI hereby accept the conditions stated above and agree to serve as supervising teacher in the Butte County schools for the term specified above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-11\">\u201c(Signed) Josie E. M. Nielsen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASD\">At all times mentioned in the complaint Josie E. M. Nielsen was a duly qualified teacher, holding a certificate authorizing her to teach in the elementary and secondary schools of the state. She at once entered upon the discharge of her duties of \u201csupervising the work of teaching in the rural schools\u201d of the county \u201cand ever since said date has faithfully and regularly performed each and every duty pertaining to said position, if any such position exists, and has faithfully and regularly discharged the duties and obligations\u201d of the aforesaid agreement of employment. October 1, 1923, C. H. Nielsen, as such superintendent of schools, executed and delivered his \u201corder and warrant\u201d purporting to authorize the payment of petitioner\u2019s salary for the preceding month, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>presented the same to respondent and requested respondent to \u201callow, approve and audit\u201d the same, but respondent refused to do so. There were at all times sufficient moneys in the \u201cemergency and supervision fund\u201d of the county, apportioned under the provisions of section 1858, subdivision 3, of the Political Code, to pay petitioner\u2019s said demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Butte County is operating under a freeholders\u2019 charter, framed pursuant to the provisions of article XI, 'section T1/^, of the constitution. (Stats. 1917, p. 1791; Stats. 1923, p. 1554.) Article VII of the charter relates to \u201ccounty schools.\u201d Section 1 thereof provides for the election of a \u201cboard of county school trustees\u201d consisting of one member from each supervisorial district of the county. Section 3 provides that the board of county school trustees shall \u201cappoint a county superintendent of schools\u201d who must be \u201ca certified teacher, having a regular elementary or high school certificate of the state of California, who has had not less than five years\u2019 experience as a teacher or educational administrator, or both; two years of which shall have been in the five years immediately preceding his appointment. He need not be an elector of Butte County, but must reside in the county during his term of office. The term of office of the superintendent of schools shall be two years for the first appointment, unless sooner removed or recalled, and if reappointed the superintendent shall hold office for four years, unless sooner removed or recalled.\u201d Section 5 provides that, \u201cin addition to the duties prescribed by general laws,\u201d the county superintendent of schools shall discharge certain other duties. Such additional duties, however, are not inconsistent or in conflict with the duties of a county superintendent of schools as provided by the general laws of the state. Section 7 provides: \u201cThe general law shall apply to and govern the conduct of the schools of the County of Butte and of the officers provided for the superintendence thereof, except as otherwise provided in this charter.\u201d The state constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">\u201cA superintendent of schools for each county shall be elected by the qualified electors thereof at each gubernatorial election; provided, that the legislature may authorize two or more counties to unite and elect one superintendent for the counties so uniting.\u201d (Art. IX, see. 3.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>It is apparent that the qualifications, manner of selection and term of office of county superintendent of schools prescribed by the charter are not the same as those provided by the constitution. Respondent argues that by reason of such, differences the office, or \u201cposition,\u201d of \u201ccounty superintendent of schools,\u201d under the charter \u201cis not the . . . office of superintendent of public schools created by the Constitutioft, and upon which alone the powers contained in the Political Code are cast.\u201d Section of article XI requires that a county charter must be \u201cconsistent with and subject to the Constitution.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Elkus, </em>59 Cal. App. 396, 404 [211 Pac. 34, 38], this court, in construing a like provision relative to city charters, said: \u2018 \u2018 This restriction applies to and qualifies every power conferred upon the chartered city. Notwithstanding such restriction, however, if the municipality is given express authority by the constitution to do a particular thing contrary to some general provision thereof, \u2018the more specific provision controls the general. \u2019 <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Election Commrs., </em>126 Cal. 404, 411 [58 Pac. 932, 935].) \u201d Section 7% not only authorizes but expressly requires that county charters \u201cshall provide . . . for sheriffs, county clerks, treasurers, recorders, license collectors, tax collectors, public administrators, coroners, surveyors, district attorneys, auditors, assessors \"and superintendents of schools, for the election or appointment of said officers, or any of them, for the times at which and the terms for which, said officers shall be elected or appointed, and for their compensation, or for the fixing of such compensation by boards of supervisors, and, if appointed, for the manner of their appointment.\u201d The foregoing provisions specifically authorize a county to provide in its charter for the manner of selection and term of office of county superintendent of schools. If it be conceded that the provisions of the charter relative to the qualifications for the office are unauthorized, it does not follow that the other provisions relating to the office are void or that the office is other than that created by the constitution. There is no contention that Nielsen does not have all the qualifications prescribed by the constitution and laws of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>From a consideration of all the provisions of section <em>7Y2 </em>it clearly appears that the office of superintendent of schools mentioned therein is the constitutional office of superintendent of schools created by article IX, section 3. Section 7% requires that county charters \u201cshall provide . . . for the powers and duties of boards of supervisors and all other county officers; . . . provided, that the provisions of such charters relating to the powers and duties of boards of supervisors and all other county officers shall be subject to and controlled by general laws. . . . Whenever any county has framed and adopted a charter, and the same shall have been approved by the legislature, as herein provided, the general laivs adopted by the legislature in pursuance of sections four and five of this article, shall, as to such county, be superseded by said charter as to matters for which, under this section it is competent to make provision in such charter, and for which provision is made therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided.\u201d Section 4 therein referred to has no bearing upon the question under consideration. Section 5 provides: \u201cThe legislature, by general and uniform laws, shall provide for the election or appointment, in the several counties, of boards of supervisors, sheriffs, county clerks, district attorneys, and such other county, township, and municipal officers as public convenience may require, and shall prescribe their duties and fix their terms of office. ...\u201d The office of superintendent of schools is not mentioned in section 5, nor is it included in the general language thereof, for it would be illogical to conclude that such general provisions were intended to authorize the legislature to provide for the \u201celection or <em>appointment\u201d </em>and term of an officer whose election and term of office are specially provided for by the constitution.  Whatever uncertainty, therefore, may exist as to whether charter provisions prescribing the duties of other officers supersede the general laws upon the same subject matter <em>(Woolwine </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>182 Cal. 388 [188 Pac. 569]), it is clear that such provisions relating to the powers and duties of county superintendent of schools are \u201csubject to and controlled by general laws.\u201d This conclusion is in harmony with other provisions of the constitution relating to public schools and with the construction thereof by the legislature and the courts. \u201cThe legislature shall provide a system of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>common schools.\u201d (Const., art. IX, sec. 5.) \u201cArticle IX of the Constitution makes education and the management and control of the public schools a matter of state care and supervision. . . . The legislature is directed, in section 5, to provide for \u2018a system of common schools.\u2019 . . . The term \u2018system\u2019 itself imports a unity of purpose as well as an entirety of operation, and the direction to the legislature to provide \u2018a\u2019 system of common schools means <em>one </em>system which shall be applicable to all the common schools within the state.\u201d <em>(Kennedy </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>97 Cal. 429, 431 [32 Pac. 558]; <em>Burch </em>v. <em>Colombet, </em>104 Cal. 347, 353 [38 Pac. 45]; <em>San Francisco </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>163 Cal. 346, 352 [125 Pac. 751]; <em>Stern </em>v. <em>City Council of Berkeley, </em>25 Cal. App. 685, 689 [145 Pac. 167].) Plaving reached the conclusion that Nielsen holds the office of superintendent of schools created by the constitution and that his duties as such are \u201csubject to and controlled by general laws,\u201d whatever additional duties may be provided by the charter, the provisions of the charter may be dismissed from further consideration herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The first subdivision of section 1858 of the Political Code provides, among other things, that the county superintendent shall ascertain the number of teachers to which each district is entitled by calculating one teacher for every thirty-five, or fraction thereof, of pupils in average daily attendance for the next preceding school year, and \u201cone additional teacher for each three hundred pupils in average daily attendance,\u201d and that \u201che must calculate one additional teacher for the county . . . for each five hundred pupils or a major fraction thereof in average daily attendance in the aggregate in those school districts of the county ... in each one of which there were less than three hundred pupils in average daily attendance . . . for the next preceding school year. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The third subdivision provides: \u201cOne thousand four hundred dollars shall be apportioned to each school district for each and every teacher allowed to it; <em>provided, </em>that one thousand four hundred dollars shall be apportioned to each county or city and county 'for each teacher allowed on the aggregate average daily attendance of pupils in attendance in the various school districts, each of which had less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>three hundred pupils in average daily attendance for the next preceding school year and the funds thus apportioned shall constitute an emergency and supervision fund under the control of the superintendent of schools of the county or city and county, and shall be used by him as provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The eighteenth subdivision of section 1543 provides: \u201cThe superintendent of schools of the county, or city and county, shall use the money allowed and apportioned under section one thousand eight hundred fifty-eight, third, of this code, as an emergency and supervision fund, for the employment of duly qualified teachers to supervise the work of teaching in the school districts of the county, or city and county, which had less than three hundred pupils in average daily attendance during the next preceding school year, for the payment of the salaries of teachers employed by him to visit, at least twice a month, and to instruct pupils and to direct the education of pupils who live more than five miles from the nearest public school in the district of which they are residents, and such other pupils residing in the school district as may not be able to attend the public school for reasons which are deemed good and sufficient by the superintendent of schools of the county, or city and county in which such pupils reside; and for employing and pajdng the salary of teachers when unexpected emergencies arise, requiring the services of teachers and no other means of supplying teachers are available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">There can be little doubt of the superintendent\u2019s authority to employ petitioner to perform the services provided for in the contract of employment and to agree with her upon the compensation to be paid therefor. The law does not contemplate that the \u201cemergency and supervision fund\u201d shall remain idle, and no officer other than the superintendent is authorized to expend the same. The corresponding additional money apportioned to every district having an average daily attendance of three hundred pupils, or more, is under the control of the trustees thereof, and is probably intended to provide, \u2022 in whole or in part, for the cost of supervising the work of teaching in the particular district to which the money is apportioned. The trustees of the smaller districts, however, are given no control over the additional moneys apportioned to the county for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>supervision of the \u201cwork of teaching\u201d in such districts, but the law provides that such fund shall be \u201cunder the control of the superintendent of schools\u201d and that he \u201cshall use\u201d the same \u201cfor the employment of duly qualified teachers to supervise the work of teaching\u201d in the smaller schools.  Neither teachers nor supervising teachers are public officers. This is clear, not only from the duties to be performed, but from the terms of the sections of the Political Code under consideration, which authorize the \u201cemployment\u201d of supervising teachers. Public officers are elected or appointed rather than employed. The argument, therefore, that a construction of those sections in accordance with \u25a0 appellant\u2019s contention would show an unlawful delegation <em>j </em>of power to th\u00a7 superintendent to fix the salary of public offi<em>I </em>cers is not well taken. It does not appear in what manner the superintendent can use any part of such money \u201cfor the employment\u201d of a supervising teacher without entering into an agreement of employment with such teacher. The duties of the superintendent in the use of the moneys in the emergency and supervision fund are similar to those of school trustees in the use of moneys apportioned to their districts. It is a matter of legislative discretion whether the control of either fund shall be committed to a single officer or to a board. The fund under the control of the superintendent is not only limited but small in amount.  The purposes for which the moneys therein may be used are clearly defined. The superintendent is not, therefore, given uncontrolled and unguided discretion in the expenditure of public funds. It is not presumed that he will abuse the authority vested in him. \u201cLaws are not made upon the theory of the total depravity of those who are elected to administer them; and the presumption is that municipal officers will not use these small powers villainously or for purposes of oppression and mischief.\u201d <em>(In re Flaherty, </em>105 Cal. 558, 562 [27 L. R. A. 529, 38 Pac. 981, 982]; <em>In re Holmes, </em>187 Cal. 640, 647 [203 Pac. 398].) The principle of law announced in <em>Tarpey </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>190 Cal. 593, 601 [213 Pac. 983], is controlling here. It is there said: \u201cThe provision in section 1 authorizing the state engineer to employ such engineers, attorneys, and other assistants as he may deem necessary, and to fix their compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>tion, does not contravene the rule announced in <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>85 Cal. 408 [24 Pac. 868], for two reasons : First, 'because the assistants here provided for are not officers but mere employees: second, because the discretion as to the number to be employed is not unguided, as it was in the Farrell ease.\u201d Laws have been held valid giving, administrative officers of the state much greater power and broader discretion in the use of public funds than is here vested in the county superintendent of schools. <em>(Ryan </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>65 Cal. App. 181 [223 Pac. 1027], and eases cited therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"ABp\">The contract of employment provides that payment for the services to be rendered shall be made \u201cby money from the supervision fund of Butte County.\u201d Respondent contends that there is no such fund known to the law. Conceding that the contention is sound, the provision of the contract referred to may be disregarded. The essential provisions of the contract. are that certain services are to be rendered and that compensation therefor shall be given at the rate specified. The law designates the fund, and the only fund, out of which payment shall be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The contract provides that petitioner shall be paid \u201can annual salary of three thousand three hundred ($3,300) dollars ($2,700 of which is designated as salary and $600 as traveling expenses).\u201d The evident intention of the parties to the contract, inartificially expressed in the parenthetical clause, is that the petitioner shall be paid an annual salary of $3,300, she to pay her own traveling expenses, estimated to be $600 a year. It is a matter of common knowledge that the expense of traveling from school to school during the year, in a county as large as Butte, must be heavy. Respondent contends that under the contract, if valid, the petitioner will be entitled to the full year\u2019s salary regardless of whether she works or not or whether she is able to work.  It is elementary that recovery can be had under a contract for services only upon performance of such services. In this case the parties have stipulated that ever since the first day of September, 1923, the petitioner has \u201cfaithfully and regularly performed each and every duty pertaining to said position\u201d of supervising teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Respondent suggests, rather by way of illustration than as argument, that petitioner is the wife of the superintendent and that, since her earnings are community property, the husband is interested in the contract of employment, contrary to the provisions of section 920 of the Political Code, which provides that county officers \u201cmust not be interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity.\u201d Since it does not appear from the petition or the stipulated facts that the parties to the contract are husband and wife, the question thus raised cannot be decided on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Respondent seems to contend that the \u201cspirit of the law\u201d requires the employment of a teacher for every $1,400 apportioned to the emergency and supervision fund of the county, and that therefore the superintendent abused his discretion in agreeing to-pay one teacher a salary of $3,300 a year.  It is clear from a reading of section 1858 that the term \u201cone thousand four hundred dollars\u201d is used in the third subdivision thereof as a convenient factor in computing the amounts to be apportioned to the several districts and to the emergency and supervision fund and that it has nothing to do with the number of teachers to be employed, either by the trustees of the districts or by the superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The most serious question raised by respondent is whether the superintendent is authorized to allow and draw his requisition for petitioner\u2019s salary. Section 4041 of the Political Code provides: \u2018 The boards of supervisors, in their respective counties shall have jurisdiction and power, under such limitations and restrictions as are prescribed by law: ... 12. To examine, settle, and allow all accounts legally chargeable against the county, except salaries of officers, and such demands as are authorized by law to be allowed by some other person or tribunal, and order warrants to be drawn on the county treasurer therefor.\u201d Section 4091 provides: \u201cThe auditor must issue warrants ... on the treasurer, in favor of all persons entitled thereto, in payment of all claims and demands chargeable against the county, which have been legally examined, allowed, and ordered paid by the board of supervisors. The auditor must also issue warrants on the treasurer for all debts and demands against the county, when the amounts are fixed by law, or are authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>by law to be allowed by some person or tribunal other than the board of supervisors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The school funds are not county moneys in the ordinary sense, which would permit their use for general county purposes, but they are particular funds set aside for specific purposes. \"While the supervisors are authorized and required to levy taxes for the support of the schools, they are given no voice in the control or expenditure of the moneys raised for school purposes, unless it be in the single instance under consideration. On the other hand, the control and expenditure of all school moneys, other than such as are under the control of school trustees and boards of education, are placed in the hands of the county superintendent of schools, to be used and ordered paid by him without any action on the part of the board of supervisors. Where trustees fail or neglect to do so, the superintendent may employ a janitor for the school and pay therefor by issuing \u201chis requisition upon the county school fund apportioned to such district\u201d (sec. 1543, subd. 13) ; appoint a teacher and \u201cdraw his requisition upon the county auditor, who shall draw his warrant upon the fund of such district for the expense incurred\u201d (see. 1545); repair school buildings, provide suitable outhouses and \u201cadorn the ground with fruit and ornamental trees and shrubbery, . . . and pay for it on his requisition upon the county auditor, who shall draw his warrant payable out of any money to the credit of the district\u201d (sec. 1546).; purchase a flag and \u201cdraw his warrant on the current expense fund of the district in payment\u201d therefor (sec. 1546).' The county superintendent is authorized to \u201cdraw his requisition upon the county auditor, who shall draw his warrant on the unapportioned county school fund to pay the expense of the county institute.\u201d (Sec. 1564.) In the use of the moneys in the institute and library funds \u201cwarrants may be drawn by the auditor upon the request of the county superintendent.\u201d (Sec. 1565.) \u201cThe county superintendent shall draw his requisition on the county auditor who shall draw his warrant on the unapportioned county school fund to pay the expenses of holding trustees\u2019 meetings.\u201d (Sec. 1566.) In certain cases of children residing more than five miles from a schoolhouse, \u201cthe superintendent of schools may provide an extra teacher for, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>or may provide transportation for such children to the public school. The salaries of such teachers and the cost of such transportation shall be paid out. of the county unapportioned fund.\u201d (Sec. 1577, subd. 1.) \u201cThe superintendent shall determine all outstanding indebtedness\u201d of a lapsed district, \u201cand shall draw his requisition upon the county auditor in payment thereof.\u201d (Sec. 1582, subd. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In the light of this uniform practice of authorizing the county superintendent of schools to use and allow claims against all school funds not under the control of school trustees or boards of education, it is not difficult to discover the legislative intent in the comprehensive terms of sections 1858 and 1543, placing the \u201cemergency and supervision fund under the control of the superintendent of schools\u201d and providing that he \u201cshall use the money . . . for the employment of duly qualified teachers to supervise the work of teaching\u201d in the smaller districts, \u201cfor the payment of the salaries of teachers employed by him\u201d to instruct certain pupils unable to attend school, and \u201cfor employing and paying the salary\u201d of an emergency teacher. If it was the intention to depart from the legislative policy which has been followed for many years and place the allowance of demands against this particular school fund in the hands of the board of supervisors under the general provisions of section 4041, singularly inappropriate language was employed to manifest that intention. The intention to authorize the superintendent of schools to employ supervising teachers and draw his requisition in payment of their salaries is reasonably certain from the terms of sections 1858 and 1543, and this conclusion is fortified by a consideration of the other sections of the Political Code to which reference has been made herein. The requisition alone, however, is not sufficient to authorize the county treasurer to pay the amount thereof. \u201c The treasurer must . . . disburse the county moneys and all other money placed in his custody by official authority only on county warrants issued by the county auditor, except on settlement with the state.\u201d (Pol. Code, see. 4101, subd. 6.) It is contended that \u201cthe duty of the auditor with respect to this kind of a claim is discretionary and not merely ministerial. With respect to such a duty <em>mandamus </em>will not lie to compel the officer to draw the warrant unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>an abuse of discretion has been shown.\u201d <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>39 Cal. App. 453, 457 [183 Pac. 820].)  Where, as here, the facts are all admitted and but one conclusion can be drawn therefrom, and that in favor of the claimant, the auditor has no discretion to refuse to issue his warrant. <em>(Dufton </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>190 Cal. 577, 580 [213 Pac. 949].)  Where one has. a substantial right which may be enforced by <em>mandamus, </em>\u201cand there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, he is entitled as a matter of right to the writ.\u201d <em>(Gay </em>v. <em>Torrance, </em>145 Cal. 144, 148 [78 Pac. 540]; <em>Inglin </em>v. <em>Hoppin, </em>156 Cal. 483 [105 Pac. 582].)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">On the fourteenth day of November, 1923, the court sustained respondent\u2019s demurrer to the petition. The petitioner declined to amend and, on the following day, judgment was entered denying the prayer of the petition. On the twenty-first day of November, 1923, a second judgment was entered to the same effect as the first. Petitioner appealed from both judgments. Since the first judgment was a complete determination of the cause, the court was without jurisdiction to render the second, and it is, therefore, void. To avoid confusion, however, it is deemed proper to clear the record of both judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The judgments are reversed, with direction to the trial court to overrule the demurrer to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Plummer, J., and Hart, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">A petition by respondent to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on January 5, 1925.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
