On May 12,1973, defendant\u2019s salesman, William Carpenter, sold a Kirby vacuum cleaner to Janice J. Fernandez, residing at 303 East Haven Court South, Columbus, Ohio 43227, by written contract, which sale is admitted to come within the definition of \u201chome solicitation sale\u201d under R. C. Section 1345.21 (A), and which defendant is admitted to come within the definition of \u201cSeller\u201d under R. C. Section 1345.21 (C). A copy of the contract, admitted into evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>as \u201cState\u2019s Exhibit No. 1,\u201d was left with Mrs. Fernandez by Mr. Carpenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">2. On May 16,1973, Mrs. Fernandez personally returned State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 by hand delivery to the office of defendant. At the bottom Mrs. Fernandez had written her intention to cancel the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">3. On May 16,1973, after Mrs. Fernandez\u2019s visit to the defendant\u2019s office, Mr. Carpenter returned to her home and offered her a $15.00 cash allowance or sales refund to keep the vacuum cleaner and perform the contract previously executed. Mrs. Fernandez accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">4. On May 17, 1973, Mr. Carpenter returned State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 to Mrs. Fernandez\u2019s home together with a cheek made payable to \u201cJanice Fernandez\u201d in the amount of $15.00, admitted into evidence as \u201cState\u2019s Exhibit No. 2.\u201d State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1, contained the only notice of her intention to cancel given by Mrs. Fernandez to Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The key issue for the court to determine is whether the cancellation notice of a home solicitation sale contract must be mailed, as opposed to hand delivered, to be effective as a cancellation under R. C. Section 1345.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">R. C. Section 1345.22 provides in part, \u201c* * * Cancellation is evidenced by the buyer <em>giving </em>written notice of cancellation to the seller at the address stated in the agreement or offer to purchase.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The phrase \u201cgiving written notice \u2019 \u2019 obviously requires a writing but is ambiguous as to the means of delivery as notice is given by hand delivery and by mail in a multitude of legal contexts. We must look elsewhere in the statutes for evidence of the General Assembly\u2019s intention. The sentence \u201cWritten notice of cancellation shall be effective upon postmarking * * *\u201d in R. C. Section 1345.22, without a comparable sentence stating the time of effect for a hand delivered cancellation, points toward a legislative intent that mail be the only means of cancellation. R. C. Section 1345.23(C) provides, \u201cUntil the seller has complied with tiffs section the buyer <em>may </em>cancel the home solicitation sale by notifying the seller by certified mail of his intention to cancel.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The prosecutor points to the permissive word \u201cmay\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>in this sentence as indicating the permissive use of mailed notice and implying the propriety of other means of delivering notice. The correct reading, however, is that the word \u201cmay\u201d refers to the freedom of the buyer to cancel if he so desires, and the only means listed for carrying out the buyer\u2019s wish is \u201cby notifying the seller by certified mail of his intention to cancel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">R. C. Section 1345.23(B), which requires the contract to alert the buyer to his right to cancel with a printed warning, tells the buyer that he \u201cmay cancel this agreement or purchase by mailing a written notice to the seller.\u201d This language is clear, unambiguous and written for the laymen. Certainly, this shows the General Assembly\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">With this reading, R. C. Section 1345.24 (the section that defendant is charged with violating), which provides \u201cIn a home solicitation sale, the seller shall record the postmark of any cancellation made pursuant to Section 1345.22 of the Revised Code and shall retain both the notice of cancellation and the postmarked envelope in which it was sent for the period in which an action to enforce the sale could be commenced <em>* </em>* *, \u201d adds further proof to the conclusion that the General Assembly intended that certified mail be the only legally effective means of cancelling a home solicitation sales contract under Chapter 1345 of the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">As the hand delivered cancellation notice was ineffective under R. C. Chapter 1345, the delivery of State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1, a copy of defendant\u2019s contract with Mrs. Fernandez written notice of intention to cancel on it, was not a \u201ccancellation made pursuant to Section 1345.22 of the Revised Code\u201d and defendant-seller was under no duty to retain the evidence of cancellation. Therefore, the court finds the defendant Not Guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
