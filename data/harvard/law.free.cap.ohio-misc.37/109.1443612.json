S. C. \u00a751, <em>et seg. </em>The cause is now before the Court on the motion of defendant railroad for change of venue under 28 U. S. O. \u00a71404(a). Defendant requests that we transfer this case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting at Catlettsburg, Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">Plaintiff seeks to recover damages for injuries suffered by him while in the employment of defendant railroad at its yards in Russell, Kentucky. Plaintiff claims residence within this judicial district.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Under section. 1404(a), this Court may exercise a broad discretion in motions to transfer. <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick </em>(1955), 349 U. S. 29. In an FELA action, however, the Supreme Court has stated that the right to select a forum is a \u201csubstantial right.\u201d <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Grand Trunk Western Rwy. Co. </em>(1949), 338 U. S. 263, 266. This Court has accordingly given substantial weight to that privilege. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Rwy. Co., </em>Civil Action No. 5786 (Order of Feb. 5, 1965, Peck, J.); <em>Broughton </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Rwy. Co., </em>310 F. Supp. 1353 (S. D. Ohio 1968, Porter, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In the instant ease, defendant argues that plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum <em>(i. e., </em>this judicial district in which he resides) should not be given substantial weight in our consideration of its change of venue motion. Defendant points out that plaintiff originally filed his cause of action in the State Court of Birmingham, Alabama. According to the supporting affidavit and exhibits, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the state suit after defendant had moved to dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction. Since plaintiff did not initially file suit in this Court, defendant urges that plaintiff\u2019s subsequent selection of this forum should not be a dominant factor in a section 1404(a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In support of its argument, defendant cites to us a case decided by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Druffel </em>(6th Cir. 1958), 253 F. 2d 680 <em>cert. den. </em>358 U. S. 821, which arose out of this Court. In the <em>Lemon </em>case, Judge Druffel granted a change of venue motion, which was sustained by the Sixth Circuit in its denial of plaintiff\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus to direct the District Court to nullify its order. Because the <em>Lemon </em>case bears a striking factual similarity with the case at bar, we believe that an extended analysis of <em>Lemon </em>is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The plaintiff in <em>Lemon </em>first filed an FELA action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, at Catlettsburg, against the same defendant as in the instant case \u2014 the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co. Plaintiff moved to dismiss the suit, which was granted. Thereafter, plaintiff filed his action in this District Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The defendant then moved to transfer the case back to the District Court in Catlettsburg. Judge D ruff el granted the motion over plaintiff\u2019s objeetion.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">G-eographically, the court in Catlettsburg was apparently more convenient than the District Court in Cincinnati. Plaintiff was a resident of Ironton, Ohio, which is only eight miles from Catlettsburg and about 140 railroad miles from Cincinnati. The scene of the accident was Ashland, Kentucky, which is approximately four miles from Catlettsburg and 146 railroad miles from Cincinnati. Catlettsburg was also closer for all of the probable witnesses, except for the medical witnesses who treated plaintiff in Cincinnati. The controlling factor, however, in the Sixth Circuit\u2019s approval of Judge Druffel\u2019s transfer order was the initial filing of the suit in the Eastern District of Kentucky, at Catlettsburg. This indicated to the Court that \u201cexcept for the question of medical witnesses, that forum [the District Court at Catlettsburg] would be the one preferred by the petitioner.\u201d 253 F. 2d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Similar to the <em>Lemon </em>case, plaintiff and all of the probable witnesses in this suit, except for plaintiff\u2019s medical witnesses, reside closer to Catlettsburg than Cincinnati. In addition, the site of the accident at Russell, Kentucky, is 11 miles from Catlettsburg and approximately 147 miles from Cincinnati. In view of these facts, and since plaintiff initially filed suit in Alabama, defendant contends that plaintiff\u2019s subsequent filing in this Court should not prevent the granting of its change of venue motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">We do not find defendant\u2019s reasoning persuasive. Defendant has overlooked an essential point of the <em>Lemon </em>opinion: Judge Druffel transferred the case back to a forum for which plaintiff had initially exhibited a preference. On the other hand, defendant asks us to transfer this case to a forum which plaintiff has shown a marked determination to avoid, and that, of course, is his privilege. His decision to file suit in the Birmingham, Alabama State Court, over 400 miles from his residence, underscores such determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Furthermore, as other courts have noted, the problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>of transporting witnesses does not present the same difficulty to a railroad as it does to a private person. <em>Broughton </em>v. <em>Norfolk </em>&amp; <em>Western Rwy. Co., supra, </em>at 1355; <em>Hohler </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. R. Co. </em>(W. D. Pa. 1956), 140 F. Supp. 487, 489. Nor does it seem proper for defendant to object to any inconvenience caused to plaintiff by his selection of this Court. <em>Cline </em>v. <em>New York Central R. R. Co. </em>(N. D. Ohio 1961), 192 F. Supp. 206, 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\">For these reasons, we do not think that a trial in this Court would constitute an imposition upon the Court or upon the defendant. We therefore deny defendant\u2019s motion for change of venue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
