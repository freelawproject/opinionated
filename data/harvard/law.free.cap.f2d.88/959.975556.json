The court below found the former contention was the fact and entered a decree in favor of the materialman and against the appellant vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">On due consideration had, we find ourselves in accord with the court below. After negotiations, a letter embodying the contract was written by libelant addressed to Zubic, who owned the vessel, which strongly supports libelant\u2019s contention that it agreed simply to furnish material, and the weight of the proof is to the same effect. The letter makes no mention of Zubic\u2019s steamer; it makes no mention of design or installation, but speaks simply of material: \u201cWe are pleased to furnish you the following material,\u201d \u201ctrusting we may be favored with your.order for this material\u201d; it does not provide for installation and delivery is \u201cf. o. b. our works.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">Without entering into the further contentions made, all of which have been duly considered, we affirm the decree below, but, in view of the very long delay of the parties in disposing of the case, and as a warning against such delays, we direct that all interest allowances in this case be reduced to 3 per cent. With such modification, the decree below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
