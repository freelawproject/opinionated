Wilder as a witness, who was given the departmental definition of total and permanent disability, and was then asked: \u201cBearing in mind that definition, Doctor, have you an opinion as to whether or not Arthur J. Eide was totally and permanently disabled within this definition prior to July first, 1919?\u201d. The witness replied \u201cI think he was, yes.\u201d ' Another doctor testified in answer to a question of appellee that on May 16, 1929, the soldier was totally and permanently disabled. Another doctor, called by appellee, testified in answer to a question by appellee, that at the time the witness was testifying, the soldier was totally and. permanently disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-25\">Appellee concedes that this evidence is inadmissible. U. S. v. Spaulding, 293 U.S. 498, 506, 55 S.Ct. 273, 79 L.Ed. 617; U. S. v. Stephens (C.C.A.9) 73 F.(2d) 695; U. S. v. Sullivan (C.C.A.9) 74 F.(2d) 799; U. S. v. Sampson (C.C.A.9) 79 F.(2d) 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-26\">No objection was made to the testimony, and the admission thereof was not assigned as error. Under these circumstances, appellee contends that the admission was not reversible error. Rule 11 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>this court. This court1 has heretofore held to the contrary. U. S. v. White (C.C.A.9) 77 F.(2d) 757, 758; see, also, Du Vall v. U. S. (C.C.A.9) 82 F.(2d) 382, 385. Appellee contends, however, that U. S. v. White, supra, was overruled by U. S. v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555. That case is not in point. Appellee says: \u201cIt is our understanding that in argument in the Supreme Court, counsel for the government relied heavily upon the decision of this Court in United States v. White. * * * \u201d If that statement is true, there is little reason to believe that U. S. v. White, supra, was overruled in U. S. v. Atkinson, supra, because the latter case makes no mention of U. S. v. White. On the authority of U. S. v. White, supra, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
