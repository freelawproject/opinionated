It found that the practice of the petitioner in stamping the term \u201csectional overlay\u201d upon its ornamental pieces of silverware was misleading, had the capacity and tendency to deceive purchasers into buying what they did not intend to buy. Moreover, that in so doing, the petitioner placed in the hands of wholesalers or retailers the means of deceiving ultimate purchasers; that the petitioner thus unfairly competed in trade in interstate commerce to the prejudice of the public in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\"> Pursuant to section 5, petitioner filed this petition seeking to set aside the order. Our duty therefore is to examine the record to ascertain whether the findings are supported by the evidence. Federal Trade Comm. v. Curtis Pub. Co., 260 U.S. 568, 43 S.Ct. 210, 67 L.Ed. 408; Federal Trade Comm. v. Paramount Famous-Lasky Corp., 57 F.(2d) 152 (C.C.A.2). To sustain the order of the Commission, it is essential to find that the methods used are unfair and that they are used in interstate commerce and that the proceeding instituted for a cessation thereof is in the interest of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Petitioner admits it is engaged in interstate commerce. We therefore inquire into the evidence of unfair competition and public interest. The Commission found \u201csectional overlay\u201d to mean in the trade a quality mark denoting additional value in silverware. This finding, supported by evidence, is conclusive. Federal Trade Commission Act, \u00a7 5; Federal Trade Comm. v. Winsted Hosiery Co., 258 U.S. 483, 42 S.Ct. 384, 66 L.Ed. 729; Federal Trade Comm. v. Algoma Lumber Co., 291 U.S. 67, 54 S.Ct. 315, 78 L.Ed. 655. Misleading representation of a product constitutes an unfair method of competition within the intent of section 5. Federal Trade Comm. v. Winsted Hosiery Co., supra; Indiana Quartered Oak Co. v. Federal Trade Comm., 26 F.(2d) 340 (C.C.A.2), certiorari denied 278 U.S. 623, 49 S.Ct. 25, 73 L.Ed. 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\"> On this record, it is established that the petitioner who sells silverware in interstate commerce caused its silver known as the \u201cMartha Washington\u201d pattern to be manufactured with all pieces stamped \u201csectional overlay.\u201d Its sets are know as staples and ornamental pieces. Its staples were in fact overlaid, but its ornamentals were not. Letters and words stamped on ornamental pieces which are not overlaid tend to mislead purchasers.. Buyers testified to being so misled. If a purchaser is induced to purchase because petitioner\u2019s product is represented as sectionally overlaid, that violates section 5 even if the purchaser did not lose actual value or quality by reason of the false representation. Federal Trade Comm. v. Algoma Lumber Co., supra; Federal Trade Comm. v. Balme, 23 F.(2d) 615, 620 (C.C.A.2). Indeed, even where the purchaser benefits by the deception it is misleading. See Pillsbury v. Pillsbury-Washburn Flour-Mills Co. 64 F. 841 (C.C.A.7). But it is shown by the evidence that the term \u201csectional overlay\u201d indicated to the public additional value and increased use and permanency of the article. Petitioner\u2019s contention that the sectional overlay is visible to the naked eye is disputed. At any rate, each purchaser is not by law charged with the duty of making a critical inspection of; the petitioner\u2019s product to be guided by his own judgment. Indiana Quartered Oak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Co. v. Federal Trade Comm., supra; see Florence Mfg. Co. v. Dowd, 178 F. 73, 75 (C.C.A.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">An alleged recognized custom to stamp a set of silverware with the words \u201coverlay\u201d where the staples only were in fact sectionally overlaid is urged as an excuse. Witnesses, both dealers and purchasers, testified that, except in the instance of very few manufacturers, they did not stamp ornamental pieces \u201csection-ally overlaid.\u201d The petitioner\u2019s conduct cannot be condoned. The petitioner argues that the custom was changed when the code authority under the N.I.R.A. (48 Stat. 195) established a new standard of industry, and that since December, 1933, it has not stamped staples or ornamental pieces \u201csectionally overlaid.\u201d Even if this were so, since the petitioner asserts the legal right to use its misleading designation, it is the continuing duty of the Commission to issue, and of the court to affirm and enforce, an order to cease and desist. Here, there is no assurance that there would be a permanent discontinuance. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Federal Trade Comm., 258 F. 307, 6 A.L.R. 358 (C.C.A. 7); Fox Film Corp. v. Federal Trade Comm., 296 F. 353 (C.C.A.2). A mere discontinuance of the unfair competition method is no defense, nor is it sufficient to deny the enforcement order particularly where the petitioner insists it has the right to continue. Federal Trade Comm. v. Wallace, 75 F.(2d) 733 (C.C.A.8); Guarantee Veterinary Co. v. Federal Trade Comm., 285 F. 853 (C.C.A.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Clearly this proceeding is in the public interest and well within the requirement of the act. Federal Trade Comm. v. Balme, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Order sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
