He is a Hindu of the Sikh caste, and belongs to the Pubhana Tribe. He asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>that he last entered the United States in June, 1923, from Mexico, at a point two or three miles west of Mexicali, Lower California, Mexico, and Calexico, California, and that from the time of his entry until May, 1932, he resided in Northern California, Utah, Nevada, and Wyoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">On the other hand, an assistant to the United States Secretary of Labor, on August 3, 1934, issued a warrant of arrest against the appellant, in deportation proceedings, alleging that the appellant landed at \u201can unknown port\u201d of the United States subsequently to July 1, 1924, in violation of sections 3 and 19 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, as amended (8 U.S.C. A. \u00a7\u00a7 136 and 155), and of section 13(a) and (c) of the Immigration Act of May 26, 1924 (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213(a) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">After a number of hearings, the assistant to the Secretary of Labor issued a warrant of deportation against the appellant, on the same grounds as those contained in the warrant of arrest. The appellant thereupon filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the court below. After due proceedings had, the lower court entered an order that the writ theretofore issued be discharged, that the proceedings be dismissed, and that the appellant be remanded to the custody of the immigration authorities. From that order, the present appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">In subdivision (n) of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 136, it is provided that natives of certain sections of Asia shall be excluded from admission into the United States. Among those excluded, both from' admission and from citizenship, are natives of any part of India. United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, 261 U.S. 204, 215, 43 S.Ct. 338, 341, 67 L.Ed. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 155, it is .provided that, \u201cAt any time within five years after entry, any alien who at the time of entry was a member of one or more of the classes excluded by law\u201d shall be deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">The text of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213(a) and (c) is in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">\u201c(a) No immigrant shall be admitted to the United States unless he (1) has an unexpired immigration visa * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\">\u201c(c) No alien ineligible to citizenship shall be admitted to the United States unless such alien (1) is admissible as a non-quota immigrant under the provisions of subdivision (b), (d), or (e) of section 204 of this title, or * * * (3) is not an immigrant as defined in section 203 of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">Finally, in 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 214, it is provided that: \u201cAny alien who <em>at any time </em>after entering the United States is found to have been at the time of entry not entitled under this subchapter to enter the United States, or to have remained therein 'for a longer time than permitted under this subchapter or regulations made thereunder, shall be taken into custody and deported,\u201d etc. (Italics bur own.)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">The \u201csubchapter\u201d referred to in the foregoing provision is the Immigration Act of 1924, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 et seq., and the provision in question is section 14 of that act (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 214).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">Accordingly, the question of the date of the appellant\u2019s entry is the crucial one in the instant case. If he entered the United States before July 1, 1924, the effective date of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 213 and 214, supra, the appellee is now barred from deporting him, under the limitations provision of five years in 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 155, supra. For the effective date referred to above, see section 31(a) and (c) of the Act of May 26, 1924, c. 190, 43 Stat. 169. Section 31(c) specifically provides : \u201cIf any alien arrives in the United States before July 1, \u2018 1924, his right to admission shall be determined without regard to the provisions of this Act, except section 23.\u201d Section 23 (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 221) places upon the alien the burden of proving lawful entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-15\">If, therefore, the appellant entered the United States after July 1, 1924, the appellee may deport him \u201cat any time\u201d. Ohara v. Berkshire (C.C.A.9) 76 F.(2d) 204, 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-16\">Since the ultimate question herein relates to the date of the appellant\u2019s entry, we will summarize the evidence bearing upon this point, \u2022 in order to ascertain whether such evidence sustains the findings of the assistant to the Secretary of Labor, to the effect that the appellant \u201clanded at an unknown port subsequent [ly] to the 1st day of July, 1924,\u201d and the finding of the Board of Review that the appellant was in Mexico early in January, 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-17\">In the first place, we will trace the numerous and serious discrepancies in the appellant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-18\">When he was first examined by an immigrant inspector at El Centro, Cal., on July 9, 1934, the appellant testified that he last entered the United States in June, J923, from a point two or three miles west 'of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Mexicali; that he was accompanied by Karm Singh, Sudargl Singh, Gunda Singh, Arjan Singh, and a Mexican boy; that the appellant and the four other men each paid the Mexican boy $200, to take them to Stockton, Cal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The questioning then veered off to the appellant\u2019s movements before reaching the Mexican border. He stated that he first went from Pubhana, his home, to Shanghai, and then to Tientsin, where, for eight months, he was a watchman for the Asia Oil Company; that from Tientsin he went Kobe, Japan, remaining for 19 days; that he next went to Yokohama, Japan, and stayed there only long enough \u201cto catch a boat\u201d; that at Yokohama he boarded a Japanese ship, the Inyo Maru, for Manzanillo, Mexico; that the boat stopped at Honolulu, San Francisco, and Los Angeles en route to Manzanillo; that the appellant debarked at Manzanillo, where he stayed for three or four days; <em>and that he had a passport for Mexico.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Describing his trip from Manzanillo to Mexicali, the appellant testified that the journey was made by closed truck, consuming one day and one night. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that the distance between Manzanillo and Mexicali is approximately 1,200 miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The appellant also testified that traveling on the same truck with him were <em>fourteen Mexicans and two Hindus </em>\u2014 Arjan Singh and \u201cSodagar\u201d [Sudargl?] Singh; that the truck was driven by an American boy; that it left Manzanillo at about 5 o\u2019clock in the evening and arrived at Mexicali at about 7 o\u2019clock the following evening, or 26 hours later; that the appellant got off the truck \u201cright in town\u201d at Mexicali, some of his fellow passengers doing likewise and others not; that he paid the driver of the truck $20 for taking him from Manzanillo to Mexicali; that he remained in the latter place \u201cabout two days,\u201d spending the two nights \u201cin some Mexican\u2019s house\u201d; and that then he went to <em>the camp of Lakha </em>Singh, five or six miles west of Mexicali, with the two Hindus who had been with him on the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The appellant stated that he stayed at the camp one day, and that two Mexicans whom he picked up there took him to Stockton in an automobile, by way of Indio, Cal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">He then outlined his movements in the various Western States already referred to, up to 1932, when he went to the Imperial Valley, Cal. At the time of his first hearing, he was still residing in the valley, on a ranch near Calipatria, Cal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">The appellant testified that, previously to the hearing, he had once before been \u201cinvestigated\u201d by Immigration officers \u2014 at Oroville, Cal., in 1931, when he was sh.ot in the leg by another Hindu.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">Near the close of his testimony, the alien declared that he had never been legally admitted into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">After this first hearing, an assistant to the Secretary of Labor on August 3, 1934, issued a warrant for the appellant\u2019s arrest, ordering that the alien be granted a hearing to enable him to show cause why he should not be deported. The appellant was arrested under that warrant on January 21, 1935, and was arraigned at El Centro two days later, at which time he stated that he desired an opportunity to obtain a lawyer. Accordingly, further hearing on the matter was deferred until February 15, 1935, when he was represented by counsel. The appellant was released on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">At the hearing of February 15, 1935, the appellant said that he wished to make a further statement, because at the hearing of July 9, 1934, \u201cin some places I made mistakes, because I did not think at that time, correctly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">He testified that he went from Yokohama to Manzanillo in a Japanese boat, <em>the name of which he did not remember, </em>and that he was working as seaman on that vessel. When reminded that in his earlier statement he had declared that he had arrived at Manzanillo on the Inyo Maru, he stated that he \u201cwas not sure at that time, either; it was just guesswork.\u201d \u201cSometimes people talk about \u2018Inyo Maru\u2019 or some other \u2018Marus,\u2019 so I said \u2018Inyo Maru.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">The appellant further stated that <em>he had n\u00fa passport for Mexico; </em>that a rowboat came to the ship; and that he \u201cgot into it and came ashore.\u201d The same rowboat took off two other men before taking the appellant, but made a separate trip for the appellant; so that when he was taken ashore there was no one else with him in the rowboat except the man in charge, according to the appellant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-17\">The appellant testified that he stayed in Manzanillo <em>one night, </em>at the house of an unidentified Mexican; that on the following day he hired a truck that he met as he walked along the road, and arranged to have it take him to Mexicali.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>There were twelve or thirteen persons on the truck, the alien testified \u2014 Mexicans, <em>Chinese, Filipmos, </em>and, he thought, <em>two Italians, but no other Hindus. </em>It will be recalled that in his earlier testimony he had said that there were fourteen Mexicans and two other Hindus aboard the truck. He rode' in the truck for one night, and at 2 o\u2019clock the next afternoon he got out and continued to Mexicali on foot, he said.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">After testifying that he walked \u201call the way,\u201d the appellant stated that he walked for two or three days after leaving the first truck, and then got a ride in a second one, boarding it in the afternoon and leaving it at 10 or 11 o\u2019clock the following morning. Reminded that he had testified at the first hearing that it had taken him \u201cone day and a night\u201d to go from Manzanillo to Mexicali, the appellant insisted he had said that he \u201crode in a truck one day and one night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Finally, an automobile picked him up one afternoon, \u201cand before sundown I was in Mexicali.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The appellant said that <em>he tried to find some Hindus in Mexicali, but could not, </em>so that he stayed with some Mexicans. Indeed, he stated that <em>he saw no Hindus at any time ivhile he was in Mexico, </em>and repeatedly denied that he had previously testified that he went to the <em>camp of Lakha Singh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">At that juncture, Inspector Gies, who was conducting the hearing, asked the interpreter whether the latter remembered the alien\u2019s having made such a statement at the first hearing. The interpreter replied in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">- The alien reiterated that he paid a Mexican $200 to bring him across the line into the United States, <em>even giving in broken Spanish the exact words that he used when asking the Mexican to smuggle him in.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Later in the day, the appellant, being examined by his own attorney, testified that he entered the United States, not by crossing the Pacific on a Japanese boat from Yokohama, as he had twice previously sworn, <em>but by crossing some river that separates Mexico' from Guatemala.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">The appellant then related how he and four other men \u2014 Sudagar Singh, Arjan Singh, Gundar Singh, and Partap Singh\u2014 crossed the river into Mexico, each of the four others paying a Mexican $8 to bring them across.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">The appellant and his four companions walked along the railroad for 19 days, and finally reached Mexico City, proceeding thence by train to Guadalajara, Jalisco, where they remained a week, according to the appellant\u2019s testimony. From Guadalajara, he said, they went to Guaymas, Sonora, by mule, the trip requiring from three to five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">After staying in Guaymas two weeks, the five men took a boat that transported them to a spot on the open shore, and the \u201cboat man\u201d put them into two barrels, the alien stated. According to his testimony, they paid the \u201cboat man\u201d $70 each, \u201cand a car came along and took us to Mexicali.\u201d The four other Hindus also accompanied him into the United States, the alien said.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">Asked why, during the morning session, he had testified that he had come in through Manzanillo, the appellant replied that he was \u201cscared,\u201d because he had no passport. When he was questioned as to his reason for having stated that no one was with him when he came into the United States, he replied that, \u201cOther people told me not to mention their names.\u201d It is worthy of note, however, that at the hearing of July 9, 1934, he gave the names of four Hindus that he said crossed the line with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">In view of the glaring discrepancies in the appellant\u2019s testimony, it is necessary to advert only briefly to the rest of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-15\">Noor Din, a Hindu farmer residing near Seeley, Cal., in the Imperial Valley, testified, at the hearing held on July 9, 1934, that he first met the appellant on November 20, 1926, in a saloon at Mexicali; that he saw the alien again in Mexicali, about fifteen or twenty days later, and again a month later, or about January 1, 1927, in Calexico; that he was surprised to see the appellant on the American side of the line, but that the latter told him that \u201che was a little sick and had a permit from some doctor on the other side to come over and get some medicine.\u201d The witness continued: \u201cA short time after that I pointed him out to Chief Patrol Inspector Chaffin and told him that this Hindu was from Mexicali, so Mr. Chaffin talked to him, and the next time I saw him, Mr. Chaffin and he were going down the street towards the international line. Mr. Chaffin told me later that he would have deported him but he had a permit to get some medicine and he allowed him to get the medicine and took him back to Mexico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Because of the appellant\u2019s claim that he was not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine Noor Din, we will set forth in full an interesting colloquy that occurred among the appellant, Noor Din, and the examining officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\u201cNote. The following questions were asked by Immigrant Inspector Gerrish and translated into Hindustani by Interpreter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">\u201cQ. Is this the man that you know as Kishan Singh? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201cQ. Is this the man whom you first saw in the Mexicali saloon where the bartender only had one arm, across the tracks in Mexicali, in 1926? A. Yes, the same man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">\u201cQ. Is this the same man whom you saw in Calexico getting his shoes shined in the early part of 1927, and who told you that he had a permit to come to Calexico from Mexicali to purchase some medicine? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">\u201cQ. Is this the same man who[m] you saw Inspector Chaffin return towards Mexicali with on that date ? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\"><em>\u201cInspector Gerrish to Kishan Singh: </em>Q. You have heard the testimony of the witness. What have you to say regarding this testimony? A. All that I can say is that everything that he said is lies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\"><em>\u201cInspector Gerrish to Noor Din: </em>Q. You heard the denial of Kishan Singh to your statements. Have you anything more to say in this regard? A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-12\">\u201cHindu Witness, Noor Din, excused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-13\"><em>\u201cInspector Gerrish to Kishan Singh: </em>Q. Have you anything more to say in this regard? A. The only thing that I can say is that when I was working on the railroad on this side how could Noor Din see me in Mexicali.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">Inspector Chaffin corroborated the testimony of Noor Din. He stated that he first saw the appellant in Calexico in January, 1927; that he investigated the alien\u2019s presence in the United States, and found that the appellant was in Calexico to receive treatment from a doctor, having been permitted to come across the line; and that the witness personally saw the appellant\u2019s return to Mexico at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">Pursuing further our inquiry into the appellant\u2019s alleged lack of opportunity to cross-examine Noor Din, we find that at the close of the hearing of February 15, 1935, the examining inspector announced that if counsel for the appellant desired to have Noor Din produced for cross-examination, it would be necessary to continue the case, since Din had been called away by the illness of his daughter. It will be recalled that Din had testified on July 9, 1934, before the appellant was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-17\">Counsel for the appellant stated that he desired to, cross-examine Din, and the case was deferred to February 28,1935, by mutual consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-18\">On February 28, 1935, the following colloquy occurred between the examining inspector and counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-19\">\u201cInspector Gies to Attorney: Mr. Wylie, you are advised that this Service has made every effort to locate Noor Din, who has mysteriously disappeared, and all efforts to ascertain his whereabouts have been futile, therefore we are unable to produce that witness for cross-examination. Have you any further evidence in behalf of the \u00e1ben ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-20\">\u201cBy Attorney: I have no further evidence, but demand the opportunity to cross-examine Noor Din, being advised that cross-examination of Noor Din will develop evidence favorable to the alien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-21\">\u201cBy Examining Inspector: This service has no assurance as to when Noor Din can be located; however, if you so desire, the service will continue this hearing and make further efforts to locate him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-22\">\u201cBy Attorney: I do not feel that I can consent to a further continuance for the purpose of securing the presence of Noor Din, [because of] the expense placed upon the alien by reason of further hearing, without assurance that Noor Din can be secured as a witness, and I ask that the hearing be closed and the matter submitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-23\">It is well settled, in this circuit and elsewhere, that the Government\u2019s failure to produce a witness for cross-examination is excused, if such failure is due to the fact that the witness cannot be found. Quock So Mui v. Nagle (C.C.A.9) 11 F.(2d) 492, 493; United States ex rel. Ng Wing v. Brough (C.C.A.2) 15 F.(2d) 377, 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-24\">The appellant also complains that the transcript of testimony and of the proceedings before the examining inspector is \u201cneither complete nor fair,\u201d for the reason that portions of the appellant\u2019s cross-examination of Inspector Chaffin, together with other material related thereto, have been omitted. The transcript as prepared shows only a part of a question propounded by counsel for the appellant, namely, \u201cQ. Was the informant \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>The omitted part dealt with the examining inspector\u2019s instruction to the witness that the latter was not permitted by Department rules to answer a question regarding the identity of the person who first informed Inspector Chaffin, at his office in El Centro, regarding the appellant\u2019s presence in the United States. The transcript shows that counsel for the appellant was not otherwise restricted in his examination of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Technical errors or irregularities, without more, do not render an immigration hearing unfair. In United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U.S. 149, 157, 158, 44 S.Ct. 54, 57, 68 L.Ed. 221, Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\u201cMoreover, a hearing granted does not cease to be fair, merely because rules of evidence ^ and of procedure applicable in judicial proceedings have not been strictly followed by the executive; or because some evidence has been improperly rejected or received. [Case cited.] To render a hearing unfair the defect, or the practice complained of, must have been such as might have led to a denial of justice, or there must have been absent one of the 'elements deemed essential to due process. [Cases cited.] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cIrregularities on the part of the government official prior to, or in connection with, the arrest would not necessarily invalidate later proceedings in all respects conformable to law. \u2018A writ of habeas corpus is not like an action to recover damages for an unlawful arrest or commitment, but its object is to ascertain whether the prisoner can lawfully be detained in custody; and if sufficient ground for his detention by the government is shown, he is not to be discharged for defects in the original arrest or commitment.\u2019 [Cases cited.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">See, also, Ex parte Keizo Kamiyama (C.C.A.9) 44 F.(2d) 503, 505; Murdoch v. Clark (C.C.A.1) 53 F.(2d) 155, 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Assuredly, the omission of a few sentences from the transcript of a hearing before an immigrant inspector, regarding a matter that could not possibly prejudice the substantial rights of the alien, does not render such hearing \u201cunfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Next, the appellant assails the \u201cpower and jurisdiction of the Court to substitute new findings for those made by Secretary of Labor in deportation proceedings where latter\u2019s findings are insufficient in law or fact to sustain the order of deportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">The Board of Review made the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">\u201cAlthough the alien insists that he entered the United States prior to July 1, 1924, his presence in Mexico was established by the testimony of Inspector M. L. Chaffin, \"who witnessed and id\u00e9ntified this alien as the same person who departed to Mexico through Calexico, Cal., early in January, 1927. The alien had been admitted to the United States for medical attention and was escorted to Mexico by the inspector who testified. No evidence was offered by the alien other than, his unsupported statement to prove his residence in the United States prior to July 1, 1924. * * *.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-12\">\u201cIt has been held that where <em>the </em>unsupported statement of an alien is the only evidence of his residence in the United States, such statement is overcome by any degree of evidence to the contrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">In a memorandum of conclusions, the District Judge held as follows: \u201cThe Court concludes that petitioner entered the United States illegally, that he is an alien ineligible to citizenship, that by reason of material discrepancies in his testimony before the Immigration Department, the immigration authorities were warranted in holding that his testimony to the effect that he entered the United States prior to July 1, 1924, was not true, and that petitioner lias failed to sustain the burden of proof that he has resided in the United States continuously since prior to July 1, 1924.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">The appellant complains that the Secretary of Labor did not find that any \u201cmaterial discrepancies\u201d existed in the appellant\u2019s testimony before the immigrant inspector, and that therefore the lower court\u2019s \u201cnew findings\u201d of \u201cmaterial discrepancies\u201d constitutes error.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-15\">In the first place, it is elementary that that a reviewing court may sustain the findings or judgment of an inferior tribunal on grounds other than those upon which such inferior tribunal based its findings or judgment.

Mills Alloys (C.C.A.9) 67 F.(2d) 807, 809, certiorari denied 292 U.S. 637, 54 S.Ct. 718, 78 L.Ed. 1489.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-16\">Secondly, the immigrant inspector who conducted the hearings at which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>appellant was represented by counsel, in his summary of the evidence stated that the appellant\u2019s testimony should \u201cbe disregarded owing to the inconsistency of his own claims as to his entry into the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\"> Finally, the cases cited by the appellant, dealing with the rule that the courts cannot \u201ccontrol or interfere with the determination\u201d of fact-finding officials, are not applicable here. In the instant case, the board of review found that the appellant\u2019s statement as to residence was \u201cunsupported.\u201d The court below concluded that his testimony, because of its material discrepancies, was \u201cnot true.\u201d Both conclusions tended to the ultimate determination that thq appellant was not to be believed. The mer\u00ab fact that the court below found, as we have found, \u201cmaterial discrepancies\u201d in the appellant\u2019s testimony, which prompted the court to sustain the board\u2019s determination that the appellant had not entered the United States prior to July 1, 1924, clearly does not amount to \u201ccontrol\u201d or \u201cinterference.\u201d We know of no rule of law that compels a reviewing court to close its eyes to glaring discrepancies, apparent on the face of the record, in sustaining the determination of a fact-finding body.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The third and last point raised by the appellant is that the Secretary of Labor erred in the assertion that \u201cwhere the unsupported statement of an alien is the only evidence of his residence in the United States, such statement is overcome by any degree of evidence to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Whether or not the foregoing assertion lays down the rule too broadly is a moot question, since there was ample evidence to sustain the findings of the immigrant inspector and of the board of review. Disregarding the testimony of Noor Din, we have the positive statement of Inspector Chaffin that, in January, 1927, the appellant was in Calexico, Cal., to receive medical treatment, by virtue of an arrangement under which the alien had been permitted to cross into the United States from Mexico; and that the inspector himself witnessed the appellant\u2019s return to Mexicali.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Both the examining inspector and the board of review believed Inspector Chaffin\u2019s testimony, referring to it in almost identical language: \u201cThe presence of this alien in Mexico was established through the testimony of Inspector M.'L. Chaffin, who witnessed and identified this alien as the same person departing to Mexico through the port of Calexico early in Jangary, 1927, this alien having been admitted to the United States for medical attention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">The appellant concedes that \u2022 the amount of evidence necessary to overcome the unsupported statements of the alien \u201cmay be small, but its competency must be unquestioned.\u201d Here there is no question that the testimony given by Inspector Chaffin was competent, and that it was believed by the fact finders. We are not disposed to disturb their determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">In a case of this character, \u201cmere error, even if it consists in finding an essential fact without adequate supporting evidence, is not a denial of due process of law.\u201d United States ex rel. Tisi v. Tod, 264 U.S. 131, 134, 44 S.Ct. 260, 261, 68 L.Ed 590. In the case just cited, the Government did not introduce any direct evidence to contradict the alien\u2019s testimony. In the present cause, however, the appellee offered the positive statement of an immigrant inspector, squarely rebutting the appellant\u2019s claim of residence. A fortiori, the language of Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is in the Tisi Case, supra, is highly apposite here:</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">\u201cThe printed [seditious] matter found consisted of leaflets in the English language. Tisi testified that he cannot read English, that he did not know the character of the leaflets, and that his presence in the company of other Italians who were seen folding the leaflets was accidental. <em>The Secretary of Labor was not obliged to believe this testimony. </em>The government did not introduce any direct evidence to the contrary. But there was much evidence of other facts from which Tisi\u2019s knowledge of the character of the leaflets might reasonably have been inferred. We do not discuss the evidence, because the correctness of the judgment of the lower court is not to be determined by inquiring whether the conclusion drawn by the Secretary of Labor from the evidence was correct, or by deciding whether the evidence was such that, if introduced in a court of law, it would be held legally sufficient to prove the fact found.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">\u201cThe denial of a fair hearing is not established by proving merely that the decision was wrong. [Case cited.] This is equally true whether the error consists in deciding wrongly that evidence introduced constituted legal evidence of the fact or in drawing a wrong inference from the evidence. The error of an administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>tribunal may, of course, be so flagrant as to convince a court that the hearing had was not a fair one. Compare [cases named.] But here no hasty, arbitrary, or unfair action on the part of any official, or any abuse of discretion, is shown.\u201d [Italics our own.] 264 U.S. 131, at pages 133, 134, 44 S.Ct. 260, 68 L.Ed. 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">See, also, Tang Tun v. Edsell, 223 U. S. 673, 681, 682, 32 S.Ct. 359, 56 L.Ed. 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Material discrepancies such as those found in the appellant\u2019s testimony \u201cwere sufficient to discredit the whole of his testimony, and his admission that he had committed perjury on the hearing justified the immigration officials in rejecting his statement that he had entered the United States\u201d prior to July 1, 1924. Wong Fat Shuen v. Nagle (C.C.A.9) 7 F.(2d) 611, 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">After a careful examination of the record herein, we find that the appellant was accorded a fair hearing by the immigration authorities, and that there was no denial of due process of law. The order of the court below discharging the writ of habeas corpus, dismissing the proceeding, and remanding the appellant to the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">NETERER, District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">I concur in affirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
