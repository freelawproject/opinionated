Upon a hearing on April 2, 1936, counsel for the petitioner, one Pedro Albizu Campos, admitted that, while the early minutes of the Nationalist Party had been destroyed, the petitioner did have in his possession the minutes of the proceedings of the Nationalist Party since February 23, 1936. The following colloquy then took place between counsel and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-19\">\u201cMr. Albizu: He isn\u2019t going to present them (referring to the minutes admitted to be in the petitioner\u2019s possession) because they are incriminating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-20\">\u201cThe Court: The court will decide whether they will incriminate him and whether or not he has any privilege in reference to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-22\">\u201cMr. Albizu: The documents do exist since February 23, 1936.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-23\">\u201cThe Court: Then he is directed to turn them over to the grand jury, and at the proper time if he wants to take the position before this court that they will incriminate him he may do so. He is entitled to protection against incrimination as a witness, but if he has in his possession some documents of an organization of which he is a member or -an officer, and if he is called upon to do so he must produce them. That\u2019s the law, decided in many cases, and that is true even in case where there is an indictment. I don\u2019t care to hear any argument. He is directed to deliver them forthwith to the grand jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u201cMr. Sanchez: He is asking your Honor until tomorrow morning at nine-thirty to bring them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">\u201cThe Court: Why didn\u2019t he bring them with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">\u201cMr. Sanchez: The subpoena is so vague and general, he doesn\u2019t know what documents are called for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">\u201cMr. Albizu: I think, your Honor, this is a case of inquisitorial proceeding. My client will not present the documents because they will incriminate him. There is a process in court accusing Mr. Corretjer of conspiracy. This is a fishing expedition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t care to hear any more. Will the grand jury conclude today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">\u201cMr. Snyder: If these books are made available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">\u201cThe Court: I want to give him every opportunity. I will tell him now to have those documents in the grand jury room tomorrow morning at nine o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\">\u201cMr. Albizu: Your Honor please, my client will not produce them because they incriminate him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-13\">\u201cThe Court: All right; have him * * * stand up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-15\">\u201cThe Court (replying to suggestions by counsel): I don\u2019t have to issue any rule to show cause when the contempt is committed in the presence of the court, and in the court I have just ordered the respondent to produce those papers tomorrow morning at nine o\u2019clock, and his counsel responded that he will not do it. Now that being the case there is nothing left for me to do except to pronounce judgment. &gt;\u25a0\u00ab s}c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-18\">\u201cThe Court: I am not going to dismiss the proceedings. Let the respondent stand up. You have heard the statement that you will refuse to bring these papers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-19\">\u201cMr. Albizu (to respondent): Do not answer. (To Court) : He will not testify because he has not been warned about the fact that he will be incriminating himself. He has a right not to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-21\">\u201cThe Court: All right; the sentence of the court is that you be confined in the San Juan district jail for a period of one year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-23\">\u201cMr. Snyder: I take it that the defendant is now committed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-24\">, \u201cThe Court: Yes. He is committed to the custody of the marshal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-26\">An order of commitment in accordance with the sentence of the court was then issued by the clerk under seal of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-27\">While it is very doubtful whether the situation is the same as in case of an officer of a corporation who is directed to produce the corporation books and papers, as in Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361, 31 S.Ct. 538, 55 L.Ed. 771, Ann.Cas. 1912D, 558, since a political party in Puerto Rico is not a corporate body, it has been defined as an association of voters believing in certain principles of government and. formed to urge the adoption of those principles. 49 Cyc., pp. 1074, 1075. It is also questioned whether the subpoena duces, tecum was directed to the petitioner as an official of the Nationalist Party, or as an individual; yet he should have produced the papers in his possession as directed and on refusing to deliver them to the grand jury should have appealed to the court and invoked his privilege under the Fifth Amendment, and submitted the documents to the court for its determination as tO' whether they were incriminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-28\">He and his counsel saw fit to decide for themselves whether the minutes in his possession tended to incriminate him and in open court defied the order of court to produce them. Brown v. United States, 276 U.S. 134, 144, 48 S.Ct. 288, 290, 72 L.Ed. 500; Consolidated Rendering Co. v. Vermont, 207 U.S. 541, 552, 28 S.Ct. 178, 181, 52 L.Ed. 327, 12 Ann.Cas. 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-29\">In the last-cited case the court said :</p>\n<p id=\"b182-30\">\u201cThe court simply held that it could not determine whether the objection as. to incrimination was valid until the books were produced for inspection by the court, though before they were to be used in evidence. If, after that inspection, any portion were found of that character, the. court held that such portion would be excluded. As, however, the company failed and refused absolutely to produce any of the books, with some unimportant exceptions, it was adjudged to have failed to show any reasonable cause for such refusal to comply with the requirements of the notice, and it was fined for the contempt. Obviously the company could not,, by its refusal to produce the books, thereby entirely conclude the court from any examination whatever into the sufficiency of the excuses for such nonproduction. Otherwise the company could disobey at its pleasure and so prevent any inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>into the merits of the excuses. The statute might as well not exist if this were to be permitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-2\">The subpoena duces tecum was not broader in the instant case than in the case last cited, and it was held in that case that \u201ceven if the notice had been too broad, the objection cannot be urged as to the validity of the order adjudging the company guilty of contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">There was even less objection in the case at bar, since the refusal to produce was confined to the minutes of the Nationalist Party since February 23, 1936. Though admitted to be in the possession of the petitioner, he refused to produce them or submit them to the court for its determination as to whether they were incriminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The order of the District Court dismissing the petition is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
