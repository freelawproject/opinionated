A. Burch, a citizen and resident of Hutchinson, Kansas, was engaged in the transportation of freight by motor truck between points in Kansas and Oklahoma. On September 25, 1933, Burch applied to the Corporation Commission of the State of Oklahoma for a certificate of public convenience and necessity as a \u201cClass B\u201d carrier. Accompanying such application, Burch filed with the Commission as required by section 3708, O.S.1931, as amended <em>by </em>section 4, c. 156, O.S.L.1933 (47 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 169), a policy of insurance issued by the Casualty Company, with an endorsement affixed thereto designated as Form E. The material portions of Form E are set out in Note. I.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The insuring clause of the policy proper excluded from the coverage employees of Burch.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">The original act regulating motor carriers was adopted in 1923. See section 3692, et seq., O.S.1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">Section 3701, O.S.1931 (47 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 162) provides that: \u201cThe Corporation Commission shall have the power and authority by general order or otherwise to prescribe rules and regulations applicable to any or all motor carriers.\u201d See Commercial Standard Insurance Co. v. Garrett (C.C.A.10) 70 F.(2d) 969. The Corporation Commission by regulation adopted Form E pursuant to the provisions of the original act. It constitutes the contract of insurance as between the insurer and the state. Commercial Standard Insurance Company v. Garrett, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">Shankel was employed by Burch as a truck driver\u2019s helper. While so engaged on a truck of Burch, Shankel suffered personal injuries at Oklahoma City, Okla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>homa, on November 14, 1933. At the time of the accident the truck was being used to transport a cargo of freight from Wichita, Kansas, to Oklahoma City. One Heaston was the driver of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">Shankel brought an action against Burch and Heaston in the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, to recover damages for such injuries. He alleged that Burch was negligent in failing to provide a reasonably safe vehicle, in providing a trailer which projected on each side more than six inches beyond the running board of the truck and which was more than eight feet in width in violation of the statutes of the state of Oklahoma and the rules and regulations of the Corporation Commission of Oklahoma,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in knowingly ordering and permitting such truck to be overloaded so as to render it and the trailer unsafe to operate, and in failing to provide a proper rear vision mirror or other device by which the driver of the truck could observe traffic approaching from the rear. He alleged negligence on the part of Heaston in the operation of the truck, the details of which are not here material. He alleged that the negligence of Burch and Heaston, jointly, was the proximate cause of his injuries. In his answer Burch pleaded assumed risk, contributory negligence and that Heaston was a fellow servant of Shankel. The Casualty Company denied liability and refused to defend the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">After negotiations Burch and Shankel agreed to a compromise. Agreeable thereto a judgment was entered in the state court action in favor of Shankel and against Burch and Heaston for $5,500.00 damages, and $42.55 costs, on September 14, 1934. The judgment recited the appearance of the parties, the waiver of a jury, and the taking of evidence. Following the entry of the judgment and on the same day Shankel and Burch entered into a written agreement. By the terms thereof Burch agreed to execute and deliver to Shankel two promissory notes each for $250.00, and not to file a motion for a new trial, and not to appeal from or otherwise challenge such judgment; and Shankel agreed to compromise such judgment with Burch for $500.00 plus any amount he might recover from the Casualty Company and, after the payment of such notes and the liability of the Casualty Company had been determined, to discharge such judgment as to Burch and Heaston. It expressly reserved the right of Shankel to proceed on such judgment against the Casualty Company. A satisfaction of judgment was executed by Shankel and placed in escrow under an escrow agreement which provided that it was not to be delivered until the liability of the Casualty Company on the judgment had been determined and the notes paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">On November 20, 1934, Shankel brought this action against the Casualty Company on such judgment and Form E to recover the sum of $5,042.55 in the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. The cause was duly removed to the Federal Court. From a judgment in favor of Shankel the Casualty Company has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Section 7, c. 113, O.S.L.1923 (section 3697, O.S.1931) in part reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">\u201cNo certificate of convenience and necessity shall be issued by the Corporation Commission to any motor carrier until and after such motor carrier shall have filed with the Corporation, Commission of this State a liability insurance bond in some company authorized to do business in this State in such a penal sum as the Corporation Commission may deem necessary to adequately protect the interest of the public, with due regard to the number of persons and amount of property involved, which liability insurance shall bind the obligors thereunder to make compensation for injuries to persons and loss of or damage to property resulting from the operation of such motor carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">Section 3697 was superseded by section 10, c. 253, O.S.Laws 1929 (section 3708, O.S.1931, 47 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 169). It required motor carriers to furnish a liability insurance policy or bond and in part read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-11\">\u201cSuch Corporation Commission shall also require a surety bond to be approved by said commission in such penal sum as the commission may require, conditioned for the payment of all fees, taxes or charges which may be, or become, due the state, under any permit of operation, and for the faithful carrying out of the permit granted, and all provisions of this Act, and the regulations of the Corporation Commission adopted hereunder. No other, or additional bonds, than as hsrein described, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>be required of any motor carrier by any city or town, or other agency of the state. Provided, that all class \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 carriers shall maintain compensation insurance upon all employees engaged in the operation of motor carriers as herein provided under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws of this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The proviso at the end of section 3708 was held invalid by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in Brinks Express Co. v. Foster, 154 Okl. 255, 7 P.(2d) 142, 144.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Section 3708, supra, was amended by section 4 of c. 156, O.S.L.1933 (47 Okl.St. Ann. \u00a7 169). The portion of the amended section here material reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">\u201cNo certificate of convenience and necessity, or permit, shall be issued by the Corporation Commission to any motor carrier until after such motor carrier shall have filed with the Corporation Commission a liability insurance policy or bond covering public liability and property damage, issued by some insurance or bonding company or insurance carrier, authorized to do business in this state and which has complied with all of the requirements of the Corporation Commission, which bond or policy shall be approved by the Corporation Commission, and shall be in such sum and amount as fixed by a proper order of said Commission; and such liability and property damage insurance policy or bond shall bin4 the obligor thereunder to make compensation for injuries to, or death of, persons, and loss or damage to property, resulting from the operation of any such motor carrier for which such carrier is legally liable. * * * A copy of such policy or bond shall be filed with said Commission, and, after judgment against the carrier for any such damage, the injured party may maintain an action upon such policy or bond to recover the same, and shall be a proper party so to do.\u201d 1934 Supp.O.S. 1931, \u00a7 3708 (47 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 169).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The amended section omitted the proviso held invalid by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma. Counsel for the Casualty Company contends that section 3708 as amended (47 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 169) does not cover personal injuries suffered by employees of the motor carrier. He urges that an intent to exclude employees of the carrier was indicated by the proviso attached to the section as originally adopted with respect to compensation insurance upon employees. He asserts that to construe the section as applicable to employees of interstate carriers would render it unconstitutional, and that \u201ca statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score.\u201d See George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U.S. 373, 379, 53 S.Ct. 620, 77 L.Ed. 1265; Kansas Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. City of Independence (C.C.A.10) 79 F.(2d) 32, 43, 100 A.L.R. 1479.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">The language of Form E is broad and all inclusive excepting from its coverage only the holder of the certificate of convenience and necessity. It expressly provides that it is payable to the state for the benefit of \u201call persons who may suffer personal injuries\u201d due to the -negligence of the motor vehicle owner, his agents, or employees. It further provides that the insurer shall pay \u201cany final judgment rendered against the holder of such certificates for personal injuries * * * other than of the holder of said certificate due to the negligence of said holder, his * * * agents, or employees\u201d; and that no condition or limitation in the policy of insurance to which Form E is attached shall affect the \u201cright of any person\u201d who suffers, personal injuries, to assert the liability provided in Form E.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">The statute provides for a policy covering \u201cpublic liability and property damage\u201d and binding the obligor \u201cto make compensation for injuries to, or death of, persons,\u201d and that after judgment against the carrier for any such damage the injured party may maintain an action on such policy to recover same.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Form E was adopted as a regulation by the Corporation Commission to effectuate the provisions of section <em>3697. </em>It has been in continuous use since its adoption. The statutory provision has been amended twice, yet the Legislature has not seen fit to disapprove or restrict the provisions of Form E. This is persuasive evidence that the Legislature approved the regulation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>the administrative construction of the statute manifested therein.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">In Kaifer v. Georgia Casualty Co. (C.C.A.9) 67 F.(2d) 309, the words \u201cany person or persons\u201d in an automobile liability insurance policy were construed to include an employee of the owner of the motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">In Williams v. Denney, 151 Wash. 630, 276 P. 858, it was held that a provision for liability insurance (Remington\u2019s Comp.Stat. of Washington, 1922, \u00a7 6391) \u201cfor all persons receiving personal injury\u201d covered passengers being transported for hire in interstate commerce. See Cobb v. Department of Public Works (D.C.Wash.) 60 F.(2d) 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In Jacobsen v. Howard, 164 Okl. 88, 23 P.(2d) 185, it was held that section 3697, supra, embraced passengers being carried for hire in a motor bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">It is well settled that a state may not require a carrier to furnish liability insurance covering persons and property being transported in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">On the other hand, the right of the state to legislate for the protection of employees engaged in interstate commerce, in the absence of national regulation on the subject, has been sustained in a number of decisions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Prior to the enactment of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 301 et seq., Congress had not acted with respect to the regulation of interstate commerce by motor carrier. Construing section 3708 -as applicable to employees of motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce would not render it unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">The proviso at the end of section 3708 as originally adopted indicates that the Legislature believed that employees of Class \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d carriers were within the Oklahoma Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. The purpose of the proviso was to restrict the provision that, \u201cno other, or additional bonds, than as herein described, shall be required of any motor carrier by any city or town, or other agency of the state,\u201d so as not to exclude Class \u201cA\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>\u201cB\u201d carriers from the requirements of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. After the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in Brinks Express Co. v. Foster, 154 Okl. 255, 7 P.(2d) 142, held that employees of motor carriers were not within the Oklahoma Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law and that the proviso at the end of section <em>3708, </em>supra, was not effectual as an amendment thereto, the Legislature amended section 3708 (47 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 169) supra,, omitting the proviso and leaving the broad, provisions of the section unrestricted. We find nothing in the section as amended indicating an intent to limit the common law liability of the carrier to its employees or excluding the latter from the coverage of the bond or policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The exclusion of the employees of-Burch from the coverage - of the policy proper is not of moment, since it is expressly provided in Form E that no condition, provision, stipulation, or limitation in the policy proper shall affect in any way the right of any person injured in his person by the negligence of Burch or relieve the Casualty Company from the liability provided for in Form E.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">We conclude, therefore, that Shankel was within the insurance coverage of Form E.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Under the terms of the policy proper, the Casualty Company had the exclusive right to \u2022 defend the action brought by Shankel against Burch. It refused to assume the defense thereof and denied liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">In his action against Burch, Shankel sought damages in the sum of $17,500.00. He alleged violations by Burch of the statutes of Oklahoma and the rules and regulations of the Corporation Commission relative to the.width arid construction of the trailer attached to the truck on which Shankel was \u00e9mployed. He also alleged other acts of negligence on the part of</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">Burch. It is a well\" settled rule in Oklahoma that public policy forbids an employee from assuming the risk created by a violation of a statute or a rule or regulation having the effect of law, or waiving the liability of the master for injuries caused by such violation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">Section 6 of art. 23 of the Oklahoma Constitution (1931 O.S. \u00a7 13719) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b888-16\">\u201cThe defense of contributory negligence or of assumption of risk shall, in all cases whatsoever, be a question of fact, and shall, at all times, be left to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-17\">Under this provision where primary negligence is established by the evidence, the issues of assumption of risk and of contributory negligence must be submitted to the jury and its finding thereon is conclusive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-18\">Shankel alleged that he had suffered severe and permanent injuries and if he established Burch\u2019s liability he probably would have recovered a judgment against Burch largely in excess of $5,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-19\">At the close of the evidence Shankel moved the court to instruct the jury to return a verdict in his favor, and the Casualty Company moved the court to instruct the jury to return a verdict in its favor. These motions are made without reservation. The court instructed a verdict in favor of Shankel. Where each party requests the court to instruct a verdict in his favor, without reservations, it is equivalent to a declaration that there are no issues of fact or a request that the court find the facts; the parties are concluded by the court\u2019s findings on the controverted issues of fact and such finding must stand if there is substantial evidence to support it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-20\">When the Casualty Company denied liability and refused to .defend the action against Burch, the latter had the right, provided he acted in good faith and with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>due care and prudence, to enter into a compromise with Shankel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We cannot say on this record that the trial court erred in failing to find that Burch did not act in good faith and with due prudence in entering into the settlement with Shankel.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-6\"> MOTOR VEHICLE FORM E INSURANCE POLICY ENDORSEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The policy to which this endorsement is attached is written under and pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 113 of the Session Laws of Oklahoma, 1923, and it is to be construed in accordance therewith and the rules and regulations of the Corporation Commission of Oklahoma and implies an acceptance of such rules and regulations, and is payable to the State of Oklahoma for the benefit of <em>all persons who may suffer personal injuries, </em>* * * due to any negligence of the assured, his/its <em>agents, </em>employes, or representatives in the operation or use of any motor vehicle under certificate of public convenience and necessity No. \u2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">In consideration of the premium stipulated in the policy to which this endorsement is attached the insurer * * * agrees to pay any final judgment rendered against the holder- of such certificate <em>for personal injuries, * * * other than that of the holder of said certificate </em>due to the negligence of said holder, his/its agents, or employes, or representatives in the operation or use of any motor vehicle, * * * operated under said certificate * * * within the limits of the schedule hereinafter set out, and further agrees that, upon its failure to pay any such final judgment, within sixty days from the date of its rendition or final affirmance on appeal, the judgment creditor may maintain an action against it in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such payment. * * * Nothing contained in the policy or any endorsement thereon, * * * shall relieve the insurer from any liability hereunder or from the payment of any such judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">No condition, provision, stipulation or limitation contained in the policy or any other endorsement thereon, nor the violation of any of the same by the insured shall affect in any way the right of <em>any person </em>injured in his person * * * by the negligence of the insured or relieve the company from the liability provided for in this endorsement, or from the payment to such person of any such judgment, to the extent and in the amounts set forth in the schedule shown hereon; * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b884-15\">SCHEDULE</p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">On each motor vehicle used for the transportation of freight or express, or both, the insurer shall be liable <em>to each person suffering damages </em>as the result of any accident due to the negligence of the assured, his agents or representatives in the use or operation of such motor vehicle to the extent of damages sustained, not exceeding five thousand dollars, and subject to the same limit, the total liability of the insurer on account of any one accident shall not exceed ten thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-17\">Attached to and forming a part of Policy No. 1587594 issued by Continental Casualty Company to W.
