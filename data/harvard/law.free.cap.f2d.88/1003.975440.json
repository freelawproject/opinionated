New York Life Ins. Co., 42 F.(2d) 651, 652 (C.C.A.6); New York Life Ins. Co. v. Cohen, 57 F.(2d) 494, 496 (C.C.A.6); Lyttle v. Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co., 72 F.(2d) 140, 142 (C.C.A.6); that the certificate of reinstatement of the policy issued March 17, 1933, was contestable within one year from its date because of the fraud of Al-bright in procuring its issuance, New York Life Ins. Co. v. Seymour, 45 F.(2d) 47, 49 (C.C.A.6); and that there is no merit in the contention that appellee\u2019s right of cancellation was waived by the alternative allegations of paragraph 3 of the bill (stricken out by leave of the court before trial) to the effect that, because of Albright\u2019s intentional self-destruction, one-tenth only of the principal sum of the policy was due by reason of the suicide clause therein. \u00c6tna Life Ins.
