All may be placed in two classes:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">(a) Failure to disregard the United States Officer\u2019s return to the writ and discharge the petitioner because the return did not specifically deny the allegations of birth of petitioner in the United States and pertinent allegations therein. The return does certify the \u201ctrue cause of the detention of such party.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 457. This particularly appears in the supplemental return (section 760, R.S. [28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 460]) which the court was empowered to permit or even direct. Bieloszycka Case (U.S. ex rel. Bieloszycka v. Com\u2019r), 3 F.(2d) 551, 552 (C.C.A.2). Tiberg v. Warren, 192 F. 458 (C.C.A.9). The return was traversed; an issue of fact was raised; appellant was not misled. He proceeded fully advised on the issue. The return is responsive to the petition for the writ. Knight v. Miles et al., 308 Mo. 538, 272 S.W. 922. In a habeas corpus case the issues are framed upon the return and denial without reference to the petition for the writ. Thompson v. Sanders, 334 Mo. 1100, 70 S.W.(2d) 1051, 1052. The writ of habeas corpus is an extraordinary remedy. It is not bound down by the thongs of technical pleading or its swift relief hindered by captious objection or finespun theories of procedure. State v. Thurman, 17 Ala.App. 656, 88 So. 61. This assignment has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">(b) The petitioner presenting himself for admission was not entitled to a judicial hearing (Quon Quon Poy v. Johnson, 273 U.S. 352, 47 S.Ct. 346, 71 L.Ed. 680), and, if the immigration officers intrusted by the Congress decided his claim for admission at a fair hearing and gave him an opportunity to establish his citizenship and did not abuse their discretion lodged with them, the finding upon the question of citizenship is conclusive. Quon Quon Poy v. Johnson, supra.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">We think the hearing in this case was not arbitrary, unfair, or unreasonable in view of the irreconcilable material discrepancies which are very numerous and vital to the relationship which it is sought to establish. The discrepancies are differenees with relation to family history, to business, physical conditions, and such matters as would be known to the members of a family. There is disagreement in material matters, Leung Shee\u2019s age and feet, the appellant\u2019s mother, and the granduncle, Jung Ping, and maternal uncle, residence after marriage of appellant\u2019s mother, residence of appellant\u2019s grandparents and grandaunt, and marriage of the appellant\u2019s father. To set out these discrepancies could serve no useful purpose and would unduly extend this memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\"> Weedin v.
