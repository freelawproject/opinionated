On hearing, the court below, following its opinion, reported in 14 F.Supp. 226 \u2014 to which reference avoids needless repetition' of the facts in the case \u2014 -dismissed the bill. Thereupon plaintiff took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">As stated in its brief, the question involved is whether a patent owner, who is in an alleged dominating and controlling position \u201cwith respect to a pool or combination of all of the \"pertinent patent rights to all of the large companies of the industry, can be compelled by court decree (under the provisions of section 16 of the Clayton Act [15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 26]) to grant plaintiff a license under the patents of tne pool on the same terms and conditions that such licenses have been granted to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">After argument and consideration had, we find ourselves in accord with the trial judge\u2019s reasoning and construction, and as a further opinion would be but an attempt by this court to clothe in different wording what has been already said by the court below, we limit ourselves to affirming the court\u2019s decree on its own opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
