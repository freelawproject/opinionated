C., of counsel), for Commissioner of Patents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b564-8\">Before GRAHAM, Presiding Judge, and BLAND, GARRETT, and LENROOT, Associate Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b564-9\">BLAND, Associate Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The Examiner of Trade-marks in the United States Patent Office refused to register appellant\u2019s alleged trade-mark \u201cHi-Octane\u201d for use on gasoline. Upon appeal to the Commissioner of Patents, the decision of the Examiner was affirmed for substantially the same reasons assigned by the Examiner. Appellant has here appealed for a review of the decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">The Examiner held that the term \u201cHi-Octane\u201d described the character of the goods and did not function as an indication of origin of ownership thereof. \u2019 He cited several references in trade journals where the term \u201chigh octane\u201d was used \u201cas a recognized commercial designation of a type of gasoline.\u201d He called attention to the Scientific American for August, 1932, page 120, which carries an article on octane rating of gasoline and states: \u201cA high octane gasoline has much better pick-up. * * * \u201d He also called attention to the Refiner and Natural Gasoline Manufacturer for May, 1933, page 29a, where in an advertisement of the Dubb\u2019s cracking process there occurs the statement: \u201cYou can\u2019t profit by making high octane gasoline if you lose most of the anti-knock value in treating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">It is conceded by'the appellant that the prefix \u201cHi-\" means \u201chigh\u201d and that the term \u201cHi-Octane\u201d stands on no different footing than would the term \u201cHigh-Octane.\u201d The Examiner and the Commissioner both cited numerous decisions relating to descriptive terms, all of which were Patent Office decisions and need not be discussed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-15\">It will not be necessary to review all the pertinent decisions on the question, since it seems to us that there can be little doubt that the term \u201cHi-Octane\u201d is descriptive of a character of gasoline and that, being descriptive, it does not indicate origin and is not subject to the exclusive appropriation by any user.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-16\">The decision of this court in Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. v. Black &amp; Decker Manufacturing Co., 39 F.(2d) 684, 17 C.C.P. A. (Patents) 962, is, we think, particularly in point. We there held that the term \u201cHicycle\u201d was descriptive as applied to electrically operated tools, had reference to cycles of frequency of operation of the same, and that it could not be registered under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, as amended, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 81-109, which is the act involved in the instant\u201dappeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-17\">In the case of Barber-Colman Co. v. Overhead Door Corporation, 65 F.(2d) 147, 20 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1118, this court held that the term \u201cOverhead\u201d as applied to garage doors was descriptive of the doors and was within the prohibition of the registration statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-18\">Appellant\u2019s main contention seems to be embraced in the following statement: \u201c * * * but 'Hi-Octane,\u2019 although it might mean something definite to a trained chemist and particularly to one skilled in the petroleum art, would certainly not immediately indicate to an ordinary member of the public any definite nature or quality of the gasoline, and it is believed that the appearance of this phrase and the rather technical explanation thereof in the scientific and technical journals cited by the Examiner will clinch the above argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-20\">\u00ed}\u00ed i}i <em>a</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-21\">We think this contention is without merit. If the word is descriptive to those skilled in the art, it is descriptive within the prohibition of the statute and is not registrable. It would be nonregistrable if it was in a foreign language, if it was descriptive, although not understood by all purchasers who understood other languages only. In re Northern Paper Mills, 64 F.(2d) 998, 20 C.C.P.A.(Patents) 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-22\">Appellant has raised some question, although he has not stressed the point, that the date of the references cited by the Examiner is subsequent to the filing date of the application here involved. This is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>case where the question of anticipation should be determined. Appellant concedes that the term \u201cHi-Octane\u201d is descriptive in a scientific sense. The word \u201cHigh\u201d and the word \u201cOctane\u201d are both good English words found in the dictionary. They can be and are appropriately used to describe a quality of gasoline. Appellant may not appropriate to its exclusive use these words when combined in the manner proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">We are not here confronted with the question of the registrability of a mark which, like the term \u201cKodak,\u201d becomes descriptive of a kind of camera after the term has been used for the first time as a trademark to indicate origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge, did not participate in this decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
