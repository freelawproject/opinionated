The trial court denied the petition, and at the time of ordering a 20 per cent, dividend upon certain unsecured merchandise claims aggregating $43,344.82, and upon unpaid commissions of $2,814.99, declined to order any payment whatever to the County of San Joaquin, stating in his order \u201cthat the claim of said County of San Joaquin for taxes is without merit either as a preferred or a general claim.\u201d Personal property taxes due the county were a lien upon the real estate of the taxpayer. Cal. Political Code \u00a7 3717. This real estate was also subject to a trust deed. It was sold under the trust deed to F. K. Woll and M. D. Clelland. The purchasers have paid the taxes in question, hence the appeal has become moot, notwithstanding the fact that the taxes were paid under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-18\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
