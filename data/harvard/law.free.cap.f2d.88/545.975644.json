Warrant was issued' on October 30, 1934, and ordered that appellant be given a fair hearing. Appellant was arraigned on November 17, 1934. After the hearing, the immigrant inspector who had conducted the hearing recommended deportation. The Board of Review on May 29, 1935, recommended deportation of appellant on the ground \u201cthat he has been' found in the United States in violation of the Act of Oct. 16, 1918, as amended by the Act of Oct. 16, 1918, as amended by the Act of June 5, 1920, in that he is affiliated with an organization, association, society and group that writes, circulates, distributes, prints, publishes, and displays printed matter advising, advocating', and teaching the overthrow by force and violence of the government of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">- On June 17, 1935, Assistant to the Secretary of Labor ordered deportation. Thereafter the petition in the present proceeding was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to show that he was affiliated with an organization which believes in the overthrow of the government by force and violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In su.ch a proceeding the order denying the petition must be affirmed if there is any evidence from which the conclusion of the administrative tribunal could be deduced. United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Com\u2019r of Immigration, 273 U.S. 103, 106, 47 S.Ct. 302, 303, 71 L.Ed. 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">1. There is ample evidence to show that appellant was \u201caffiliated\u201d with the Communist Party. He was employed as managing editor of the \u201cWestern Worker\u201d which is, as stated in the paper, \u201cpublished on the 1st and 15th of every month by the Communist Party, U. S. A.\u201d Appellant was instructor and had been a director in the \u201cSan Francisco Workers School,\u201d the nature of which is explained by the following excerpt from an announcement of courses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">\u201cIt is necessary to state that the Workers School is the only school in San Francisco which authoritatively bases its education on the theory of Marxism-Leninism under the official guidance and leadership of the Communist Party of the U. S. A. and the Communist International.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">One of the courses offered by the school was \u201cAgitation and Propaganda Methods\u201d which, as stated by the announcement, was \u201climited to members of the Communist Party.\u201d There was evidence that appellant taught one of such classes. There was evidence that appellant addressed a meeting at Oakland, Cal., on June 16, 1934, and at that time solicited funds for the support of the Communist Party. Other evidence was before the administrative tribunal, but the foregoing is -sufficient to show that appellant was \u201caffiliated\u201d with the Communist Party, within the definition as stated by this court in Wolck v. Weedin, 58 F.(2d) 928, 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">2. There is likewise ample evidence to show that the Communist Party advocates \u201cthe overthrow by force or violence of the Government of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AXz\">The \u201cCommunist Manifesto\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAWl\">\u201cThe Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble- at a Communist revolution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACa\">Although many quotations could be made from the evidence in the proceeding, there are many in \u201cToward Soviet America\u201d by Foster, which was introduced by appellant. It is said therein, p. 212:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">\u201cBy the term \u2018abolition\u2019 of capitalism we mean its overthrow in open struggle by the toiling masses, led by the proletariat. Although the world capitalist system constantly plunges deeper into crisis we cannot therefore conclude that it will collapse of its own weight. On the contrary, as Lenin has stated, no matter how difficult the capitalist crisis becomes, \u2018there is no complete absence of a way out\u2019 for the bourgeoise until it faces the revolutionary proletariat in arms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">\u201cIt is the historical task of the proletariat to put a last end to war. Nevertheless, the working class cannot itself come into power without civil war. * * * \u201d P. 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">In this connection, see Kenmotsu v. Nagle (C.C.A.9) 44 F.(2d) 953, 955; Ex parte Vilarino (C.C.A.9) 50 F.(2d) 582, 583, 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">There is evidence that appellant shared the view. In a speech at a street demonstration he stated, according to one witness, that \u201cthey would change the capital<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>istic war into a civil war and overthrow lilis government.\u201d In a conversation with another witness he said, according to the witness, \u201cthey were forced to use violence and force and that is the way they intended to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
