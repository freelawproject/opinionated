The first ground of appellant\u2019s demurrer is that the indictment does not in any count thereof state facts sufficient to constitute \u00e1 public offense. Count 1 alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\u201cThat [appellant], a physician who had duly registered and paid the special tax as required by the [Harrison Narcotic Act], on the 26th day of October, 1935, at Portland, in the State and District of Oregon, and within the jurisdiction of this court, then and there being, did then and there, unlawfully, knowingly, feloniously and willingly sell, barter, exchange and give away to one George Morey a quantity, to-wit: twenty-five (25) grains of a certain compound, manufacture, salt, derivative and preparation of opium, to-wit: morphine sulphate, not in pursuance of any written order of the said George Morey on a form issued for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of the United States, and not in good faith and not in the course of his professional practice only, the said selling, bartering, exchanging and giving away being done and effected through a written order of [appellant], in the form of a prescription signed by [appellant], which said prescription called for the delivery to the said George Morey of the amount of the drug above described; that [appellant] then and there intended that the said George Morey should obtain the said drugs from a druggist upon and by means of said order; that the said George Morey did thereafter obtain upon and by means of said order, drugs of the amount and kind above described pursuant to said prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\u201cThat the said George Morey did not then and there require the administration of morphine sulphate by reason of any disease and that [appellant] did riot sell, barter, exchange or give away any of said drugs for the purpose of treating any disease; but that said drugs were sold, bartered, exchanged and given away by [appellant] in the form in which such drugs are usually consumed by persons addicted to the habitual use thereof, to satisfy their cravings therefor, and were adapted to such consumption and were so sold, bartered, exchanged and given away by [appellant] with the intent that the said drugs should be used for such purpose; contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">Counts 9 and 11 charge sales of cocaine, instead of morphine sulphate. Otherwise, except as to dates, amounts, and names of purchasers, counts 2 to 13^ inclusive, are similar to count 1. Each count sufficiently charges a violation of the above-quoted provision of the Harrison Narcotic Act. Compare Nelms v. United States (C.C.A.9) 22 F.(2d) 79; Du Vall v. United States (C.C.A.9) 82 F.(2d) 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the Harrison Narcotic Act (38 Stat. 785, as amended) is an attempt, under the guise of taxation, to regulate purely intrastate matters and, therefore, unconstitutional. The act, in its original form, was upheld against a similar attack in United States v. Doremus, 249 U.S. 86, 39 S.Ct. 214, 63 L.Ed. 493. It is true that, because of later decisions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> holding unconstitutional certain acts of Congress, which purported to be, but were not in reality, revenue acts, a doubt as to the correctness of the Doremus decision was expressed in United States v. Daugherty, 269 U.S. 360, 362, 46 S.Ct. 156, 70 L.Ed. 309. Subsequently, however, the act was so amended<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as to make of it \u2014 whatever it may have been before \u2014 a genuine taxing act, thus removing any doubt as to its constitutionality. Alston v. United States, 274 U.S. 289, 294, 47 S.Ct. 634, 71 L.Ed. 1052; Nigro v. United States, 276 U.S. 332, 353, 48 S.Ct. 388, 394, 72 L.Ed. 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">The second ground of appellant\u2019s demurrer is that the provision of section 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>of the Harrison Narcotic Act (26 U.S.CA. \u00a7 1044(g) that \u201cit shall be unlawful for \u00e1ny person to obtain by means of said order forms any of the aforesaid drugs for any purpose other than the use, sale, or distribution thereof by him in the conduct of a lawful business in said drugs or in the legitimate practice of his profession,\u201d is unconstitutional. Since appellant is not indicted under or accused of violating this provision, he has no interest or standing to question its validity. That question is not before us and will not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The third and last ground of appellant\u2019s demurrer is that \u201cthere is no provision of the Harrison Narcotic Act which limits the amount of said drugs that a physician may prescribe.\u201d The indictment in this case does not charge appellant with exceeding any such limit. Whether the act does or does not impose such a limit is, therefore, immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\"> Opium or cocoa leaves or any compound, manufacture, salt, derivative or preparation thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\"> Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U.S. 20, <em>42 </em>S.Ct. <em>449, </em>66 L.Ed. <em>817, </em>21 A.L.R. 1432; Hill v.
