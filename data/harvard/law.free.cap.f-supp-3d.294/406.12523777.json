The corollary issue is whether the state agency, the Office of Dispute Resolution (ODR), must first decide the residency issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because a school district has an obligation to provide a free appropriate public\n   education to a disabled child who resides in its jurisdiction, the residency issue is intertwined with IDEA eligibility for FAPE. A residency determination is an issue of state law. Thus, we conclude that a challenge to a residency determination, when intertwined with a disabled child's IDEA claim, must first be presented through the state administrative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The ODR hearing officer must adjudicate the question of residency. Only on appeal from the ODR hearing officer's decision does the federal court have jurisdiction to review the school district's residency determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.P., a disabled child entitled to special education services under the IDEA, attended Bala Cynwyd Middle School in Lower Merion. Dissatisfied with Lower Merion's implementation of his individual educational plan, E.F. enrolled A.P. for the 2015-2016 school year in the Ivymount School, a private school in Rockville, Maryland. She and her children moved to Maryland and she enrolled A.P.'s siblings in a nearby public school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2015, midway through A.P.'s school year at Ivymount, E.F. filed a due process complaint with ODR, seeking reimbursement for the cost of tuition at Ivymount. Lower Merion agreed to reimburse E.F. for A.P.'s tuition at Ivymount for the 2015-2016 school year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 20, 2016, E.F. applied to reenroll A.P. in Bala Cynwyd Middle School for the 2016-2017 school year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 13, 2016, finding that A.P. was not a resident of Lower Merion, Lower Merion concluded that he was ineligible \"to attend school in the District or [another school] at the District's expense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lower Merion advised E.F. that residency in the district was a prerequisite for enrollment or tuition reimbursement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lower Merion notified E.F. that she could challenge the decision at a hearing before either the Lower Merion Board of School Directors or an appointed hearing officer. The notice warned that unless she requested a hearing on or before July 27, 2016, Lower Merion would conclude that she had waived one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   E.F. did not request a hearing before the Lower Merion Board of School Directors or a hearing officer. Instead, on July 20, 2016, she filed a due process complaint with ODR. She claimed that Lower Merion's failure to offer appropriate extended school year services in the summer of 2016 and a special education placement for the 2016-17 school year constituted a denial of FAPE in violation of the IDEA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lower Merion moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that E.F. and A.P. were non-residents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The ODR hearing officer granted Lower Merion's motion to dismiss. He concluded that he lacked jurisdiction to determine residency. He reasoned that because residency \"falls under the School Code and its regulations,\" only the courts, not ODR, have jurisdiction to adjudicate an appeal of a district's residency determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, he did not reach the substantive claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   E.F. then filed this civil action, claiming violations of the IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. She asks that we adjudicate the question of residency and award reimbursement for A.P.'s tuition at Ivymount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, she requests we remand to the hearing officer to conduct an evidentiary hearing to resolve not only her substantive claims, but also the residency issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Moving to dismiss the complaint, Lower Merion challenges subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that E.F. failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. Lower Merion also contends that we must deny E.F.'s request for remand because the hearing officer lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the issue of residency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its Rule 12(b)(1) motion, Lower Merion makes a facial challenge to subject matter jurisdiction. It does not dispute the allegations in the amended complaint. It argues that even accepting E.F.'s allegations as true, they are insufficient to invoke subject matter jurisdiction because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because the issue before us is a legal question, we consider only the allegations in the complaint and the attached documents.\n   <em>\n    Constitution Party of Pa. v.

A school district is obligated to provide FAPE only to qualified students who reside in the school district. Conversely, a school district\n   has no obligation to provide FAPE to ineligible non-residents. Otherwise, parents would be free to place their child in any school district regardless of where they reside. Hence, when challenged, the residency of the disabled child is a threshold issue in the context of an IDEA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The IDEA does not address residency requirements or enrollment policies. Residency is a matter of state law.

Feb. 23, 2007) (the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal from hearing officer's finding of fact that child was a resident of school district; instead, residency question had to first be presented for review before the (now defunct) ODR appeals panel as part of the administrative exhaustion process).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The processes Lower Merion claims A.P. should have pursued are not acceptable alternatives. Lower Merion argues that E.F.'s only recourse from the district's\n   denial of enrollment is the process provided under the Pennsylvania School Code and the Administrative Agency Law. This process entails navigating through several steps that potentially could take years to complete. Such a process frustrates, rather than vindicates, the federally mandated right to FAPE. Thus, to assure that a disabled child gets FAPE as soon as possible, the residency determination must be made at the ODR due process hearing and not relegated to another forum to conduct a separate proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The exhaustion process Lower Merion contends must be followed requires the parent to initially seek review of the school district's decision before the school board. An appeal from the board's adjudication is to the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas in the county where the school district is located.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    2 Pa.

Because the PDE did not rule on E.F.'s complaint, there was no adjudication to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The process for challenging a denial of enrollment for want of residency is inappropriate in an IDEA case. It is lengthy and entails many procedural hurdles. Such a process could thwart or unreasonably delay achieving the goal of the IDEA to provide FAPE. In this case, A.P. is protected by the stay-put provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, a disabled child who requests FAPE for the first time could face a long delay in getting the education to which he is entitled. Awaiting placement too long may have a detrimental effect on the child's educational development. Thus, when the residency issue is intertwined with the IDEA, the ODR hearing officer must resolve it in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because E.F.'s administrative remedies have not been exhausted, we lack subject matter jurisdiction. The ODR hearing officer must resolve the question of residency and the substantive claims. Thus, we shall remand this case to ODR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    1st Am.
