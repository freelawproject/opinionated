Limited (collectively, \"plaintiffs\"), allege that defendants, Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Pennsylvania, Inc. (\"C &amp; W\"), Blank Rome LLP (\"Blank Rome\"), and Cozen O'Conner, P.C. (\"Cozen\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   induced them into investing at least $27 million in a real-estate development project called \"River City,\" in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by fraudulently misrepresenting the applicable zoning restrictions, the feasibility of the project, and the valuation of the real estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court are two Motions for Summary Judgment filed by defendant Cozen O'Connor and Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and four\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   Motions filed by plaintiffs and defendants. This Memorandum addresses Cozen's Motion for Summary Judgment. For the reasons that follow, Cozen's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In the spring of 2006, Ravinder Chawla and Richard Zeghibe developed a plan to purchase and flip the River City Property. Pls.' Counterstatement of Material Facts in Opp. to Mot. Summ. J., \u00b6\u00b6 36-40 (\"Pls.' SOF\") (Document No. 149, filed May 24, 2017). On or about March 14, 2006, Chawla and Zeghibe, through their entities, World Acquisition Partners Corporation (\"WAP\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Patriot Properties, Inc. (\"Patriot),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   retained real estate attorney Charles Naselsky of Cozen O'Connor to represent them in connection with the acquisition of the River City Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 2,3, 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Naselsky formed an entity called JFK BLVD Acquisition GP, LLC (\"JFK Blvd.\"), on or about March 30, 2006, for the purpose of purchasing the River City Property from its owner at that time, R &amp; F Penn Associates, L.P. (\"R &amp; F Penn\"). Cozen SOF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9; Pls' SOF, Ex. PSJX-11, Deposition of Andrew Teitleman, 40: 14-21. Naselsky drafted an agreement of sale, executed by R &amp; F Penn and Zeghibe as the managing member of JFK Blvd., on May 12, 2006, providing for the sale of the River City Property to JFK Blvd. for $32.5 million. Cozen SOF \u00b6 10; Pls.' SOF \u00b6 67. Architect James Rappoport was also hired to design a development concept for the property to attract prospective investors. Cozen SOF \u00b6 18; Pls.' SOF \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2006, Naselsky engaged Cushman &amp; Wakefield (\"C &amp; W\") to appraise the River City Property. Cozen SOF \u00b6 11; Pls.' SOF \u00b6 113. On May 18, 2006, Gerald McNamara, one of the appraisers at C &amp; W, emailed a draft engagement letter to Naselsky in connection with the appraisal of the River City Property. Pls.' SOF \u00b6 118. Naselsky responded to the draft engagement letter with proposed edits, which included changing the client name from Cozen O'Conner to \"JFK Acquisition G.P., LLC\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and expanding the intended users section of the appraisal to include, not just the client, but \"its professionals, investors and potential lenders.\" Pls.' SOF \u00b6\u00b6 126-28, 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   C &amp; W issued a draft appraisal on June 23, 2006, which appraised the property at $57 million. Pls.' SOF \u00b6 140; Cozen SOF \u00b6 30. The June 2006 draft appraisal stated that the River City Property \"is currently reported to be under a contract of sale, dated January 2006, for a reported consideration of $50,000,000.\" Cozen SOF \u00b6 31; Pls.' SOF \u00b6 142. The June 2006 draft appraisal misstated both the sale price and date of the contract between JFK Blvd. and R &amp; F Penn; the contract was executed in May 2006, not January 2006, and the sale price was $32.5 million, not $50 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon receipt of the June 2006 draft appraisal, Chawla emailed Naselsky instructing him to: \"Please do your magic and push the value over $100 million.\" Cozen SOF, Ex. 23, Email from Ravinder Chawla to Charles Naselsky and Richard Zeghibe; Pls.' SOF \u00b6 158. Zeghibe also provided feedback with respect to the June\n   2006 draft appraisal and expressed his belief that the appraised value should be higher given the River City Property's development potential. Cozen SOF, Ex. 24, Email from Richard Zeghibe to Charles Naselsky and Ravi Chawla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Naselsky emailed McNamara on July 4, 2006, expressing concern about the $57 million figure in the June 2006 draft appraisal, stating: \"[i]n essence, the number is conveniently close to the contract price where the factors that need to go into play for a development assemblage of this type seem to be missing.\" Pls.' SOF \u00b6 170. On July 10, 2006, Naselsky met with Daniel McNeil, the C &amp; W employee who drafted the June 2006 draft appraisal, to discuss his concerns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 172; Cozen SOF \u00b6 34. Ten days later, McNeil submitted a revised draft appraisal (\"the July 2006 draft appraisal\") of the River City Property with a new appraised value of $77 million. Pls.' SOF \u00b6 191; Cozen SOF \u00b6 36. The July 2006 draft appraisal again listed the sale price of the property between R &amp; F Penn and JFK Blvd. as $50 million, not the actual sale price of $32.5 million. Pls.' SOF \u00b6 192.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 27, 2006, Naselsky emailed Zeghibe and Chawla, attaching an \"Agreement of Sale\" by which JFK Blvd. was to sell the River City Property to WAP for $50 million. Pls.' SOF, Ex. P-132; Cozen SOF \u00b6 22. According to plaintiffs, the transaction never occurred. Instead, the purported transaction was an \"internal flip\" used to \"increase[ ] valuations based on agreements of sale that were never intended to close.\" Pls.' SOF \u00b6 220.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Naselsky left his employment with Cozen on July 28, 2006. Cozen SOF \u00b6 4. On July 31, 2006, Naselsky commenced employment with Blank Rome LLP (\"Blank Rome\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. In his role at Blank Rome, Naselsky continued to work with Chawla and Zeghibe on the River City Property. Pls.' SOF \u00b6 234.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Post-Cozen: The Proposed Zoning Ordinance, and Eli Weinstein\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 7, 2006, Naselsky received an email from Chawla notifying him that the City Council had passed a Proposed Zoning Ordinance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cozen SOF \u00b6 53. Shortly before Chawla and Zeghibe began working to acquire the River City Property in the spring of 2006, the Philadelphia City Council introduced Bill No. 060292, titled \"An ordinance amending Section 14-1611 of the Philadelphia Code, entitled 'Benjamin Franklin Parkway Controls,' \" (the \"Proposed Zoning Ordinance\"). Cozen SOF \u00b6 43. On May 25, 2006, the Proposed Zoning Ordinance was amended to expand the territory impacted to include two of the five parcels of the River City Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. The Proposed Zoning Ordinance, passed by the Philadelphia City Council on June 8, 2006, imposed a height limit of 125 feet on the impacted territory, including two of the five River City Property parcels.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Despite the height limitations imposed by the Proposed Zoning Ordinance, Chawla and Zeghibe solicited investors to purchase the River City Property. On August 29, 2006, Chawla and Zeghibe met with Eli Weinstein, who expressed an interest in\n   purchasing the River City Property. Cozen SOF \u00b6 68; Pls.' SOF \u00b6 291. Weinstein was a real estate investor who lived in Lakewood, New Jersey and is a member of the Orthodox Jewish community there. Cozen SOF \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 26, 2006, Weinstein agreed to purchase the River City Property for $70 million. Cozen SOF \u00b6 69, ex. 47, \"Nominee Agreement between World Acquisition Partners Corp. and Eli Weinstein\"; Pls.' SOF \u00b6 296.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weinstein sought potential investors in the River City Property, including Berish Berger. Cozen SOF \u00b6 106. Berger is a real estate investor who lives in London, and is a member of the Orthodox Jewish community there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 82, 83. On December 6, 2006, Berger was present at a meeting in Philadelphia attended by Weinstein, Chawla, and Rappoport,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   at which Rappoport presented his designs for the River City Property. Pls' SOF \u00b6 407; Cozen SOF \u00b6 113. Following the December 6, 2006, meeting, Berger received a copy of the C &amp; W appraisal which valued the River City Property at $77 million. Cozen SOF \u00b6 117; Pls.' SOF \u00b6\u00b6 427-29. Berger agreed to partner with Weinstein to purchase the River City property. Cozen SOF \u00b6 120.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 18, 2006, plaintiff Kilbride, a discretionary family trust established by Berger's father, sent $12 million to Montgomery Abstract Company, a title company which held funds for the purchase of the River City Property. Cozen SOF \u00b6\u00b6 84, 121; Pls.' SOF \u00b6 451. Upon Berger's request, plaintiff Busystore Limited, a United Kingdom company formed by Berger and his wife to conduct real estate business, wired $9.5 million to Weinstein and his entity, Pine Projects LLC. Pls.' SOF \u00b6 455. On January 19, 2007, plaintiff Bergfeld, a real estate company of which Berger is one of nine directors,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   wired $5 million to Pine Projects. Cozen SOF \u00b6 137; Pls.' SOF \u00b6 479.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Berger later discovered that Weinstein had misappropriated the funds sent to Pine Projects. As a consequence, plaintiffs never obtained an interest in the River City Property. Cozen SOF \u00b6 141.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This case is the fourth civil action filed by Berish Berger and/or plaintiffs arising from the River City development project. The Court detailed the procedural history of this case at length in its Memorandum dated August 18, 2017, (Document No. 177) and sees no need to repeat it. The Court notes only that, after issuance of the Memorandum and Order dated August 18, 2017, by which the Court granted the Motion By Defendants, Blank Rome LLP, Cozen O'Connor, P.C., and Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Pennsylvania, Inc., for Summary Judgment as to the Claims of Plaintiffs Berish Berger, Ardenlink Limited, and Towerstates Limited for Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction Based Upon Want of Standing, the remaining plaintiffs are Kilbride Investments Limited, Busystore Limited In Liquidation, and Bergfeld Co.

Pennsylvania courts long imposed liability on employers through\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   where there is no evidence that the employer had knowledge of, or authorized, the tortious conduct \"on the ground of public policy, that it is more reasonable that when one of two innocent persons must suffer from the wrongful act of a third person, that the principal who has placed the agent in the position of trust and confidence should suffer, rather than an innocent stranger.\"\n   <em>\n    Aiello v.

A contrary holding would \"permit the person who held out his agent as worthy of trust and confidence to escape liability for his agent's deceits and frauds, while at the same time reaping the fruits of his agent's fraud, all at the expense of an innocent third party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 287. Cozen's argument that conspiracy liability and\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   are inconsistent fails because the very purpose of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability is to impose liability on the employer regardless of knowledge of or participation in the alleged tortious conduct. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Cozen may be held liable for conspiracy under the theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Liability under\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   is, however, limited to acts committed \"\n   <em>\n    during the course of\n   </em>\n   and within the scope of employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Costa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11813831,11814043,281179,281084,11813917\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/490/\">\n    708 A.2d at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Accordingly, Cozen's potential liability is not unlimited; instead Cozen may only be held liable under a theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   for action taken in furtherance of the conspiracy during Naselsky's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Cozen concedes that Naselsky was acting within the scope of his employment in his work with Chawla and Zeghibe through \"negotiating a purchase agreement for his clients, forming a special-purpose entity to acquire the property, communicating legal advice to his clients, and engaging various vendors ... on behalf of his client.\" Memo. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 53-54. Cozen may, therefore, only be held liable for actions taken in furtherance of the conspiracy that occurred prior to July 28, 2006, at which time Naselsky left his employment with the firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Memo. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 30. Because Naselsky did not conspire with Weinstein while he was at Cozen, Naselsky cannot be liable for Weinstein's fraud and Cozen cannot be liable under a theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   for that fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40. But plaintiffs' evidence is not limited to Weinstein's conduct. Plaintiffs have presented evidence that Naselsky and Chawla took numerous steps to fraudulently inflate the price of the River City Property and concealed from investors the height limitations imposed by the proposed zoning ordinance for the purpose of misleading potential investors into purchasing the Property. Accordingly, the Court must determine whether plaintiffs have established a prima facie case upon which a jury could conclude that Naselsky conspired with Chawla to defraud plaintiffs as potential investors in the River City Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Liability for civil conspiracy under Pennsylvania law occurs upon a showing of \"(1) a combination of two or more persons acting with a common purpose to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means or for an unlawful purpose; (2) an overt act done in pursuance of the common purpose; and (3) actual legal damage.\"\n   <em>\n    Gen.

In return, Naselsky omitted legal fees owed to Cozen on the settlement sheets at real estate closings so that Chawla would not be required to use closing proceeds to pay for legal services performed in connection with the transaction, allowing him to delay payment until receipt of funds from an investor to avoid using his own money to pay for closing costs. Pls. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 32-36.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is against this backdrop that plaintiffs assert Naselsky continued to represent Chawla's entity, WAP, in connection with the purchase of the River City Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs have further provided evidence that Naselsky took the following overt actions in furtherance of the conspiracy: (1) Naselsky asked C &amp; W to revise the engagement letter for the 2006 Appraisal to expand the \"Intended Users\" section so that the appraisal \"could be shown to JFK GP, LLC's potential lenders and potential investors ... and used to defraud them,\" Pls.' SOF \u00b6\u00b6 128, 129; (2) Naselsky failed\n   to correct information in both the June and July 2006 draft appraisals that he knew to be false-that the River City Property was under contract of sale for $50 million when in fact the sale price was $32.5 million; (3) Naselsky misrepresented to C &amp; W that the agreement of sale for the River City Property was a private sale with no brokers involved, when he knew that to be false; (4) Naselsky met with C &amp; W appraiser to persuade him to increase the appraisal value from $57 million to $77 million; and (5) Naselsky negotiated and drafted the June 26, 2006, \"Agreement of Sale,\" which he knew was an \"internal flip\" designed to fraudulently increase the value of the River City Property; (5) and that Naselsky assisted the financing of the conspiracy by leaving Cozen's legal fees \"off the sheets\" at closing, thus allowing Chawla and Zeghibe to delay payment to Cozen until they received funds from an investor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs have also presented evidence that Naselsky learned of the height ordinance while he worked at Cozen. Pls' SOF \u00b6 25. On this issue, plaintiffs cite Naselsky's trial testimony in 2010:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q.

The Court disagrees. Naselsky left his employment with Cozen on July 28, 2006. If Naselsky learned of the proposed ordinance during the \"early summer of 2006,\" that could certainly have occurred prior to July 28, 2006, while Naselsky was still employed at Cozen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Construing the foregoing evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the Court concludes that a fact-finder could conclude that Naselsky agreed with Chawla to fraudulently inflate the price of the River City Property and conceal the existence of the proposed height ordinance in order to sell it to unwitting investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that there is evidence of one additional overt act taken in furtherance of the conspiracy during the time in which Naselsky was employed at Cozen. The Court disagrees. Plaintiffs argue that there is evidence that \"Naselsky or Rappoport\" provided C &amp; W with false information regarding the purported $50 million sale. Pls.' Resp. to Cozen's Mot. Summ. J. at 2. However, this statement is based on deposition testimony that\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   Naselsky or Rappoport provided that information to C &amp; W. There is no other evidence with respect to that issue. Without more evidence, a juror would be required to speculate with respect to the source of this information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robertson v.
