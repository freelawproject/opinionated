Determan\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 17.] The Complaint alleges the following claims: negligent design, development, manufacture, construction, assembly, testing, inspection, sale, distribution, failure to remedy potential hazards, and failure to failure to warn of potential hazards (\"Count I\"); wanton, fraudulent, willful, and/or reckless design, development, manufacture, construction, assembly, testing, inspection, sale, distribution, failure to remedy potential hazards, and failure to failure to warn of potential hazards (\"Count II\"); and a products liability claim (\"Count III\"). Plaintiffs pray for: general, special, compensatory, and punitive damages; attorneys' fees and costs; and any other appropriate relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Each of Plaintiffs' claims alleges that Defendants: \"designed, developed, manufactured, built, assembled, tested, sold and/or distributed the subject MV-22 Osprey aircraft without reasonably precise specifications from the United States government;\" [Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 27, 37, 49;] and \"failed to ensure that the subject MV-22 Osprey aircraft conformed to design specifications articulated by Defendants and/or the United States government,\" [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 38, 50].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The accident at issue in this case occurred on May 17, 2015, when the Subject Aircraft, was making its second attempt to land at the Marine Corps Training Area Bellows on Oahu (\"MCTAB\" and \"the Subject Accident\").

CSOF at \u00b6 3; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 3.] Plaintiffs add that the Subject Aircraft experienced the brownout after it descended to twenty five feet, and was at an altitude of between 25-35 feet during the thirty-five-second brownout. [Pltfs.' CSOF at Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6 (citing Command Investigation Memo at p. 18, \u00b6 115 &amp; \u00b6 158).] Because of the brownout, the Subject Aircraft conducted a \"wave off,\" climbing in a predetermined pattern to avoid the brownout. It then attempted a second landing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8 (citing Command Investigation Memo at \u00b6\u00b6 162, 170).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The second attempt to land caused another brownout that engulfed the Subject Aircraft for approximately another 45 seconds.\" [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 4; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 4.] Plaintiffs add that the second brownout occurred after the Subject Aircraft descended to twenty five feet, and it was at an altitude of between 25-110 feet during the forty-five-second brownout. [Pltfs.' CSOF at Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9 (citing Command Investigation Memo at \u00b6\u00b6 170-71).] While the Subject Aircraft was attempting to climb out of the second brownout, there was a loud bang and three red flashes from the bottom exhaust of the engine on the port side. The Subject Aircraft fell to the ground at a speed of 2100 feet per minute from an altitude of 110 feet. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11 (citing Command Investigation Memo at \u00b6\u00b6 170, 173-74).] L.C. Determan was removed from the Subject Aircraft and transported to Castle Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, having suffered blunt force head trauma during the crash. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14 (citing Command Investigation Memo at \u00b6 228).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Marine Corp Command Investigation determined that the Subject Accident was the result of \"engine failure caused by ingestion of sand and particulates into the engine compressor.\" [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 5; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 5 (admitting Defendants' \u00b6 5 \"with a clarification\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] Plaintiffs clarify that the sand was reactive,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   corrosive, and it \"accumulated and physically altered the ability of the engine to ingest air.\" According to Plaintiffs, if the sand was non-reactive, \"the engine likely would not have failed.\" [Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 5 (citing Pltfs.' CSOF (sealed), Exh. C (Risk Assessment of Reduced Visibility Landings, dated 8/19/15) (dkt. no. 98-3) at NAVY15185-92).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Non-party Rolls-Royce designed, developed, and manufactured the Subject Aircraft's engine, pursuant to a V-22 program that was separate from the government's development contracts with Bell and Boeing. [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 6; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 6 (admitting Defendants' \u00b6 6 \"with a clarification\").] Plaintiffs emphasize that Rolls-Royce delivered at least one engine to Defendants for testing purposes. [Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 6 (citing Pltfs.' CSOF (sealed), Exh. J (dkt. no. 98-10) at BELL008505).] At the time of the 2011 delivery, the engines on the Subject Aircraft \"were Government Furnished Equipment ('GFE'), meaning the Navy procured them from Rolls-Royce and had them delivered to Bell-Boeing for installation.\" [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 7; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 7.] Plaintiffs' claims in this case are based upon the failure of the Subject Aircraft's Engine Air Particle Separator (\"EAPS\") system, including, but not limited to the EAPS system's failure to prevent the engine from ingesting dust and particulates. [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 8; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 8.] An EAPS system is \"designed to remove sand, dust, and single foreign objects from the air entering a turboshaft engine,\" and the system's purpose \"is to improve performance of gas turbine engines, which historically performed poorly in air containing sand, dust, ash, dirt, or other particulate.\" [Defs.' CSOF, Decl. of David Loe (redacted) (\"Redacted Loe Decl.\") at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs emphasize the cause of the Subject Accident was not sand erosion, but the accumulation of sand and dust in the engine during the two landing attempts. As a result of the accumulation, \"airflow to the engine was disrupted, which caused a complete compressor failure, ultimately resulting in engine failure.\" [Pltfs.' CSOF at Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18 (citing Command Investigation Memo at p. 26, \u00b6 1).] Plaintiffs contend the EAPS system was defective and either caused or contributed to the Subject Accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 1986, the federal government awarded the V-22 Full Scale Development Contract (\"FSD Contract\") to a joint venture between Boeing and Bell (\"Bell-Boeing\"). The FSD Contract called for a design that complied with the then-current version of Detail Specification 572-1, a Navy document approved by Naval Air Systems Command (\"NAVAIR\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, every specification in Detail Specification 572-1 that was incorporated into the FSD Contract was approved by NAVAIR. [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6\u00b6 10-13; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6\u00b6 10-13.] The parties agree that, \"[w]hen it originally approved and issued Detail Specification SD-572-1, NAVAIR was aware that the ingestion of sand, dust and particulates can degrade turbine engine performance,\" but they disagree as to the extent of NAVAIR's knowledge at that stage. [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 14; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 14.] Detail Specification 572-1 \u00a7 3.12.5.2.3, which was incorporated into the FSD Contract, \"contained NAVAIR's specifications for the V-22\" EAPS system, \"including efficiency requirements.\" [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 15; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 15.] The parties agree that Bell-Boeing and NAVAIR negotiated the separation efficiency requirements that were ultimately included in Detail Specification 572-1. [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 17; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 17.] However, they disagree as to the extent, if any, of NAVAIR's involvement with Bell-Boeing in the design phase. [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 16; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 16 (disputing Defs.' \u00b6 16).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties agree that, between 1986 and 1988, Bell-Boeing tested a full scale model of the proposed EAPS system for the V-22. [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 18; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 18.] However, Plaintiffs emphasize that Eaton may have been involved with the testing, and Plaintiffs contend that there is no information about the Navy's and/or NAVAIR's involvement, except for the approval documentation showing conformity with performance standards. [Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 18.] At the end of the testing, NAVAIR reviewed and approved a test report, and one of the tested configurations became the NAVAIR-authorized design for the V-22 EAPS system and the only approved configuration for V-22 aircraft. [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6\u00b6 19-21; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6\u00b6 19-21.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Subject Aircraft was delivered to the Navy pursuant to its procurement contract with Bell-Boeing, contract number N00019-07-C-001 (\"the Procurement Contract\"). The Procurement Contract required that the Subject Aircraft conform to Drawing Number 901-100-011 and the specifications in the then-current version of Detail Specification 572-1-3. Detail\n   Specification 572-1-3 contained the same EAPS system efficiency specifications as in Detail Specification 572-1 and the FSD Contract. [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6\u00b6 22-24; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.] The parties agree that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The NAVAIR-approved V-22 design set forth in the drawings and other documents incorporated in Drawing 901-100-011, and which thus constitutes the design required by the procurement contract, includes the design features of the EAPS system that was reviewed and approved by NAVAIR in conjunction with testing of the EAPS system from 1986 through 1988, every modification of which that could affect the functional or technical requirements of the EAPS system had been reviewed and approved by NAVAIR.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 26; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 26.] The design also includes the \"Critical Item Development Specification for Engine Air Particle Separator Blower 901-947-258 and Bell/Boeing Source Control Drawing 901-362-203, and which thus constitutes the design required by the procurement contract,\" and \"include[s] the blowers that were designed, qualified, and supplied specifically for the V-22 by defendant Eaton, and approved by NAVAIR.\" [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 27; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 27.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   NAVAIR's designees conducted inspections and testing-including flight tests-to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , verify conformity with Drawing Number 901-100-011 and Detail Specification 572-1-3. Thereafter, Bell-Boeing delivered the Subject Aircraft to the Navy on April 29, 2011. [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6\u00b6 28-30; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6\u00b6 28-30.] On that date, the Navy executed a Form DD250 \"Material Inspection and Receiving Report\" for the Subject Aircraft (\"Subject Form DD250\"). [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 31; Pltfs.' CSOF at \u00b6 31.] Defendants state the Subject Form DD250 \"confirms that, subject to specifically identified exceptions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Subject Aircraft conformed to Drawing Number 901-100-011 and with Detail Specification SD-572-1-3.\" [Defs.' CSOF at \u00b6 32.] Plaintiffs assert other documentation calls into question the EAPS system's conformity with government specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Navy issues the Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization manual for the V-22 (\"V-22 NATOPS Manual\").

In addition to claims failing\n   within the negligent design and manufacture category, the instant case involves claims failing within the failure-to-warn category. Although the government contractor defense may apply to state law failure-to-warn claims, because the\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   involved claims alleging design or manufacturing defects, the analysis does not adequately address the preemption of failure-to-warn claims.\n   <em>\n    Getz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876014\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/852/#p860\">\n    654 F.3d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, we knew that the impact of sand and dust ingestion on performance depended on the following: first, the environment\u00b7in which the aircraft would be operated; second, the design of the engine air intake system and, more specifically, the method selected for sand/dust filtration or extraction; and third, the design of the engine with respect to its tolerance for sand/dust ingestion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   18. The NAVAIR engineers who prepared, reviewed, and ultimately approved the V-22 design specifications were aware of dangers of sand/dust ingestion and, by specification, required design risk mitigation. The contents of the V-22 Detail Specification make it clear that knowledge of this risk informed the Navy's design and development program from its inception.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   [Redacted Pauling Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18.] Defendants also provide similar testimony from Bell-Boeing's perspective. [Redacted Loe Decl. at \u00b6 7.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As previously noted, the V-22 is only manufactured for the government. Thus, \"the Government is the first entity to learn about any danger in the aircraft's EAPS. Whatever knowledge Bell and Boeing gain about such dangers must necessarily come from the Government itself.\" [Redacted Pauling Decl. at \u00b6 30.] For example, the government was aware of the August 2013 accident and issued IC 78 as a result, but the government has not changed the EAPS system specifications over the years. The government was therefore aware of the potential problem prior to the Subject Accident and made changes to the V-22 NATOPS Manual that it deemed appropriate, while declining to make design changes. Defendants were not required to warn of dangers regarding the V-22 EAPS system that were already known to the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Getz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876014\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/852/#p860\">\n    654 F.3d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because the MH-47E is operated exclusively by the United States Army, government personnel were necessarily aware of the potential problem prior to the crash. Again,\n   <em>\n    Boyle\n   </em>\n   does not require government contractors to warn of dangers that were already known to the United States.\" (citing\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775177\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/500/\">\n    487 U.S. at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775177\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/500/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ).
