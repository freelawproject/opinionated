CHEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Ford manufactured vehicles with defective door latches which permit the door sensors to become contaminated over time, and thus to falsely signal that a door is not closed when in fact it is, posing a variety of safety risks. Plaintiffs bring causes of action for breach of express and implied warranty and under consumer fraud laws for failure to disclose a material defect. Defendant moves to dismiss all claims. As explained below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that certain Ford and Lincoln vehicles contain defects in the door latch assembly that cause certain sensors to become contaminated over time and\n   thus to falsely signal that a door is open when it is in fact closed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), Docket No. 18, \u00b6\u00b6 1-14. The affected vehicles are 2011-2016 Ford Edges, 2012-2014 Ford Flexes, 20131-2014 Ford Explorers, 2011-2013 Lincoln MKXs, and 2013 Lincoln MKTs (the \"Subject Vehicles\"). FAC \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defect is inherent to the vehicles in question. In particular, the door latch assembly uses an integral electro-mechanical switch (i.e., a sensor) that detects whether the door is open or closed based on the voltage signal received from the switch. FAC \u00b6 35. The vehicles contain a Body Control Module (\"BCM\") that monitors the voltage from the door latch switch to determine whether the door is open or closed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. When the switch indicates that the door is closed, the BCM sends a \"wetting current\" through the electrical connector from the door latch switch to the BCM that is supposed to keep the sensor clean.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A \"wetting current\" is \"the minimum electric current needed to flow through an electrical contact to break through the surface film resistance on the contact\" and to prevent a film of oxidation that may occur from humidity and exposure to moisture.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defect arises from the allegation that the \"wetting current\" used by the Subject Vehicles is too low to prevent such surface film from accumulating, and thus too low to keep the sensor clean.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. In particular, beginning in 2011, the BCM was modified to \"reduc[e] the wetting current sent out to clean the switch contacts by more than 75%,\" which Ford admits \"is not sufficient to keep the switch contacts clean and contamination build up [then] causes them to fail.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As the contamination progresses, it interferes with the accuracy of the voltage readings, falsely indicating to the BCM that a door is open when it is in fact closed. This \"triggers an audible warning, activates a visual warning on the instrument panel, and sends out a visual intermittent 'shift to park' message\" because the faulty sensor causes the vehicle computer system to mistakenly believe the vehicle has stopped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. In addition, \"all interior lights are illuminated and the doors are unlocked, and they cannot then be manually relocked.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This \"can continue for several hours, even after the vehicle is parked and turned off, draining the battery and potentially stranding vehicle occupants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, the defect causes the vehicle's autolock feature to fail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. The autolock feature \"will lock all the doors when: all the doors are closed, the ignition is on, you shift into any gear putting your vehicle in motion, and your vehicle reaches a speed greater than 12mph\" as well as when \"you open then close any door while the ignition is on and the vehicle speed is 9mph (15 km/h) or lower, and your vehicle then reaches a speed greater than 12 mph.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Ford knew about the defect. In 2014, Ford issued a Technical Service Bulletin (\"TSB\") to dealerships describing the defect in detail and its cause. Ford recommended dealers use a special tool to perform a fix that would \"clean\" the sensors, a procedure known as \"burning the wires.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Plaintiffs describe this \"fix\" as a \"work-around that did not repair the underlying defect but temporarily stopped it from manifesting for a short period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Allegedly, this allowed Ford to \"give the false appearance of repairing the defect, and doing so at a lower repair cost and often during the warranty period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because it was a temporary fix, however, many customers reported recurrence of the defect, typically after the warranty period, at which point Ford would recommend that drivers \"replace the entire door watch assembly at a significant cost to vehicle owners and lessees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs suggest that Ford intentionally used only a less expensive\n   temporary fix during the warranty period in order to shift the cost of repairing the underlying defect onto consumers after expiration of the warranty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This faulty repair process-which temporarily covered up the symptoms but failed to repair the defect-is the basis for Plaintiffs' claims for breach of express warranty. (All the vehicles are subject to a three year or 36,000 mile \"Bumper to Bumper\" warranty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defect has affected a significant number of vehicles. Plaintiffs allege that \"[o]ver 2,670 people have reported false door ajar problems to NHTSA and Ford and more than 33,000 warranty claims [for the problem] ha[ve] been submitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs claim the door latch defect gives rise to various safety risks. Various studies have shown that having a door which is locked and remains closed during an accident improves a vehicle's crashworthiness and reduces the likelihood of an occupant being ejected in a crash.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 60-63. Automatic door locks \"improve the likelihood that doors will stay closed in the event of an accident, retaining the structural integrity of the vehicle and lowering the chance of occupant ejection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") \"has repeatedly urged parents to purchase vehicles with automatic door locks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. The inability to lock the doors while in motion places drivers at risk because it increases the risk of carjacking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68, 70-71. In addition, it permits passengers, such as young children, to open the doors while in motion because neither the autolocking system nor manual override permit them to be locked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. At least 14 consumers reported doors opening while in motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that the audio and visual signals are allegedly distracting to drivers, causing some to pull over and check the doors, placing them at risk of being struck by vehicles on the roadway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 72-77. In particular, when the interior dome lights remain on, especially at night, there is a \"reduction in object visibility resulting from diminished contrast\" as well as a distraction \"from what is going on outside the car at night.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Finally, because the lights will not turn off when the vehicle thinks the doors are open, even when the vehicle is off or parked, the battery may drain and has drained for several Plaintiffs and consumers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege violations of various state consumer fraud laws, breach of implied warranty, and breach of express warranty.

The NHTSA Findings indicate that the NHTSA opened an investigation in September 28, 2016 and closed it on March 20, 2017 into a total of 1,983 complaints related to door ajar warning lights in 2011-2013 Ford Edge vehicles. Reported safety consequences included \"doors opening while driving (because doors were initially not latched properly), doors cannot be locked while driving, and the interior dome lights staying on continuously.\" NHTSA Findings at 1. The failures were caused by the same defect described in Plaintiffs' complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The NHTSA identified 14 complaints in which a door opened while driving, 12 out of 14 involving an incident where \"an occupant of the vehicle (often a child) opened a passenger door because the doors were not locked.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No accidents were reported. The NHTSA concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   After reviewing all available data, an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety has not been identified. The door latches themselves continue to function properly, remaining securely latched until acted upon by a driver or passenger. Child safety locks on the rear doors continue to function properly and can be used to prevent the rear doors from opening via the inside door handles. Vehicle crashworthiness is not affected by the lock condition of the doors and all active safety systems continue to function normally even if the vehicle BCM believes one or more doors is open. In addition, no accidents or accident related injuries have been reported.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A safety-related defect trend has not been identified at this time and further use of agency resources does not appear to be warranted.

Rather, Ford argues that it may not be liable unless Plaintiffs allege that Ford subjectively believed that the defect was an unreasonable safety hazard and failed to disclose that belief, or that its conclusion that no defect requiring a recall under the NHTSA standards was unreasonable. Ford also disputes whether the safety hazard was unreasonable, arguing Plaintiffs must identify a specific safety standard which the defect violated. Ford also argues that, in any case, any safety issue could be mitigated through prompt action to address the issue by the driver and therefore was not unreasonable.

Plaintiffs have identified the specific defect, shown that it is inherent to all the vehicles as admitted in Ford's 2014 TSB, demonstrated that it affects thousands of other drivers, and that they and others have incurred costs attempting to repair it.

A jury could conclude that in such circumstances the defect could pose an unreasonable safety risk-such as the interior dome lights impairing night-time visibility while driving, the inability to protect vehicle occupants by locking the doors while in motion, and the risk of the battery draining and stranding a driver in an unsafe location. Although Ford argues that the safety risk is unreasonable only if drivers ignore the problem and fail to repair it promptly, a driver may be at risk as long as he or she is required to drive the vehicle before having an opportunity to service it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Ford's motion to dismiss the post-warranty claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Reliance Under Illinois, California, North Carolina, and Michigan Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Ford argues that Plaintiffs have inadequately pled reliance (and therefore causation) under the consumer protection laws of Illinois, California, North Carolina and Michigan.

In particular, the conclusion that there has been \"no omission\" does not follow from the premise that \"there has been no communication with the plaintiff\" because it fails to consider whether, separate and apart from the communications that\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   took place, there were others that\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have taken place if the defendant had exercised reasonable care. Indeed, as explained above in the context of California law, the more sensible inquiry in an omission claim that already deals with a hypothetical realm is the\n   <em>\n    opportunity\n   </em>\n   to communicate; in other words, whether the plaintiff would have received the information if properly disclosed, not whether the plaintiff actually communicated with the defendant. Nevertheless, the Court is obligated to apply what appears to be the Illinois Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    De Bouse\n   </em>\n   with respect to Illinois state law: that a plaintiff must demonstrate he or she actually communicated with a defendant to demonstrate reliance in an omission case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiff Abruscato alleges that she purchased her vehicle new from a Ford dealership, however.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85. As explained above with respect to the California Plaintiffs, it is plausible to infer that Ms. Abruscato would have communicated with sales agents at that dealership in connection with her purchase. Further, as discussed above, Plaintiffs have alleged that the Ford dealerships were agents of Ford. These allegations are sufficient, at this stage, to support an inference that Plaintiff in fact communicated with Ford's agents, as apparently required by\n   <em>\n    De Bouse\n   </em>\n   to state an omission claim. The Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Ford's request to dismiss Plaintiff Abruscato's claim.

They argue such notice was adequate because Ford's warranty itself instructs owners that \"[y]ou are responsible for presenting your vehicle to a Ford Motor Company dealer as soon as a problem exists.\" ECF Nos. 37-1 at 25, 37-2 at 25, 37-3 at 25 (sample warranties). Moreover, Ford has a policy \"that when a repair is made under warranty the dealership must provide Defendant with detailed documentation of the problem and the fix employed to correct it.\" FAC \u00b6 46. Thus, notice to the dealers constitutes notice to Ford for purposes of warranty repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Ford counters that such notice is insufficient because it does not constitute notice of a\n   <em>\n    breach\n   </em>\n   , but rather, simply a request for a repair; moreover, some vehicles were presented for repair\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the warranty coverage period. The success of this argument varies by state. In most of the states at issue, the notice requirement is satisfied by presenting the car to an authorized dealership for warranty service even if a breach is not specifically alleged. These states include Illinois (Abruscato and Furno),\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   New York (Jenkin),\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Florida (Farrell),\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   New Mexico\n   (Caron),\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   North Carolina (Abbott),\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and New Hampshire (Brown).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, California (Nicolau)\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not require notice to a defendant manufacturer if, as here, the consumer did not directly deal with the manufacturer and the manufacturer was not the seller.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Ford's motion with respect to Plaintiffs Abruscato, Furno, Jenkin, Farrell, Abbott, Brown, and Nicolau.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiff Caron's claim under New Mexico law must be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   , however. Although a request for warranty service without specific notice of a breach appears to be sufficient under New Mexico law,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   n. 15, Caron did not present his vehicle for repair during the warranty period. There is no basis to infer that Ford would have been informed of a non-warranty repair because Plaintiffs do not allege that Ford dealers were required to report non-warranty service requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Ford's request to dismiss Plaintiff Kinnunen's claim because Michigan requires notice of a breach (not just a request for warranty service).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Express Warranty Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs' express warranty claims fall in two camps: (1) Ford performed inadequate repairs because it simply cleaned the contaminated sensors (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"burned the wires\") rather than repair the defect and (2) the warranty includes an \"unconscionable\" three-year or 36,000 mile limit on the warranty when Ford knew that repairs for the door ajar defect would be required beyond that period, such that requiring owners to pay for repairs after that time was also breach of warranty. Ford moves to dismiss the first category of claims on the basis that applying only a temporary fix is not a breach of warranty and no Plaintiff alleges a refusal to apply any fix whatsoever during the warranty period.

Ford argues in its Reply that its warranty did not require it to do anything more. The warranty expressly states, \"[n]othing in this warranty should be construed as requiring defective parts to be replaced with parts of a different type or design than the original part, so long as the vehicle functions properly with the replacement part.\" Eikey Decl., Ex. 1 at 9 (Docket No. 37-1) (2011 Warranty). Thus, the warranty does not require Ford to replace any part if other measures can remedy the malfunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Here, Ford merely \"burned the wires\" to cleanse the door latch sensors of corrosion causing the false warnings without replacing any parts. Nevertheless, the warranty permits Ford simply to make \"adjustments\" to correct the malfunctioning part. Although this adjustment may not have prevented eventual recurrence of corrosion and malfunctioning of the sensor\n   after expiration of the warranty, the warranty does not appear to require Ford to do anything more. This situation is no different from the warranty related to any other part that will eventually require replacement outside the warranty period even where eventual, post-warranty replacement is predictable. Regardless of whether such a situation may give rise to another legal claim, it does not constitute a breach of the express warranty. Ford's motion to dismiss the express warranty claims is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Unconscionability of 3-year/36,000 mile coverage period\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiffs Brown, Kubber, and Caron,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   who did not seek warranty service during the coverage period, claim that the durational limits were unconscionable. They can demonstrate neither procedural nor substantive unconscionability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Plaintiffs' sole argument for procedural unconscionability is that Ford \"used its superior knowledge, bargaining power, and control over its dealerships and its customers to craft a nationwide TSB directing a 'repair' of the door ajar defect that was not a repair, surprising its customers with a re-manifesting defect and news that by 'repair' Ford actually meant 'temporary work-around.' \" Opp. at 20. They cite no case-law to support this theory, however. Moreover, procedural unconscionability relates to contract formation. Plaintiffs Caron, Brown, and Kubber agreed to the terms of the warranty when they purchased their vehicles-before the allegedly unconscionable act of issuing a limited TSB in 2014 despite knowledge of a latent defect. Thus, Ford's 2014 TSB could not have spoken to formation of the contract at the time of their earlier purchases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate procedural unconscionability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiffs' only argument for substantive unconscionability is the \"harsh and one-sided result...that Ford's customers ended up paying for repairs that should have been paid for by Ford.\" Plaintiffs cite no cases to support this theory, however. And as Ford points out, the argument is circular: Ford only \"should have paid\" for the repairs if the limitations period was substantively unconscionable, because the repairs were not needed until after expiration of the warranty period in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Substantive unconscionability has not been demonstrated either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Because Plaintiffs Caron, Brown, and Kubber cannot demonstrate either procedural or substantive unconscionability, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Ford's request to dismiss their express warranty claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Implied Warranty and Lack of Privity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Ford argues that, except for Plaintiffs Brown, Caron, and Kinnunen (New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Michigan), all implied warranty claims must be dismissed for failure to allege vertical privity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Plaintiffs generally allege that Ford dealers acted as agents of Ford and thus privity obtains via the agency. Ford claims these pleadings are not supported by factual allegations. The allegations that Ford issued a TSB instructing dealers how to repair the defect, that Ford's warranty directs vehicle owners to present their vehicles to dealers for repairs, and that Ford requires dealers to submit detailed data regarding repairs support a plausible inference that the dealers acted as Ford's agents. The scope of that agency relationship (and hence privity) is a question of fact.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re MyFord Touch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889913\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/46/936/#p960\">\n    46 F.Supp.3d at 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"the scope of the agency is a factual one for the jury to resolve, especially as information about Ford's precise relationship with its dealers...is largely within Ford's possession, custody or control\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   At least at the pleading stage, Plaintiffs Abbitt and Abruscato have adequately alleged agency to support privity, so the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Ford's request to dismiss.

Plaintiff Jenkin does not allege where the vehicle was purchased. Accordingly, they have failed to allege privity under either an agency theory or a third-party beneficiary argument (because there is no agreement or relationship alleged between those private parties/used car dealers and Ford for which Plaintiffs could be third-party beneficiaries to begin with).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Ford's motion to dismiss Plaintiff Baranco, Furno, Farrell, and Jenkin's implied warranty claims with leave to amend to satisfy the privity requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff Kinnunen's Implied Warranty Claim and Statute of Limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Michigan law provides that \"[a]n action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within 4 years after the cause of action has accrued.\" Mich.
