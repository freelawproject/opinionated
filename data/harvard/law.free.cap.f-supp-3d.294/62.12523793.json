(\"Plaintiff\") commenced a breach of contract and guaranty action against Won Sam Yi and Sung Eun Yi (collectively, the \"Yi Defendants\"). (Dkt. 1). About two months later, on February 8, 2018, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint against the Yi Defendants, various business entities owned, operated, or managed by Won Sam Yi (\"Dr. Yi\")-Comprehensive Cancer Services Oncology, P.C., CCS Equipment LLC, CCS Billing, LLC, CCS Medical, PLLC, and WSEJ, LLC (collectively, the \"Defendants\")-as well as the United States of America (the \"Government\"). (Dkt. 15). On the same day, Plaintiff filed a motion seeking an order of seizure over certain assets in Defendants' possession that were subject to the parties' security agreement (hereinafter, the \"Collateral\"). (Dkt. 16). Plaintiff also seeks a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from dissipating, transferring, or otherwise disposing of the Collateral. Plaintiff claims that it is entitled to an order of seizure pursuant to the parties' security agreement because Defendants have defaulted on various loan obligations and have refused to voluntarily surrender the Collateral. (Dkt. 16-1 at 14-18). Plaintiff also claims that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction to prevent any further\n   interference by Defendants with Plaintiff's interest in the Collateral. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   There is no good outcome to the pending motions. Plaintiff seeks to recover the debt owed by Defendants, but in reality the requested seizure order and preliminary injunction will likely not fully compensate Plaintiff for its losses. Defendants provide benefits to the local and regional community as employers of medical professionals and as healthcare providers for apparently thousands of cancer patients. The relief requested by Plaintiff will likely result in a forced shutdown of Defendants' businesses. However, the financial debt owed by Defendants to Plaintiff and the federal and state taxing authorities is substantial, and it appears only to be growing. Defendants have had a number of opportunities over many months to prepare and develop a firm plan for addressing their accumulating debt. Defendants are unable to demonstrate that their present circumstances will materially change if the Court declines to grant the relief requested at this time. Accordingly, to prevent any further depreciation of Plaintiff's contractual rights, the Court grants Plaintiff's application for an order of seizure and a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff submits several affidavits and a number exhibits in support of its requested relief. (Dkt. 16). Defendants constitute various business entities owned, operated, or managed by Dr. Yi. (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7). Defendants operate as an oncology practice for the treatment and care of cancer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 21, 2016, Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a loan agreement in which Plaintiff opened four separate credit lines to Defendants that, in total, amounted to $16.2 million (the \"Loan Agreement\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). These loans were secured by a security agreement (the \"Security Agreement\"), which granted Plaintiff \"a first priority blanket security interest upon all assets of [Defendants],\" including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (a) All accounts, and all chattel paper, instruments, deposit accounts, letter of credit rights, and general intangibles related thereto; and all returned or repossessed goods which, on sale or lease, resulted in an account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (b) All inventory;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (c) All equipment and fixtures now owned or hereafter acquired by [Defendants] ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (d) All of [Defendant]'s deposit accounts with [Plaintiff]. The Collateral shall include any renewals or rollovers of the deposit accounts, any successor accounts, and any general intangibles and choses in action arising therefrom or related thereto;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (e) All instruments, chattel paper, documents, certificates of deposit, securities and investment property of every type;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (f) All general intangibles. The Collateral shall include all good will connected with or symbolized by any of such general intangibles;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (g) All negotiable and nonnegotiable documents of title covering any Collateral;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (h) All accessions, attachments and other additions to the Collateral, and all tools, parts and equipment used in connection with the Collateral;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (i) All substitutes or replacements for any Collateral, all case or non-case proceeds (including insurances proceeds), products, rents and profits of the Collateral, and all income benefits and property receivable on account of the Collateral, and all supporting obligations covering any Collateral; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (j) All books, data and records pertaining to any Collateral, whether in the form of a writing, photograph, microfilm or electronic media, including but not limited to any computer-readable memory and any computer software necessary to process such memory (\"Books and Records\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-5 at 2 (Security Agreement) ). On January 22, 2016, Plaintiff filed a Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statement with the New York Department of State, perfecting its security interest. (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Parties also executed a \"Master Lease Agreement, a Progress Payment Agreement, a Priority Payment Agreement, a certain Schedule No. 1 and an Acceptance Notice\" (the \"Lease Documents\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Pursuant to the Lease Documents, Dr. Yi agreed, among other things, \"to pay to [Plaintiff] certain Distributions ... upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Lease Documents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-24 at \u00b6 10 (Affidavit of Todd C. Wittenberg); Dkt. 16-25 at 4-5, 11-12, 14 (Lease Documents) ). On or about May 4, 2017, Dr. Yi also executed a \"Limited Guaranty\" as security for the payment of all of Defendants' \"then or thereafter-existing debts, obligations, and liabilities to [Plaintiff] under\" certain loan documents and \"the Lease Documents.\" (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 15). The Limited Guaranty secured the payment of Defendants' obligations up to $300,000, plus other fees, costs, and interest accruals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In connection with the Limited Guaranty, on May 12, 2017, Plaintiff agreed \"to forebear from enforcing its rights resulting from the occurrence of certain events of default by [Defendants] through the earlier of December 29, 2017, or the occurrence of any further events of default...\" (the \"Initial Forbearance Agreement\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Then, on June 11, 2017,\n   <em>\n    The Buffalo News\n   </em>\n   published an article that reported a \"pending federal investigation into [Defendants'] billing practices[,] ... including possible fraudulent activities,\" and that a whistleblower lawsuit had been filed in the Western District of New York, which alleged that Defendants had committed fraudulent activities that cost the federal and state governments ten to fifteen million dollars. (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 8). The article also quoted Dr. Yi, who confirmed the existence of the federal investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff subsequently learned that Defendants were encumbered with various federal tax liabilities, Defendants had \"stopped paying their real estate lease payments ... on all but one of their properties,\" and that for a thirteen-week period, Defendants had operated \"at a negative cash flow of $2,415,455[,] ... and thus [were] unable to pay their ordinary debts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On or about October 10, 2017, the parties amended the Initial Forbearance Agreement and increased the amount of Defendants' obligations secured under the Limited Guaranty to $2,300,000 (the \"Amended Forbearance Agreement\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20). In addition, the Yi Defendants\n   agreed to pay certain New York State tax refunds to Plaintiff to \"pay down the outstanding Obligations,\" and to send Plaintiff two \"make-up\" payments for expending certain federal tax refunds they had previously agreed to apply to their contractual obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23 (indicating that the Yi Defendants assigned there \"rights, title and interests in the State Tax Refunds to [Plaintiff]\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Later that month, the Government recorded federal tax liens assessing unpaid federal tax balances against Defendants, and various other tax obligations and penalty costs became due as against Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25). In addition, on November 1, 2017, Defendants failed to make principal and interest payments to Plaintiff as required by the Amended Forbearance Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff then sent a notice to Defendants on November 8, 2017 (the \"Notice\"), stating that Defendants' failure to satisfy their tax obligations and adhere to their contractual payment schedule each constituted an \"Event of Termination\" under the Amended Forbearance Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-12 (Notice) ). As a result, Plaintiff also increased the amount Dr. Yi owed under the Limited Guaranty to $3,330,000. (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 27). In addition, the Notice further explained that each of the Events of Termination constituted an \"Event of Default\" under the Master Lease Agreement, and that the imposition of federal tax liens as well as Defendants' failure to pay their contractual obligations constituted additional Events of Default under the Loan Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-12 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 22, 2017, Plaintiff sent a demand letter to Defendants notifying them that it had elected to accelerate and declare due the outstanding balance on the first line of credit as a result of the various Events of Termination noted above (the \"Demand Letter\"). (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 29;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-13 (Demand Letter) ). Plaintiff further demanded that the entire $3.3 million under the Limited Guaranty, the second \"make-up\" payment for Defendants' failure to surrender the federal tax refund-in the amount of $537,000-and any state tax refunds in their possession be delivered by November 30, 2017. (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-13 at 4-5 (Demand Letter) ). Defendants then failed to make any principal or interest payments that were due on December 1, 2017. (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 33). On December 1, 2017, Plaintiff increased the amount Dr. Yi owed under the Limited Guaranty to $4.3 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 21, 2017, Plaintiff sent Defendants an acceleration notice that-based upon the occurrence of the previously described events-declared the Master Lease Agreement and the related Lease Documents to be terminated, demanded Defendants to \"cease the use of\" the Collateral, and declared the entire outstanding balance of Defendants' obligations due and payable by January 2, 2018 (the \"Acceleration Notice\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-15 at 3 (Acceleration Notice) ). In addition, Plaintiff demanded the return of \"all of the Collateral by January 3, 2018.\" (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff then chose to take no further action against Defendants to enforce its rights in order \"to permit additional time for due diligence to be completed by a potential/investor/purchaser\" of Defendants' assets, and to allow Defendants time to secure an alternative source of financing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38). However, Plaintiff received a letter from the prospective purchaser, dated December 26, 2017 (the \"Purchaser Letter\"), which \"confirmed that [Defendants'] operations [were] beset with numerous operational difficulties and poor accounting controls.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-22; Dkt. 27 at 6-12 (Purchaser\n   Letter) ). Then, on January 25, 2018, the prospective purchaser emailed Plaintiff, indicating that it was no longer interested in purchasing Defendants' assets. (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 39). Furthermore, on January 30, 2018, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance sought to enforce a $198,680.06 state tax levy against Comprehensive Cancer Services Oncology, P.C. (\n   <em>\n    Id.; see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-16 (State Tax Levy) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 5, 2018, Plaintiff sent a final notice to Defendants, indicating that it would pursue civil litigation in light of the state tax levy, the federal tax liens, the previously noticed defaults and Events of Termination, Defendants' failure to secure alternative financing, and Defendants' continued possession and use of the Collateral (the \"Final Notice\"). (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 41;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-17 at 2-3 (Final Notice) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 8, 2017, Plaintiff commenced this action against the Yi Defendants. (Dkt. 1). At that time, Plaintiff purposefully did not name the associated business entities in order to permit them time \"to pursue either a sale or refinancing.\" (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 47). However, when Plaintiff determined that this would not occur-likely around the time it sent Defendants the Final Notice-Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on February 8, 2018, which named the Yi Defendants, Defendants, and the Government. (Dkt. 15). On the same day, Plaintiffs filed the pending motion that is the subject of this Decision and Order. (Dkt. 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On February 13, 2018, the Court held a motion hearing at which time the parties signed and executed a Consent Order. (Dkt. 22; Dkt. 23). Pursuant to the Consent Order, Plaintiff was granted leave to file the Amended Complaint on consent. (Dkt. 23 at \u00b6 1). In addition, Defendants were temporarily restrained from \"selling, transferring, pledging, assigning, encumbering, or otherwise disposing of the Collateral,\" or removing it from its current location, \"to the extent that any such actions [were] outside of the ordinary course of [Defendants'] business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2). Defendants further agreed to \"produce such officers or employees with actual knowledge regarding the Collateral as may be necessary, to give deposition testimony... and [to] produce information to [Plaintiff] regarding the Collateral. ...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On March 2, 2018, Defendants filed their response in opposition to Plaintiff's application. (Dkt. 37; Dkt. 38; Dkt. 39; Dkt. 40). On the same day, the Government filed its response papers to Plaintiff's application, indicating that it did not oppose Plaintiff's request for relief \"provided that Plaintiff may not alienate [the Government's] interests prior to a judicial determination (or agreement between [the Government] and Plaintiff[ ] ), as to the priority rights and distribution of the assets/Collateral between Plaintiff and [the Government].\" (Dkt. 41 at 3). On March 5, 2018, Plaintiff took the deposition testimony of Dr. Yi and David A. Bonk (\"Bonk\"), Defendants' Chief Financial Officer. (Dkt. 42-8; Dkt. 42-9). On March 9, 2018, Plaintiff filed its reply papers. (Dkt. 42). Oral argument was held before the undersigned on March 14, 2018, at which time the Court reserved decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Application for an Order of Seizure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-5 at \u00b6 1). Defendants agreed that Plaintiff could file a financial statement to perfect its interest in the Collateral (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3), and Nanette C. Franco, one of Plaintiff's Senior Vice Presidents (\"Franco\"), has averred that Plaintiff has done so (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 11). In the event of a default, as that term is described in the Security Agreement, Plaintiff was granted a number of remedies, including the repossession and sale of the Collateral. (Dkt. 16-5 at \u00b6 6). Such a default would occur if Defendants failed to comply with their obligations in the Security Agreement or \"any other contract or instrument\" evidencing indebtedness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Franco's affidavit not only establishes the existence of the various transactional agreements that underscore this action, but it also demonstrates the occurrence of Defendants' numerous defaults on their obligations. Plaintiff describes these defaults, which include Defendants' failure to comply with their tax obligations, and the subsequent imposition of government tax liens and levies against Defendants, as \"Events of Termination\" under certain loan documents, the Lease Documents, and the Amended Forbearance Agreement. (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 28, 40;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-12 at 3-4). Franco also averred that Defendants' failure to make timely principal and interest payments to Plaintiff amounted to further defaults by Defendants on their obligations to Plaintiff. (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 33-36;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-15 at 3-4). As a result of these cumulative failures, which took place over the period of several months, Plaintiff commenced the instant litigation. (Dkt. 16-2 at \u00b6 41). Furthermore, Dr. Yi's and Bonk's deposition testimony confirm that Defendants failed to pay their tax liabilities or the money owed to Plaintiff, and remain unable to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Dkt. 42-8 at 9-10, 15-16, 19; Dkt. 42-9 at 10-11, 28). Indeed, Defendants are not even able to stay current with their ordinary debts, such as lease payments, utility bills, and vendor commitments. (Dkt. 42-8 at 31-32, 34; Dkt. 42-9 at 3-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The evidence indisputably demonstrates that Defendants have defaulted upon their obligations to Plaintiff.

Plaintiff has estimated the value of the accounts receivable, as of October 31, 2017, at $8,104,754.59. (\n   <em>\n    Id.; see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-23; Dkt. 27). In addition, Todd C. Wittenberg (\"Wittenberg\"), a Senior Vice President for Plaintiff, has also submitted an affidavit, which specifically identifies the equipment collateral and its locations. (Dkt. 16-24 at \u00b6 19). Wittenberg provides the addresses at which this equipment can be located, and has estimated its aggravated value at $3,445,000.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20).

Accordingly, the Court finds that Franco's and Wittenberg's averments establish almost all of the requirements of CPLR 7102 by setting forth the existence, value, location, and possession of the Collateral.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barlow Lane Holdings Ltd.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201792456\">\n    2004 WL 1792456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (finding that the affidavit \"sufficiently identified\" who possessed the graphite and \"its value and location,\" and indicated that \"an action ha[d] been commenced in this\n   court for breach of contract and that [the] plaintiff [sic] has no defense to the action.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As Defendants point out (Dkt. 40 at 4-5), and as Plaintiff acknowledges (Dkt. 42 at 12-13), an undertaking pursuant to CPLR 7102(e) has not yet been posted in relation to the Collateral. Defendants argue that a bond of $23,099,873 must be posted, which is twice the value of the Collateral as calculated by Plaintiff. (Dkt. 40 at 4-5). In its reply papers, Plaintiff argues that the Court should impose a lesser undertaking requirement than the amount suggested by Defendants because \"there is no certainty that those values will be realized by [Plaintiff]\"-due to Defendants' growing tax liabilities-and given Plaintiff's \"financial strength.\" (Dkt. 42 at 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \" CPLR \u00a7 7102(e) requires that an undertaking be posted for an amount 'not less than twice the value of the chattel stated in the plaintiff's affidavit, for the return of the chattel to any person to whom possession is awarded by the judgment, and for payment of any sum awarded by the judgment against the person giving the undertaking.' \"\n   <em>\n    Amplicon, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20688430\">\n    1999 WL 688430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

(Dkt. 40 at 4-5). The Court notes that Defendants have submitted several affidavits in response to Plaintiff's motion. (Dkt. 37; Dkt. 38; Dkt. 39). None of these affidavits raises a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   defense to Plaintiff's entitlement to seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Dr. Yi's affidavit describes various precursor events leading up to the filing of the present application, including Defendants' attempts to reduce the balance owed to the Government and Plaintiff. (Dkt. 37). Dr. Yi's affidavit warrants some additional discussion because he requests that any order of seizure and injunctive relief be \"denied until at least June 30, 2018,\" while Defendants are pursuing financial alternatives. (Dkt. 37 at 5-6). At the motion hearing, Defendants implored the Court to defer issuance of an order of seizure and a preliminary injunction until June of this year to provide additional time for a \"monetization event.\" However, Defendants could not offer the Court any concrete assurances that their financial circumstances would materially change between now and then. Indeed, when pressed on the issue, Defendants' counsel retreated from his initial request to defer any relief until June, inquiring whether the Court would be inclined to at least defer relief until April. Although the Court can appreciate Defendants' desire for more time, it is evident that Defendants' request is supported merely by the hope that their fortunes will change, with no plan to effectuate such action. This conclusion is further supported by Bonk's deposition testimony, which confirms that Defendants have not received any firm commitments for alternative financing.

(Dkt. 38 at 2-4). However, these averments have no bearing on the undisputed fact that\n   Defendants have defaulted multiple times on their obligations to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, Bonk submits an affidavit averring that despite a financially \"disastrous\" 2017 year, Defendants have planned to restructure their work force with the hope of achieving a projected $46 million in profit for 2018. (Dkt. 39). Bonk's averments also fail to raise any\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   defense.

The Court will issue an order of seizure upon Plaintiff's filing of the $23,099,873 undertaking. Furthermore, Defendants, their officers, agents, servants, employees and any other persons acting in concert with or in participation with any of them, are hereby enjoined from transferring, selling, concealing,\n   pledging or otherwise disposing of, or substantially impairing the value of any and all of the Collateral outside the ordinary court of Defendants' operations. Plaintiff is directed to file a proposed order of seizure for the Court's approval within seven (7) days of this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The following facts are taken from the Affidavit of Nanette C. Franco, one of Plaintiff's Senior Vice Presidents. (Dkt. 16-2). Defendants dispute any suggestion that they are in dire financial peril or are fraudulently or otherwise wrongfully ignoring their tax obligations, and the merits of the related whistleblower lawsuit. (Dkt. 37; Dkt. 38; Dkt. 39). However, Defendants do not provide an alternative version of the events leading up to the pending application for relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    CPLR 7102(c)(7), which applies when an order of seizure is requested without notice to the other party, is not applicable here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    At oral argument, Plaintiff's counsel confirmed that Plaintiff had received copies of the Collateral referred to as \"Books and Records\" in the Security Agreement. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 16-5 at 2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    This figure may be well in excess of the actual value of the Collateral, but it represents twice the value of the Collateral as set forth in Plaintiff's motion papers, consistent with the requirements of CPLR 7102(e).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
