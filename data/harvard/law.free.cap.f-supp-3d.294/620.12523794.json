On February 15, 2018, the Court was informed that the parties in the Verizon case have entered into a settlement agreement. Accordingly, this order will not address any issues relating to that case. The Court has set trial in the action against Level 3 to begin on April 23, 2018, with the trials in each of the other two cases to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This order addresses a number of motions filed in advance of the Level 3 trial, some of which are filed by, or directed at, Level 3 alone, and some of which are filed by, or directed at, Level 3 and other defendants. This order will first address\n   <em>\n    Sycamore's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment of Infringement by Performing the Accused Mappings Pursuant to the Accused Standards\n   </em>\n   , Dkt.

The Court DENIED the first three of those motions following argument at the motions hearing, with an explanation for the Court's ruling on each motion. The Court GRANTED the fourth motion in part and DENIED it in part. In this order, the Court will expand on the explanations given in open court for its rulings on each of those four motions.

Transmission protocols that are frequently used in local area networks (\"LANs\"), such as Gigabit Ethernet (\"GbE\") or Fibre Channel, are inefficient for transmitting data over long-haul communication networks that are designed to carry data at high speeds and over long distances. Long-haul networks, sometimes referred to as wide area networks (\"WANs\"), therefore typically use different transmission protocols from those used in local networks; for example, long-haul networks often rely on optical communication protocols such as Synchronous Optical Networking (\"SONET\"). When multiple protocols are used, it is often desirable that messages transferred from a LAN system to a WAN system be transferred without the loss or corruption of information, a process known as \"transparent transcoding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The '405 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A problem that engineers in the industry encountered during their efforts to devise transparent transcoding schemes was that differences in the bandwidth used by the LAN and WAN systems resulted in the inefficient use of the available WAN bandwidth. '405 patent, col. 1, line 52, through col. 2, line 11. The objective of the '405 patent was to create a transcoding protocol that would, for example, compress a GbE signal into fewer bits, thus enabling two GbE signals to be sent at once over a SONET link.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   col. 2, ll. 53-59. To achieve that objective, the inventors of the '405 patent devised a transcoding system in which, for example, an 80-bit information group from the GbE transmission is converted into a 65-bit information stream for transmission over the SONET link without the loss of any information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   col. 7, ll. 41-48;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Fig. 6.

Dkt. No. 104, at 2. The output of the encoding methods is called the \"encoded information stream.\" The parties agree that each \"information group\" is encoded into a single \"encoded information stream,\" and that the two correspond one-to-one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 419, at 1 (Defendants: \" 'Encoded information stream' refers only to the data corresponding to a single incoming 'information group.' \"); Dkt. No. 420, at 1 (Sycamore: \"The parties agree that each 'encoded information stream' corresponds to a single 'information group' and\n   <em>\n    vice versa\n   </em>\n   .\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Claim 1 recites a method in which the encoding occurs through one of two processes, depending on whether the information group includes control characters. Claim limitation 1(a). If the information group contains only data words and no control characters, the first process is used. The first step is to generate a \"data indicator.\" Claim limitation 1(b). The data indicator consists of one or more bits indicating whether the information group includes any control characters. Dkt. No. 104. The data indicator is combined with the data words, and both are included in the encoded information stream. The parties agree that the data indicator and the data words must be combined as part of the same encoded information stream. Dkt. No. 419, at 10 (Defendants: \"The limitations require that the recited claim components [i.e., the data indicator and data words]...be combined/included in one encoded information stream.\"); Dkt. No. 420, at 1 n.1 (Sycamore: \"Sycamore agrees the referenced fields are contained within the same 'encoded information stream.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   If the information group contains one or more control characters, the encoding method uses the second process, which consists of four steps. First, the control characters are encoded to form \"control codes.\" Claim limitation 1(c)(i). Second, a transition indicator is generated based on the number of control codes that are present in the information group. Claim limitation 1(c)(ii). A \"transition indicator,\" which consists of one or more bits, indicates the occurrence of the last control code in the encoded information stream. Dkt. No. 110. Third, a location pointer is generated for each control code; the location pointer indicates the sequential position of the corresponding control character within the information group. Claim limitation 1(c)(iii). Finally, the control codes, data words, location pointers, and transition indicator are all combined to form the encoded information stream. Claim limitation 1(c)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Claim 8, the only other independent claim asserted in this action, teaches a nearly identical method for encoding a multi-word information group. If the information group does not include control characters, the data words and a data indicator are encoded into an encoded information stream. Claim limitation 8(a). If the information group includes control characters, then: (i) the control characters are encoded into control codes; (ii) a transition indicator is generated; (iii) a location pointer is generated; and (iv) the control codes, the transition indicator, the location pointers, and any data words are combined into an encoded information stream. Claim limitation 8(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Accused Mapping Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Sycamore accuses the defendants' networks of infringing the '405 patent to the extent that they use one of four transcoding\n   methods, or \"mappings,\" for which the Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunications Union (\"ITU-T\") has issued standards. Sycamore's theory of infringement is that those standardized transcoding methods are covered by the claims of the '405 patent and that the defendants' use of those standardized methods in their communication systems infringes the patent. For ease of reference, the Court adopts the defendants' nomenclature of referring to the four accused mappings as Mappings A through D.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 193.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Mapping A\n   </em>\n   : In 2005, the ITU-T released a standard for what it called the Transparent Generic Framing Procedure (\"GFP-T\") in a document entitled ITU-T Recommendation G.7041/Y.1303.

Claim Construction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following summary judgment briefing, the Court identified several infringement disputes that the Court considered to be predicated on disagreements regarding claim construction. The Court therefore directed the parties to file briefs on the newly identified claim construction issues. Dkt. No. 389. The parties filed briefs addressing those issues, Dkt. Nos. 418-421, and the Court heard oral argument on those issues at the January 19, 2018, motions hearing. The Court will address two of those issues here: the meaning of the term \"encoded information stream,\" and the meaning of the term \"control characters\" in the phrases \"encoding the control characters,\" claim limitation 1(c)(1), and \"encoding control characters,\" claim limitation 8(b). The Court does not address the \"data words\" claim construction issue raised only by CenturyLink.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 419, at 20-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Encoded Information Stream\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   With respect to the term \"encoded information stream,\" the parties disagree about two interrelated issues: (1) whether an encoded information stream must be a continuous series of bits, such that when a data indicator is \"combin[ed]\" with the data words the data indicator bits and the data words are physically contiguous; and (2) whether the bits in an encoded information stream may be logically connected but physically separate in the outgoing data signal, such that the data indicator bits may be separated from the data words by bits from other, unrelated encoded information streams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sycamore argues (1) that the '405 patent requires only that there be a \"logical relationship\" between the bits in an encoded information stream, and (2) that the word \"combining\" does not require physical contiguity. Sycamore notes that the specification permits the user to \"arrange the fields...as desired,\" so long as the fields are sent in \"prearranged sequential locations in the encoded information stream.\" '405 patent, col. 6, ll. 12-19. Sycamore also emphasizes a sentence in the specification that reads: \"It is not necessary to have these fields [i.e., the control codes, the data words, and the transition indicator] be physically contiguous within the encoded information stream as long as the fields can be found according to predetermined logic.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   col. 6, ll. 20-22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   col. 4, ll. 56-60 (\"It is understood that the data indicator field...and the data fields...may be arranged in many other predetermined orders within the encoded information stream.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   col. 5, ll. 65-67 (\"Again it should be appreciated that the first and second fields 414 and 418 and the sub-fields 418\n   <sub>\n    z\n   </sub>\n   may be arranged in other predetermined orders.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   col. 8, ll. 18-21 (\"These fields can be arranged in any of a variety of different orders, as desired by the user, within the constraints as described above.\"). From these descriptions in the specification, Sycamore concludes that the bits of an encoded information stream need not be contiguous in the outgoing signal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Sycamore's position, however, begs the question. The quoted excerpts from the specification make clear that the various fields may be rearranged within the encoded information stream in any predetermined order, so long as those fields all appear within the same encoded information stream. Thus, it does not matter whether the control codes are transmitted first or last, or whether a control code is physically contiguous to its corresponding location pointer, so long as their positioning within the encoded information stream is predetermined. That much is beyond dispute. But that does not answer the question whether the encoded information stream itself consists of a continuous series of bits. That is, the specification does not unambiguously answer the question whether all of the bits belonging to a particular encoded information stream need to be physically contiguous, or whether the bits belonging to each encoded information stream can be intermingled with bits belonging to other information streams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While the specification is not explicit as to that issue, both intrinsic and extrinsic evidence supports the construction that an encoded information stream consists of a continuous series of bits. Both of the examples of encoded information streams depicted in the specification, Figures 3(a) and 3(b), depict a single block of contiguous bits. Figure 6, which \"illustrates one example of the configurations for the encoded information stream 400 that may be generated according to the present encoding algorithm,\" '405 patent, col. 7, ll. 43-46, labels the bits in a 64B/65B encoded information stream sequentially, from bit 1 to bit 65.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   col. 7, line 41, through col. 8, line 21 (describing a preferred embodiment of the encoding method in a sequential, bit-by-bit process).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although the defendants concede that the specification does not expressly define the term \"encoded information stream\" to\n   be limited to a continuous series of bits, they argue persuasively that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the term \"stream\" to impose a requirement of contiguity. For example, although dictionary definitions of the term \"stream,\" including those cited by the defendants, are not identical, nor all equally relevant, they are consistent in suggesting that the term \"stream,\" as of the date of the '405 patent application, was understood to refer to a continuous or sequential series of bits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Alan Freedman,\n   <em>\n    The Computer Desktop Encyclopedia\n   </em>\n   (2d. ed. 1999) (Stream: \"A contiguous group of data.\" Streaming data: \"Data that is structured and processed in a continuous flow, such as digital audio and video.\");\n   <em>\n    IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms\n   </em>\n   (6th ed. 1997) (Stream: \"An ordered sequence of characters, as described by the C Standard.\");\n   <em>\n    McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms\n   </em>\n   (Sybil P.

Indeed, even Sycamore's expert, Dr. Scott Nettles, appears to have agreed with the thrust of those definitions when he testified in his deposition that \"stream is a term of art and streams are sequences of things of indefinite extent.\" Dkt.

No. 420, at 4. For example, Dr. Nettles explained that a person of ordinary skill in the art would know that the outgoing signal would be multiplexed for transmission and de-multiplexed at the receiver. Dkt. No. 418-3 \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. That may be so.

That interpretation of the term \"combine\" is not supported by the '405 patent or any of the extrinsic evidence cited by Sycamore. If, however, \"encoded information stream\" means a contiguous set of bits such that the various fields are put together in a continuous stream, the term \"combine\" can assume its natural and ordinary meaning.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   (2002) (Combine: \"[T]o bring into close relationship.\").

Dkt. No. 418, at 11; Dkt. No. 419, at 18. The parties' agreed-upon construction of \"control codes\" as \"encoded control characters,\" Dkt. No. 104, at 2, indicates that each control character must be encoded in some fashion. Furthermore, the specification provides that the encoding of the information stream results in a reduction in \"the necessary bandwidth for transporting the information,\" '405 patent, col. 2, ll. 36-37, and that \"[t]he control codes have fewer bits than the control characters contained in the information group,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C952%2C405\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   col. 4, ll. 24-25. Therefore, it is clear that each control character must be converted in some way that results in a reduction in the number of bits. Accordingly, the Court construes \"encoding control characters\" to mean \"converting at least a portion of each present control character into a form that comprises fewer bits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, the parties dispute whether \"control characters\" consist exclusively of\n   bits that represent system control information, or whether \"control characters\" can contain non-control information, including data information or block-type information. Although the parties previously agreed that \"control characters\" should be construed to mean \"bits in an information group representing control information,\" Dkt. No. 104, at 2, Sycamore now argues for a construction that permits control characters to \"include information relating to non-control information, so long as when considered in their entirety, they represent control information,\" Dkt. No. 418, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The defendants contend that the patent draws a clear distinction between \"control characters\" and \"data,\" such that \"control characters\" must include only bits representing control information and may not include data. Dkt. No. 419, at 14-16.

The '405 patent designates certain bits as \"control characters\" based on the designation assigned by the LAN line encoding scheme. That is to say, the patented scheme relies on the input signal protocol to define the distinction between data words and control characters. The encoding protocol simply reduces the number of bits in each control character so as to transport the communication more efficiently over an optical network. As Sycamore's expert explained, in the 8B/10B encoding specification \"there are clear definitions as to what the control and what the data is\" and \"the definition of 8b/10b says these are the control and these are the data.\" Dkt.

Dkt. No. 159-1, at A-6 through A-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Under the Court's claim constructions, Sycamore has not presented evidence that the G.7041 mapping standard necessarily satisfies either claim limitation 1(b) or claim limitation 8(a) of the '405 patent. Claim limitation 1(b) requires that the data indicator and data words be combined to generate an encoded information stream that includes the data indicator and data words. Similarly, claim limitation 8(a) requires that the data words be encoded with a data indicator to generate an encoded information stream. The G.7041 standard does neither. Although the G.7041 standard generates a flag bit for each 64-bit information group, the data words and the corresponding flag bit are not combined, but are transmitted separately. The superblock structure transmits the data words and control characters first, followed by an octet of eight flag bits. Because the eight separate information groups-i.e., eight separate encoded information streams-are transmitted first, and the data indicators for all eight are combined and transmitted later, the data indicator is never put into a contiguous stream of encoded information with the data words. For that reason, the transmission of the superblocks under the G.7041 standard does not infringe the '405 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In its opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment of non-infringement, Sycamore made an alternative argument in favor of infringement. It argued that superblock encoding is a two-part process, and that \"the data indicator and data words are first combined before the data indicator is separated into a trailing octet.\" Dkt. No. 245, at 7. As support for that proposition, Sycamore cited two White Papers on the G.7041 and G.709 standards prepared by Dr. Steve Gorshe, an engineer with PMC-Sierra and one of the principal architects of the standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 245-12 and 245-13. Summarizing the mapping method for Gigabit Ethernet onto OPU0 in the 2011 White Paper, Dr. Gorshe described the implementation of the G.709 standard as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"Adapt the incoming GE signal into GFP-T:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 Transcode the incoming GE 8B/10B characters into 64B/65B code blocks,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 Group eight 64B/65B blocks into a 67 byte superblock, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 Map one superblock into a GFP frame, with no 65B_PAD or GFP Idles.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Dkt. No. 245-13, at 41. Sycamore also cites the 2005 White Paper by Dr. Gorshe, Dkt. No. 245-12, which addressed the G.7041 standard. The cited portions of that White Paper describe the GFP-T mapping protocol\n   and the way data and control characters are mapped into a 64B/65B code. It describes the process of mapping an incoming information stream to form a 64B/65B code, after which eight 64B/65B codes are combined into a superblock in which the \"payload data bytes of the eight constituent 64B/65B codes are placed into the superblock in transmission order, with the eight leading (flag) bits of these codes grouped together in a trailing byte.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In their reply brief, the defendants did not respond to Sycamore's argument based on the White Papers. Because little attention had been devoted to the White Papers in the parties' briefs, the Court requested additional briefing on the relevance and admissibility of the White Papers. Dkt. No. 494. The defendants responded that the White Papers are inadmissible as hearsay and do not create a fact issue regarding infringement. Dkt. No. 512. Sycamore responded that the White Papers are admissible and that they raise a factual issue as to infringement. Dkt. No. 514. Sycamore also pointed to certain technical documents generated by manufacturers of the equipment that use the accused mappings. That evidence had not previously been submitted as part of the summary judgment record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For purposes of the summary judgment motions, the Court will assume the White Papers are both admissible. The question before the Court on Sycamore's alternative theory of infringement is whether Sycamore's evidence, consisting primarily of the G.7041 standard and the two White Papers, is sufficient to create a factual issue as to whether the standards require the formation of an infringing block of continuous bits before the data indicator is separated from the data to which it pertains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Sycamore argues that the G.7041 standard establishes that the decoded 8B/10B characters are mapped into a 64B/65B block, as shown in Figure 8-2 of the standard, before the 64B/65B blocks are grouped into a superblock, as shown in Figure 8-3 of the standard. Dkt. No. 185-2, at 30, 32. The block shown in Figure 8-2, Sycamore argues, is a physical, contiguous block of bits. That characterization, according to Sycamore, is consistent with the statement in the 2011 White Paper referring to \"[t]ranscod[ing] the incoming GE 8B/10B characters into 64B/65B code blocks.\" Dkt. No. 509-2, at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The problem with Sycamore's theory is that neither the G.7041 standard nor the White Papers establishes that the 64B/65B block consists of physically contiguous bits, as opposed to bits that are logically related but not necessarily continuous within the communication signal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both the standard and the White Papers refer to the 64B/65B blocks as \"codes\" or \"code blocks,\" Dkt. No. 509-1, at 15-16; Dkt. No. 509-2, at 41, and the standard refers to the 64B/65B code being \"formed,\" Dkt. No. 418-4, at 32, but none of those references states that the standard requires that a physical \"block\" of contiguous bits ever be generated in order to satisfy the '405 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For example, the 2005 White Paper articulates, in granular detail, the \"process of going from the 64B/65B code to a GFP frame,\" which is illustrated in Figure 6 of that document. Dkt. No. 245-12, at 16. Figure 6 shows the construction of the GFP-T frame in four steps: first, it shows a 65-bit block of contiguous bits containing the leading bit and the 64 bits of payload information; second it shows a 520-bit block consisting of eight 65-bit blocks, in which each leading bit is physically contiguous with its respective 64 bits of payload information; third, the eight leading bits are repositioned into a trailing byte to form the superblock structure; and finally, four superblocks are fit into a GFP-T frame.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Dkt. No. 245-12, at 17. If this four-step process of encoding were necessary for implementing the G.7041 standard, the first and second steps would satisfy the contested claim limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   However, the standard itself suggests that this four-step process need not occur. The standard states that \"[t]o minimize latency, the transparent GFP mapper can begin transmitting data as soon as the first 64B/65B code in the group has been formed rather than waiting for the entire superblock to be formed.\" Dkt. No. 185-2, at 32. Because information can begin to be transmitted immediately after the first block of information is received, the standard does not require the actual physical generation of the second step of the White Paper's four-step implementation. Given that the 2005 White Paper is intended to \"provide an overview of GFP for a reader who is unfamiliar with this technology,\" Dkt. No. 245-12, at 5, the Court cannot infer that the White Paper describes the only possible implementation of the G.7041 mapping standard. It is therefore insufficient to satisfy Sycamore's burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The defendants elicited expert testimony from several witnesses that the 64B/65B block referred to in the G.7041 standard\n   does not have to consist of physically contiguous bits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 298-6, 91:22-92:10 (Sharma deposition: \"Q. In order to create an output 64b/65b block, is it necessary that those 65 bits be physically contiguous? A.

Thus, from an implementation stand point, one of skill in the art could place the data indicator directly into the first trailing octet without ever combining it with the data words in the encoded information stream as required by limitation 1(b).\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Sycamore offered no expert evidence to the contrary. In fact, Sycamore's expert, Dr. Nettles, gave testimony that was squarely at odds with Sycamore's alternative theory of infringement. He admitted that Figure 8-2 from the G.7041 standard does not \"depict what is actually generated and sent over a communications link,\" but instead \"is showing the logical relationships that go into the transform. The figure which is 8-3, which is the superblock, is closer to what is sent over the wire[.]\" Dkt. No. 427-4, at 152:14-21.

He added, \"[t]he output stream is generated with the logical relationships we see in 8-2...you don't have to preserve the physical relationships we see in 8-2 in the serialized output.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 159:4-23. He conceded that \"I don't necessarily have visibility into what the implementation of the framer does and what order they do things in,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 160:3-6, but he clarified that \"picture 8-2 tells us how to encode information groups. Figure 8-3 tells us more about how the serializer formats things,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 162:8-10. When asked, \"So it doesn't matter for purposes of infringement whether what is actually physically generated takes the form of what is shown in Figure 8-2, it just needs to employ the logical relationships depicted in Figure 8-2; is that correct?\" he answered, \"It has to have the pieces.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 166:15-21. Thus, Dr. Nettles conceded that, as the defendants' experts contended, the G.7041 standard does not require an implementation that generates the 65 bits of the 64B/65B block depicted in Figure 8-2 in a physically contiguous form. His testimony puts the kibosh on Sycamore's alternative infringement theory that the 64B/65B block of Figure 8-2 is generated before the creation of the superblock of Figure 8-3 and that each of the data-only blocks in the 64B/65B block is an encoded information stream of continuous bits that includes both the data indicator and data words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In response to the Court's request for the parties to brief the issue of the admissibility and relevance of the White Papers, and to provide any deposition testimony or expert reports in the case that discussed\n   the White Papers, Sycamore submitted specification sheets from four chip manufacturers. Sycamore contends that the chips made by those manufacturers generate an intermediate block of physically contiguous bits corresponding to one of the blocks displayed in Figure 8-2 of the G.7041 standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Those specification sheets, Dkt. Nos. 514-2 through 514-5, provide no significant support for Sycamore's infringement claims. To begin with, Sycamore's infringement contention was that the defendants practice the G.7041 standard and that practicing that standard would necessarily result in infringement of the '405 patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fujitsu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782268\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/1321/\">\n    620 F.3d at 1327-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even assuming that the specification sheets describe an infringing 65-bit block of continuous bits, the specification sheets do not prove that the G.7041 standard\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be implemented in a way that infringes Sycamore's patent, but only that it\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be. Second, at least two of the specifications-those from Nortel Networks and Ciena Corporation-contain language that largely tracks the G.7041 standard. Nothing in those specifications provides support for Sycamore's alternative theory of infringement. The other two specifications-from Applied Micro Circuits Corp. and Cortina Systems, Inc.-are ambiguous; without supporting testimony explaining the language used in those specifications, it is not clear whether the reference to \"blocks\" and \"codes\" are meant to refer to physical structures or merely logical constructs. And finally, Sycamore represented that it was not relying on those specifications to prove infringement, but was merely using them as support for the proposition that the G.7041 standard is consistent with Sycamore's alternative theory of infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that the evidence presented on summary judgment fails to show a genuine issue of material fact as to infringement by Accused Mappings A or B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Standards\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The 2012 revised version of the G.709 standard provided for mapping of faster LAN networks onto faster optical transport networks. Among other changes, the revised standard provided for mapping 10 Gigabit Fibre Channel signals onto ODU2e signals (Mapping C) and 40 Gigabit Ethernet signals onto ODU3 signals (Mapping D). The 2012 document was released as a new version of ITU-T Recommendation G.709/Y.1331. Except for one difference at the end of the encoding process, Mapping C and Mapping D are identical. Sycamore claims that both infringe the '405 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Mappings C and D are both methods to encode data and to send it more efficiently over a transport network. Rather than receive information in 8B/10B characters, as in the '405 patent and the G.7041 standard, Mappings C and D process input that is in the form of 64B/66B code blocks-i.e., 64 bits of content and two bits of overhead. Dkt. No. 185-4, at 164-65. According to the line encoding scheme, each 64B/66B block can be one of two types: a data block, which contains eight data bytes; or a control block, which can include a mixture of data and control information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The 64B/66B control blocks are more complex than the control words in the 8B/10B scheme. In the 8B/10B scheme, there are only 12 possible control words.

A flag continuation bit (\"FC\") indicates whether the particular control block is the final control block in the 512B/513B mapping group, or whether there are additional control blocks in the group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Figure B.4 shows the structure of the eight-bit \"control block header\":\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The control block header is combined with the remaining 56 bits of the control block to create a 64-bit row in the 512B/513B structure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Any control blocks are placed at the front of the 512B/513B structure, in the order in which they were received, followed by any data blocks, in the order received.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Figure B.3 depicts an example, containing five data blocks and three control blocks (the fifth, sixth, and seventh rows on the left side of the figure), of how eight incoming 64B/66B blocks are processed and rearranged into the 512B/513B structure:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The two mapping standards diverge at the final step. In Mapping C, each 512B/513B structure is grouped with seven other 512B/513B structures to form a \"516-octet superblock,\" and 17 such superblocks are grouped to form an 8800-octet GFP frame.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95. As in the G.7041 mapping standard, the physical structure of the superblock is significant for infringement analysis. Figure 17-18 of the 2012 version of the G.709 standard, set out below, illustrates the FC1200 GFP frame, with four bytes (32 bits) per row, and shows in detail the structure of a single superblock. The figure shows that a superblock has 512 bytes (4096 bits) of information and four trailing bytes (32 bits). Specifically, the eight one-bit flag bits are grouped together in a single octet at the end of the superblock (the \"Superblock flags\"), followed by 24 CRC error-check bits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95-96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Mapping D combines the 512B/513B structures in a different way. Rather than being combined into a superblock, two 512B/513B structures are combined to form a 1027B block.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92. Mapping D adds an additional leading bit, the \"flag parity bit\" to protect the 512B/513B structure's flag bit and signal the location of the code blocks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 191. The two 512B/513B structures are transmitted in the following order: the parity bit; the flag bit from the first 512B/513B structure; the flag bit from the second 512B/513B structure; the payload (i.e., the eight data and/or control blocks) from the first 512B/513B structure; and finally, the payload from the second 512B/513B structure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Figure F.1 from the 2012 standard illustrates this structure:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    2. Infringement of Claim Limitations 1(b) and 8(a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As with the first two accused mappings, Sycamore's theory of infringement is that the defendants practice Mappings C and D, and that those mapping standards necessarily infringe the asserted claims of the '405 patent. The defendants again respond that Sycamore's evidence fails to show that implementing the mapping standards necessarily satisfies limitations 1(b) and 8(a) of the '405 patent, and that Sycamore has therefore failed to prove that practicing the mapping standards constitutes proof of infringement. The Court again agrees with the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Sycamore contends that the \"information group\" in the 512B/513B mapping standards is the set of eight 64-bit blocks that are shown in Figure B.5. Dkt. No. 185, at 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 159-1, at C-1 (Sycamore's infringement contentions regarding Mapping C, dated September 12, 2016, which identify the \"multi-word information group\" as the eight 64-bit blocks shown in Figure B.5);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at D-1 (same, regarding Mapping D). As in the case of the G.7041 mapping standard, the \"data indicator\" of the '405 patent corresponds to the standard's \"Flag bit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at C-8, D-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As in the case of Mappings A and B, the defendants contend that the 512B/513B mapping standards do not infringe the '405 patent because the data words and the data indicator are not \"combin[ed]\" to \"generate an encoded information stream.\" For that reason, the defendants argue, the 512B/513B mapping standards do not satisfy claim limitations 1(b) or 8(a), which require that the data words and the data indicator be \"includ[ed]\" in a single encoded information stream. In Mapping C, as\n   in the G.7041 standard, the flag bits for each of the eight information groups in the superblock are placed in a trailing octet at the end of the superblock, separate from the corresponding data words. In Mapping D, the flag bits for the two information groups are grouped first and are transmitted immediately before the two information groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Applying the Court's claim constructions, limitations 1(b) and 8(a) both require that the data indicator and the data words be combined or included in the same encoded information stream. The encoded data is transmitted in a superblock in the case of Mapping C, and in a pair of blocks in the case of Mapping D. As a result, multiple flag bits are combined and transmitted together, and they are transmitted separately from their corresponding data words. Therefore, it is clear that the final encoded output of each mapping does not infringe the '405 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In its opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, Sycamore did not argue that Mappings C and D perform a two-step process, the alternative infringement argument that Sycamore made with respect to Mappings A and B.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 245, at 6-7 (in the context of its two-step theory, discussing only Figures 8-2 and 8-3 of the G.7041 standard and creating a 64B/65B code block). However, Sycamore raised that argument in its supplemental brief addressing Dr. Gorshe's White Papers. Dkt. No. 514, at 4. In his 2011 White Paper, Dr. Gorshe wrote that in Mapping C, the \"64B/66B line codes are first transcoded into 512B/513B block codes\" and then \"eight 513B blocks are grouped in a 16-block (64-octet) superblock.\" Dkt. No. 509-2, at 55. Similarly, Dr. Gorshe wrote that in Mapping D, \"[t]he 1024B/1027B block code is constructed as a concatenation of two 512B/513B block codes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In its supplemental brief, Sycamore also argued that the standard itself requires that an infringing contiguous 513-bit block be formed. Dkt. No. 514, at 4. For Mapping C, the 2012 G.709 standard is performed by \"transcoding a group of eight 66B blocks into one 513B block (as described in Annex B)\" and then \"assembling eight 513B blocks into one 516-octet superblock,\" wherein \"the leading flag bits from each of the eight 513B blocks are relocated into a single octet at the end of the 513-octet superblock data field.\" Dkt. No. 185-4, at 95-96. Similarly, Mapping D is described as creating a flag parity bit \"across two 513B blocks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 191.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As with Mappings A and B, however, Sycamore has not met its burden of showing that an infringing 513-bit block is generated. Sycamore offers no evidence or expert testimony that these 513-bit blocks must consist of contiguous bits, and the defendants offer expert testimony to suggest that implementing the standard would not require generating a continuous 513-bit block before further encoding the superblock or interleaved structure of Figure 17-18 or Figure F.1, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 185-10 \u00b6\u00b6 252-62;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 271 (Lanning Report: \"Indeed, although I have not been shown evidence of the internal implementation of the line cards, in my opinion it is more likely that the line cards would generate the superblock in the final format. This is my opinion because such rearrangement would be wasteful and would require additional time (thus potentially leading to communications latency), as well as additional computational resources (thus potentially leading to greater power consumption and additional circuitry).\"). Because Sycamore has failed to meet its burden to show that there is any evidence that Mappings C and D require the generation of a continuous series of 513 bits in order to perform a two-step encoding process, and because the final encoded outgoing\n   stream does not combine or include the transition indicator and the data words in a single encoded information stream, summary judgment for the defendants is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    3. Infringement of Claim Limitations 1(c)(i) and 8(b)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The defendants further contend that Mappings C and D do not satisfy claim limitations 1(c)(i) and 8(b) of the '405 patent, which recite encoding \"control characters to control codes.\" With respect to those limitations, the defendants assert that there are two flaws in Sycamore's infringement theory: First, they contend that the control blocks in the 64B/66B input information cannot constitute \"control characters\" because the blocks can contain data words in addition to control information. Second, they note that only the eight-bit \"block type\" field is encoded, while the remaining 56 bits of the control block are incorporated without change in the encoded information stream; for that reason, they contend, these mappings do not \"encode\" control characters. Dkt. No. 193, at 16-17; Dkt. No. 255, at 11-15. Neither argument is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Under the Court's construction, a \"control character\" is defined by the line encoding standard that the accused infringing device uses as input. According to Sycamore's infringement theory regarding Mappings C and D, each \"information group\" comprises eight 64B/66B blocks. Dkt. No. 185, at 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 159-1, at C-1. Under both standards, \"[e]ach 66B codeword...is one of the following: a set of eight data bytes with a sync header of '01'; or a control block...beginning with a sync header of '10'.\" Dkt. No. 185-4, at 164. Each control block can be one of 15 block types, and each control block can contain either exclusively control information or a mixture of control and data information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164, 166. The control block contains a leading byte that in turn contains a block type field.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 166, 168. When the mapping standard receives a 66B control block, it is \"encoded into a row of the [512B/513B] structure shown in Figure B.3\" by first removing the sync header \"10,\" then translating the 8-bit control block type field into a 4-bit code, and finally generating a flag continuation bit and a position indicator of three bits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   This encoding process satisfies the encoding \"control characters into control codes\" limitations of claims 1 and 8. The accused \"control character\" in these mappings is the control block, which is defined in the 64B/66B line encoding scheme as consisting of 64 payload bits and 2 bits of overhead.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (using the phrase \"66B control block\" 13 times on a single page when describing the encoding process for the accused mappings). The accused mappings reduce an eight-bit segment of each of the 66-bit control blocks into four bits. The accused mappings, like the '405 patent, rely on the line encoding standard to determine what constitutes a \"control block.\" Under the Court's construction of \"control character,\" the fact that the control block may contain data words does not preclude infringement. Moreover, the mapping standards are clear that the 8-bit block type field is part of the incoming 66B control block, and that the 8-bit type field is converted into a form that comprises fewer bits. Nothing more is required to satisfy the two disputed limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Remaining Issues Relating to Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In the course of the summary judgment briefing, Sycamore stated that it was not pursuing a theory of indirect infringement. Dkt. No. 245, at 1. That issue, which was raised in the defendants' motion for summary judgment, is therefore moot. Because\n   the Court grants the defendants' motion as to non-infringement, their argument about no willful infringement is also moot. With respect to Sycamore's motion for summary judgment on the scope of Level 3's infringement, Dkt. No. 191, the Court's disposition of the summary judgment motions regarding infringement of the accused mapping standards make it unnecessary to address the infringement contentions in that motion. That motion is therefore DENIED AS MOOT. For the same reason, Sycamore's infringement-related motions directed to AT &amp; T and CenturyLink are DENIED AS MOOT, specifically:\n   <em>\n    Sycamore's Motion for Summary Judgment on AT &amp; T's Infringement of the Sycamore Patent\n   </em>\n   , Dkt.

Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In the fall of 2000, Dr. Danny Tsang took a sabbatical from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and joined Sycamore Networks, a predecessor-in-interest to plaintiff Sycamore IP Holdings LLC. While at Sycamore Networks, Dr. Tsang worked with his manager, Dr. Murat Azizoglu, on an encoding scheme to transport Gigabit Ethernet signals over SONET systems. On December 5, 2000, Sycamore Networks filed U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/251,341 (the \"Provisional Application\"), which described Dr. Tsang's encoding scheme and named Dr. Tsang and Dr. Azizoglu as the inventors. Dkt. No. 179-4. The Provisional Application described methods of encoding Gigabit Ethernet signals for transmission over a SONET network by encoding the control codes and grouping multiple data words or control codes together for more efficient transmission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   From at least August 2000 until July 2001, Sycamore Networks was a member of the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Standards (\"ATIS\"), a standards-setting organization that is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (\"ANSI\"). ANSI accredited and ATIS sponsored the T1 Standards Committee, which included a working group called T1X1.5 that was working on protocols for encoding data over SONET. The T1X1.5 working group was ultimately responsible for developing a proposal for transparent encoding that became one of the foundations of the four accused mappings at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Dr. Tsang and Dr. Yang Cao, another employee of Sycamore Networks, were participants in the T1X1.5 working group. Dr. Tsang participated in the working group from approximately October 2000 to March 26, 2001. In the weeks after he submitted the Provisional Application, Dr. Tsang approached Dr. Gorshe of PMC-Sierra and Mike Scholten of Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (\"AMCC\") to propose presenting his transparent encoding scheme to the T1X1.5 working group. PMC-Sierra\n   and AMCC were both members of the T1X1.5 working group, and Dr. Gorshe was the technical editor of the group. Dr. Tsang informed Dr. Gorshe and Mr. Scholten that he had a patent application pending on his encoding scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   On December 8, 2000, Mr. Scholten wrote to Dr. Tsang via e-mail stating that he believed Dr. Tsang's proposal \"represents a simpler, more generic approach than the current T1X1 proposal\" and that \"AMCC would like to support and co-author this contribution with you.\" Dkt. No. 257-6, at MC000015-16. However, Mr. Scholten emphasized that \"we can't do that unless Sycamore publicly indicates they will not use their pending patent to charge royalties or restrict use of this scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at MC000016.

During a conference call on December 19, 2000, that included Dr. Tsang, Dr. Gorshe explained that the ANSI patent policy required that any patented technology that is included in the standard would have to be available royalty free or under reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Dkt. No. 257-6, at MC000006; Dkt. No. 257-17, at 78:13-79:22.

As of December 26, 2000, Dr. Gorshe devised a revision to Dr. Tsang's encoding scheme that rearranged some of the fields so that the output would be byte-aligned-that is, Dr. Gorshe's revision ensured that information fields would be self-contained within the same byte, rather than spanning across more than one byte. Dr. Gorshe's idea was included in the trio's December 29 submission to the working group. The encoding scheme, with Dr. Gorshe's revisions, was adopted by the working group and was made a part of the draft standard in January 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   On February 27, 2001, Sycamore Networks filed U.S. Patent Application No. 09/794,949 (\"the '949 application\" or \"the Non-Provisional Application\"). That application claimed priority to the December 5, 2000, Provisional Application. The '949 application issued as the '405 patent in October 2005. The specification of the Non-Provisional Application was significantly expanded from the Provisional Application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Meanwhile, in June 2001, the T1X1 subcommittee began working with the ITU-T Study Group to create a final version of the standard. The ITU-T Study Group integrated the T1X1 encoding scheme into the ITU-T's final adopted standard for GFP-T in the August 2005 ITU G.7041 recommendation. Dr. Gorshe was involved in the development of the standard for the ITU-T. Sycamore Networks was not a member of the ITU, and neither Sycamore Networks nor Dr. Tsang was listed in connection with the draft ITU-T recommendation or the June 2001 ITU-T meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    2. Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The defendants have moved for summary judgment of invalidity of the '405 patent under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 102(f). Their claim of invalidity focuses on the use of the term \"transition indicator\" in the '405 patent. Based on the language of the patent, the Court construed \"transition indicator\" to mean \"one or more bits that indicate the occurrence of a final control code in an encoded information stream.\" Dkt. No. 110, at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The defendants argue that the Provisional Application does not contain a written description of the claimed \"transition indicator\" and that, as a result, the '405 patent is not entitled to priority as of the December 5, 2000, filing date of the Provisional Application. Instead, the defendants contend that the \"transition indicator\" was invented only when Dr. Gorshe devised his byte-aligned revision to Dr. Tsang's encoding scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the defendants argue that the asserted claims of the '405 patent are invalid under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) because the patent fails to name Dr. Gorshe as one of the joint inventors.

Sycamore responds that the Provisional Application provides written description support for the transition indicator, and that Dr. Gorshe was not a co-inventor of the '405 patent because his revisions of Dr. Tsang's coding scheme merely rearranged elements\n   of Dr. Tsang's invention in a way that was not required by any limitation of the asserted claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The term \"transition indicator\" appears in three of the asserted claims.

The defendants point to the following text in the Provisional Application:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   However, if the rate optimizing encoder determines that control code words are present, the control location field is generated. The first part of the control location field includes a variable number of bits, each indicating the presence of a corresponding code word.

For example, if\n   three control code words are detected, the first part of the control location field is 1110 and if seven control code words are detected, the field is 11111110.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Provisional Application at 15 (emphasis added). The defendants point out that the Provisional Application's \"encoding scheme begins with a variable length field that is used to count control codes, and the '0' bit is used to end the counting. The scheme has no need for a bit that 'indicate[s] the occurrence of a final control code.' Instead, the rules of this scheme rely on beginning the encoded stream with a variable number of '1' bits that indicate how many control codes are present when counted.\" Dkt. No. 179, at 14. The defendants contend that the function described in the Provisional Application \"is indisputably different than the function of the claimed transition indicator.\" Dkt. No. 281, at 2. Specifically, the defendants argue that the \"0\" bit in the Provisional Application indicates \"stop counting\"-that is, the previous \"1\" bit indicates the occurrence of the last control code-whereas in the '405 patent, the \"0\" bit itself indicates the last control code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The defendants' argument distinguishing the Provisional Application's encoding scheme from the '405 patent is strained, as the encoding scheme described in the Provisional Application is identical to the one described in the specification of the '405 patent :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   The rate optimizing encoder 210 detects the control characters present in the information group and generates the information for storing in the first and second fields 414 and 418.\n   <em>\n    When at least one control code is detected, the first field 414 includes a variable number of bits 414\n   </em>\n   <sub>\n    1\n   </sub>\n   <em>\n    ,...414\n   </em>\n   <sub>\n    w\n   </sub>\n   <em>\n    including a transition indicator (preferably the last bit of the first field 414) for indicating that no more control characters are present in the information group\n   </em>\n   .

The Provisional Application makes clear that the first variable field of the \"data/control sequence field\" serves to \"indicate[ ] where the control code words are positioned in the data stream.\" Provisional Application at 12-13. That variable field is a \"set of bits for indicating which of the signal blocks contains a control code.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (\"The position of the data and encoded control code words corresponding to their positions indicated by the data/control sequence field.\").

The \"0\" bit at the end of the variable field is therefore necessary to determine which control code is the final one, thereby indicating the occurrence of the final control code in the stream. Although the language was revised,\n   the scope of the disclosure is the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In sum, the evidence before the Court does not support the defendants' argument that the Provisional Application lacks written description support for the '405 patent's \"transition indicator.\" For that reason, the evidence offered by the defendants fails to show that the '405 patent is not entitled to the Provisional Application's priority date. Accordingly, the defendants have failed to show that the '405 patent is anticipated by the December 29, 2000, submission to the T1X1.5 working group. For similar reasons, the Court concludes that the defendants have failed to show that Dr. Gorshe must be regarded as the inventor of the \"transition indicator.\" The patent has therefore not been shown to be invalid under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), for failure to name Dr. Gorshe as an inventor.

The defendants contend that the claims of the '405 patent fail to satisfy the eligibility requirement of section 101 because they are directed to an abstract idea and lack an inventive concept. Dkt.

Because the encoding procedure claimed in the '405 patent effectively reduces the bandwidth of certain communications without sacrificing the content of the communicated information, Sycamore argues that the invention solves a technical problem in the computer networking field in an inventive manner, rather than simply claiming an abstract idea as the patentable invention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amdocs (Israel) Ltd. v.

The patent, according to Sycamore, teaches a concrete technical solution that reduces the number of bits required to transmit a particular communication across those different protocols without losing any portion of the communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Moreover, even assuming the patent is regarded as being directed to an abstract idea, such as merely encoding and decoding data, Sycamore argues that the evidence before the Court shows that the patented method effects an improvement over the prior art and contains an inventive concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The defendants begin by arguing that claim 1 of the '405 patent does not expressly require compression, i.e., a reduction in the number of bits without loss of content, and that in light of dependent claim 4, which does require compression, claim 1 cannot be analyzed as if it were directed to an encoding scheme that results in compression of the transported message. The Court disagrees with the defendants' characterization of claim 1. In describing the invention, the specification of the '405 patent states that as a consequence of the claimed coding protocol, \"the necessary bandwidth for transporting the information is reduced after the encoding is completed without sacrificing any control information so that the information is transparently and efficiently transported over the communications link.\" '405 patent, col. 2, ll. 36-40;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/#p78\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/#p78\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   col. 6, ll. 50-53 (\"The coding scheme according to the embodiments of the present invention allows information to be transparently transported across the network at a reduced data rate....\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/#p78\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/#p78\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Abstract (\"[T]he necessary bandwidth for transporting the information is reduced by using this encoded information stream without sacrificing any control information.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The '405 patent is so clearly directed to a method for compression that it is difficult to interpret claim 1 as serving any function other than compression. That is so even though compression is not expressly required by claim 1 and even though dependent claim 4 adds the requirement of compression, which would normally call for application of the doctrine of claim differentiation. Indeed, the Court's construction of the claim term \"encoding control characters\" to mean \"converting at least a portion of each present control character into a form that comprises fewer bits\" indicates that the Court construes claims 1 and 8 to require compression.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The defendants also argue that the claims of the '405 patent\"recite no computer\" and \"do not call for any form of computer implementation of the claimed methods.\" Dkt. No. 180, at 8. For that reason, they argue that the claims cannot be defended on the ground that they address computer-related functionality. That argument, however, is based on an unsupportable reading of the claims. The defendants' own proposed claim constructions repeatedly define particular claim terms by reference to \"bits\" and \"series of bits.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Those constructions effectively acknowledge that the invention operates in a digital communication system that is, in all practical applications, computer driven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   For purposes of the first step of the section 101 analysis, the Federal Circuit has distinguished between claims that \"are directed to an improvement to computer\n   functionality versus being directed to an abstract idea.\"\n   <em>\n    Enfish, LLC v.

While it is true that the invention in this case involves the manipulation of data, the point of the invention is not simply the transmission of data in coded form, but the conversion of the data into a form that makes the communication of the data more efficient. The specific function of the recited encoding scheme is to add efficiency to the process in a particular manner.

First, there is a dispute of fact as to the scope of the ANSI patent policy. Both Sycamore and the defendants contend that the language of the ANSI patent policy unambiguously supports its own interpretation of the policy. Dkt. No. 183, at 8 (Sycamore: \"The written policy is clear on its face: only disclosure of 'patented items' is required. Because the policy is unambiguous....\"); Dkt. No. 256, at 10 (Defendants: \"Defendants agree with Sycamore IP that the Committee T1 patent policy is unambiguous....The plain language of the Committee T1 policy required the disclosure of Sycamore Networks' patent application.\"). The Court finds that the language of the patent policy is not unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   On the one hand, the policy is limited to a \"patent holder\" and a \"patentee\": \"ANSI shall receive from the\n   <em>\n    patent holder\n   </em>\n   ...assurance...that the\n   <em>\n    patentee\n   </em>\n   does not hold and does not anticipate holding any invention whose use would be required for compliance with\" the proposed standard. Dkt. No. 257-15, at ATIS002562 (emphasis added). These terms generally apply only to parties who have been granted a patent or have acquired ownership of a patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20100\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (defining \"patentee\" to include \"not only the patentee to whom the patent was issued but also the successors in title to the patentee\"). Dr. Tsang and Sycamore Networks, having only filed a provisional application at the time the presentation was made to the working group, would not be considered \"patentees\" under the statutory definition of that term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   On the other hand, the ANSI patent policy requires an assurance that the patentee \"does not hold\n   <em>\n    and does not anticipate holding\n   </em>\n   any invention whose use would be required for compliance with the proposed\" standard. Dkt. No. 257-15, at ATIS002562 (emphasis added). The defendants argue that Dr. Tsang anticipated holding a patent on his encoding scheme, as evidenced by his provisional and subsequent non-provisional patent applications. According to the defendants, Dr. Tsang therefore had a duty under the terms of the patent policy to disclose that he anticipated holding a patent on the invention at issue. Although the policy does not use the term \"patent application,\" the use of the term \"anticipates holding\" suggests that the policy is not limited to patents that the participants presently hold, and could include pending or provisional applications. Sycamore's suggested reading of the phrase \"anticipate holding\"-to mean that the policy imposes a duty on patentees \"who anticipate that a standard might encompass their patent,\" Dkt. No. 291, at 3-contorts the phrase \"anticipates\n   <em>\n    holding\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   which appears to refer to a person who does not presently hold a patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Given the tension between those two readings of the text, the Court turns to extrinsic evidence, which is not conclusive in support of either interpretation. Sycamore presents evidence from ANSI in 2002, 2003, and 2004, including ANSI documents and testimony from its General Counsel, to support its contention that ANSI's patent policy did not apply to pending patent applications. Dkt. No. 182-12, at SYC0026714; Dkt. No. 182-13, at 6; Dkt. No. 182-20, at SYC0026698. For their part, the defendants offer testimony from two participants in the T1X1.5 working group-Dr. Gorshe and Deborah Brungard, the chair of the T1X1.5 working group in 2000-that they understood that patent applications were covered by the policy. Dkt. No. 256-3, at 244:13-246:17; Dkt. No. 257-17, at 260:20-261:14. Given the existence of this contested material fact, the Court is not prepared to conclude, for purposes of summary judgment, that Dr. Tsang and Sycamore Networks did not have a duty to disclose the Provisional Application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Even if the ANSI patent policy did not impose a duty to disclose, other conduct by Dr. Tsang could give rise to a defense of waiver. At the least, Dr. Tsang's representations to Dr. Gorshe and members of the T1X1.5 working group that Sycamore Networks would not charge royalties to chip vendors who supported integrating Dr. Tsang's encoding scheme into the standard and that there would not be \"big royalties in any case\" raise triable questions of fact of the existence of express waiver. Dkt. No. 257-6, at MC000006. As Sycamore now seeks royalties on products made by the same chip vendors that supported Dr. Tsang's proposed encoding scheme, such conduct could be sufficient to satisfy the defendants' burden to show conduct \"so inconsistent with an intent to enforce [Sycamore's] rights as to induce a reasonable belief that such right has been relinquished.\"\n   <em>\n    Hynix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5650441\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/1336/#p1348\">\n    645 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1348 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mars, Inc. v.

As explained in\n   <em>\n    Princo\n   </em>\n   , \"the key inquiry under the patent misuse doctrine is whether ... the patentee has impermissibly broadened the physical or temporal scope of the patent grant and has done so in a manner that has anticompetitive effects.

The defendants' asserted defense of patent misuse is based solely on Dr. Tsang's purported violation of his duty to disclose the provisional patent to the T1X1.5 working group. Dkt. No. 256, at 12 (citing\n   <em>\n    Qualcomm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3953113\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/548/1004/#p1020\">\n    548 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1022 ). Even assuming that Dr. Tsang had such a duty and a violation of that duty had anticompetitive effects, the evidence would be insufficient to support a defense of patent misuse, as there would be an absence of any factual allegation that Sycamore \"impermissibly broadened the physical or temporal scope of the patent grant,\" particularly given the fact that the '405 patent had not issued at the time of the allegedly anticompetitive conduct. The Federal Circuit's 2008 opinion in\n   <em>\n    Qualcomm\n   </em>\n   only discussed patent misuse as an analogy in defining the scope of the defense of waiver,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3953113\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/548/1004/#p1020\">\n    548 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1024-27 ; the Federal Circuit's 2010 en banc decision in\n   <em>\n    Princo\n   </em>\n   expressly adopted the standard for patent misuse set forth above,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767994\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1318/#p1328\">\n    616 F.3d at 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that decision governs here. Accordingly, the Court holds that the defendants have not identified a viable theory of patent misuse, and Sycamore's motion for summary judgment is therefore GRANTED as to patent misuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Unenforceability for Inequitable Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Sycamore has moved for summary judgment of no inequitable conduct, targeting\n   the defendants' affirmative defense that all the claims of the '405 patent are unenforceable because of inequitable conduct by Sycamore. In particular, the defendants contend that Sycamore's claim of small entity status-and its payment of reduced fees to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") based on its asserted entitlement to small entity status-was unjustified and constituted inequitable conduct as a matter of law. Dkt. No. 186; Dkt. No. 260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The Federal Circuit has ruled on several occasions that, in the right circumstances, the improper invocation of small entity status by an inventor not entitled to that status can constitute inequitable conduct sufficient to render the inventor's patent unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nilssen v.

In the\n   <em>\n    Nilssen\n   </em>\n   case, the court noted that the district court had found clear and convincing evidence of the patent owner's \"obvious intent to mislead.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2951322\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/1223/\">\n    504 F.3d at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In both\n   <em>\n    Ulead\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    DH Technology\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit reversed trial courts that had entered judgments of inequitable conduct based on the improper payment of small entity fees and held that further proceedings were required in order to determine whether the patentee had acted with intent to deceive the PTO. It is clear that in this case similar evidence would be required before the Court could find inequitable conduct based on the claim of entitlement to small entity status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   At the motions hearing, the Court ruled that the defendants have adduced sufficient evidence about the activities of Sycamore's general counsel and managing partner, Dr. Kai Zhu, from which a finder of fact could conclude that Sycamore acted with the level of intent necessary to constitute inequitable conduct under the governing standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715257\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/1276/#p1290\">\n    649 F.3d 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1290-91 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (en banc). That evidence includes the fact that Dr. Zhu is a patent attorney who is familiar with patent prosecution, and that in light of Sycamore's financial situation, he had a significant incentive to avoid paying more than the small entity fee. While the evidence of intent to deceive is not especially strong, such evidence is often difficult to develop except from the person who is accused of deceitful intent. An issue such as this one therefore is particularly appropriate for resolution after a trial. Accordingly, the Court therefore DENIES the motion to hold, on summary judgment, that the '405 patent is not unenforceable for inequitable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Exhaustion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The Court will not at this time address\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment that Sycamore's Rights in the '405 Patent Are Exhausted\n   </em>\n   , Dkt.

However, Level 3, AT &amp; T, and CenturyLink have each raised a number of counterclaims, including for invalidity and unenforceability, that are not fully resolved by this order. Therefore, it is ORDERED that the parties shall promptly meet and confer to determine whether the trial set for April 23, 2018, is necessary. If trial in the Level 3 case is not necessary, the Court will conduct the trial in the AT &amp; T case (if necessary) on that date or, if not necessary, the CenturyLink case (if necessary).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   By 3 p.m. Eastern Time on February 23, 2018, Sycamore and each of the remaining sets of defendants are directed to advise the Court whether trial will be necessary at this time in any of the three remaining cases.
