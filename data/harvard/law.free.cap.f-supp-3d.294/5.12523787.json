On or about March 27, 2012, the Defendant Selectmen voted to eliminate the title of Environmental Supervisor, and to fire Pace's from his job as Chief Operator. Pace was 57 at the time and was suffering from a rotator cuff injury to his shoulder which he had suffered at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 28, 2012 Pace filed a complaint (\"MCAD Complaint\") with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\"), alleging that the Erving had terminated his employment based upon age discrimination, handicap discrimination and in retaliation for exercising his rights under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 152, the Massachusetts Workers Compensation Act. Pace's factual allegations were all against Erving and did not mention any member of the Board of Selectmen. The MCAD failed to conduct any investigation into Pace's claims until December 2015. On January 19, 2016, after reviewing documentation provided by Pace's attorney and conducting no further discovery, the MCAD issued it Investigative Disposition recommending a finding of lack of probable cause. The MCAD denied Pace's claim on the grounds that the Defendants had a valid reason for terminating him,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"budgetary restraints.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On or about February 1, 2016, the MCAD sent the parties a Dismissal and Notification of Rights, which advised Pace of his right to appeal its finding. Pace exercised his statutory right to appeal the dismissal of his MCAD Complaint, and requested a preliminary hearing. On June 14, 2016, a preliminary hearing was held at the offices of the MCAD, and on July 19, 2016, the Investigating Commissioner affirmed the dismissal of Pace's MCAD. On or about August 17, 2016, Pace filed a Petition for Judicial Review (the \"Superior Court Complaint\") in the Franklin (Mass.) Superior Court (the \"Franklin Action\"). Pace sought all of the damages alleged in the MCAD Complaint. He also expressly asked that the court \"order that summary judgment enter for [him] as to all counts in his Complaint to the MCAD that Respondent Town of Erving did unlawfully discriminate against [him] on the basis of age, handicap and retaliation when it terminated him on March 27, 2012,\" and asked for an evidentiary hearing as to damages. Thus, the claims in the Franklin Action included all of the claims in the MCAD Complaint, which included ADEA and the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 21, 2016, the Erving filed a Motion to Dismiss the Franklin Action. After a hearing on December 9, 2016, the Court allowed the Motion to Dismiss and entered judgment in favor of Erving. The action was essentially dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the Pace was not appealing a \"final decision\" within the meaning of the statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 23, 2017, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued and mailed to Pace a Notice of Dismissal of its companion case, together with A Notification of Right To Sue, Pace informing Pace of its action and providing him with a 90 day period in which to file\n   suit based upon federal law in a court of competent jurisdiction. Pace never requested a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC or the MCAD at any time during the nearly four years this matter was pending before the MCAD, or after it was dismissed by the MCAD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pace had elected to file in the MCAD, rather than the EEOC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so doing, Plaintiff checked the box indicating the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   As a party to the charge, you may request that EEOC review the final decision and order of the above named Agency.

Defendants assert that Pace's ADA and ADEA claims against the individual members of the Erving Board of Selectmen are barred because individuals are not personally liable under these statutory schemes. Pace does not contest this aspect of the Defendants' motion to dismiss. Therefore, the ADA and ADEA claims against the individual members of the Erving Board of Directors are dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taite v.

Where, as here, a federal court is asked to determine the preclusive effect of a Massachusetts state court adjudication, the federal court applies the Massachusetts law of\n   res judicata. Under Massachusetts law, res judicata requires: (1) the identity or privity of the parties to the present and prior actions, (2) identity of the cause of action, and (3) prior final judgment on the merits. Because claim preclusion is an affirmative defense, the party asserting it has the burden of establishing the facts necessary to support it. Thus, the defendants have the burden of establishing that all three elements are satisfied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Fernandes v.

Mass. 1998) (dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is not adjudication on merits for claim preclusion purposes and, therefore, would not preclude plaintiff from reasserting first claim in a different forum). The basic rule that dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction does not preclude a second action on the same claim is well settled. This means only that dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction permits a second action on the same claim that corrects the deficiency found in the first action. This same rule also applies to dismissals that rest on matters closely related to jurisdiction, such as prior resort to an administrative agency. This is because jurisdictional dismissals ordinarily preclude any decision on the substance of the claims presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While the issue is not free from doubt, I read the state court opinion as dismissing Pace's action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Moreover, the Defendants have not provided any persuasive argument that the adjudication was actually one on the merits. For these reasons, I am denying Defendants' motion to dismiss on res judicata grounds. This does not bar the Defendants from arguing other grounds for dismissal, including that this actions is barred by the doctrine of laches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Motion To Dismiss By The Defendants, Town Of Erving And Board Of Selectmen Eugene M.
