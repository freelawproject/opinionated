In that Report, Magistrate Judge Turnoff recommends granting Movant's Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [DE 1]. Movant argues his sentence should be vacated based on the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Samuel Johnson v. United States,\n   </em>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (holding that the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) was unconstitutionally vague). The Report found that Movant is not procedurally barred from asserting a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim and is entitled to relief under\n   <em>\n    Johnson.\n   </em>\n   The Government filed objections [DE 20] to the Report, Movant filed a Response [DE 21], and the Government filed a Reply [DE 24]. The Government also filed a Notice [DE 25] regarding recent developments in the law, the Movant filed a Response [DE 26] and the Government filed a Reply [DE 27].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court has reviewed the record\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and adopts in part the Report in finding that the Movant is not subject to a procedural bar to bring his claim forward and in finding that Movant is entitled to relief. The Court, however, respectfully declines to adopt the Report in its analysis of the Movant's claim under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   on the merits. For different reasons than those set forth in the Report, the Court finds that the Movant is entitled to relief under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and his sentence should be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

[CR-DE 1\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]. On August 21, 2006, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all five counts. [CR-DE 69].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2006, the Probation Department issued the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") to assist the Court with sentencing. The PSR increased the Movant's offense level from \"26\" to \"37\" after finding that Movant qualified for an enhanced sentence as a Career Offender under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1 and as an armed career criminal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PSR \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19). The PSR based this qualification on the following predicate offenses: (1) armed robbery and possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine on February 19, 1999; and (2) two convictions for battery on a law enforcement officer (\"BOLEO\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on October 10, 2001. (PSR \u00b6 19, 34-35). The enhancement rendered a guideline range of 360 months to life, followed by a mandatory consecutive sentence of five years on Count 4, for a total range of 420 months to life. (PSR \u00b6 21). The PSR provided a description of the facts underlying the Movant's predicate convictions which the Movant did not object to in writing or at his sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court sentenced the Movant to 420 months and eight years of supervised release on November 28, 2006. [CR-DE 79]. The Court disagreed with the disparity under the sentencing guidelines between powder and crack cocaine, but imposed a sentence in line with the guidelines at that time. [CR-DE 99]. The Court also noted that the PSR set forth the Movant's qualifying predicate offenses for \"career offender\" purposes. Although the Court listed the Movant's predicate qualifying offenses, it made no findings as to whether these offenses qualified under the elements, enumerated, or residual clause of the ACCA. The Court referred to Movant's \"gun enhancement,\" but not to any specific clause of the ACCA. [CR-DE 99].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Appeal and Re-sentencing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 1, 2006, the Movant filed an appeal in the Eleventh Circuit. [CR-DE 81]. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the denial of the Movant's request for a new trial on January 24, 2008.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dawson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=266%20Fed.%20Appx.%20810\">\n    266 Fed.Appx. 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 813-14 (11th Cir. 2010). However, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the Movant's sentence and remanded the matter for re-sentencing, pointing out that judges had discretion to depart from the crack/powder disparity under\n   <em>\n    Kimbrough v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/\">\n    552 U.S. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/\">\n    169 L.Ed.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court held a re-sentencing hearing on April 8, 2008, at which it decreased the sentence to 240 months imprisonment for all counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [CR-DE 126].

[CV-DE 31 at 8]. The Court affirmed and adopted the Magistrate Judge's Report. [CV-DE 43]. Movant appealed to the Eleventh Circuit. On December 18, 2014, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed this Court's decision and rejected the Movant's claims that he was improperly sentenced as an Armed Career Criminal. [CV-DE 68].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Current 2255 &amp; Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 22, 2016, the Movant filed a successive Motion to Vacate Sentence Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . [DE 1]. The Movant petitioned the Eleventh Circuit for leave to file a second or successive motion to vacate pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . [DE 8]. On July 28, 2016, the Eleventh Circuit found that the Movant had presented a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case showing that his ACCA claim fell within the scope of the new substantive rule in\n   <em>\n    Johnson.\n   </em>\n   The Movant was given leave to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his ACCA enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Movant asserts his sentence is no longer subject to the ACC A enhancement because his BOLEO conviction no longer qualifies as a predicate offense under\n   <em>\n    Johnson.\n   </em>\n   [DE 1]. The Government contends that the Movant procedurally defaulted on his present claim by failing to argue at his sentencing hearings or on direct appeal that the ACCA's residual clause was unconstitutional on vagueness grounds, and that the Movant failed to meet his burden of establishing that this Court relied on the ACCA's residual clause to find that his prior BOLEO conviction qualified as a predicate offense for ACCA purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Magistrate Judge issued the Report and Recommendation granting the Motion, finding the Movant is not procedurally barred from bringing his claim forward and is entitled to relief under\n   <em>\n    Johnson.\n   </em>\n   [DE 17]. The Government, in its Objections and Reply, maintains that Movant is procedurally barred from bringing the claim and fails to meet the required burden of proof for a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim. [DE 20, 24].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Movant's\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    claim is not procedurally barred.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Court must address whether the Movant's claim is properly before the Court. Generally, a Movant is procedurally barred from raising a challenge to his conviction or sentence for the first time in his \u00a7 2255 petition if he could have raised the challenge on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Frady,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184490\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/152/#p165\">\n    456 U.S. 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184490\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/152/#p165\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184490\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/152/#p165\">\n    71 L.Ed.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). Movant can avoid the procedural bar by showing \"both (1) 'cause' excusing his double procedural default, and (2) 'actual prejudice' resulting from the errors of which he complains.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184490\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/152/#p165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184490\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/152/#p165\">\n    at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184490\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/152/#p165\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Report found\n   that Movant established both cause and actual prejudice and therefore is not procedurally barred from bringing his claim. For the reasons discussed below, the Court affirms and adopts the Report's legal reasoning in determining Movant is not procedurally barred from bringing his claim forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Movant Has Shown Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In determining Movant has shown cause, the Report found that Movant's requested relief relied on a new constitutional law set forth in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   that was not readily available to counsel. The Government objects that the Magistrate Judge \"relied heavily on the reasoning in two district court opinions previously rejecting the government's argument on this issue.\" [DE 20] (referring to\n   <em>\n    Duhart v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204720424\">\n    2016 WL 4720424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. Sept. 9, 2016) and\n   <em>\n    Simmons v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204536092\">\n    2016 WL 4536092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla Aug. 31, 2016) ). The Government also stated it had nothing more to add to its procedural default argument and simply renewed its initial argument. [DE 20]. Local Magistrate Judge Rule 4(b) indicates that written objections shall specifically \"identify the portions of the proposed findings, recommendations or report to which objection is made, the specific basis for such objections and supporting legal authority.\" S.D. Fla. L.R. 4(b). The Government provides no legal authority to support its objection to the Report that the Magistrate Judge used two cases that rejected the Government's arguments. Additionally, the Government's initial argument was already reviewed by the Magistrate Judge prior to finding that Movant had shown cause. Therefore, this objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Movant Has Shown Actual Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Report found that the Movant has shown actual prejudice because he is serving an enhanced sentence that should not have been enhanced under the ACCA. In a separate part of the Report, the Report mentions that the Government conceded that if Movant were sentenced today, he would no longer qualify for the enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its objections, the Government explains it initially conceded that Movant would not qualify for the enhancement at the time of its filing because BOLEO was no longer considered to be a categorically violent felony and asserts that BOLEO qualifies today as a predicate crime for ACCA purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   However, regardless of the Government's concession, the Movant has demonstrated actual prejudice. To demonstrate prejudice, the Movant \"must shoulder the burden of showing, not merely that the errors at his trial [or sentencing] created a possibility of prejudice, but that they worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial [or sentencing] with error of constitutional dimensions.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v. U.S.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057777\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/1316/#p1333\">\n    720 F.3d 1316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1333 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Frady,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184490\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/152/#p165\">\n    456 U.S. at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184490\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/152/#p165\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, Movant must show that there is a reasonable probability that but for the error, his sentence would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mincey v. Head,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11458135\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/1106/#p1147\">\n    206 F.3d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1147 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding that the showing of prejudice necessary to overcome a procedural default is\n   the same showing of prejudice required by\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ). Moreover, erroneously sentencing a defendant under ACCA results in \"actual prejudice\" because it \"affect[s] the defendant's substantial rights and seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Mays v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812034\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/728/\">\n    817 F.3d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 737 n.12 (11th Cir. 2016) (citations omitted).

Here, Movant is prejudiced by serving an enhanced sentence that should not have been enhanced under the ACCA. As such, Movant has shown actual prejudice. Therefore, the Government's objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Movant is Entitled to Relief under\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The ACCA Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under ACCA, a defendant who is convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm is subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence if he has three prior convictions for a \"violent felony or a serious drug offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). A \"violent felony\" is any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that: (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; (2) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives; or (3) otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. The third clause, known as the \"residual clause,\" was found by the Court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to be unconstitutionally vague and to violate due process.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the parties disagree over whether Movant's previous conviction for BOLEO qualifies as a predicate offense for ACCA purposes. BOLEO is not one of the listed enumerated offenses in ACCA.

Additionally, \"touch or strike\" are contained in the first element, showing that the first element may be satisfied upon a showing of either a \"touch\" or a \"strike.\" Based on a plain reading of the statute, it appears that BOLEO is divisible in two elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court may also examine the indictment to determine the divisibility of Florida's battery statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both Count 1 and Count 2 charge the Movant with \"actually and intentionally touching or striking said person against said person's will.\" This signifies that the first element of BOLEO is treated as its own crime that the prosecutor must prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. If the Government only charged the first element to the Movant, the element is divisible from the second element of \"intentionally causing bodily harm to another person.\" Furthermore, the indictment does not specify whether the Movant was charged with \"touching\" or \"striking,\" demonstrating again that \"touch or strike\" are alternative means within the first element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court can also examine the jury instructions to determine if the statute is divisible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The jury is not asked to differentiate between \"touching or striking.\" Because the Movant can be found guilty of the crime if the jury finds that he intentionally \"touched or struck the victim against his or her will,\" this first element is divisible from the second. Additionally, because the jury is not required to make an additional finding of whether the Movant was guilty of \"touching\" or \"striking,\" these represent alternative means of satisfying the first element of the offense. Therefore, upon review of the plain language of the statute, Florida case law, the indictment, and the jury instructions for Florida's battery statute, the Court finds that Florida's battery statute is divisible in two ways: (1) actually and intentionally touching or striking another person against the will of the other; or (2) intentionally causing bodily harm to another person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Further, the parties' unauthorized additional filings [DE 25, 26], which the Court has reviewed for completeness, focus on whether BOLEO was considered a violent crime under the elements clause at the time of Movant's sentencing. If there was clear binding precedent that the Movant's BOLEO conviction qualified as a violent felony under the elements clause, the Eleventh Circuit would not have certified Movant's successive motion under the rubric of the clear-unclear test.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Rogers\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325693\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/1335/\">\n     825 F.3d at 1338-39\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
