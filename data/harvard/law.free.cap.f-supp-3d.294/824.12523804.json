No matter how careful I am the breakouts come larger and larger all the time. The pain and suppuration are becoming unbearable. The headaches increase every day....\" She stated that as she wrote her answers, she was unable to move her left arm due to pain, and \"I can no longer wear a brassiere as it will cause a break out of multiple\n   sores if I wear it for more than an hour.\" My anxiety is still difficult but the dr. is hopeful my new medication will help.\" AR 314.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Webb responded to a \"personal pain questionnaire\" that asked for detailed descriptions of her pain, how often she experienced pain, where pain was located, how it limited her activities, and treatment used to relieve pain. AR 327. Webb reported that her headaches were sharp, pounding, and aching. Her hidradenitis sores throbbed or caused dull aching. Headache pain was worsened by laughing, crying, sneezing, bending, and straining. Hidradenitis pain was worse in hot weather. She had pain every day, generally all day. Headache pain radiated down her neck. Hidradenitis suppurativa pain was under the breasts and arms. She used hot compresses and showers on the skin sores.

AR 328. \"My pain radiates from the back of my head, blurring my vision, causing loss of balance, nystagmus, loss of fine motor skills and grip, also severe dizziness and loss of balance.\" Headaches were brought on by laughing, coughing, sneezing, bending, lifting, or straining. AR 328. She stated that when she had a headache she could not walk without support, that she no longer drove, and that she had to cancel many appointments due to pain. AR 329. She stated that Salsalate in conjunction with Tylenol eased that pain, that heat sometimes eased headache pain, and that neck or back rubs relieved headache pain. AR 329. She stated that she did not seek treatment when she had a headache as \"there really isn't anything they can do.\" AR 329.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On July 22, 2013, Webb completed a \"fatigue questionnaire.\" AR 332. She stated that she experienced fatigue once a day on average, that her \"cm headaches leave me drained, as well as the pain from my HS sores. I also have difficulty sleeping most nights.\" Asked what activities she had had to restrict or stop because of fatigue, she stated, \"I do little in the afternoons and mid-morning.\" Asked to describe her activities in a 24-hour day she stated that she usually did laundry first thing in the morning, then what cleaning and vacuuming she could with her children helping with bending or lifting \"to try and avoid triggering a headache.\" She said she went grocery shopping twice a month. She stated, \"My fatigue has increased drastically since my headaches have increased. I went from a headache 1-4 times a month to daily, lasting sometimes all day.\" AR 332.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On October 1, 2013, Webb's attorney completed a second disability report.

She stated in response to the ALJ's questions that she had been having \"significant problems primarily with the headaches\" and these \"added to my symptoms as far as being unable to use the computer system at work.\" AR 57. She testified that she would need to go home \"because as my headaches progress, I lose my depth perception and my balance, making it really dangerous for me to drive.... I became unable to drive consistently, my husband was having to take me to work.\" AR 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Webb testified that supervisory personnel \"knew the situation, I had my doctor's note, but there's still limits to what's acceptable.\" AR 58. She testified that she was five feet, ten inches tall, weighed 320 pounds, and had \"problems\" with her knees that \"aren't great\" and \"haven't been since I was a teenager.\" AR 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Webb testified that she and her husband were separated and the three children, ages 17, 15, and 11, lived with her and her husband's former step mother, Amy (\"my best friend\"), and Amy's daughter in a mobile home in Sturgis. AR 59-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Webb testified that she did not have a driver's license \"because I really couldn't drive,\" and her husband or Amy drove her places. AR 60. She had completed twelfth grade. AR 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Webb testified that for mental health treatment, she primarily saw Dr. Hoag. AR 72. She stated that she had been referred to one practitioner who was not taking new patients, that it was difficult for her to get back and forth to Rapid City, and that she had recently learned of a therapist in Sturgis who was now accepting Medicaid. AR 72. However, she did not know his specialty and had to find out from Dr. Hoag, her family doctor. AR 72-73. She stated that Dr. Hoag had prescribed Wellbutrin,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   which helped significantly. She stated that she also took Celexa and \"between the two there's much better function, at least at home.... I can go out with the family on occasion, as long as it's ... limited.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 73. She testified that she could not go to the mall but she could go to the grocery store or out to dinner if it wasn't terribly busy. AR 73-74. She testified that she also took Hydroxyzine for the times that anxiety kind of overwhelmed her usual medications, and had taken two [pills] before the hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Webb testified that her headaches were \"by far the most dominant\" symptoms, that she had headaches pretty much every day, which could last five minutes to a day. AR 75. She testified that she usually lay down when she had a headache, and took Acetaminophen and caffeine, which \"tend[ed] to take the sharp edge off....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   AR 75. Dr. Finley had given her Topamax,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was effective for a while but lost effectivity. AR 76. Dr. Finley had given her Nortriptyline, \"which never worked....\" AR 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Dr. Finley had not offered other medication but \"wants to reexamine the sleep apnea and try to alleviate some of that to see if it will ... help with some of the headaches.\" AR 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Webb testified that she had seen Dr. Gasbarre in Spearfish for her hidradenitis, but only once. AR 76. She stated, \"I'm pretty much scars from here to here,\" gesturing under both arms, and \"all the way underneath both breasts. I'm pretty much just a mass of scars....\" AR 77. She said creams did not work. She also said Dr. Gasbarre had tried steroid injections \"and it was not terribly useful\" and was excruciatingly painful. AR 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Webb testified that she took \"Ropinirole\" for restless legs and that it helped, or slowed it down. AR 77-78. She testified that she had no side-effects from any of her medications. AR 78-79. Webb testified that she had pain all day every day, and \"If it's not the headache it's ... under my arms or in my breast.\" AR 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Webb testified that her boys helped cook, and pulled laundry out of the stacking washer and dryer because she did not have the strength to lift it. Her boys brought laundry to her to sit down and fold. AR 80. She testified that she had not been to any of her children's activities for five years (\"since my 17-year-old was in seventh grade\") because \"I can't handle the crowds.\" AR 80. She could handle individual parent teacher conferences. AR 81. She could not tolerate concerts. AR 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Webb testified that she had been prescribed a BiPAP machine that South Dakota did not approve, \"So Dr. Finley wants to revisit that ... [a]nd write a new order....\" AR 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Webb testified that she took two dogs outside but not for walks: \"I couldn't get down the driveway at this point.\" AR 84. She did not garden, or go to church, or visit relatives, although during the past few months she had made multiple trips to Colorado for her father's last illness and funeral. AR 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Webb testified that when she was working she was absent once or twice a week on average. AR 86. She sometimes had a warning of onset of headache, \"[w]here... I can be carrying something or holding something and I just drop it.\" AR 86. She described symptoms associated with her headaches, which were not like a typical migraine with light-sensitivity, \"but I do lose depth perception. It's very difficult for me to read or see. My eyes ... become unfocused.\" AR 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Webb testified that her sleep schedule was \"all over the place.\" AR 88. She testified regarding her understanding that surgery for Chiari Malformation was effective for alleviating headaches about 50 percent of the time, but did not alleviate problems with balance, depth perception, or \"the numb spots that I get.\" AR 88-89. She described her balance problem as being unable to walk a straight line and tending to veer left. AR 89. She said that when she walked with her husband, he walked on her left to compensate for this. AR 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Webb testified that she could walk 15 or 20 minutes \"before it starts affecting me.\" AR 90. She could sit 15 or 20 minutes before she had to get up and move. AR 90. She could lift 20-30 pounds. AR 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Webb wrote a letter to the Appeals Council dated September 11, 2015. AR 373.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Webb stated that she had been unable to obtain consistent medical help for her Chiari Malformation, diagnosed in 2003. AR 374. She stated that she had been informed then, that the neurosurgeon recommended surgery.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   I didn't have insurance, beyond the post-natal that I received through Medicaid which expired approximately one week after my diagnosis. There are no medications that alleviate the symptoms of CM. The best that I could do was try to manage the pain the best I could with over the counter medications which is of extremely limited efficacy at best.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   AR 374.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   I had a very understanding boss for several years, who knew my work ethic prior to these headaches taking over my life.... I was able to get off work as I needed to. Then when I no longer had the same manager, due to him leaving, I began to have problems with attendance. My new manager was not as flexible.... I then went to another company.... Then was I not only experiencing the incredible pain, and myriad other CM symptoms, I was also unable to cope with terrible social anxiety. Again, no medical coverage meant no \"official\" diagnosis, and certainly no medications to alleviate the anxieties. The anxieties, coupled with spotty attendance, became a serious issue in continuing my employment. Again, initially, I was in luck with a fairly flexible supervisor, who helped as he could, but when he moved to another location in the company, I lost that help, and consequently was informed if I couldn't alleviate the issues, maybe I shouldn't work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   AR 374.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   During the same time frame, Webb stated, \"I was dealing with my Hidradenitis Suppurativa.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   The Hidradenitis began flaring up around 2004... I had to have emergency surgery. This is a bill I still have been unable to pay off.... I was never even able to go to my follow up visits with the surgeon, due to lack of money and/or coverage.... With Hidradenitis, as with CM, there is no medication or consistent course of action or care that is a definitive treatment... I was at my dermatologist this past week, and he reiterated the same to me. He informed me that I was already doing the best that could be done and that we would just try some other options to see if it might help a bit more. The Hidradenitis is incredibly painful as well as socially demeaning.... I ran into consistent issues at work because of it-the pain, the drainage, the smell, the all around mess.... Many days I cannot even move one or both arms due to flare ups, or open sores. This again means I cannot function properly at work, so leads to even more attendance issues, and frequent disciplinary action by my employers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   AR 374-375.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   I have tried to find jobs, but I simply cannot find anything that is flexible enough to deal with my frequent absences. On average, I was absent at my last place of employment once per week, and had to go home early sometimes twice within the same week... I cannot predict when I will be debilitated with pain. I would gladly when I'm not in pain, but I cannot predict when that would be, and so employers cannot rely on a solid schedule with me.... I even attempted work at home programs, but ultimately ran into the same problem.... I was still required to produce X amount of work and/or X hours. Again, unpredictable. I am truly at a\n   loss as to how to proceed at this point. I wish desperately to work....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   AR 375.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Webb submitted information about her conditions \"since I am aware that neither of my conditions is common, nor is the treatment of them. I am hopeful you will be able to see what I am up against....\" AR 376.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   She stated that her neurologist was focusing on her sleep apnea\"to help alleviate what can be alleviated and therefore help with the pain more effectively.... There is simply no medication for the other Chiari symptoms that I experience such as the dizziness, loss of depth perception, trouble swallowing, nystagmus, terrible fine motor skills, and more depending on the day.\" AR 376.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Webb stated that her dermatologist had informed her in the past week that surgery for her Hidradenitis was not an option due to the severity and length of the sinuses that had developed. AR 376.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   She stated that she still needed to be able to provide for her children, but \"I am lucky in that my children are now of an age that they require little in the course of day to day that I have to be fully functional for. They get rides from family members, friends, their dad, etc. They assist me daily in household maintenance such as laundry and cooking....\" AR 376.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Webb submitted an undated addendum to her letter, stating that she had had appointments with her neurologist and dermatologist, and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   [T]here was still nothing that changed or alleviated my symptoms of ... hidradenitis and the Chiari Malformation. My dermatologist recommended a topical ointment that unfortunately I cannot afford. My Medicaid will not cover it due to the huge expense, and I cannot pay over $300 per prescription. My neurologist prescribed another medication that unfortunately isn't efficacious, and instead increases my pain and discomfort with side effects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   AR 372.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Medical Evidence-Chronological\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   On July 5, 2011, Kevin O'Toole, D.O., saw Webb at Poudre Valley Health System, Ft. Collins, Colorado, for a June 20, 2011, work related left ankle sprain. AR 463. She was wearing an ankle brace and was weight bearing and doing ankle exercises. She did not complain of instability. The swelling had improved. She said her pain level was 3/10. AR 463. On exam she demonstrated no pain behaviors. Gait was minimally antalgic and she was wearing her brace. With removal of the brace, there was mild edema inferior to the lateral malleolus. She had tenderness over the anterior and posterior talofibular ligaments and the calcaneal fibular ligament. She had distal peroneal tenderness. She had full range of motion. Anterior drawer testing was positive. X-rays showed soft-tissue swelling and no bony injury. The assessment was \"Left ankle sprain, unimproved with signs of increased joint mobility and ligamentous tearing.\" AR 463. Dr. O'Toole said he was referring Webb for an ankle MRI. She would wear a boot when weight bearing, continue to elevate, do range of motion exercises gently, and apply cold as needed. Her working status was updated to wearing the boot and avoiding stairs. AR 464.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   On July 19, 2011, Dr. O'Toole reported the MRI findings that included ankle joint effusion, Grade II sprain of the ATF ligament, and Grade I sprains of the calcaneal, fibular, and deltoid ligaments. AR 461. Also noted was chronic central band plantar fasciitis of which the patient was aware. Examination showed plaintiff demonstrated no pain behavior and with removal of boot, there was just minimal edema, tenderness over the anterior talofibular ligament, and full ankle active\n   range of motion. The assessment was severe left ankle sprain. Treatment was a lace-up brace. AR 461. She would avoid stairs and perform daily range of motion exercises. AR 462. Dr. O'Toole did not expect permanent impairment. AR 462.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   On August 2, 2011, Dr. O'Toole recorded that the patient reported improvement, felt comfortable in her new brace, and had minimal trouble with swelling by the end of the day. AR 459. She said she was performing her active range of motion exercises and felt better overall. AR 459. With removal of the brace upon examination, there was just trace edema and minimal tenderness and her active range of motion was full. AR 459. Dr. O'Toole assessed left ankle sprain, improving. AR 459. Her work status continued to be wearing her ankle brace and avoiding stairs. AR 459.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   On September 29, 2011, Dr. O'Toole reported that the patient had weaned from her brace, had a pain level of 2/10, and complained of some popping and general weakness. AR 457. She felt better climbing stairs but had some discomfort descending stairs or on very uneven terrain. She did home exercises daily. She reported tolerating full duty [work]. AR 457. Examination was normal except for end-point inversion tenderness. Her gait was not antalgic on a level surface. There was no deformity or edema. She was nontender over the lateral ankle but had end point inversion tenderness. Active range of motion of the ankle was full. The assessment was that her severe sprain was improving but she needed ankle-strengthening. AR 457. Dr. O'Toole planned to refer her to physical therapy for strengthening and proprioceptive training. AR 457. He noted she was on full duty without restrictions. AR 458.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   On October 11, 2011, Paul Braunlin, physical therapist at Poudre Valley Health System, reported his evaluation and treatment. AR 454-56. Webb reported she was a full-time customer service employee at Center Partners. AR 454. On June 20, 2011, she was walking outside the building, up the stairs, and caught her left foot on the remnant of a post that had been cut off that had a portion sticking up. She tripped, fell, and sustained a fairly severe ankle sprain. AR 453. Mr. Braunlin noted a June 12, 2011, MRI showed \"moderate-sized ankle joint effusion, marked grade II sprain of the ATF ligament, grade I sprain of CF and deltoid ligament, mild posterior tibial tenosynovitis and tendinopathy, mild peroneal synovitis, chronic central band plantar fasciitis.\" AR 454.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Webb told Mr. Braunlin that she was 50-60 percent back to normal but still had problems on uneven ground and going down stairs. She described feelings of instability multiple times per day in her left ankle. She gave a history of severe right ankle sprain at age 14 or 15. She reported bilateral knee pain and \"states they had recommended surgery. She has patellofemoral cartilage problems. The right is worse than the left.\" AR 454. She smoked 3/4 to 1 pack of cigarettes a day. AR 454. She once quit for a year. AR 454-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Webb told Mr. Braunlin that she had headaches from a Chiari I malformation and had days when she was \"clumsy with both her hands and feet.\" AR 455. She took ibuprofen and Tylenol as needed. She rated her ankle pain between 1-2 and denied using heat or ice. Objectively, the patient had a fairly normal gait. Her balance was only fair, and she reported having had poor balance all of her life. AR 455. Active knee range of motion was full extension and 135 degrees of flexion without report of pain. Active ankle range of motion was dorsiflexion 5 degrees, plantar flexion 45 degrees, inversion 35 degrees, eversion 25 degrees. On passive range of motion the therapist felt instability at the end range of plantar flexion inversion, with excessive motion. She was tender diffusely\n   through the left ankle and had mild swelling. AR 455. She was able to walk on her heels and toes though not comfortably due to pain. She had 5/5 strength for dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion and eversion. The physical therapist gave her instructions for a home exercise program with elevation, use of heat or ice, use of the ankle brace which was preferable to a device that restrained the ligament. He recommended using a stationary bike and \"she said she would be unable to because of her knees although she may tolerate 5 degrees.\" The therapist instructed her how to do balance re-education exercises. AR 455. Therapist and patient agreed on goals: stop smoking, with discussion of the implications in the healing (she said initially no way, although ... there are times when she does want to quit ... and we will discuss this further); improve one-legged standing and dynamic balance; use heat and ice to reduce swelling and pain; and consistently use the brace to protect the ligaments as they heal. AR 456. The patient would be seen once a week for modalities for 3-4 weeks. AR 456. Rehabilitation prognosis was good.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   On October 27, 2011, Dr. O'Toole noted Webb's diagnosis, treatment, and July 2011 MRI findings. On September 29 she had reported 2/10 pain, ankle popping and weakness, and was referred to physical therapy. Today she said she felt the same, with 2/10 pain, but denied any problems when she was on even\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   ground. \"It is only on uneven terrain that she experiences pain.\" She said the ankle felt somewhat unstable. She had been wearing her brace but did not wear it this day because of snow. On exam, blood pressure was 150/92, pulse 102, respiration 24, and pain level 2/10. AR 449-450.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Exam findings were mild edema over the inferior malleolus, tenderness over the ATF ligament, and tenderness with endpoint inversion of the ankle, but without laxity. Assessment was severe left ankle sprain with delayed recovery and poor compliance with treatment as she had missed and rescheduled appointments. AR 449-50. The plan was to continue physical therapy, wear the brace, return to full duty but avoid stairs. AR 450. Dr. O'Toole planned to refer her to Dr. Wesley Jackson for an orthopedic consultation. AR 450.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   On November 3, 2011, Dr. Wesley Jackson, M.D., Orthopaedic &amp; Spine Center of the Rockies (hereinafter Orthopaedic Center) saw Webb for a left ankle injury. AR 408. The history was that she had inverted her left ankle on a post in a concrete parking lot on June 13, 2011, and had a lot of swelling. Initially she wore a boot, then an ASO ankle brace. Currently she was in physical therapy. She still had pain and instability on the lateral side of the ankle.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   She had a medical history of Chiari malformation, asthma, and latex sensitivity. She worked in telesales and was working without restrictions. On examination she was five feet 11 inches tall and weighed 283 pounds. She had swelling along the posterolateral ankle. On seated exam, she had a grade 2 drawer and a grade 2 tilt, which reproduced pain with tenderness over the ATFL [anterior talofibular ligament]\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   . AR 407-08. She had minimal medial gutter tenderness. Her peroneals functioned well but were slightly tender. AR 407. Three non-weightbearing x-rays on the PVH PAC system from June 28 showed no osseous abnormalities. An MRI dated July 12, 2011, showed tearing of the ATFL and CFL [calcaneofibular ligament]\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and quite a bit of fluid in and\n   around the ankle posteriorly, anteriorly, and medially. AR 407. The peroneals were a little bit tenosynovitic without obvious tear. The posterior tibial tendon was the same. Diagnosis was chronic anatomic left ankle instability status post sprain. AR 407. Dr. Jackson discussed the findings, natural history and treatment options. She had ankle impingement and instability. It was now chronic. Her nonoperative option was a more robust brace. AR 407. Or she could have, as an outpatient, ankle arthroscopy, debridement, and Brostrom-Gould ligament reconstruction, which would benefit her greatly. She would be able to bear weight two or three weeks after surgery. AR 407.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   On November 14, 2011, Paul Braunlin saw Webb for her fourth and last physical therapy visit. AR 447. She reported intermittent left ankle pain, feeling more stable in the ankle brace, pain going downstairs, but said she was pain-free going upstairs. She states that she was reluctant to have surgery as she had a problem coming out of anesthesia after her last surgical procedure. AR 447. Objectively, she went upstairs quite well. Going down she had obvious pain and was somewhat awkward. This had not changed since Mr. Braunlin began seeing her, he said. AR 447. She had full active range of motion and could walk on her heels and toes but that was painful. AR 447-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   She had \"fairly good\" one-legged standing balance. AR 448. She had obvious weakness in her hips and trunk, demonstrating excessive weight shift. She was able to walk on her heels and toes forward and backward and go sideways crossing her right foot over her left and the reverse with good coordination and balance. AR 448.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Mr. Braunlin recommended that she begin doing partial sit-ups and hip abduction strengthening, which was difficult for her. He recommended a stationary bike, treadmill or recumbent bike. She did not have the finances to go to a gym, and did not have time with her young children at home. The physical therapist assessed a \"plateau in progress of her physical therapy. She continues to have intermittent pain and [in]stability.\" AR 448. Mr. Braunlin said he did not have anything else to offer. AR 448.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   On December 15, 2011, Dr. O'Toole assessed chronic left ankle instability, status post sprain, and recommended that Webb proceed with surgery proposed by Dr. Jackson. AR 446.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   On March 1, 2012, Dr. Jackson reported that the patient had elected to undergo surgery for left ankle instability and impingement. She wanted to take a week or two off work and then go back to a desk job. She still had pain and instability of the left ankle that affected her activities of daily living. On exam, she had grade 2 drawer, grade 32 tilt, and pain over the ATFL and sinus tarsi. Assessment, again, was chronic left ankle anatomic instability after a sprain. AR 406.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   On March 1, 2012, the Poudre Valley laboratory reported results of latex allergy studies. Classes 0, 1, and 2 were undetected to moderate. Class 3 was high, and Classes 4-6 were very high. AR 552.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   On March 9, 2012, Webb was post op. She was on Percocet and had severe itching all over her body. She stated that she did not tolerate Vicodin. She said her pain was reasonable. She was given Tramadol\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and would use Benadryl for the itching. AR 405.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   On March 13, 2012, Dr. Jackson saw her six days after left ankle arthroscopy, debridement, and Brostrom-Gould ligament reconstruction. AR 404. She reported intermittent diurnal paresthesias, i.e., tingling and numbness in the top of her foot. She thought her splint was pressing in the front of the ankle. She said she \"really has not much pain\" and had stopped pain medications. On exam she had moderate swelling, negative drawer, and negative tilt. Light touch sensation was slightly diminished in the superficial peroneal nerve distribution and she had slight paresthesias in the plantar aspect of the foot. Dr. Jackson did not think this was unusual but told her to remain non-weightbearing for another week. She would wear a removable Cam Walker boot. AR 404.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   On March 16, 2012, Dr. O'Toole recommended that Webb be off work until she saw Dr. Jackson again, and do no weight bearing on her left foot. AR 444.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   On March 22, 2012, Dr. Jackson recorded that the paresthesias had resolved and that Webb reported having some aches and pains. On exam she had grade 1 drawer and a negative tilt, and minimal swelling. She had no calf pain. Dr. Jackson stated the treatment plan. She was not working. She could walk one hour and stand one hour a day. She would wean off crutches and Roll-A-Bout as tolerated. She could ice and elevate as needed. AR 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   On April 11, 2012, Dr. O'Toole updated her work status to one hour walking or standing per day, using a Roll-A-Bout as needed and wearing her cast boot. He stated that she had been unable to work on March 27 due to injury-related pain. He informed Webb that if she had any more problems where she felt incapable of working, to notify him so that he could assess and provide a work status form if appropriate. AR 442.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   On April 12, 2012, Dr. Jackson said Webb was doing well, working on restrictions and her cast would be removed today. She had been walking in the cast quite a bit and elevating her leg quite a bit. She had intermittent calf pain below the gastroc when she elevated it. Otherwise her ankle pain was intermittent, with activity. AR 402. Exam findings were negative. The assessment was \"excellent postoperative.\" The plan was to wear a boot except to sit, sleep, shower, and bathe. She would use the boot to walk for the next three weeks, then an ASO ankle brace. She would do gentle active range of motion. If this did not eliminate her pain within two days, she would return for another evaluation. At work she could walk two hours and stand three hours a day max, wearing the boot. AR 402.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   On April 13, 2012, Webb saw Dr. O'Toole for increased pain beginning the evening before, and spasm that she thought might be due to increased activity after she got out of the cast. AR 439. Tramadol helped. She rested, elevated, and the pain improved to 4/10, she said. After coming to the clinic, it was higher at 9/10, she said. AR 439. On exam, with removal of the boot, there was a horizontal ridge in the area of tenderness on the mid posterior calf. Dr. O'Toole assessed left calf myofascial pain secondary to increased activity. AR 439. Dr. O'Toole advised heat, elevation, and gentle ankle active ROM exercises and Tramadol as needed. Her work status was unchanged. She was to go to the ER if she had a significant increase in pain, redness or swelling in the ankle. AR 440.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   On April 17, 2012, Webb saw Dr. Johnson who reported to Dr. Jackson in a phone conversation. She had calf pain and a Doppler was negative for DVT. Other than leg or calf pain she had no constitutional\n   symptoms. Her pain could be due to the splint or the cast. AR 401.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   On May 24, 2012, Dr. Jackson said that Webb was not in therapy yet. She had been wearing her ASO ankle brace for two weeks. She got calf cramping and pain intermittently with activity. AR 400. She was working. She denied back pain, leg pain proximal to the knee, or radiation, and paresthesias. On exam her ankle was neutrally aligned with a \"very, very subtle varus\" and no pain, tenderness or swelling, and good strength and range of motion. Her peroneals were a bit weak. She had a grade 1 to 2 drawer sign. Dr. Jackson said she was satisfactory postoperative. New x-rays showed mild osteopenia and a normal mortise, hindfoot, and subtalar joint. She had subtle hindfoot varus deformity. AR 400. The treatment plan would be to neutralize her subtle varus with a laterally posted Superfeet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Jackson recommended physical therapy for balance and proprioceptive training. He thought a lot of her muscle aches and pains in her calf were neuromuscular. \"I think she has plenty of room for improvement\" and \"I think she is still too close to having had surgery to make any other assessments....\" AR 400. Her only working restrictions were no climbing and no stairs. AR 399.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   On May 31, 2012, Dr. O'Toole recorded Webb's complaint of continued problems with ankle and foot pain, reported as 5-6 currently. She said that the Superfeet were not helping but caused pain on the contralateral foot and ankle and that her feet fatigued more quickly using the Superfeet. She also noted persistent pain in the lateral foot. The topical gel that Dr. O'Toole had provided for her calf at the last visit was helping with the pain. AR 437. On exam, gait was noted to be antalgic on the left. Positive findings were trace edema over the lateral malleolus, minimal tenderness to palpation laterally, positive anterior drawer, calf tenderness with dorsiflexion of the ankle, and no other findings of note. AR 438. Dr. O'Toole advised Webb to discontinue Superfeet, start physical therapy, and see Dr. Jackson earlier than planned to talk about the problem with the inserts. Dr. O'Toole updated her work status to a maximum of one hour walking and standing per day, and she was to wear her lace-up ankle brace. \"Date of MMI is unknown at this time.\" AR 438.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   On June 11, 2012, Paul Braunlin, physical therapist, evaluated and treated Webb. He noted in the subjective section of the treatment note that she had failed conservative care and underwent left ankle arthroscopy, debridement, and ligament reconstruction for instability and anterior impingement. Date of surgery was March 7, 2012. AR 431. She described the pain in her left ankle and lateral forefoot as \"constant bruising\" and rated the pain as 5-6/10. AR 431. She stated that the snapping and popping was 10 times worse than before surgery and reported being \"very, very frustrated how tight and how loose my ankle is.\" AR 431. She said she was mostly sitting at a desk when working. AR 431. When they discussed improving her balance and proprioception, Webb reminded the therapist about her Chiari malformation\"and she states she has had balance problems and clumsiness all her life in her hands and feet. She noticed her balance is not good, doubts this can be corrected. I did discuss with her the need for improving it ... since she has been\n   immobilized for such a long time, and that her balance must be worse....\" AR 432.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Objectively the patient moved somewhat slowly from sitting to standing. She had a short but not antalgic gait. When she took off the brace there was still moderate swelling. She was able to heel-toe walk. She was able to stand \"fairly well, not good balance but fair on one leg, using her hand to support herself. She is very restricted with her left ankle active range of motion.\" Dorsiflexion was 2-4 degrees, plantar flexion 35 degrees, eversion 10 and inversion 25 degrees. AR 432.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Mr. Braunlin instructed her in calf stretching for her gastroc and soleus muscles. AR 432. He demonstrated one-legged standing balance improving her trunk sway, using a mirror for feedback. He recommended use of a stationary bike. AR 432. He treated her with gentle passive range of motion in the talocrural and subtalar joints, not moving to end range. AR 432. Goals included gait improvement (Webb reported pain in her fourth and fifth metatarsal regions when she pushed off with her left foot). AR 433.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   On June 14, 2012, Dr. O'Toole noted that Webb was in physical therapy to work on balance and prioprioception. AR 429. She questioned the merit because her Chiari malformation affected her balance. \"Both her physical therapist and I reassured her that our intent is to optimize her ankle function in order to minimize any disturbance to her balance.\" AR 429. She stated that her current pain level was 3 \u00bd/10 and that the topical gel benefited the pain in her foot. The calf cramping had resolved. She had occasional foot cramping. AR 429. On exam, her gait was not antalgic, she had minimal ankle edema, was moderately restricted in dorsiflexion and inversion, and had endpoint tenderness with both. AR 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Also on June 14, 2012, Dr. Jackson said that Webb had completed two physical therapy visits, did not like the Superfeet and stopped using them, and did not like the feel of the ASO ankle brace. She complained of pain in the lateral ankle. AR 398. She was still working with restrictions of no stairs. AR 398. On exam she had grade 1 drawer and grade 1 to 2 tilt. Peroneal eversion strength was weak 1-/5. She had no calf pain and had full ankle and subtalar range of motion. AR 398. Assessment was \"satisfactory postoperative.\" He recommended continued physical therapy and told her she could try a MalleoTrain sleeve instead of the ASO. AR 398. He advised no impact activity unless she was perfectly comfortable with it. AR 398.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   On July 19, 2012, Dr. O'Toole assessed status post left ankle arthroscopy for debridement and ligament reconstruction, improving. The treatment plan was to continue physical therapy as needed. Her work status was updated: she would wean from the ankle brace as tolerated and avoid stairs. Dr. O'Toole anticipated that Webb would be at MMI [maximum medical improvement] at her next visit with Dr. Jackson. AR 428.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   On July 19, 2012, Dr. Jackson wrote that the patient was working, said she felt a little plateaued, had one more physical therapy visit, and was a little bit more convinced that she had made some progress. She wore both her ASO ankle brace and MalleoTrain sleeve and wanted to wean out of them. On physical exam she had grade 1 drawer and grade 2 tilt. She had no tenderness, swelling, or calf pain and had good ankle and subtalar range of motion. There was no calf pain, tenderness, or swelling, and she was neurovascularly intact. AR 397. Dr. Jackson said she \"may ultimately plateau with a little bit of intermittent pain. She is still at risk of recurrence and instability.\" AR 397. He assessed her as satisfactory postoperative. AR 397.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   On July 24, 2012, Dr. O'Toole reported that Webb continued physical rehabilitation, working on balance and proprioception. AR 425. Dr. O'Toole stated that Mr. Braunlin had seen the patient yesterday when she came to the clinic limping after a severe calf cramp. AR 425. \"She has been working as usual. She has attempted weaning from her brace. She ... has been doing her recommended exercises.... Her sleep was still disturbed last night. Her pain level is reduced today to 6/10.\" AR 425. On exam her gait was non-antalgic, she had some muscle spasm in her left calf and was tender to palpation of the proximal calf, and had restricted dorsiflexion. AR 425. Dr. O'Toole assessed calf tightness and spasm. He ordered lab work to evaluate for electrolyte abnormalities and prescribed Flexeril. \"She remains on temporary restrictions of avoiding stairs and weaning from her brace gradually as tolerated.\" AR 426.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   On July 27, 2012, Dr. O'Toole reported that Webb returned early complaining of increased pain and cramping in the left calf. He had refilled her Flexeril three days before but she had not been able to pick it up. She was doing her directed stretches. She also reported numbness on the back of the calf. On exam, her gait was antalgic. The calf and ankle were not swollen but there was spasm and tenderness in the calf and diminished sensation in the calf. Supine and seated straight-leg-raises were positive on the left. Reflexes were absent at both knees. Reflexes were 1+ at both ankles. Great toe strength was 4+/5 on the left, ankle dorsiflexion was 4+ on the left and 5 on the right, and plantar flexion was 5/5 and equal. She had difficulty with the heel walk. AR 423. Dr. O'Toole assessments included possible lumbar radiculopathy. He referred Webb to Dr. Rebekah Martin for electrodiagnostic testing and physiatric consult and took her off work temporarily. AR 424. He noted that the recent metabolic panel was remarkable only for a marginally elevated glucose and slightly low AST. AR 424. \"Date of MMI is unknown at this time.\" AR 424.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   On July 30, 2012, Webb had a first-time visit with Amber Steves, M.D., at Poudre Valley Health System, Family Medicine Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Webb presented several concerns. AR 479.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   She has a history of Chiari 1 malformations and as a result, often has headaches associated with dizziness. She has been evaluated by a neurosurgeon but is NOT interested in surgery currently. The headaches sometimes go away with Excedrin, but sometimes she needs to go home and sleep it off. She is asking that I fill out FMLA [Family Medical Leave Act] paperwork today so that they cannot fire her for her medical condition. She states that currently she has headaches that are bad enough to go home 2-4 times a month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   AR 480.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Dr. Steves noted the history of recent ankle surgery and the patient's report, \"She is having a lot of nerve pain so they are going to be doing an EMG soon.\" AR 480. Webb reported mood swings, \"feels like her mood can go from happy to tearful with no explanation,\" although she denied depression or anxiety and was not interested in counseling. She did not have a history of psychiatric diagnosis and had never been on a psychotropic medication. AR 480. She was interested in quitting smoking. AR 480.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Dr. Steves recorded medical history of morbid obesity, Chiari 1 malformation diagnosed after the delivery of her last child. The patient had been pregnant three times and had three normal vaginal deliveries. AR 480. She was married, employed, drank alcohol occasionally and smoked 15-20 cigarettes a day. AR 480.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   On review of systems Webb complained of headache and left leg paresthesias, and mood changes. AR 480. Webb denied abnormal gait, muscle aches and stiffness, anxiety, decreased concentration, and depression. AR 480-481. Dr. Steves reported (relevant) examination findings: full affect, cooperative and oriented, grossly normal mental status, mild swelling around the left ankle joint, normal upper extremity reflexes, normal lower extremity reflexes, appropriate range of motion and strength in upper and lower extremities, intact cerebellar finger-to-nose test and intact rapid alternating movements, 5/5 motor strength throughout and intact sensation, and narrow-based gait. AR 481. Dr. Steves' assessment was tobacco dependence syndrome, history of Chiari 1 malformation with resultant headaches, left ankle surgery 2012, and mood swings. AR 482. The treatment plan: Bupropion (Wellbutrin ) for tobacco cessation; mood swings (patient declines counseling), and possible weight loss. Dr. Steves filled out FMLA paperwork for the patient. AR 482.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   On July 31, 2012, Dr. Jackson recorded the patient's complaint of cramping and now pain and numbness from the knee down, laterally. AR 396. When she had this symptom before, a Doppler was negative for DVT. She was not working currently. On exam she had some tenderness around the leg. It was not any more swollen than the opposite side. Dr. Jackson could not reproduce the cramp. Straight leg raise was negative, distal strength was good (eversion, inversion, dorsiflexion and plantar flexion), and reflexes were normal. Dr. Jackson discussed the treatment plan: \"We know she does have a Chiari malformation. I am not so sure that has much influence on it.... She has not had this problem before, except after her injury and subsequently surgery.\" Dr. Jackson recommended EMG and NCV studies. AR 396.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   On August 15, 2012, Dr. O'Toole reported Dr. Rebekah Martin's findings on August 7: significant for electrodiagnostic evidence of peroneal mononeuropathy, both demyelinating and axonal. There was evidence of reinnervation. There was no electrodiagnostic evidence of a lumbar or lumbosacral source of symptoms. AR 421. Dr. O'Toole reported Dr. Martin's statement that she felt the prognosis was excellent. She recommended application of cold several times a day to the peroneal head region, physical therapy with local iontophoresis and dorsiflexion strengthening, and weaning from the ankle brace, which Webb had already done. Webb still complained of painful cramping, pain level 5-6/10. She took Bupropion. AR 421. Her blood pressure was 146/100, and she had palpable cramping in the calf, with reports of tenderness to palpation and pins-and-needles sensation after compressing the lateral lower leg just inferior to the fibular head. AR 421-22. She had persistent 5- strength for great toe extension and ankle plantar flexion. AR 422. Dr. O'Toole referred her to PT and prescribed topical Gabapentin to apply around the fibular head 3-4 times daily. AR 422.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   On August 23, 2012, Mr. Braunlin reported what Webb told him. She had had continued pain and paresthesia and left leg and cramping. She saw Dr. Martin. Since taking off her ankle brace \"per Dr. Martin,\" she has improved. Her pain and cramping were less. She was having only three cramping episodes per days and was able to walk more. Paresthesias continued in her left lateral shin. AR 419. Objectively her gait was much less antalgic, and she went down stairs with improved dorsiflexion with weight bearing. This was still painful, however. She was able to heel walk with slightly less dorsiflexion on the left compared to the right. She was able to go up on her toes, although it was very weak and she put more pressure on her\n   right foot. She continued to have tenderness with passive ROM in the left ankle, especially dorsiflexion. AR 419. Mr. Braunlin designed a home exercise program and she demonstrated the calf-stretching exercises well, although she had 50 percent loss of range of motion when demonstrating these. AR 419-20. \"We will continue to focus on [balance], although I recognize she has a Chiari I malformation and will never have perfect balance.\" AR 420. Assessment was improved pain, improved function, positive nerve conduction/EMG testing per Dr. Martin. AR 420. Mr. Braunlin prescribed particular stretches and icing and said that Webb would be seen weekly for three more weeks. AR 420.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   On August 28, 2012, Dr. Jackson completed a report of Workers Compensation injury identifying June 13, 2011, as the date of a left ankle injury. AR 393.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   On August 30, 2012, Dr. O'Toole wrote a \"closing note impairment rating.\" He stated that working status was restricted. AR 415. Webb noted improvement from discontinuing ankle brace. AR 416. He reported the August 7 specific electrodiagnostic test results. AR 415.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   On exam, Webb's blood pressure was 152/84, pulse 96, and pain level 4 \u00bd/10. AR 416. Gait was nonantalgic. She had difficulty descending stairs. She had an area of decreased sensation over the lateral malleolus. She had 4+/5 great toe extension and dorsiflexion strength. Heel walk was difficult. AR 416. Dr. O'Toole referred to the\n   <em>\n    AMA Guides to Evaluation of Permanent Impairment\n   </em>\n   . \"Her best measurements were with 45 degrees of knee flexion. There her dorsiflexion was to 0 degrees at the neutral position and plantar flexion to 60 degrees. Inversion was 25 degrees, eversion 10 degrees. He assessed left peroneal mononeuropathy with both sensory and motor effect. AR 416. He completed \"closing form M164\" and \"made Miss Webb's temporary restrictions permanent. These are avoiding stairs and walking as tolerated.\" AR 417. Dr. O'Toole stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   Permanent impairment is assigned in accordance with the AMA Guides to\n   <em>\n    Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 3rd Edition (revised)\n   </em>\n   . Based on the active range of motion measurements the dorsiflexion at 0 degrees past neutral results in a 7% lower extremity impairment.... With inversion at 25 degrees, she receives a 1% lower extremity impairment. Eversion to 10 degrees results in a 2% impairment. The total active range of motion impairment is 10% lower extremity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   For peripheral nervous system impairment under table 51 involvement of the common peroneal nerve, under sensory the maximum impairment is 5%.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   Because this limits activity, I have assigned a 50% correction from table 10. This results in a 3% impairment. For motor impairment, the maximum assignment is 35%. Applying table 11, she has range of motion against gravity and some resistance, so I have applied 25% which results in a 9% lower extremity impairment. The combined value for peripheral nervous system impairment is then 9%. Combining this with the active range of motion impairment results in a 21% lower extremity impairment.... The total lower extremity impairment is 21% converted to a whole person impairment of 8%.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   Further follow-up is as needed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   AR 417.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   On August 30, 2012, Dr. Jackson saw Webb.

He assessed left lower leg cramping and suggested adding nerve-stabilizing agents like Lyrica or Cymbalta, and provided samples of Lyrica. He stated that he thought most of her symptoms were \"somewhat nerve related.\" Therefore, Dr. Martin could consider a sympathetic blockade since her symptoms were consistent with someone who might be developing a complex regional pain syndrome.

He noted her original injury was June 20, 2011, with surgery on March 7, 2012, and postoperative complications of \"left calf cramping, which was disabling, which began around July, and persistent left ankle and foot pain and paresthesia, and there was electromyographic evidence of peroneal mononeuropathy.\" AR 409. Mr. Braunlin reported Webb's statement that she had \"plateaued with progress and admits not being consistent with her home exercise program, especially in the last week.\" She reported that she continued to have trouble going up and down stairs and had limited walking. \"She is able to walk approximately 15 minutes.... She is very careful on uneven surfaces, she will use her brace, which she stopped wearing due to the possibility this was causing some of her neuropathy. Since she stopped wearing the brace, her ... paresthesias improved; however, even in the grocery store she can tell her ankle will tend to roll.\" Objectively the patient had a fairly normal non-antalgic gait and still had obvious discomfort, \"very slow and careful,\" going up and down stairs one step at a time. AR 409. Her active and passive range of motion was within normal limits. Mr. Braunlin noted that Dr. Jackson had noted subtle instability after surgery. AR 409. She had 5/5 strength but had pain going up on her toes and heels. AR 409-10. They discussed her home exercise program. AR 410. They discussed her smoking.

She stated that smoking helped her headaches because it evened things out by lowering her BP or something, which seems to alleviate her headaches. She wants to quit smoking for her Suppurativa, but it helps her headaches and she smoked 3/4 pack per day. AR 472. Wellbutrin had not helped smoking; she said it magnified her anxiety about a thousand fold and she couldn't function.

The lab reported low Potassium, total bilirubin, and AST, and high triglycerides. AR 491.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   On May 29, 2013, Poudre Valley Imaging reported findings on an MRI of the brain. AR 485. This was compared with a brain MRI dated October 22, 2003 and a head CT dated August 3, 2010. The cerebellar tonsils remained low, 7 mm. below the level of the foramen magnum, and were pointed in shape. Compared to the prior exam, when the tonsils were 6 mm. below the foramen magnum, this was a minimal change. AR 485. There was no evidence of acute infarct, hemorrhage, or mass lesion. AR 486.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   On July 2, 2013, Anne Voorhes, physician assistant at Colorado Health medical Group Pulmonology, reported an evaluation preliminary to sleep study. AR 553-55. The patient was 40 and had been referred by Dr. Steves. AR 553. Her chief complaint was fatigue that had become worse in the past six months. Her sleep pattern was variable: she went to bed as early as 10:30 p.m. or as late as 4 a.m. Her\n   preferred bedtime was 3-4 a.m. If she did not fall asleep, she got out of bed and read until she was drowsy. She averaged 6-10 hours of sleep at night and often napped 2-4 hours during the day. AR 553. Her husband was with her and reported that her legs moved at night. The patient was unaware of this but reported that her legs ached in the evening. Her husband said she snored. The patient slept on her side and avoided sleeping in a supine position due to hip pain. Both husband and patient agreed that she had memory problems. The patient described poor focus and concentration. She had a history of night shift work that worked well with her preferred sleep schedule. AR 553.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   On the Epworth Sleepiness Scale the patient reported that she had a high chance of dozing or falling asleep when sitting and reading, watching tv, or lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permitted this. AR 553. She reported she would never doze while sitting and talking to someone and had only a slight chance of dozing while sitting inactive in a public place, sitting as a passenger in a car for an hour, and sitting quietly after lunch without alcohol. AR 553. Ms. Voorhes noted the medical history of hidradenitis suppurativa, mild single episode of major depression, morbid obesity, and vitamin D deficiency (but not Chiari malformation ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   On the review of systems, the patient endorsed lower extremity edema, constipation, diarrhea, arthralgias, and joint pain. AR 554. Objectively her BMI was 45.86, blood pressure 142/92, and O2 saturation 93. AR 554. Review of systems was negative for mood or personality changes, joint and limb swelling, and joint stiffness. AR 554. On exam, Ms. Voorhes described a morbidly obese female in mild pain due to headache, with a \"mallampati class III\" airway, thick neck, clear lungs, regular heart rate and rhythm, no pitting lower extremity edema, normal gait, and normal affect and mood. AR 555. She assessed fatigue, snoring, headache, and delayed nonorganic circadian rhythm sleep disorder. There was strong suspicion for sleep apnea based on snoring, headache, memory and concentration impairment, and fatigue. AR 555. Risk factors included body habitus, crowded posterior oropharynx, and positive family history. Insomnia and delayed circadian rhythm disorder could be contributing to fatigue. As for headache, there was known Chiari malformation, and underlying sleep apnea could be contributing as well. AR 555.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   On August 13, 2013, Webb saw Kevin Tool, M.D., at the Women'sClinic of Northern Colorado, to discuss a hysterectomy.

She had had pregnancies and normal deliveries in 1998, 2000, and 2003. AR 556. On review of symptoms, Webb endorsed bilateral vision loss, irritability and/or mood swings before periods, bloating and/or swelling before periods, emotional outbursts and/or memory loss before or during periods. AR 557. Neuropsychiatric ROS was positive for headaches. \"Psychiatric/Emotional Evaluation patient is anxious, in depressed moods.\" AR 557. Musculoskeletal ROS was negative for joint, back, or muscle pain. AR 557. Physical examination showed extremities were normal with no edema, varicosities, arthritic deformity, or tenderness. AR 557. Neurological assessment was normal. AR 557. Dr. Tool reported examination findings. \"Based on ACOG FMI standards the patient's build is classified as extreme Obesity -Class III.\" AR 557. The gynecological examination was unremarkable other than an anteverted uterus. AR 557-58. Dr. Tool assessed menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and hidradenitis suppurativa. He recommended \"embx in office or in OR.\" He discussed\n   options: OCP, Mirena, Ablation, RTC mctrin [sic], Lysteda, and finally hysterectomy, which has the highest risk. \"Will schedule an office embx and Mirena. She will call if she decides on an ablation.\" AR 558.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   On August 28, 2013, Kerry Kamer, D.O., reported a consultative disability examination. AR 570-76. Dr. Kamer noted that she arrived as a passenger in her husband's vehicle and he accompanied her during the evaluation. AR 570. Dr. Kamer said the history of present illness was somewhat vague and that the patient was unable to provide more detailed information about her history of care. AR 570. According to the patient she was diagnosed with a Chiari I malformation after a 2003 brain MRI. \"She was being evaluated for complaints of imbalance, dropping things, dizziness, and headaches.\" She saw a neurologist and neurosurgeon who told her she could \"have surgery or not,\" some type of \"decompression.\" AR 570. She decided not to, had a repeat brain MRI two months ago and was told the findings were stable. \"She complains of imbalance, dizziness, gait disturbance, she drops things, she has memory problems, problems with her vision and depth perception, and she constantly has sudden headaches.\" AR 570. She was diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2004 and had not been evaluated by a dermatologist. \"She has taken care of the condition on her own. She does currently have some draining lesions in her underarms, beneath her breasts, and in her groin.\" AR 571. She was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in 2013, was given a medication that did not help, and was not referred for a mental health evaluation. She complained of agoraphobia, and disliked being around people.

Skin examination showed\n   diffuse erythematous pustules over left and right subaxillary areas, beneath left and right breasts, and the left groin, with \"scant clear and no purulent discharge\" [sic] and no signs of abscesses or cellulitis. \"These skin lesions are not likely to impact her functional capabilities.\" AR 573. Extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing, varicosities, lower extremity edema, weakness, or atrophy. AR 573.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Dr. Kamer reported no remarkable findings in the examination of head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, chest and lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, pulses, and extremities. AR 573. Dr. Kamer stated that she was able to perform finger-nose, heel-knee, and that Romberg was absent. He stated that ambulation did not appear ataxic or antalgic, that Webb was able to stand and walk on heels and toes, and had a \"full deep squat.\" AR 574. She did not use an assistive device. Range of motion was reported for cervical spine, dorsolumbar spine, hip joints, and knee joints; ankle, shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. AR 574. He stated that these were all normal and caused no discernible discomfort. Dr. Kamer reported that the Fabere test caused hip pain bilaterally and Milgram's caused low back pain. AR 574. Straight leg tests were negative. AR 574. Dr. Kamer reported ranges of motion of finger and thumb joints, and she stated they were all normal range and without discernible discomfort. AR 575. Dr. Kamer reported a spine examination without tenderness to palpation. AR 575. Neurological exam was normal. AR 575.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Dr. Kamer reported a brief mental status survey: pleasant, cooperative, no acute distress. AR 575. Attention and concentration appeared sufficient. She appeared oriented and was able to recall the day of the week, the year, and the state. Simple arithmetic questions revealed average simple mathematical skills. Fund of knowledge was average based on the stated level of education. Memory was average for recent and remote events. Five-minute recall of five random objects was \"average.\" She had \"average ability to think abstractly. A test of reversing multiple digit number was attempted and the results were average.\" She could draw a clock showing the time, identified geometric figures and relative sizes, and recalled an average degree of detail after being read a short story. Insight into illness suggested an average perception of illness. \"Observations of judgment are average ability to come to appropriate conclusions.\" AR 575. Findings appeared to suggest no significant neurocognitive deficiency.

There were no manipulative limitations. AR 576. No assistive device was recommended. AR 576. Based on her neurological condition and intermittent instability workplace limitations (such as working at heights, climbing ladders, operating heavy or dangerous machinery) \"may be prudent.\" AR 576.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   On September 5, 2013, Dr. Steves reported, \"Patient has not followed up with a neurologist secondary to cost concerns.\" Dr. Steves filled out FMLA paperwork and encouraged her to follow up with a neurologist after she moved to South Dakota. AR 577. Dr. Steves recorded that anxiety was not well controlled on current medication, that Webb had social anxiety and agoraphobia that was better on Celexa but not ideal. Webb wanted to get back on Wellbutrin since it seemed to help in the past. The patient had had a sleep study test and needed a CPAP but had not gotten the machine titrated. AR 577. Dr. Steves discussed with Webb that she should do this before she leaves or get\n   records transferred so she could take care of it in South Dakota. AR 577. She had left breast cellulitis secondary to infected hidradenitis and would be given Keflex. AR 577. Dr. Steves discussed the benign nature of positional vertigo and gave Webb an Epley maneuver handout. AR 577. Examination showed normal mood, affect, and behavior. AR 578.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   On September 6, 2013, Webb returned to CHMG Pulmonary to review findings of her August 1 sleep study.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   This revealed severe obstructive sleep apnea with an AHI of 37/hr and average oxygen saturation of 87%. Frequent leg movements. CPAP and BIPAP were both tried. She did not tolerate CPAP well and did best on BIPAP at 14/8 c. Leg movements resolved and oxygen saturation improved to 89% on CPAP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   AR 580.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Review of systems was positive for shortness of breath, cough, heartburn, arthralgias, joint pain, joint stiffness, limb swelling, skin lesion, skin wound, dizziness, and anxiety.

AR 581. Ms. Voorhes noted, \"She is moving to South Dakota this weekend.\" AR 580. Ms. Voorhes said she would provide a prescription for the appropriate BIPAP setting and that Webb would need to establish with a sleep specialist in South Dakota to initiate treatment. AR 581.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   On October 25, 2013, Webb saw Michael Hogue, M.D., at Regional Health Physicians in Sturgis. AR 687. She was there to get established and discuss her headaches and medications. She told Dr. Hogue that she had Chiari I malformation and a recent diagnosis of sleep apnea. She said she got a prescription for a CPAP from her pulmonologist before she left Ft. Collins but had not had a chance to pick it up. She had a history of appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and left ankle ligament reconstruction. AR 687. She was morbidly obese. She wanted to know if she should take Salsalate with Celexa and her Albuterol inhaler and someone told her they interacted. \"I have no idea and I have never seen an interaction with these in the past.\" AR 687. She also wanted to know what to do for her headaches \"although it is pretty clear ... she did have a positive sleep apnea study.\" AR 687.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Dr. Hogue reported an unremarkable examination other than morbid obesity. AR 688-89. She ambulated normally with no limping ; was oriented; had normal mood, affect, and speech; and demonstrated good judgment. AR 688. Neurological examination showed normal gait, station, and balance. AR 689. He assessed: carbuncle, sleep apnea, headache, obesity, and Chiari malformation. AR 689. Dr. Hogue planned to get her records from the Poudre Valley clinics. He said he would put her sleep apnea high on the list as a cause of her headache. AR 689. \"We checked with the local DME and they will not accept the prescription [presumably for BIPAP] from Colorado; however, if she has got an abnormal test they will accept a prescription from me.... [I]f we can verify this I will go ahead and write her that prescription. If we cannot verify this information, I want to send her to pulmonary and have her evaluated there and they can determine whether or not a different sleep test is needed.\" AR 689. In the meantime, he said they would wait until they get her started on the CPAP and see what that does for the headaches. AR 689.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   The laboratory reported a Westergren sedimentation rate within normal range and a normal basic metabolic panel except for low calcium. AR 690.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   On November 19, 2013, Webb saw Dr. Hogue at Regional Health Physicians in\n   Sturgis. She reported that she was still having problems with headaches. Dr. Hogue stated that he had reviewed her records from Colorado and that her MRI confirmed a Chiari 1 malformation. \"It does not appear that this is any accelerated from what it was previously; however, as I explained to her, I am not an expert in this area. She needs to follow with the neurologist who knows something about this.... We also did get a copy of her sleep apnea study and she does have some fairly severe symptoms.\" AR 684. Dr. Hogue recorded, \"She also has some increasing anxiety of late and wonders about how to approach this.\" AR 684. Dr. Hogue's assessment was: headache, Chiari malformation, history of kidney disease, anxiety, and arthritis. He ordered laboratory study of erythrocyte sedimentation rate. AR 685. He discussed the treatment plan: get a neurologist to at least look at her and render an opinion and with her history of sleep apnea, she would see Dr. Rob Finley. With the history she gave of kidney scarring, he would order a basic metabolic panel. For headaches he would try switching Salsalate to Indomethacin because Webb stated that Salsalate gave good relief for a long time but less so now. \"I think part of this [is] maybe her sleep apnea and so she absolutely needs to get this addressed.\" AR 685. For anxiety, Dr. Hogue said he would try Hydroxyzine in addition to her current medicines. \"I think the patient did seem a little frustrated that she had some other issues to address. She has scheduled herself for a 20-minute appointment and basically came in with a laundry list....\" AR 685. Dr. Hogue reported his physical examination, which was negative except for morbid obesity. AR 686.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   On this date, the patient called to say that her script for a BIPAP was older than one month so Regional Home Medical would not accept it. She wondered if Dr. Hogue would write a new script for her \"bi-pap 14/8 with heated humidity, smart card, and mask of choice and send to DME here.\" AR 700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   On January 6, 2014, Webb saw Suzanne Harris, M.D., at Regional Health Physicians in Sturgis, for sore throat, cough, chest congestion, laryngitis, right-ear hearing loss, and sinus pain and pressure. She also needed a refill of Celexa. AR 639. She was accompanied by several of her children. AR 640. Dr. Harris assessed acute bronchitis and anxiety. AR 642. This would be treated with antibiotics. AR 642.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   On January 13, 2014, Webb saw Lori Fritz, C.N.P. at Regional Health Physicians in Sturgis for upper respiratory problems, \"coughing constantly\" over two weeks. AR 636. She appeared acutely ill, no acute distress, and ambulated normally. AR 638. Ms. Fritz assessed bronchitis and tobacco user. AR 639. She planned to try a higher burst of Prednisone and Levaquin, with Cheratussin for cough at night. She advised to patient to quit smoking. AR 639.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   On February 14, 2014, Webb saw Dr. Hogue to refill medications. She complained of pain in her forearms and numbness and tingling into her hands, and right knee pain. She had not filled a prescription for Indomethacin because, she said, this did nothing for the pain she had been seen for in the past. She was told that Dr. Hogue did not prescribe narcotic pain medications. Dr. Arban completed the \"HPI.\" The patient had pain in her elbows and wrists. The lateral epicondylitis in both arms were the locations of elbow pain. It was worse on the right and she was right-handed. The pain was a burning-type pain, especially when she moved her hands. \"Her job is basically operating keyboard and 10-key entry.\" AR 633. Her second problem was \"increasing problems with numbness in her fingers. She notices this mostly on the palmar side and says it is hitting all 5 fingers including the\n   thumb.\" She said she did not do much freeway driving in Colorado, but she had been going back and forth to Rapid City periodically. \"She notices that if she just hangs her hands on the steering wheel it does not seem to be a problem, but if she tries gripping the steering wheel she gets numbness....\" AR 633.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Webb was accompanied by her spouse. Examination showed tenderness over the lateral epicondyles bilaterally, right greater than left. \"Pain shoots down arm. Exacerbated with wrist motion.... Tinel's and Phalen's both positive however sx go only into the middle and ring fingers....\" A wrist splint was ordered, and Salsalate. Dr. Hogue stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   She clearly has some mild lateral epicondylitis. It does seem worse on the right than on the left and flexion and extension in her wrists causes it to increase. We talked about carpal tunnel splints to see how this would help.... [S]he got a burning sensation in her wrist when I did the Tinel's... She did have pain in her wrists when I retried to test Phalen's. It is a little bit of a bizarre response, but I think these may be positive. We had discussed the fact that she had been on Salsalate for chiari malformation symptoms and that one always seemed to work the best. She did not realize that she could take 3000 mg a day so what I told her to do is to go back to the 750 mg. tablets and take 1 or 2 b.i.d. to see how she responded....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   AR 636.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   If this did not work, they would discuss injections and nerve conduction studies.

AR 635.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   On February 27, 2014, Webb saw Dr. Arban for a respiratory infection. She had gone through two courses of antibiotics, which helped but symptoms never completely went away, and two days ago, she started coming down with the same thing, symptoms of which were a cough, plugged sinuses, phlegm, body aches, and fevers. AR 630. The patient was a smoker. She reported coughing without remission, using Albuterol, and reported that she had reduced her smoking to a few a day. AR 630. Dr. Arban stated that she was accompanied by her spouse and teen-aged son. AR 632. Clinic exam was unremarkable other than Dr. Arban's observation that Webb was morbidly obese, had nasal discharge and rhonchi that cleared with coughing. Dr. Arban said that her wheezing required hand-held nebulizer treatment. After treatment, she had clearing of wheezes and rhonchi. The patient's peak-flow, pre- and post-nebulizer, was 250 L/min. Normal for her age, sex and height was 349. Post peak flow was 325 L/min. Assessment was bronchitis. Dr. Arban prescribed Vicodin and Ventolin. AR 632. He also prescribed Symbicort. AR 633. For her diagnosis of acute sinusitis, he prescribed Augmentin. He noted that a chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia. AR 633. Webb was not quite ready to quit smoking as far as Dr. Arban could tell.

AR 626. Dr. Hogue stated that he started treating her after she moved from Colorado. She had a history of Chiari 1 malformations, and on and off throughout her life had some fairly significant headaches that waxed and waned. \"She can get them pretty severely sometimes and get a pretty good run of these.\" AR 626.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Second, she had hidradenitis suppurative, which she had learned to control fairly well using a particular body wash and\n   antibacterial soap three times a day. She wore loose-fitting clothing and did not wear a brassiere. \"Most of her issues are under her breasts and in her axilla. I have never seen her for this.\" AR 626.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Third, she had been diagnosed \"by her doctor back home\" with social anxiety disorder. She had worked at a credit card center and started developing severe anxiety. \"It got to the point where she could [not] go to work when there were large crowds around and basically that was the whole function in the call center. She now operates such that she will get up early in the morning and go shopping right when the stores open before there is any kind of crowd and she will have to leave when a big crowd comes along. She avoids stores such as Walmart, Target.... She worked with her physician in Colorado. She got on [a] number of different medicines that she was trying to help get this to settle down.\" AR626. Her combination of Citalopram 40 mg., Wellbutrin SR 150 mg., twice a day, and Hydroxyzine helped to control her symptoms fairly well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"She has some chronic ankle pain from an injury where she disrupted ligaments and apparently has some nerve damage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   She still smoked occasionally.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Dr. Hogue summarized Webb's problem list, past medical and surgical history, allergies and medications, family and social history.

AR 622. She was concerned about a continued cough. AR 623. This had started in December 2013 and had been on and off. She had been on Levaquin, Augmentin, Cephalexin, and another medication and they did not seem to help because the cough came back. She had also been on \"a little bit of prednisone here and there.\" She also had Chiari malformation with an appointment with Dr Finley in May. Until then she wanted something for her headaches as they seemed to be getting quite a bit worse.

On examination she was morbidly obese and clinical examination was otherwise unremarkable. AR 625. She had no anxiety, stress, depression, irritability or sleep disturbances. AR 625. She had no muscle aches, weakness, or back pain, or\n   extremity swelling. AR 625. Ms. Carlson ordered Tramadol, Symbicort, Depo-Medrol, Zithromax, and Prednisone to treat acute bronchitis, fever and headache. AR 625.

Webb described her headaches as starting over the posterior head and then coming to the area between her ears. She had been using Salsalate to control the headaches. On this day, she denied any headache associated symptoms like vision changes, etc. AR 620.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Dr. Harris ordered an Ativan injection. AR 622. She explained that she was reluctant to use narcotic medication because it could cause a rebound headache, and Webb had been in the ER recently and was given Demerol and Phenergan, which could lead to a rebound headache. \"Initially wanted [to] use Toradol, but she has been using Salsalate quite a bit and has already taken quite a bit of that already today.\" Dr. Harris said \"certainly she could also have chronic daily headaches from medication overuse.\" AR. 622. Dr. Harris advised Webb to keep a headache diary and record how much pain medication she used.

She had been on prophylactic salicylate which were controlling it probably 75% to 90%, but she was still having some breakthrough so they switched her to indomethacin and she has totally lost control of the headache now, rates it a 9/10. Denies typical symptoms suggestive of migraine. She does have an upcoming appointment with Dr. Finley next week for further evaluation. The last time she was in the ED was March 27, seen by Dr. Hermann.... She received an injection of Demerol and Phenergan, which helped considerably.

AR 610-14 (duplicate at AR 678-82). The chief complaint was Chiari malformation. The problem list included obesity, anxiety, headache, migraine without aura, sinusitis, bronchitis, carbuncle, arthritis, lateral epicondylitis, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and numbness of hand. AR 610. The patient was on medications: Citalopram 40 mg. Headache Relief 1000 mg., Hydroxyzine 25 mg., Salsalate\n   750 mg., Symbicort inhaler, Ventolin inhaler, Topamax 25 mg., and Welbutrin SR 150 mg. AR 610.

She was 340 pounds and five feet seven inches tall. AR 611. She was accompanied by her husband. AR 611. Dr. Finley recorded relevant history. AR 611-12. In 2003 she was evaluated for problems that included dizziness and intermittent trouble with fine motor control, balance trouble, intermittent nystagmus, and trouble with headaches. Chiari malformation was discovered. \"She actually has always had trouble with headaches. She has poor balance and had poor balance at the time that the Chiari 1 malformation was discovered.\" AR 611. She had been treated for migraine at age 11 or 12 in Ft. Collins \"and that was not overly successful.\" AR 612. In 2003 she was seen by a neurologist and then referred to a neurosurgeon. According to Webb, both doctors felt she needed surgery. However, due to a number of factors in her personal life, she did not want surgery. She was told there were no other options so she did not maintain follow-up with neurology or neurosurgery and just \"dealt with it.\" AR 612.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Dr. Finley recorded Webb's history that about a year ago, she was having problems with a back injury and was put on Salsalate. \"[R]emarkably to her, that actually helped her headaches,\" and she continued to use Salsalate. After she moved to the Rapid City area, she continued to use Salsalate. For a while, she was tried on Indocin but that did not benefit her. She tried it twice and went back to Salsalate. AR 612. \"Her headaches are manageable as long as she does not strain or do a lot of activity. Unfortunately, she has to be active to some point and therefore the headaches do flare up at times. She does have some coordination trouble and may stumble at times or may veer off to one side or the other.\" She was not sure she wanted to revisit the surgery issue but noted that the headaches at times were debilitating. \"When they occur, she seems to lose her train of thought and is very scatter brained.\" She took a combination of Tylenol, aspirin, and caffeine up to 8 a day. She took up to 100 mg. of Tylenol at times for her headaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Dr. Finley recorded that Webb had recently been diagnosed with sleep apnea, was to be put on BIPAP, but did not have a machine yet. AR 612. She snored, had apnea, was not rested in the morning, had excessive daytime somnolence, and her legs moved all night long. AR 612. She had a slight headache when she got up in the morning, that would get a little better, then recur around 1 p.m., and \"she has to take something or it gets real bad for 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon. If it gets too bad then the patient, despite taking medication, can't really get on top of the pain.\" AR 612. Her husband said her worst headaches were around 3:00 in the morning. AR 612. Some headaches were worse with light, but sound did not bother her. \"She does feel that she is depressed,\" and said she did well on Wellbutrin and Celexa, with Hydroxyzine p.r.n. AR 612. She did not necessarily feel she had to take the hydroxyzine on a regular basis. AR 612.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Dr. Finley's review of systems was positive (indicated by boldfaced items in the list) for exercise intolerance, snoring, apnea, blurred vision, dizziness, dry mouth, dysphagia, menorrhagia, muscle aches and weakness, arthralgias/joint pain and morning stiffness, dizziness, weakness, and frequent or severe headaches, anxiety, stress, sadness/depressed mood and sleep disturbances, and tremor.

She was oriented and she had intact recent and remote memory and fund of knowledge. Attention span, concentration, receptive and expressive language were normal; and she had appropriate mood and affect. AR 613. Dr. Finley's cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. AR 613. Dr. Finley's motor exam was normal for range of motion and strength. Webb had full range of motion in both ankles. AR 613. Dr. Finley reported all reflexes normal; he reported normal motor coordination, sensation, gait, posture, stability, heel walk, tandem gait, and mobility. AR 613. She ambulated independently. AR 613.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Dr. Finley assessed \"known history of Chiari 1 malformation with a multitude of neurologic symptomatology potentially related to that. This was initially evaluated back in 2003 and the patient declined surgical intervention.\" AR 613. Dr. Finley assessed increasing problems with headache symptomatology, some of which may be related to her Chiari abnormality and some of which may have some sort of vascular component or musculoligamentous or tension type etiology, and further evaluation and attempts at treatment were indicated. AR 613. She had known obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and her worst headaches, which are around 3 a.m., were potentially related to that. Certainly, treatment for OSA was indicated. AR 613.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   She had difficulty with periodic limb movement symptomatology. She had depression and was on medication for it. She had a remote but not real active migraine headache problem. AR 613. She was having coordination difficulty with stumbling at times or veering to one side or the other which could be related to her Chiari malformation. AR 613-14. She had intermittent trouble coordinating her thoughts and was often scatter brained when headaches were bad. AR 614.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Dr. Finley formulated a treatment plan: Get her BIPAP machine and start on that, try Topamax, stay active, return in four months. \"We will try to review the patient's MRI scan.\" AR 614. Diagnoses were chiari malformation, headache, migraine without aura, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. AR 614.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   On July 10, 2014, Dr. Hogue saw Webb to discuss her antidepressants, side-effects from Topamax, and her hidradenitis. AR 616. Webb reported increased problems with moods swinging quite a bit. AR 616. She notes a family history of bipolar and said she seems to swing from mood to mood very quickly. When she gets irritable, she can snap off at people in the family pretty easily. We talked about different medications she has tried. I told her I have been very comfortable through the years with Lithium; it seems very smooth in terms of its ability to stabilize the mood. We can use it with Topamax ; we just have to watch the Lithium level pretty closely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also wonders if it is possible to see a dermatologist for her problems with hidradenitis. AR 616. Dr. Hogue noted, \"Very flat affect today.\" AR 618. She had normal mood, was oriented, and had good judgment. AR 618. She ambulated normally. AR 618. Dr. Hogue assessed hidradenitis, mood swings, and depressive disorder, and he prescribed Lithium, increasing to 900 mg. over the course of a week. AR 618. Dr. Hogue wanted to see the patient after two weeks to get a Lithium level and see how she was doing. AR 619.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   On September 8, 2014, Webb saw Christopher Gasbarre, D.O., in Spearfish, for her hidradenitis. AR 648-50. The HPI shows a report of painful nodule present\n   approximately three years in the left axilla. \"She does develop similar lesions on the breasts and in the bilateral axillae.\" The problem list was reviewed-obesity, mood swings, anxiety, depressive disorder, headache, migraine without aura, Chiari malformation, sinusitis, acute bronchitis and bronchitis, carbuncle, hidradenitis, arthritis, lateral epicondylitis, sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and numbness of hand. AR 648.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   The surgical history was reported as appendectomy, cholecystectomy, left ankle ligament reconstruction, and tubal ligation. AR 648. Medications were Doxycyline, Headache Relief OTC medication, Lithium 600 mg. a day, Salsalate, Topamax 75 mg. twice a day, ventolin inhaler, Wellbutrin 300 mg. a day, and Zyrtec. AR 649.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   Height and weight were recorded as five feet, seven inches, and 342 pounds. The physical examination report is mostly unreadable other than something affecting \"inframammary folds. There is also an inflamed papule on the left breast. There is an inflamed cystic nodule in the left axilla.\" AR 650. Treatment consisted of a Kenalog injection of \"1 hidradenitis\" and a prescription for Doxycycline 100 mg. twice a day for 30 days. AR 650. Dr. Gasbarre's discussion note is unreadable except for, \"I discussed treatment options with her, which would include continued topical antibacterial washes. I also discussed longterm use of tetracycline class antibiotics and I would recommend a trial of Doxycyline 100 mg. b.i.d ....\" AR 650. He recommended a Kenalog injection as a first approach. AR 650.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   On September 26, 2014, Webb saw Dr. Arban. AR 714. She complained of leg and foot cramps and restless leg. \"Wakes up exhausted.\" She wanted treatment for RLS. \"Headache mgmt by Dr. Finley, no changes overall but chronic problem aggravated by lack of sleep.\" AR 714. Exam was negative except for morbid obesity. Gait and station were normal. AR 717. Dr. Arban assessed restless legs syndrome, depressive disorder, and headache. AR 717. He discussed a trial of Ropinrole and discussed stretching and sleep hygiene. He continued Bupropion. He noted that the headache was treated by Dr. Finley. AR 717.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   On October 2, 2014, Dr. Finley reported a follow-up visit. AR 673. Chief complaint was headaches. AR 673. She stated that things went well for about three months. AR 675. The last one and one-half months she had had an increase in headaches, but not as severe as before. Head pain was \"7 out of 10 right now.\" AR 675. Dr. Finley reviewed the diagnoses and symptoms, Chiari malformation and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with (subjective) difficulty coordinating her thoughts and feeling scatter brained at times. AR 675. In addition she had clinical symptoms concerning for periodic limb movement disorder. She stated that overall she was doing all right. She thought Topamax 75 mg. twice a day actually worked fairly well for awhile but the benefit slowly reduced, although she still thought that the severity of her headaches was less as she continued to take Topamax. Recently she had a headache which, in the past, would have been really severe, but she was able to struggle through it, which prior to Topamax she would not have been able to do. AR 675. Dr. Finley noted that she had not been tried on a lot of other medications for her headaches. She had been on Amitriptyline for insomnia in the past and was not sure why the medication was stopped. AR 675.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   She noted having intermittent leg cramps from the knee region down, which used to be primarily on the left but now was in both legs. The calves could cramp or the toes curl under \"and she may have flexion of the foot area that is very problematic.\" AR 675.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   She noted some restless leg symptoms. Whenever she lay down to go to bed or watch a movie \"her feet will just seemingly automatically start rubbing against each other and this can be exhausting for her although she can stop it. If she sits up and rests quietly, then her legs do not necessarily feel the urge to move. She has been told by family members that her legs are going \"all the time\" when lying down and sleeping. She had significant sleep apnea but was unable to afford a BIPAP machine. \"She has also been told that her hand seems to shake a little bit,\" mostly on the right but it could happen bilaterally and once present lasted all day. \"It does impact her fine motor control at times\" and was likely more prominent when she was tired. AR 675. On the review of systems, Webb endorsed [ROS items that are boldfaced indicate items she endorsed; due to poor copy these are not clear]. AR 676.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   On exam she was morbidly obese and had a Mallampati score IV for narrowed posterior pharynx. AR 676. Dr. Finley reported a normal examination of cranial nerves, motor function, reflexes, coordination, and gait, posture and mobility. AR 676. Her attention and concentration were normal, memory was intact, and mood and affect were appropriate. AR 676. Dr. Finley assessed known history of headache symptomatology likely related to tension-type etiology and also to migrainous etiology, improved on Topamax, with benefit not quite as efficacious as it was initially. AR 676. He assessed history of OSA \"but she is not treating herself as she cannot afford her BIPAP machine.\" AR 676. Dr. Finley assessed probable restless leg syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder and gave her Requip.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   He assessed a history of depression, history of coordination difficulty and stumbling at times, Chiari 1 malformation, trouble in the past coordinating her thoughts and somewhat scatter brained when her headaches are real bad, and some history of mild tremor that came on recently. AR 677. Dr. Finley planned to try the patient on Pamelor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   She would likely transition onto Requip\"once we see how she is going to do on her nortriptyline.\" She would likely be tapered off Topamax once she got to a therapeutic range on Pamelor or nortriptyline. AR 677.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   Dr. Finley diagnosed headache, migraine without aura, Chiari malformation, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs, and tremor. AR 677.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   On October 29, 2014, Webb had an appointment with Dr. Arban. She told the clinic nurse that she was losing her Medicaid at the end of this week and was on some medication that she \"will not be able to quit cold turkey.\" She mainly had questions regarding her Lithium and Salsalate. She was \"under good control with prior meds.\" AR 711. Dr. Arban reviewed her problems: obesity, mood swings, anxiety, depressive disorder, restless legs, headache, migraine without aura, Chiari malformation, sinusitis, bronchitis, carbuncle, hidradenitis, arthritis, lateral epicondylitis, sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, tremor, and numbness of hand. AR 711. Dr. Arban spent most of the 25-plus minute visit discussing her conditions, medications, and management. AR 713. He prescribed a 90-day supply of Pamelor and Bupropion. AR 713-14. He discussed the headache treatment prescribed by Dr. Finley,\n   transitioning to Nortriptyline, and said he would assist the patient as this developed. AR 714.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   On March 16, 2015, Webb saw Dr. Arban for medication refills, a new referral to Dr. Finley, and an Ob-Gyn exam. AR 707. Dr. Arban reported an unremarkable physical examination other than obesity. AR 709-10. She was oriented, cooperative, and had normal mood and affect. AR 709. She had normal motor strength and gait and no skin rash. AR 710. He spent \"25-plus minutes with 50% or more in counseling and coordination of care regarding RLS, bipolar disorder, and chronic pain.\" AR 710. Dr. Arban assessed depressive disorder, headache, tobacco user, asthma, and arthritis. He replaced Bupropion SR with Bupropion XR \"as the morning dosing usually does not disturb sleep.\" He counseled Webb about [cigarette] reduction as an aid to eventual cessation of smoking. AR 710.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   On April 3, 2015, Lori Fritz, C.N.P., saw Webb for headache, cough, sore throat, and cold symptoms with body aches and lethargy for approximately a month. AR 704. On exam she was morbidly obese, had sinus tenderness and post nasal drip. AR 706. She had normal mental status. AR 706. Ms. Fritz prescribed Augmentin and a Prednisone burst and refilled Symbicort. AR 707.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   On April 13, 2015, Webb saw Dr. Finley for follow-up. AR 720. Her primary insurance was Medicaid. AR 720. She was accompanied by her husband. AR 722. \"She feels she is doing all right.\" AR 722. Dr. Finley reviewed her treatment plan: when last seen she was to be put on Pamelor and considered for transition to Requip, and was to be tapered off Topamax. She lost Medicaid in November and could not stay on her medications and ultimately went off Topamax and she could not tolerate the side-effects. She went on Nortriptyline but it caused nausea and dry mouth as she worked her way up to 50 mg. so she weaned off it in February. She really didn't feel it helped that much.

He stated that Webb had social anxiety disorder and that her ability to interact with the general public was fair; ability to maintain socially appropriate behavior and adhere to basic standards of neatness and cleanliness was good; and ability to travel in unfamiliar places and use public transportation was \"poor or none.\" AR 740. Asked to assess mental abilities and aptitudes needed to do any job, Dr. Hogue assessed \"poor or no\" ability to maintain regular attendance and be punctual, work in coordination with or proximity to others, complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms, and respond appropriately to changes in a routine work setting.

He listed the categories upon which medical disposition was based: Depression, Social Anxiety, and Agoraphobia. AR 655. He assessed the degree of limitations as \"None\" for all \"B\" criteria: restriction of ADLs; difficulties maintaining social functioning; difficulties maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace; and repeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration. AR 665. He opined that the \"C\" criteria were not met. AR 666. Dr. Houston referred to medical evidence from the Family Medicine Center, Dr. Finley, and Regional Medical Clinic. AR 667.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Dr. Houston opined that Webb's mental impairments did not affect her ability to understand, remember, and carry out instructions. AR 669. He opined that her impairments had no effect on her ability to interact appropriately with supervision, co-workers, and the public, or to respond to changes in the routine work setting. AR 670. He opined that no other capabilities were affected. AR 670.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   The ALJ called Ronald P. Houston, Ph.D., to provide forensic evidence. AR 64-66. Dr. Houston's curriculum vitae is at AR 214-19. Dr. Houston testified that he had been given \"Exhibits 1F through 25F\" to review, and some additional evidence, \"let's see what those are.\" AR 66-67. The ALJ stated that Dr. Houston had also been given Exhibits 27F and 28F.

He stated that the records showed affective and anxiety disorders. AR 68. Dr. Houston assessed \"mild\" restriction of activities of daily living; \"moderate\" difficulties maintaining social functioning; \"mild\" difficulties maintaining concentration, persistence or pace; and no episodes of decompensation of extended duration, defined as two weeks. AR 69. Dr. Houston opined that Webb was not completely unable to function independently outside of the home, so the \"C\" criteria (ref. 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1, Listing 12.00) were not established. AR 69. Dr. Houston stated, \"the depression is more secondary to the anxiety.\" AR 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   The ALJ turned Dr. Houston over to claimant's counsel, who asked Dr. Houston if he thought there were limitations in terms of interaction with others. AR 70. Dr. Houston responded, \"I don't really know what \"poor\" and \"none\" means. But I can say that given the social anxiety and the difficulty being around others and leaving the home ... it's going to create some level of anxiety in working around coworkers, the public, and supervisors.\" AR 70. The ALJ asked, \"if this individual were not required to have regular interactions with people, if they could go into work and ... greet people and then go to their work stations and work independently ... [w]ould they be experiencing these same limitations ...?\" to which Dr. Houston answered \"no.\" AR 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   On July 20, 2015, Barry Brown, the ALJ's vocational expert (credentials at AR 367-68), was asked to identify jobs that matched the hypothetical RFC presented by the ALJ: an individual able to lift 20 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds frequently; stand, walk, and sit \"all six hours in an eight-hour work day\" with normal breaks; with no limitations in the climbing of ramps and stairs; who could frequently balance and occasionally stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; could be exposed occasionally to unprotected heights or fastmoving machinery; and tolerate brief, casual interactions with coworkers and supervisors but not work with the public. AR 93. The ALJ said the individual could tolerate the supervisor giving them basic unskilled instructions, possibly 15, 20 minutes in the beginning, as the job was learned. AR 94. Mr. Brown identified light, unskilled jobs, specifically the job of merchandise marker, DOT 209.587-034, with 271,000 jobs in the United States, and \"some housekeeping cleaner jobs,\" DOT 323.687-014, with at least 136,000 jobs in the United States. AR 94. The VE was not asked and did not volunteer numbers of jobs in the region or several regions of the country. The VE said his testimony was consistent with the\n   <em>\n    Dictionary of Occupational Titles\n   </em>\n   . AR 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   In response to the ALJ's second hypothetical RFC, Mr. Brown opined that there were no matching jobs: sit, stand, and walk two hours in an eight-hour day, take a ten-minute break each hour or, alternatively, be absent three or more days a month. AR 95. In response to Webb's attorney's question, Mr. Brown opined that the employer-tolerated absenteeism threshold for an unskilled worker was one absence every month or every other month, between six and twelve days a year. AR 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The ALJ's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   The ALJ, Debra J. Denney, denied the claim on August 16, 2015. AR 43. Sequential evaluation findings were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Step one: The claimant had not engaged in substantial gainful activity (SGA) since August 15, 2012, the alleged onset date (AOD), and had not performed any work since the AOD. AR 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   Step two: Severe impairments were depression, anxiety, morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, Chiari I malformation, and hidradenitis suppurativa. AR 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   Non-severe impairments were asthma ; history of reconstructive surgery of the left ankle with post-surgical complications of cramping, pain, paresthesias, and EMG study revealing a resolving peroneal mononeuropathy, asymptomatic by September 2012 except for sensation at \"a few branches of the sural nerve;\" restless legs ; and mild bilateral lateral epicondylitis. AR 35. Conditions that were not medically determined were hip and lower back pain and longstanding knee problems alleged but not documented. AR 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   Step three: No impairment or combination of impairments met or medically equaled a listed impairment. AR 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   Residual functional capacity: Light work, frequently balance; occasionally stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; occasional exposure to unprotected heights and fast-moving machinery; would do best if allowed to work independently, but able to tolerate brief, casual interactions with coworkers and supervisors; and should not work with the public. AR 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   Step four: The claimant was unable to perform past relevant work (PRW) as a charge account clerk, order clerk, and cashier II. AR 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   Step five: The claimant's RFC matched the requirements of representative unskilled light occupations such as merchandise marker (271,000 positions in the U.S.) and housekeeping cleaner (136,000 positions in the U.S.). AR 42. These were significant numbers. AR 43.

Thus, the ALJ did not specifically find August 15, 2012, to be the disability onset date. The ALJ merely noted this was the \"alleged\" date of onset.

From March 7, 2012, to August 15, 2012, is a period of 5 months and 8 days, so it is less than the 6-month cut-off for unsuccessful work attempts.

She worked full time (4 10-hour days) at this job for an hourly wage of $9.25. AR316. Thus, for one week, Ms. Webb's gross pay would have been $370 at this job ($9.25 x 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   From the medical records, the court pieces together that Ms. Webb did not work from March 7, 2012, to April 11, 2012. AR401, 405, 431, 442. She was also off work from July 27, 2012, to August 15, 2012. AR421-22, 424. For the first two quarters of the year, then, Ms. Webb worked 21 weeks; 9.5 of these weeks occurred before March 7. If she was working full time from January 1 to March 6, Ms. Webb would have earned $3,515 (9.5 weeks x $370 weekly pay). Thus, of Ms. Webb's $6,412.67 earnings in the first two quarters of 2012, $2,897.67 were earned in the second quarter, that is, from April through June ($6,412.67 total first half earnings-$3,515 earnings from Jan. 1-March 6 = $2,897.67 earnings from April 12-June 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   Ms. Webb worked 11 weeks and 3 days (11.4 weeks) between April 12 and the end\n   of the second quarter (June). Her total earnings for this period, $2,897.67, divided by 11.4 weeks' work, equates to $1,016.72 per month (4 weeks). This is just narrowly above the $1,010 set by the Commissioner for SGA. It would appear that Ms. Webb did engage in SGA from April 11 to June 30, 2012. As explained next, she would have also met the requirements for SGA for the third quarter of 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   Ms. Webb worked approximately 5 weeks in the third quarter (July 1-26 and August 16-20), according to the information in the record.

The court notes that Ms. Webb stated in her Work History Report that she worked until September, 2012. AR315.

The state agency physicians gave short shrift to the Commissioner's own instructions about evaluating obesity as an impairment and they did not consider the combination of obesity, sleep apnea, and a left lower extremity impairment together. In any case, given the wide variety in which obese people carry their weight, the court is extremely skeptical that a nontreating nonexamining physician can\n   appropriately evaluate the impact obesity has on a claimant's functioning without physically seeing the claimant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   For example, when a claimant has a BMI of over 50, it begs credulity to conclude (as the state agency physicians did) the claimant can climb ropes, ladders and scaffolds at all. Even if the claimant could do these activities, how many workplaces have ropes, ladders and scaffolds designed to hold persons of such great weight? Moreover, such activity requires a degree of dexterity that those carrying extra flesh around their legs and abdomens likely could not perform. Not every person with a BMI of 50 carries their weight in the same place on the body, resulting in what could be significantly different functional limitations for different obese claimants. One person may have a pendulous abdomen that interferes with the ability to move her legs; another may have large legs that interfere with the ability to kneel, crouch and crawl; still another may have excess adipose tissue in their hands, interfering with the ability to manipulate with their hands and fingers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   Finally, the state agency physicians rightfully gave Dr. Kamer's opinion \"less weight\" because he failed to consider Ms. Webb's obesity at all when determining functional limitations. A consultative examination to determine the impact Ms. Webb's obesity has on her functioning is certainly warranted here because the records relied upon by the ALJ inadequately assess that issue. The court is not aware of any records from Ms. Webb's treating medical sources that specifically address the impact of her obesity on her functioning. Where a claimant has a consistent BMI over 40, the Commissioner has recognized this \"represents the greatest risk for developing obesity-related impairments.\"\n   <em>\n    Enderle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207606\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/7/928/#p934\">\n    7 F.Supp.3d at 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing SSR 02-1p).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   The court is cognizant of the fact that the regulations regarding consultative exams use the word \"may.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1517\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404.1519a.

Using this criteria from the Commissioner's listings, Dr. Houston concluded Ms. Webb's mental impairments of anxiety and depression imposed no functional limitations. AR667. As seen below, Dr. Houston revisited his opinions at the ALJ hearing and revised some of them. Dr. Houston reviewed only Ms. Webb's medical records in arriving at his opinions; he reviewed none of her own statements as to her symptoms, functioning, and activities.

AR741. He rated her ability \"poor or none\" in the following categories: maintaining regular attendance and punctuality; working in coordination with or proximity to others without being unduly distracted; complete a normal workday and week without interruptions from psychologically-based symptoms; and respond appropriately to changes in a routine work setting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Hogue opined Ms. Webb's mental impairments would cause her to miss work at least two days per month.

AR68. Dr. Houston testified Ms. Webb's mental conditions did not meet any of the listings of mental impairments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He testified to the PRTF and concluded under Paragraph B that Ms. Webb had mild restrictions in her activities of daily living; that she had moderate difficulty with social functioning; that she had mild difficulty maintaining concentration, persistence and pace; and that she had no episodes of decompensation. AR69. Thus, Dr. Houston testified Ms. Webb did not meet the Paragraph B criteria. As to Paragraph C, Dr. Houston testified Ms. Webb's impairments did not meet that criteria either.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   Dr. Houston testified Ms. Webb's social anxiety associated with being around others and leaving home would create some level of distress if she worked with the public, coworkers and supervisors. AR70. However, Dr. Houston testified Ms. Webb's mental impairments would impose no functional limitations in a work setting if she had a job where she just went into work and worked at a work station independently. AR71. The ALJ described Ms. Webb's mental RFC as follows: Ms. Webb would do best if allowed to work independently; she could tolerate brief, casual interaction with coworkers and supervisors;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   and she could not work with the public. AR36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   Based on Ms. Webb's vague arguments to the contrary, the court believes there was sufficient information in the administrative record to allow the ALJ to come to conclusions about the impact Ms. Webb's mental impairments had on her functioning. Although Dr. Houston did not listen to Ms. Webb's hearing testimony or review any of the questionnaires and reports she wrote describing her symptoms, functioning, and activities, the state agency physician\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   review these documents (though not the hearing testimony). The ALJ accorded \"significant\" weight to both Dr. Houston and the state agency physicians' opinions as to mental RFC. AR36. Therefore, the court will not order the ALJ to purchase a consultative exam as to Ms. Webb's mental functioning on remand. The ALJ, of course, is free to do so of her own accord should she believe such an exam is necessary to develop the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Consultative Exam as to Stage of Hidradenitis Suppurativa\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   Ms. Webb asserts that the court should issue an order requiring the ALJ to order a consultative exam to determine whether her skin condition (hidradenitis suppurativa ) meets Listing 8.06. Listing 8.06 reads, in its entirety, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-423\">\n   8.06\n   <em>\n    Hidradenitis suppurativa\n   </em>\n   , with extensive skin lesions involving both axillae, both inguinal areas or the perineum that persist for at least 3 months despite continuing treatment as prescribed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 8.06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   Ms. Webb's medical records reveal that she has seen various doctors who have either documented her skin condition and did not prescribe treatment (Dr. Kamer-AR573), or saw Ms. Webb on an acute-care, one-time basis for her skin treatment but did not treat the condition long term (Dr. Steves-AR577, 581-single lesion in left breast). In her July, 2013, function report, Ms. Webb stated her skin condition was becoming more problematic. AR314. In August, 2013, Dr. Kamer documented skin lesions beneath Ms. Webb's breasts, in her underarms, and in her groin that were draining. AR571.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-426\">\n   There are numerous doctors' records that do not mention any skin condition at all.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   AR480-82 (7/30/12-Dr. Steves-patient denied any rash); AR475-78 (11/7/12-Dr. Steves-no mention of rash); AR554 (7/2/13-negative for rashes); AR710 (3/16/15-Dr. Arban-inspection showed no rash). There are other records that show Ms. Webb told the physician she suffered from hidradenitis suppuativa, but the physician neither documented the state of that condition nor prescribed any treatment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   AR472, 558, 626. There is no record of a three-month prescribed treatment and a reassessment of Ms. Webb's condition following the treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   Dr. Christopher Gasbarre saw Ms. Webb specifically for treatment of her skin condition on September 8, 2014. AR648-50. At that time, he documented one nodule under Ms. Webb's left arm that she self-reported had been present for 3 years. AR648. At that time, Ms. Webb had no other nodules anywhere else.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She stated she had none in her groin, and Dr. Gasbarre documented scars from past lesions on her breasts, but no lesions there at that time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ms. Webb described her only self-treatment of the lesion as washing with Dial\u00ae Antimicrobial wash.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-428\">\n   Of note is the fact that Ms. Webb reported in her Disability Report that she had gone to the Emergency Room for surgery on her lesions because of flare-ups/drainage (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR303), but in her medical history which she gave to Dr. Gasbarre, although she listed a number of surgeries, she did not mention any surgery for her skin lesions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR648. This is\n   somewhat significant because she was consulting Dr. Gasbarre for the specific purpose of receiving treatment for her skin lesions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   Other discrepancies are apparent. At the ALJ hearing on July 20, 2015, Ms. Webb testified Dr. Gasbarre was her doctor for her skin condition. AR76. She testified that Dr. Gasbarre told her surgery is useless. AR77. She indicated that creams and steroidal injections were ineffective.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Dr. Gasbarre's own record indicates that he injected her one nodule with 10 milligrams of Kenlog and prescribed 30 days' of oral Doxycycline. AR650. He recommended to Ms. Webb that she try long-term use of tetracycline antibiotics.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He asked Ms. Webb to come back and see him for a recheck in 6 weeks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There are no other records from Dr. Gasbarre in the administrative record, so one assumes Ms. Webb did not go back to see him for the recommended recheck. Ms. Webb never testified about taking Doxycycline or tetracycline, so one assumes she did not follow this treatment recommended by Dr. Gasbarre.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   The trouble in Ms. Webb's case with meeting listing 8.06 is that, in order to meet the listing severity, a claimant must have followed prescribed treatment for at least 3 months and still have the extensive skin lesions described.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. Pt. 400, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 8.06. In the first place, she did not have extensive lesions at the time of her appointment with Dr. Gasbarre-she had one nodule. No medical records show a consistent presence of extensive lesions. The condition appears to wax and wane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   Secondly, as the listing further explains, if one has not been treating with a physician and following their prescribed treatment for at least 3 months, one cannot meet the listing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 8.00H. In such a case, the Commissioner will consider whether you are disabled under\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   listings, or may find you disabled at steps 4 or 5 of the sequential analysis, but the Commissioner will not find you disabled at step 3 based on listing 8.06.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   Ms. Webb concedes that she has mostly self-treated her skin condition and does not have the necessary track record of following a physician's prescribed treatment for 3 months without improvement in the condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 18 at p. 20. The listing makes clear that, without this prerequisite, Ms. Webb cannot meet listing 8.06.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 8.00H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   A consultative exam would not change this fact. The consultative exam could establish the extent of Ms. Webb's lesions at that moment in time, but the consultative examiner would not be able to supply the other half of the equation: prescribing treatment, requiring Ms. Webb to follow that prescribed treatment for 3 months, and then reassessing whether the lesions still meet the severity described in the listing after 3 months' treatment. For these reasons, the court rejects Ms. Webb's suggestion that a consultative exam should be required on remand as to her skin condition. As per the listings, the ALJ must consider that skin condition at steps 4 and 5, but Ms. Webb clearly has not met the listing for 8.06 at step 3. The ALJ's decision at step 3 as to Ms. Webb's skin condition is supported by substantial evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

The Law Applicable to Determining Validity of Subjective Complaints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   In determining whether to fully credit a claimant's subjective complaints of disabling pain, the Commissioner engages in a two-step process: (1) first, is there an underlying medically determinable physical or mental impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce the claimant's symptoms; and (2) if so, the Commissioner evaluates the claimant's description of the intensity and persistence of those symptoms to determine the extent to which the symptoms limit the claimant's ability to work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SSR 16-3p;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1529\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So the credibility determination rested on the second prong discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   In evaluating the second prong of the analysis, an ALJ must consider several factors, including: whether such complaints are supported by objective medical findings, whether the claimant has refused to follow a recommended course of treatment, whether the claimant has received minimal medical treatment, whether the claimant takes only occasional pain medications, the claimant's prior work record, observation of third parties and examining physicians relating to the claimant's daily activities; the duration, frequency, and intensity of the pain; precipitating and aggravating factors; dosage, effectiveness, and side effects of medication; and functional restrictions.\n   <em>\n    Wagner v.

AR476.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-449\">\n   2. Ms. Webb had not seen Dr. Curiel, the physician who diagnosed her Chiari malformation, in 9 years. AR466.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-450\">\n   3. Ms. Webb was not seeing a dermatologist for her skin condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-451\">\n   4. The ALJ found Ms. Webb's description of her symptoms to be inconsistent with her activities of daily living.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-452\">\n   5. The ALJ found Ms. Webb's failure to obtain a BiPAP machine to address her sleep apnea to be incongruent with Ms. Webb's description of the severity of her symptoms. AR39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-453\">\n   6. The ALJ concluded Ms. Webb's skin condition and her anxiety were fairly well controlled with antibacterial soap and prescribed medication, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-454\">\n   7. The ALJ found that by May, 2014, Ms. Webb still had not obtained her BiPAP machine and that she was \"doing well\" on psychiatric medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-455\">\n   8. The ALJ found Ms. Webb wanted to continue her medications in October, 2014, because her conditions were \"under good control\" with those medicines. AR40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-456\">\n   9. The ALJ found Ms. Webb said in April, 2015, she was \"doing all right\" after losing her medications due to the loss of Medicaid. AR40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-457\">\n   The court groups these 9 instances into 3 categories for purposes of discussion: (1) failure to follow recommended treatment, (2) impairment is well-controlled with medication, and (3) inconsistent with activities of daily living.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-458\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Failure to Follow Recommended Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-459\">\n   There are several instances the ALJ asserted Ms. Webb failed to pursue treatment or failure to follow treatment recommendations by her doctors. The ALJ did not follow the recommendations of SSR 82-59 as to these issues. The ALJ did\n   not advise Ms. Webb of the importance and consequence of whether she followed her doctors' recommendations. The ALJ did not ask Ms. Webb why she failed to follow her doctors' recommendations. The ALJ did not give Ms. Webb an advance warning about the import of this issue and afford her an opportunity to try the recommended treatment. The result is a record before this court wholly inadequate to determine this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-460\">\n   Most basic to this inquiry is the requirement of a finding by the ALJ that the recommended treatment is \"clearly expected to restore capacity to engage in any SGA.\" SSR 82-59. Here, as to Ms. Webb's Chiari malformation and its attendant headaches, depth perception distortion, and imbalance issues, Ms. Webb testified the only treatment for the underlying condition itself is surgery. AR88-89. She further testified that surgery is only \"successful\" in 50-percent of the cases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8944964\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/922/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, she testified that even in \"successful\" surgeries, the headaches are alleviated, but the imbalance and depth perception problems are not fixed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8944964\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/922/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This was why Ms. Webb had not seen Dr. Curiel, the physician who diagnosed her Chiari malformation, in 9 years. AR466. The ALJ never recontacted Ms. Webb's doctors to \"substantiate or clarify\" whether this was true. Thus, there is an absence in the record of any evidence-other than Ms. Webb's own testimony-about whether surgery would restore Ms. Webb to an SGA level. Failure to follow treatment recommendations that do not restore SGA is not a black mark on one's credibility. SSR 82-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-461\">\n   Similarly, with regard to her skin condition, Ms. Webb tried steroidal injections with Dr. Gasbarre, but they did not work. AR77. She told the Commissioner her dermatologist said she was not a candidate for surgery. AR376. She also stated creams do not work. AR77. Ms. Webb was not seeing a dermatologist for her skin condition at the time she was examined by Dr. Kamer. Neither Dr. Kamer nor the ALJ asked Ms. Webb why she was not seeing a dermatologist. Ms. Webb alleged before the agency she saw an unnamed dermatologist in September, 2015, who told her she was not a good candidate for surgery for her skin condition, but who prescribed a cream that cost $300 and which Ms. Webb could not afford. AR372, 376. Again, there is an absence in this record of any evidence-other than Ms. Webb's own testimony-that there was a treatment for her skin condition that would have restored her to an SGA level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-462\">\n   With regard to Ms. Webb's headaches, it is true on\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   occasion in November, 2012, she refused a physician's offer to prescribe headache medication for her. AR476. Several months later in April, 2013, she described her headaches as worsening. AR472. The record shows many other doctors on numerous occasions prescribed headache medication which Ms. Webb tried-Topamax, nortriptyline, Prodrin, Indomethacin,\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   and salsalate among them.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   AR471, 474, 610, 677, 685, 713-14. Ms. Webb testified the Topamax worked initially, then ceased easing her headaches. AR76. She testified the nortriptyline never worked at all on her headaches.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8944964\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/922/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition, she was injected on two separate occasions for acute treatment of severe headaches with Ativan (AR622) and Demerol and Phenergan (AR601). Refusing Dr. Steves' offer of prescription headache medicine on one occasion does not constitute failure to follow recommended treatment\n   regarding headache medicine given the longitudinal evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-463\">\n   Ms. Webb also refused Dr. Steves' offer to refer her to a neurologist or neurosurgeon. AR476. Ms. Webb explains before this court that she refused the referral because she did not have health insurance and could not afford to pay a neurologist/neurosurgeon. Docket No. 18 at p. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-464\">\n   Dr. Finley and Dr. Hogue saw a potential connection between Ms. Webb's headaches and her severe sleep apnea. AR613, 689. Therefore, it is possible if Ms. Webb had obtained a BiPAP machine, she may have improved her headaches. However, she never did obtain the prescribed machine so the court cannot tell on this record if the machine would have improved Ms. Webb to an SGA level. The ALJ never quizzed Ms. Webb about this issue during the hearing. In her opinion, the ALJ acknowledged Ms. Webb had been \"unable\" to obtain a BiPAP machine. AR39-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-465\">\n   Ms. Webb states she was unable to afford the approximate $1,600 cost of obtaining a BiPAP machine. She specifically testified that South Dakota would not approve her to receive a BiPAP machine. AR82-83. This court assumes the reference to \"South Dakota\" is a reference to Medicaid or some other state-based system for helping indigent people obtain medical care. The ALJ never asked her about this, nor did the ALJ inquire about whether there were sources of free or reduced-cost assistance for the indigent in Ms. Webb's community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-466\">\n   The ALJ herself acknowledged that Dr. Finley's record from September, 2014, indicates Ms. Webb told him she could not afford the BiPAP. AR40. Unmentioned by the ALJ is a reference in Dr. Hogue's records that\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   checked with \"the local DME\" and they told Dr. Hogue they would not accept Ms. Webb's BiPAP prescription from Colorado. AR689. This was also confirmed by a note of a phone call Ms. Webb placed to Dr. Hogue. AR700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-467\">\n   \"If a claimant truly has no access to health care, then the absence of such care would not tend to disprove her subjective complaints of pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785488\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/926/#p930\">\n    356 F.3d 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 930 (8th Cir. 2004). However, in evaluating a claimant's subjective complaints of pain, it is permissible for the ALJ to consider whether she sought out treatment available to indigents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785488\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/926/#p930\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-468\">\n   The Commissioner asserts that Medicaid covers BiPAP machines and that Ms. Webb had a prescription for a BiPAP machine for over a year before she lost Medicaid coverage. Furthermore, the Commissioner supplies a citation to a web site where free or low-cost BiPAP machines can be obtained. Likewise, although Ms. Webb said her dermatologist prescribed a cream in September, 2015, that she could not afford, the Commissioner points out she did not indicate she explored any options for financial assistance for low-income patients. The question becomes who has the burden of proof to show access to low- or no-cost treatment? The Commissioner has placed the burden on the ALJ to (1) explain the importance of not following treatment, (2) to ask why treatment was not followed, and (3) to ask if there were alternatives to obtain the treatment at no or reduced cost.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SSR 82-59. Therefore, the fact that the record is silent on this issue is the failing of the ALJ, not Ms. Webb.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785488\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/926/#p930\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-469\">\n   The facts regarding the recommended treatment from Ms. Webb's doctors are undeveloped. No medical source has suggested Ms. Webb is malingering. There are no facts from which the court could conclude that, had Ms. Webb followed doctors' orders, she would now have been restored to an SGA level. Furthermore, because the ALJ did not advise Ms. Webb of the importance of this issue, and did not\n   even question her about this issue in most instances, the court cannot conclude the ALJ's decision comports with the Commissioner's own rules about evaluating a claimant's failure to follow doctors' orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-470\">\n   The facts of this case are further complicated by the fact Ms. Webb moved from Fort Collins, CO, to Sturgis, SD, in September, 2013, thus disrupting the continuity of care with her Colorado medical care providers. AR580. Then, the first of November, 2014, she lost her Medicaid coverage. AR711. These facts make it all the more crucial that the ALJ perform her two-fold duty of advising the claimant about the importance of following recommended treatment and making inquiry as to why treatment was not followed in some instances. There is not enough information in the record for the court to conclude Ms. Webb's failure to follow recommended treatments was unjustifiable and, thus, undermined her testimony as to the effect of her symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-471\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Impairments are Well-Controlled with Medications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-472\">\n   The ALJ concluded Ms. Webb's skin condition, anxiety, and headaches were well controlled with over the counter remedies or prescribed medication. The ALJ based this conclusion on reports that her conditions were \"fairly well controlled,\" that she was \"doing well,\" that her conditions were \"under good control,\" and that she was \"doing all right.\" AR38-40. Ms. Webb contests these citations to the medical records by the ALJ, asserting that whether one is \"all right\" is a relative term. Ms. Webb further asserts that a detailed look at the medical records cited by the ALJ reveals conditions that were significantly impairing even with medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-473\">\n   The ALJ found Ms. Webb wanted to continue her medications in October, 2014, because her conditions were \"under good control\" with those medicines. AR40. At that time, Ms. Webb points out, she was about to lose her Medicaid coverage. Ms. Webb argues that \"under good control\" is a relative term, and does not support the conclusion she was capable of working. Instead, she points to records from Dr. Arban showing she could not work. AR711.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-474\">\n   The ALJ found Ms. Webb said in April, 2015, she was \"doing all right\" after losing her medications due to the loss of Medicaid. AR40. Again, Ms. Webb asserts the phrase \"doing all right\" is relative and not indicative of her ability to work full time. Furthermore, contemporaneous medical records describe daily, vice-like headaches, an inability to afford a BiPAP machine, severe sleep apnea, and other factors disturbing her sleep. AR722-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-475\">\n   Ms. Webb also questions the accuracy of Dr. Finley's finding in September, 2014, that Ms. Webb was not suffering from fatigue or insomnia at that time. AR675-76. The records from other care providers during the same time frame document complaints of insomnia and fatigue. AR714. Furthermore, Dr. Finley failed to note Ms. Webb's skin condition in his September, 2014, record, calling into question the accuracy and thoroughness of that record according to Ms. Webb. AR675.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-476\">\n   Ms. Webb is correct that phrases such as \"doing well\" or \"all right\" are relative.\n   <em>\n    Hutsell v. Massanari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499748\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/707/#p712\">\n    259 F.3d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 712 (8th Cir. 2001). The ALJ may not rely on these bromides to conclude a claimant is able to work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499748\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/707/#p712\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, the description of her symptoms in the medical records, objective findings, and functional abilities is what the ALJ must scrutinize and comments such as \"doing well\" must be placed into context in the longitudinal record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499748\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/707/#p712\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-477\">\n   Here, the court has concluded that one of the primary reasons the ALJ cited for not crediting Ms. Webb's description of the limiting effects of her symptoms (failure to\n   follow treatment), requires remand. Thus, on remand, the court instructs that the ALJ revisit all the\n   <em>\n    Polaski\n   </em>\n   factors in light of the record as a whole, including the above statements of supposed well-being.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-478\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Activities of Daily Living Inconsistent with the Described Severity of Symptoms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-479\">\n   The ALJ found Ms. Webb's description of the severity of her symptoms to be inconsistent with her activities of daily living. AR37-40. The court notes first that the absence in this record of any assessment of the impact Ms. Webb's obesity has on her ability to function is a significant absence when determining whether Ms. Webb's impairments are consistent-or inconsistent-with her activities of daily living. That said, the court turns to Ms. Webb's description of her activities of daily living.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-480\">\n   At the hearing before the ALJ, Ms. Webb testified she shares the cooking duties with another adult female living with her and with her teenaged children. AR79-80. She does not drive because of the depth perception and balance problems that accompany her headaches. AR57, 60. She ventures outside her home only occasionally and only if she is assured of not encountering crowds. AR73. She has not attended any of her children's activities for 4 years, except for parent-teacher conferences. AR80. She can load laundry into the washer, but she needs her children to transfer the wet clothes to the dryer. AR80. Her older children work outside the home full time and the 11 year old is in school and has extended stays at her grandmother's home in the summer. AR81. Ms. Webb testified she could stand for 30 minutes at a time, walk for 15 to 20 minutes, sit for 15 to 20 minutes, and lift 20 or 30 pounds. AR90. When her dad was terminally ill, she went to stay with him and help him get his things in order, but the record does not show what specific physical activities she engaged in on this occasion or whether she drove herself to Colorado to see him. AR85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-481\">\n   When discussing Ms. Webb's activities of daily living, the ALJ cited to a brief paragraph in Dr. Kamer's consultative exam report. AR38 (citing AR572). In that exam, conducted a full two years prior to the hearing before the ALJ, Dr. Kamer recorded the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-482\">\n   Ms. Webb indicates that she begins her typical day between 4 and 10 am and usually retires between 9 pm and 2 am. She indicates she is able to get herself in and out of bed, dress herself, and bathe herself as well as drive, cook, and clean for herself. She indicates that she spends her typical day, \"wake up around 3-4 am with headache, take meds if headache eases up sleep until 6 or 7 am. Wake up kids, supervise them getting ready for school, do a load of laundry, clean dishes while I can stopping often, alternate housework, reading or napping, depending on the day. I have no set routines as I can't predict what will happen on a given day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-483\">\n   AR572. First of all, the above description is not terribly inconsistent with Ms. Webb's hearing testimony: she described broken sleep, daily headaches, intermittently effective headache medication, and stop-and-go household activities on both occasions.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AR572\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   AR57, 60, 79-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-484\">\n   \"Supervising\" one's children and getting them ready for school, referenced by the ALJ, takes on a different meaning whether they are preschoolers or high schoolers. Ms. Webb's children were older, both at the time she saw Dr. Kamer and at the time of the ALJ hearing. At the time of the hearing the children were old enough to be employed outside the home full time with the exception of the 11 year old who attended school and had extended stays at\n   a grandmother's home during summer break.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR81. Supervising teenagers certainly does not require the type of labor-intensive dressing, tying shoes, locating outerwear, threading small hands into gloves or mittens that dressing very young children does. Getting one's teenagers out the door in the morning for school does not automatically undermine one's assertion one is unable to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-485\">\n   There are some distinctions between Ms. Webb's hearing testimony and what she told Dr. Kamer two years earlier. She told Dr. Kamer in August, 2013, she could drive,\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   do laundry, and cook. AR572. She testified at the hearing that others helped her cook and launder and that she no longer drove. AR57, 60, 79-80. The Commissioner's policy guidance, SSR 16-3p, recognizes that symptoms may change over time-they can improve or worsen. The ALJ never asked Ms. Webb about whether her symptoms had changed since her consultative examination two years prior to the ALJ hearing. The conclusion that Ms. Webb's hearing testimony was therefore not worthy of credence is unsupported by the record at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-486\">\n   The court will remand with instructions for the ALJ to consider all of the\n   <em>\n    Polaski\n   </em>\n   factors in the context of the entire longitudinal record. Dr. Kamer's two-year-old statements about Ms. Webb's activities of daily living should be a subject of further development to determine (1) whether the impairments Ms. Webb has wax and wane and (2) whether any of her impairments worsened in the two years between the consultative exam with Dr. Kamer and the ALJ hearing. \"Possibly a decision to disbelieve the claimant ... would be proper, but on this record [the court] cannot so hold.\"\n   <em>\n    Caviness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11099475\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/603/#p604\">\n    250 F.3d at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-487\">\n   <strong>\n    H.

Here, Dr. Houston did not review Ms. Webb's written disability and function reports and he did not listen to her hearing testimony. Therefore, Ms. Webb posits his opinion was faulty and the ALJ should not have relied upon it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-491\">\n   The Commissioner tacitly concedes Dr. Houston did not consider Ms. Webb's hearing testimony, function or disability reports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 19 at 21-22. The Commissioner also does not dispute that \u00a7 404.1520a required Dr. Houston to consider\n   this evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, the Commissioner's argument is tantamount to a \"harmless error\" argument.

Pt. 404, Subpt. P, \u00a7\u00a7 1200D1 and D3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-495\">\n   This is the type of evidence Ms. Webb presented in her testimony at the ALJ hearing. It is also the type of evidence she presented in her disability and function reports. Bits and pieces, here and there, of Ms. Webb's daily activities and functions are found in the medical evidence, but the medical evidence does not provide a clear and complete picture. Nowhere in the medical evidence does it reveal, for example, that Ms. Webb has not attended any of her children's activities for four years because of her anxiety about being outside the house and being around crowds. Ms. Webb testified her prescribed medications for her depression and anxiety, Wellbutrin and Celexa, allow her to function better\n   <em>\n    at least at home\n   </em>\n   . This qualification is not found in the medical records either. Ms. Webb testified she shops for groceries when the store first opens so as to avoid as\n   much as possible encountering large numbers of persons. The medical records merely state Ms. Webb does her own grocery shopping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-496\">\n   Had Dr. Houston's opinion been the sole basis for the ALJ's formulation of Ms. Webb's mental RFC, that might warrant remand because he considered only medical records. However, as noted above in discussing the issue of whether a mental consultative exam was warranted, the ALJ accorded \"significant\" weight to Dr. Houston's opinion, which did not take into account Ms. Webb's written and oral descriptions of her activities, functioning, and symptoms. AR36. And, the ALJ also accorded \"significant\" weight to Dr. Wanstrath's opinion, which\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   take into consideration Ms. Webb's written descriptions of her activities, functioning, and symptoms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; AR102-09. The ALJ found both professionals' opinions to be persuasive. AR36. Comparing the PRTF completed by both, they are identical.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AR109-10,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   AR68-69 (Houston hearing testimony). Furthermore, the mental RFCs rendered by both professionals are nearly identical.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AR113-15,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   AR70-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-497\">\n   The Eighth Circuit has made clear that when considering the activities of daily living of claimant's with mental impairments, it is important to consider whether the claimant has \"structured [her life] in such a way as to minimize stress and reduce their signs and symptoms.\"\n   <em>\n    Hutsell v. Massanari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499748\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/707/#p712\">\n    259 F.3d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 711 (8th Cir. 2001). The Commissioner's regulations make clear that if a claimant closets herself almost entirely in her house in order to compensate for a mental impairment, that is a significant factor to consider in determining-as the Commissioner says it must-whether the claimant can function on a sustained basis\n   <em>\n    in a work environment\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.00D. Although Dr. Houston failed to take these factors into account, his opinion is not the only opinion in support of the ALJ's rendering of Ms. Webb's RFC. Dr. Wanstrath's opinion as to PRTF and mental RFC was nearly identical to Dr. Houston's and was also relied upon by the ALJ. Remand is, therefore, unnecessary as to any inadequacies of Dr. Houston's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-498\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Opinions of Dr. Kamer, Dr. Canham and Dr. Erickson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-499\">\n   Ms. Webb argues the ALJ improperly relied on the opinions of these physicians because they did not know of Ms. Webb's sleep study, severe sleep apnea, or her inability to obtain a BiPAP machine to address her sleep apnea. The Commissioner concedes this fact, but argues knowledge of Ms. Webb's sleep apnea could not have had any bearing on Dr. Kamer's opinion. Docket No. 19 at p. 22. Ms. Webb did tell Dr. Kamer she suffered from broken sleep and often woke up in the middle of the night with headaches.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499748\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/707/#p712\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR572). This was enough, the Commissioner argues, to make Dr. Kamer aware of Ms. Webb's sleep problems.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499748\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/707/#p712\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the Commissioner asserts, the ALJ\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   consider Ms. Webb's sleep apnea and found it to be a severe impairment, so the court should ignore any irregularity with regard to Dr. Kamer's opinion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499748\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/707/#p712\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-500\">\n   As to the state agency doctors, the Commissioner asserts these doctors did consider Ms. Webb's Chiari malformation (and the attendant headaches) and her weight when determining Ms. Webb's RFC. The Commissioner asserts before this court that Ms. Webb has failed to show harm as a result of the omissions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-501\">\n   Ms. Webb counters that the effects of sleep apnea are best evaluated when observed over a period of time and that Dr. Kamer's one-time assessment that Ms. Webb did not seem affected by fatigue on\n   a single day is not determinative. Ms. Webb asserts neither Dr. Kamer nor any of the state agency consultants took into account fatigue and daytime somnolence as a result of Ms. Webb's severe sleep apnea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-502\">\n   When Ms. Webb had her sleep study in Colorado in July, 2013, she was asked to rate herself on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. AR553. The scale uses 0 to mean \"never\"; 1 to mean there is a slight chance of dozing; 2 means a moderate chance of dozing; and 3 means a high chance of dozing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Webb stated she would never doze off while sitting and talking to someone or while in a car stopped for a few minutes in traffic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She stated there was only a slight chance of dozing when sitting inactive in a public place, as a passenger in a car for an hour without a break, or while sitting quietly after lunch without alcohol.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She stated there was a high chance of dozing while sitting and reading, watching television, or when lying down in the afternoon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-503\">\n   Dr. Finley recorded that Ms. Webb reported \"excessive daytime somnolence\" associated with her sleep apnea. AR734. Finally, the ALJ found Ms. Webb's obstructive sleep apnea was a severe impairment. AR34. It was error to rely on RFCs from nontreating, nonexamining state agency physicians where those physicians were unaware of one of Ms. Webb's severe impairments. The agency physicians themselves gave Dr. Kamer's opinion little weight because\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   failed to take into account another of Ms. Webb's severe impairments-obesity. Because this matter is being remanded for other reasons, the court also remands for reconsideration of the opinions of Dr. Kamer and the state agency physicians and/or further development of the record to taken Ms. Webb's severe sleep apnea into account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-504\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Dr. O'Toole's Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-505\">\n   Ms. Webb notes the ALJ never mentioned Dr. O'Toole's objective impairment rating. Thus, she argues the ALJ failed to accord proper weight to this treating physician opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-506\">\n   The Commissioner notes the ALJ cited to the record which contained the impairment rating and asserts the ALJ was not required to discuss every piece of evidence. Docket No. 19 at 24. Furthermore, the Commissioner reasserts its earlier argument that Dr. O'Toole's impairment rating was rendered for purposes of worker's compensation and so has limited significance in this Social Security proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Commissioner also reasserts its earlier argument that medical evidence subsequent to Dr. O'Toole's evaluation showed Ms. Webb's impairment resolved itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-507\">\n   As to the latter, the court has already discussed at length the Commissioner's argument that other evidence in the record showed Ms. Webb's left ankle was unimpaired. That argument has been rejected because there is no record of any doctor subsequent to Dr. O'Toole who evaluated Ms. Webb's left ankle in the same detail applying the same objective standards promulgated by the American Medical Association. Dr. Kamer's August, 2013, ankle exam was expressed in a range of degrees of movement and did not distinguish between Ms. Webb's left and right lower extremities. Dr. Finley's exam results were expressed in conclusory fashion. Neither exam shows Dr. O'Toole's exam to be invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-508\">\n   Regarding the Commissioner's argument that the ALJ considered, but did not discuss, Dr. O'Toole's impairment rating, the court is not convinced. The ALJ\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   cite Dr. O'Toole's records, exhibit 2F, in her opinion in the following context:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-509\">\n   The medical evidence additionally documents the claimant's history of a left ankle injury in June 2011, for which she underwent reconstructive surgery in March 2012, followed by postoperative complications of left calf cramping and persistent left foot/ankle pain and paresthesias, with August 2012 electrodiagnostic studies revealing a resolving peroneal mononeuropathy (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ex. 1F, 2F, 4F). By August and September 2012, her pain had improved (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ex. 4F at 15); exams showed normal gait, normal range of motion, full strength, normal sensation except for \"a few branches of the sural nerve\", [sic] no calf pain or tenderness, and no swelling (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ex. 1F at 3, 2F at 1); and her prognosis was deemed \"excellent\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ex. 4F at 33).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-510\">\n   AR35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-511\">\n   One reads the above passage and draws the definite inference that all problems with Ms. Webb's left ankle had resolved by August or September of 2012. However, if one reads the exhibits cited by the ALJ, they tell a different story.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-512\">\n   The ALJ cites to exhibits 1F, 2F, and 4F. These correspond to pages AR393-408, 409-464, and 484-552 in the administrative record, respectively, collectively 140 pages of medical records. The ALJ singles out citations to page 3 of exhibit 1F, page 1 of exhibit 2F, and pages 15 and 33 of exhibit 4F. AR35. The court describes these records in chronological order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-513\">\n   On August 15, 2012, Dr. O'Toole dictated a report for Ms. Webb's worker's compensation claim.

He described Ms. Webb as still experiencing painful cramping, a 5 or 6 out of 10 on the pain scale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. O'Toole limited her to avoiding all stairs and walking as tolerated. AR517 (ex. 4F at p. 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-514\">\n   On August 23, 2012, physical therapist Paul Brannin wrote that Ms. Webb continued to experience pain, paresthesia, and cramping in her left extremity.

He noted changes in her perineal and sural nerves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-515\">\n   On August 30, 2012, Dr. Wesley Jackson wrote of Ms. Webb that it was \"difficult to say\" when she would reach maximum medical improvement. AR394 (ex. 1F at p. 2). Dr. Jackson wrote on the same date that Ms. Webb's calf cramping had not improved. AR395 (ex. 1F at p.1). He stated she was \"moving in the right direction although it might take quite some time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also opined Ms. Webb might be developing a complex regional pain syndrome.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-516\">\n   The court notes the ALJ never cited to pages 7-9 of exhibit 2F, which is the location of Dr. O'Toole's permanent impairment rating of Ms. Webb's left leg. AR415-17. However, Dr. O'Toole's impairment rating was issued the same day as the above record from Dr. Wesley Jackson, August 30, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-517\">\n   The final record cited by the ALJ is page 1 of exhibit 2F, found at AR409. This was a record of a September 14, 2012, visit Ms. Webb made to Dr. O'Toole.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On that occasion, Dr. O'Toole wrote that Ms. Webb continued having difficulty negotiating stairs and was only able to do limited walking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She reported instability in her ankle, such as a tendency to roll in the grocery store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-518\">\n   The ALJ never mentions Dr. O'Toole's impairment rating anywhere in her opinion.

Therefore, the absence of valid evidence of substantial numbers of jobs in Ms. Webb's \"region\" or in \"several regions\" is an absence of evidence that cuts against the Commissioner. While this court might hazard a guess that there are substantial numbers of housekeeping cleaning jobs available in South Dakota, or in the region consisting of South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana, or in several other regions in the country, this court is not allowed to guess about facts that might have been able to have been adduced at the agency level.

Another kind of benefit, SSI benefits, are also known as \"Title XVI\" benefits. Receipt of both SSD/DIB and SSI benefits depends on whether the claimant is disabled. Both Titles define disability the same. The difference-greatly simplified-is that a one's entitlement to SSD/DIB benefits depends on one's \"coverage status,\" which is based on one's earning history. The amount of SSD/DIB benefits is based on a formula using the claimant's earning history. There are no \"coverage\" requirements for SSI benefits and the amount of benefits is set by statute. Title II benefits may include a 12-month period of benefits retroactive to the date of application; Title XVI benefits are not retroactive to the application date. SSR 83-20.
