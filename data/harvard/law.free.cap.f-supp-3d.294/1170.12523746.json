The Court held a hearing on November 6, 2017. The primary issues are (i) whether Defendants Mike Wood, Jason Green, and David Hightower (collectively \"Officers\") are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiff Sean McGarry's claim that Wood used excessive force when he shoved McGarry against his kitchen counter to arrest him; (ii) whether the Officers maliciously prosecuted McGarry for resisting, evading, or obstructing a peace officer and for assaulting a peace officer; (iii) whether the Court should dismiss the respondeat superior count against Defendants Board of County Commissioners for the County of Lincoln and the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department; and (iv) whether the Court should dismiss the remaining state law claims. The Court concludes that: (i) Wood used excessive force, but he is entitled to qualified immunity, because the right was not clearly established; (ii) the Officers are entitled to qualified immunity on the malicious prosecution count, because the right was not clearly established; (iii) Lincoln County and Lincoln County's Sheriff's Department cannot be liable under respondeat superior for\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims; and (iv) the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over McGarry's remaining state law claim, so dismisses it. Accordingly, the Court grants the Motion for all federal claims and dismisses the state law claim without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court draws its facts from the Defendants' statement of undisputed material facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3-5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Response and Supporting Memorandum to Defendant's Motion for Qualified Immunity and Summary Judgment at 1-3, filed April 24, 2017 (Doc. 52)(\"Response\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 26, 2014, Officers Wood, Green, and Hightower responded to a report that McGarry and his girlfriend-Theresa Traci-got into a fight at McGarry's rural New Mexico home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion \u00b6 1, at 3 (asserting this fact)(citing Affidavit of Deputy Mike Wood \u00b6 3, at 1 (executed March 14, 2017), filed March 15, 2017, (Doc. 45-1)(\"Wood Aff.\"); Lapel Video of Deputy Mike Wood at 0:00:00-0:20:47, (dated May 26, 2014), filed March 15, 2017 (Doc. 45-1)(Attachment 1)(\"Wood Video 1\").

The Defendants argue, as an initial matter, that Green and Hightower are not liable under the NMTCA and for malicious prosecution, because there is no evidence that those officers caused the purported harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 6 n.1 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pahls v.

Luna Cty. Detention Ctr.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-0954 (D.N.M. September 6, 2012)(Doc. 84)(Vidmar, M.J.) ). They also contend that Lincoln County and the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department cannot be liable on any of the individual claims, because they are not individuals capable of causing the constitutional and tort harms alleged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 6, n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Defendants also argue that Wood did not clearly commit a violation under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America when Wood pushed McGarry into the kitchen counter and handcuffed him on the ground.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 7. They contend that, under the totality of the circumstances, it was reasonable for Wood to take those actions when he observed McGarry screaming profanities and shaking his finger at Green.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 7-8. According to the Defendants, Wood's actions were all the more reasonable, because Wood knew that McGarry had battered his girlfriend the prior night, McGarry had a temper, and McGarry had a gun in the home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 8. The Defendants conclude that, in light of those facts, and the minimal force that Wood used against McGarry, Wood's actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Defendants aver that there is no United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit case that has held that a similar use of force-\"taking hold of a suspect, forcing him against a counter, and placing him on the ground to cuff him\"-violates the Fourth Amendment. Motion at 11. They also aver that the Tenth Circuit has held that more force than Wood used\n   was not excessive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 11-14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Aldaba v.

The Defendants assert that Wood had probable cause to arrest McGarry for assaulting Green, or resisting, evading, or obstructing Wood, so the malicious prosecution claim fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 14-15. The Defendants contend that Wood had probable cause to arrest for assault when he observed McGarry yelling profanities at Green and waving his hand in Green's face.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 15-16 (citing\n   <em>\n    Benavidez v.

The Defendants argue that Wood had probable cause to arrest McGarry for resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer, because: (i) McGarry's yelling caused Wood to stop his \"investigation\" in order to assist Hightower and Wood; (ii) McGarry refused repeated orders from officers to calm down; and (iii) McGarry hurled profanities at the Officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 18.

They also contend that, to the extent the respondeat superior claim relates to the NMTCA, it fails, because McGarry cannot show that any of the Officers committed any torts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 21. Finally, they contend that the NMTCA claim fails, because Wood's actions, under the totality of the circumstances, were reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   McGarry responds that Wood did not have probable cause to arrest McGarry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5.

He also contends that Green's and Hightower's presence in the room with McGarry makes Wood's action less reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 7. McGarry argues that the gun he owned was an antique and never left the box, so Wood could not have been responding to a danger that the gun presented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   McGarry also contends that Wood used excessive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 7-9.

[T]hat's not what I think the law should be. And I think they're pretty much making 1983 a pretty difficult area for us to develop constitutional law in.

The Defendants rejoined that the proper inquiry is to look at the facts with \"the lens of what Deputy Wood knew at the time and just prior to entering the house.\" Tr. at 5:14-16 (Martinez). The Defendants argued that the facts demonstrate that Wood knew: (i) McGarry had choked his girlfriend the prior night; (ii) McGarry had a weapon in the house; and (iii) McGarry was within a foot and a half of Green screaming profanities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:17-25 (Martinez).

He also argued that yelling and shaking a finger at an officer's face is not enough to establish probable cause for resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 24:5-10 (Witt).

The Court asked \"isn't it a fairly strong inference that no force was necessary if [ ] the two police officers inside the house\n   that had been there for some time weren't using it.\" Tr. at 27:7-10 (Court).

The police officers in the home with McGarry outnumbered him two to one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Green Video at 0:35:57-0:37:25; Hightower Video at 0:048:20-0:50:00.

All of those circumstances were visible to Wood as he rushed into the home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wood Video 2 at 0:11:53-0:13:19. To be sure, Wood knew that McGarry had choked his girlfriend the prior night,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Wood Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, at 1-2, but a reasonable officer would have known that McGarry-a police officer-was far less likely to attack two armed police officers than his unarmed girlfriend. That Green and Hightower, who were both a few feet from McGarry, had not arrested McGarry before Wood tore into the room, much less put McGarry on the ground, also speaks volumes. Although Wood was aware that McGarry owned a gun, McGarry's hands were empty when Wood entered the home, and Wood had been told that McGarry had no ammunition for the gun.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wood Video at 13:10-21 (Traci).

Taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, a reasonable juror could conclude that McGarry posed no immediate threat to Green and Hightower, and he could not have posed a threat to Wood, as Wood had just entered the home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    York v.

Within a few seconds however, Wood secures McGarry in a bear-hug-from-behind grab, which McGarry does not appear to struggle against.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Green Video at 36:20-34. The available videos then do not clearly show how the Officers take down and handcuff McGarry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wood Video 2 at 15:15-24; Green Video at 36:35-44; Hightower Video at 48:50-49:00. In the clearest video, McGarry is partially visible for only a portion of the tape and then he falls out of the frame entirely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Green Video at 36:35-44. The Court can see that, before being handcuffed, McGarry moves his arms against Wood's grasp, which could be interpreted as McGarry struggling against Wood, but a reasonable juror could also interpret McGarry's arm movement as compliance with Wood's command to \"give me your hands!\" Green Video at 36:35-44 (Wood). Thus, the only clear evidence of resistance is McGarry's initial shove, and the Court concludes accordingly, that the third factor weighs, slightly, toward Wood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   With two factors weighing slightly toward Wood and the most important factor tipping toward McGarry, the Court is mindful that the Fourth Amendment's touchstone is reasonableness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend. IV (\"The right of the people to be secure ... against\n   <strong>\n    unreasonable\n   </strong>\n   searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\")(emphasis added). Here, there were three officers. Two of them-Green and Hightower-apparently concluded that, before Wood entered the home, McGarry need not be tackled or even touched, let alone arrested. Green and Hightower also happen to be the officers who knew the most about the situation. Wood, however, who could clearly see that neither Green nor Hightower had made a move on McGarry,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Wood Video 2 at 11:56, decided that McGarry needed to be taken down. In fact, Green appears to try and call off Wood from engaging with McGarry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hightower Video at 48:34-36 (Green).

For example, the police officer in\n   <em>\n    York\n   </em>\n   threatened York with a Taser, whereas Wood did not threaten McGarry with one. York was arrested for\n   disorderly conduct whereas McGarry was arrested for assault and resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer. McGarry shouted at the Officers to get out of his home, whereas it is unclear what York said or how loudly he said it to the officer confronting him. It is also unclear how close York was to the officer during his confrontation, but the Court knows that McGarry was just a couple of feet from Green. Because of these factual differences, the Court concludes that the right was not clearly established when Wood grabbed and threw McGarry to the ground, so Wood is entitled to qualified immunity on the excessive force count.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     THE OFFICERS ARE ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY ON THE MALICIOUS PROSECUTION CLAIMS.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   To prevail on his malicious prosecution claims, McGarry must demonstrate that the Officers did not have probable cause for the charges brought. Wood brought two charges: assault and resisting, evading or obstructing an officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Criminal Complaint at 1. A reasonable juror could conclude that yelling at an officer and pointing at your door does not amount to probable cause for assault. Wood did, however, have probable cause to prosecute McGarry for resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer, because McGarry refused to comply with Green's commands. Although Wood lacks probable cause for the assault charge, he is nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity, as the right was not clearly established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   To the extent that McGarry's malicious prosecution claim includes Green and Hightower, there is no evidence that Green or Hightower prosecuted these charges against McGarry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Criminal Complaint at 1 (signed only by Wood). Moreover, even if there were evidence that they had prosecuted charges, Green and Hightower are also entitled to qualified immunity for the same reasons that Wood is.

Jan. 6, 2015) (Parker, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Here, McGarry yelled at Green to get out of his house and pointed his finger both at Green and at the door.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Green Video at 0:36:00-0:36:15. Green stood within a few feet of McGarry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Green Video at 0:35:54-0:36:15; Hightower Video at 0:048:10-25. Neither Green nor Hightower, who was also very close to McGarry, had moved to handcuff or arrest McGarry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Green Video at 0:35:54-0:36:15; Hightower Video at 0:048:15-31. From those facts, a reasonable juror could conclude that Wood's belief-that a battery on Green was imminent-was unreasonable. McGarry's shouts were not threats, but commands to leave his home. McGarry did not reach out to Green or Hightower, move toward them suddenly, or otherwise indicate intent to strike. McGarry's only action that suggests an imminent touching is his finger-pointing that alternated between pointing at Green and at the door.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Green Video at 0:35:54-0:36:15. A reasonable inference is that McGarry's pointing is a gesture meant to reinforce his command that Green and Hightower leave his house. In short, yelling and gesturing at a police officer to get out of your house does not amount to probable cause for assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Court is also mindful that Green and Hightower, who had both been with McGarry longer than Wood and were both physically closer to McGarry than Wood, apparently concluded that McGarry's finger-pointing was not an assault. As already explored above, when Wood entered the home, he saw both Green and Hightower and neither had attempted to arrest McGarry. That two other officers, who had greater knowledge of the situation, made no move to arrest McGarry, and that Wood saw both of those officers not acting casts considerable doubt on the reasonableness of Wood's belief that a battery was imminent. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to McGarry, the Court determines that a reasonable juror could conclude that Wood lacked probable cause for arresting McGarry on the assault charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Wood, however, also charged McGarry with resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer, which occurs when a person \"resist[s] or abus[es] any judge, magistrate or peace officer in the lawful\n   discharge of his duties.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"407\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-22-1\">\n    N.M.

Rather than being a poor or discouraged means of developing constitutional law, \u00a7 1983 seems the better and preferable alternative to a motion to suppress.

It is odd that the Supreme Court has not adopted a clearly established prong for suppression claims; it seems strange to punish society for police violating unclear law in criminal cases, but protect municipalities from damages in \u00a7 1983 cases.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    <em>\n     Kerns v.

Moreover, in a day when police shootings and excessive force cases are in the news, there should be a remedy when there is a constitutional violation, and jury trials are the most democratic expression of what police action is reasonable and what action is excessive. If the citizens of New Mexico decided that the Defendants used excessive force, the verdict should stand, not set aside because the parties could not find an indistinguishable Tenth Circuit or Supreme Court decision.
