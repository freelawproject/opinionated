The Court will\n   <strong>\n    deny\n   </strong>\n   Jackson Taylor's Motion to Dismiss Kimball's Crossclaim (ECF No. 45). Finally, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    deny\n   </strong>\n   ACA's Motion to Dismiss GBC's Third-Party Complaint (ECF No. 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction and Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the original Complaint filed by Apple American Group, LLC.

U.S.C. \u00a7 1391.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court has supplemental jurisdiction over GBC's third-party claims against Kimball, Jackson Taylor, and ACA because GBC's third-party claims form part of the same case or controversy. 28. U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a).

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Apple's Complaint Against GBC\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Apple owns and operates Applebee's Neighborhood Restaurant franchises. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2013, Apple purchased a property in Ebensburg, Pennsylvania, on which it planned to construct an Applebee's restaurant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.) Apple contracted with ACA to conduct a \"Geotechnical Investigation Report\" of the premises \"to guide site planning.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) Apple also contracted with GBC to provide Site Plans which included, among other things, a \"grading, drainage, and erosion control plan ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) Apple's contract with GBC provided that GBC would rely on other contractors' work, including ACA's Geotechnical Investigation Report, to prepare the Site Plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.) GBC completed the Site Plans in September 2013 after receiving ACA's Geotechnical Report and reports from other contractors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Construction on the Applebee's began in 2013 and was completed by spring of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.) The appropriate agencies inspected the Applebee's and approved the construction as conforming to GBC's Site Plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) The Applebee's opened for business in November 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Applebee's immediately began to experience drainage and moisture issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) The rain garden installed on the north side of the building failed and caused water to pool and freeze in the downspouts and under the sidewalks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The drainage and water management systems malfunctioned and allowed water infiltration that cracked and buckled the sidewalks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And the drainage and grading systems proved deficient and caused the roof, doors, and windows to suffer severe damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   These defective systems conformed with GBC's Site Plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Apple hired ACA-the engineering firm that had prepared the Geotechnical Investigation Report-to inspect the premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.) ACA determined that the damage to the premises was due to the fact that GBC's Site Plans failed to properly follow ACA's Geotechnical Investigation Report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.) ACA also hired Wallace &amp; Pancher, Inc.-another engineering firm-to inspect the premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.) Like ACA, Wallace &amp; Pancher determined that GBC's Site Plans failed to conform to ACA's Geotechnical Investigation Report and that this failure caused the water damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Apple spent approximately $300,000.00 to fix the defects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.) Apple also sustained lost profits and damage to its reputation because it closed its business \"for several days\" to make the necessary repairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Apple brings four counts against GBC: (1) breach of contract; (2) professional negligence; (3) negligence; and (4) unjust enrichment. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 32-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. GBC's Third-Party Complaint Against Third-Party Defendants ACA, Jackson Taylor, and Kimball\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 31, 2017, GBC filed its Third-Party Complaint. (ECF No. 24.) GBC asserts one count of indemnification/contribution\n   against each third-party defendant (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) and alleges the facts described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ACA served as the engineering firm for the Applebee's construction project and was responsible for producing a Geotechnical Investigation Report and ensuring that the report's recommendations were followed during construction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18.) Apple's harm resulted from ACA's negligent failure to ensure that the construction complied with the recommendations set forth in its Geotechnical Investigation Report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Jackson Taylor served as the general contractor for the Applebee's construction project and performed the defective work described in Apple's Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) Jackson Taylor knew about the recommendations set forth in ACA's Geotechnical Investigation Report but failed to abide by these recommendations when it constructed the Applebee's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) Apple's harm resulted from Jackson Taylor's negligent failure to conform its construction to the specifications of ACA's Geotechnical Investigation Report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Kimball provided construction services to Apple. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) Kimball supervised the construction of the Applebee's and was responsible for ensuring that the design documents-including ACA's Geotechnical Investigation Report-were followed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) Apple's harm resulted from Kimball's negligent failure to properly supervise the construction and ensure that the construction complied with the design recommendations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Kimball's Cross-claims Against ACA and Jackson Taylor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Third-Party Defendant Kimball asserts cross-claims for indemnification/contribution against ACA and Jackson Taylor. Kimball asserts its crossclaims on the last page of its Answer and Affirmative Defenses to GBC's Third-Party Complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 35). While Kimball's cross-claims are pled sparingly and merely allege that ACA and Jackson Taylor are liable to Kimball for any monies that Kimball is found to owe GBC, Kimball \"incorporates by reference the factual allegations in the Complaint and the Third-Party Complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The Court Will Grant in Part and Deny in Part Jackson Taylor's Motion to Dismiss GBC's Third-Party Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Jackson Taylor articulates four arguments for why this Court should dismiss GBC's third-party claim. The Court will examine these arguments in turn, starting with Jackson Taylor's argument that GBC improperly joined it as a third-party defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    1. GBC Properly Alleged that Jackson Taylor is Derivatively Liable to GBC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, Jackson Taylor asserts that GBC may not join it as a third-party defendant because GBC alleges that Jackson Taylor is liable to Apple instead of alleging that Jackson Taylor is derivatively liable to GBC for GBC's potential liability to Apple. (ECF No. 40 at 5-7.) Jackson Taylor further argues that GBC's third-party claim is improper because GBC alleges that Jackson Taylor's negligence directly and proximately caused the injuries Apple sustained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) In response, GBC argues that it's Third-Party Complaint does not assert that Jackson Taylor is liable directly to Apple, but merely alleges that if GBC were found liable to Apple, Jackson Taylor would be liable to GBC for contribution and common law indemnity. (ECF No. 47 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court finds that GBC properly alleged that Jackson Taylor is derivatively liable. GBC's Third-Party Complaint alleges that, if GBC is found to be liable to Apple, GBC is entitled to indemnification and contribution from Jackson Taylor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 24 at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27.) Accordingly, GBC's third-party claim argues that Jackson Taylor is secondarily liable to GBC should GBC be found liable to Apple. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, GBC's claim against Jackson Taylor satisfies Rule 14's requirement that a defendant allege that the third-party defendant \"is or may be liable to it for all or part of the claim against it.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 14(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Jackson Taylor cites one case from within the Third Circuit to support its argument that GBC improperly alleged that Jackson Taylor is liable to GBC.

Neither Apple's Complaint nor GBC's Third-Party\n   Complaint alleges that Jackson Taylor signed a contract with Apple, much less provides a detailed account of any contractual obligations that Jackson Taylor owed Apple. Accordingly, the Court rejects Jackson Taylor's analogy to\n   <em>\n    EQT\n   </em>\n   and dismisses Jackson Taylor's argument that the gist of the action doctrine prohibits GBC's third-party claim from proceeding to the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Having rejected Jackson Taylor's arguments that GBC's third-party claim should be dismissed for improper joinder and the gist of the action doctrine, the Court turns to the merits of GBC's contribution and indemnity claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    3. GBC Stated a Plausible Claim for Contribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Next, Jackson Taylor argues that this Court must dismiss GBC's third-party contribution claim. Jackson Taylor contends that GBC and Jackson Taylor cannot be classified as joint tortfeasors because they owed different duties to Apple. (ECF No. 40 at 10.) According to Jackson Taylor, GBC's duties to Apple \"related to its preparation, as a design professional, of the Site Plans, while Jackson Taylor's arose from its construction of the [r]estaurant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) GBC responds by arguing that it has plausibly alleged that GBC and Jackson Taylor are joint tortfeasors because their actions united to cause the singular harm-moisture and drainage problems-that Apple suffered. (ECF No. 47 at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court is satisfied that GBC has stated a plausible contribution claim. As GBC argues in its response brief, Apple sustained a single injury-\"water and moisture damage\" (ECF No. 47 at 12)-which plausibly makes GBC and Jackson Taylor \"joint tortfeasors.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8322 (defining \"joint tortfeasors\" as \"two or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the\n   <em>\n    same injury\n   </em>\n   to persons or property.\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It is possible that discovery will uncover evidence to corroborate Jackson Taylor's contention that the duties owed, and injuries inflicted, by Jackson Taylor and GBC were distinct, thus foreclosing GBC's contribution claim. But the Court agrees with GBC's assertion that the nature of GBC's relationship with Jackson Taylor turns on issues of fact that are more properly decided at summary judgment. (ECF No. 47 at 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    4. GBC Did Not State a Plausible Common Law Indemnity Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, Jackson Taylor argues that this Court should dismiss GBC's common law indemnity claim. Jackson Taylor asserts that GBC and Jackson Taylor do not have a legal relationship sufficient to give rise to a common law duty to indemnify and that, therefore, there is no scenario under which GBC could be held liable for Jackson Taylor's acts or omissions. (ECF No. 40 at 9.) GBC does not allege that a legal relationship exists between it and Jackson Taylor, but instead asserts that Pennsylvania law does not require a legal relationship for one party to owe the other a duty to indemnify. (ECF No. 47 at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court holds that GBC failed to state a plausible indemnity claim. GBC has not alleged that it had a legal relationship with Jackson Taylor, much less one that would require GBC to pay damages resulting from Jackson Taylor's negligence. Furthermore, GBC has not alleged that it had any special relationship with Jackson Taylor that would give rise to an extra-contractual duty to indemnify. Because no special relationship exists, Jackson Taylor correctly argues that it would be impossible for GBC to be completely without fault and still be held liable for Jackson Taylor's\n   negligence; either GBC is partially liable, and indemnity is unavailable, or GBC is blameless and has a complete defense to Apple's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Conclusion: The Court Will Grant in Part, and Deny in Part, Jackson Taylor's Motion to Dismiss GBC's Third-Party Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   GBC stated a plausible third-party claim against Jackson Taylor for contribution. Accordingly, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    deny\n   </strong>\n   Jackson Taylor's motion to dismiss as it pertains to GBC's contribution claim. However, GBC failed to state a plausible claim for common law indemnity. Accordingly, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    grant\n   </strong>\n   Jackson Taylor's motion to dismiss as it pertains to GBC's common law indemnity claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \"[I]f a complaint is subject to Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, a district court must permit a curative amendment unless such amendment would be inequitable or futile.\"\n   <em>\n    CollegeSource, Inc. v. AcademyOne, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20Fed.%20Appx.%20116\">\n    597 Fed.

Appx. 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112 (3d Cir. 2017) (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court will grant GBC's request for leave to amend. As noted above, GBC must allege a legal or special relationship between GBC and Jackson Taylor to state a plausible common law indemnity claim. Because the Third-Party Complaint failed to allege in detail the relationship between GBC and Jackson Taylor, the Court cannot conclusively determine that amendment would be futile. Accordingly, the Court will allow GBC to amend its Third-Party Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Court Will Deny Jackson Taylor's Motion to Dismiss Kimball's Cross-claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Jackson Taylor asks this Court to dismiss Kimball's cross-claim. Jackson Taylor argues that Kimball cannot maintain a cross-claim against Jackson Taylor if this Court dismisses GBC's Third-Party Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46 at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This argument is flawed in two respects. First, this Court has already denied Jackson Taylor's motion to dismiss GBC's Third-Party Complaint, instead holding that GBC stated a plausible contribution claim against Jackson Taylor. Second, Jackson Taylor's argument misstates the law. In the Third Circuit, \"a dismissal of the original Complaint as to one of the defendants named therein does not operate as a dismissal of a cross-claim filed against such defendant by a co-defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Aetna Ins.

ACA argues that its contract with Apple-which ACA attached to its motion to dismiss\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   -mandates dismissal of GBC's third-party claim. ACA states that it did not have a contractual relationship with GBC, and asserts that its contract with Apple (1) released ACA from any duty to supervise the work of the third-party contractors who built the Applebee's; (2) gave Apple the option to have ACA provide \"field monitoring services\" or to have ACA review the project plans to ensure that they conformed to the Geotechnical Investigation Report, but that Apple never asked ACA to do so; and (3) contained an indemnity clause, an exculpatory clause, and a limitation of liability clause. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50 at 3-6.) In response, GBC argues that ACA improperly relies on extrinsic documents that are neither attached to nor integral to Apple's Complaint or GBC's Third-Party Complaint.

While Apple's Complaint mentions in passing that Apple \"contracted\" with ACA to \"conduct a geotechnical investigation\" of the Applebee's location \"to guide site planning,\" (ECF No. 1 at \u00b611), Apple's claims-\n   <em>\n    all of which are against GBC\n   </em>\n   -are in no way based on Apple's contract with ACA.
