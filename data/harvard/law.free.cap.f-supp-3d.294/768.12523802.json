Judge Mahoney recommends that I affirm the decision of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) denying an administrative appeal by plaintiff St. Anthony Regional Hospital (the Hospital) related to the calculation of its reimbursement for the treatment of patients insured through Medicare. The Hospital has filed timely objections (Doc. No. 23) to the R &amp; R and the Secretary has filed a response (Doc. No. 26) to the objections.

THE R &amp; R\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Judge Mahoney thoroughly and accurately explained the background regulations used to calculate the reimbursement paid to hospitals that treat patients insured through the Medicare program. Doc. No. 22 at 1-6. As such, I will provide only a brief overview here. Hospitals are paid a fixed rate per patient based on each discharged patient's diagnosis, regardless of how much the hospital actually spends on a particular patient (the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) payment).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Good Samaritan Hosp. v. Shalala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11435\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/402/\">\n    508 U.S. 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 406 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11435\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/402/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11435\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/402/\">\n    124 L.Ed.2d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). This system has the potential to disadvantage a hospital if its patient volume shrinks, as hospitals have fixed costs (such as rent, interest, depreciation and costs associated with regulatory compliance) that do not automatically shrink along with patient volume. To protect a hospital that experiences a 5% or greater reduction in patient volume through no fault of its own, Congress created the Volume Decrease Adjustment (VDA) payment, which is to be used \"as may be necessary to fully compensate the hospital for the fixed costs it incurs in ... providing inpatient hospital services, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(D)(ii). The VDA payment is at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Judge Mahoney summarized the method used to calculate the Hospital's VDA payment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The regulations promulgated by the Secretary in effect during the relevant time period did not provide a specific formula for calculating the VDA payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.92(e)(3) (2009). Instead, the regulation directed that the following factors be considered in determining the VDA payment amount: \"(A) [t]he individual hospital's needs and circumstances, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services in view of minimum staffing requirements imposed by State agencies; (B) [t]he hospital's fixed (and semi-fixed) costs ...; and (C) [t]he length of time the hospital has experienced a decrease in utilization.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 412.92(e)(3)(1). In addition, the regulation provided that the VDA payment could not exceed the difference between the hospital's total Medicare costs and the hospital's DRG payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 412.92(e)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A section of the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual (Manual or PRM), issued around the same time as the regulation, also addressed calculation of the VDA payment:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [A VDA] payment is made to an eligible [hospital] for the fixed costs it incurs in the period in providing inpatient hospital services including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services, not to exceed the difference between the\n   hospital's Medicare inpatient operating cost and the hospital's total DRG revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Fixed costs are those costs over which management has no control. Most truly fixed costs, such as rent, interest, and depreciation, are capital-related costs and are paid on a reasonable cost basis, regardless of volume. Variable costs, on the other hand, are those costs for items and services that vary directly with utilization such as food and laundry costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In a hospital setting, however, many costs are neither perfectly fixed nor perfectly variable, but are semifixed. Semifixed costs are those costs for items and services that are essential for the hospital to maintain operation but also vary somewhat with volume. For purposes of [the VDA payment], many semifixed costs, such as personnel-related costs, may be considered as fixed on a case-by-case basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In evaluating semifixed costs, [the Secretary] consider[s] the length of time the hospital has experienced a decrease in utilization. For a short period of time, most semifixed costs are considered fixed. As the period of decreased utilization continues, [the Secretary] expect[s] that a cost-effective hospital would take action to reduce unnecessary expenses. Therefore, if a hospital did not take such action, some of the semifixed costs may not be included in determining the amount of the [VDA] payment ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   PRM 15-1 \u00a7 2810.1(B) ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, the Hospital's total Medicare costs were $8,348,116, and its DRG payment was $6,273,905. AR 14, 32, 34. The MAC, the Board, and the CMS Administrator all classified the following expenses as variable: (1) purchased laundry services, (2) dietary cost of food, (3) central distribution supplies, (4) drugs and intravenous (IV) solutions, (5) operating supplies, and (6) implantable devices. Nar 12, 30-31. Based on this classification, the Hospital's variable Medicare costs were $1,543,034 and its fixed Medicare costs were $6,805,082. AR 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The [Secretary] determined that the Hospital's VDA payment should be its total Medicare costs, less its variable Medicare costs and its DRG payment (or stated another way, the Hospital's fixed Medicare costs less its DRG payment). AR 7, 14. Thus, the CMS Administrator found that the Hospital's VDA payment should be $531,177 .... AR 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Doc. No. 22 at 2-5 (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Hospital argues that the Secretary's methodology for calculating the VDA payment is arbitrary and capricious because it violates the plain language of the statute and is inconsistent with the example set forth in the Manual. Additionally, the Hospital argues that the Secretary erred in calculating its VDA payment by failing to take into account certain \"semi-fixed\" variables. Judge Mahoney considered each of these bases for overturning the Secretary's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. The Methodology\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Judge Mahoney first found that the Secretary's methodology does not violate the plain language of the statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The statute requires that a hospital be \"fully compensate[d]\" for its fixed Medicare costs through a combination of the VDA payment and the DRG payment (indeed, the Hospital recognizes that the VDA payment need not equal its fixed Medicare costs and that whether its fixed costs have been fully compensated is based on both the VDA and DRG payments). Here, the Hospital received\n   payment (through both the DRG and VDA payments) totaling its fixed Medicare costs. That is all that the plain language of the statute requires. The statute is ambiguous whether a hospital must also receive its usual share of reimbursement (through the DRG payment) for its variable costs. Although the Secretary could have reasonably interpreted the statute to require the usual partial payment for variable Medicare costs in addition to payment for the totality of a hospital's fixed Medicare costs, as advocated by the Hospital, the Secretary's interpretation is also reasonable. It is therefore entitled to [\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   ] deference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Doc. No. 22 at 9. Further, Judge Mahoney found that the Secretary's methodology does not contradict the policy of the statute: \"the Secretary considered the entire DRG payment as compensating a hospital's fixed costs (because the statute does not require that a hospital be compensated for any of its variable costs, even if the DRG payment ordinarily compensates a hospital for some of those costs).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As to whether the Secretary's methodology violates the Manual, Judge Mahoney first considered whether the Secretary's consistency with the Manual is a relevant issue:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As an initial matter, the Manual contains interpretative rules adopted without notice and comment, and it is intended to provide guidance without binding the Secretary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Paul-Ramsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413785\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/50/522/#p528\">\n    50 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   527 n.4.

That \"program Inpatient Operating Cost\" in the example does not include a hospital's variable costs is further supported by another example in the Manual, which\n   involves calculating whether a hospital had excess staff that could have been reduced:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Hospital B's nursing staff[ ] ... exceeds the core staff [allowed] ....

The Calculation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Turning to the issue of whether the Secretary erred in calculating the VDA payment by failing to take into account certain \"semifixed\" costs, Judge Mahoney stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Secretary determined that the Hospital's costs related to purchased laundry services, food, central distribution supplies, drugs, IV solutions, operating room supplies, and implantable devices were variable and thus, not compensable. The Hospital argued below that none of its costs should be classified as variable because it reduced its costs as much as possible, and \"[t]he only costs incurred by [the Hospital] for ... supplies and services were directly related to the care provided to its actual patients,\" so all its costs were necessary for the hospital to maintain operation. AR 77, 256. The Hospital essentially makes that same argument on appeal, although the Hospital clarifies that not all its costs were used in connection with treating patients (as suggested below), arguing instead that certain minimum levels of food and supplies must be maintained in case of emergency and thus, cannot be reduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Neither the statute nor the regulation defines fixed costs. The Hospital relies on the definitions of fixed and semifixed costs that appear in the Manual: fixed costs are defined as costs \"over which management has no control,\" and semifixed costs are defined as costs \"for items and services that are essential for the hospital to maintain operation but also vary somewhat with volume.\" PRM 15-1 \u00a7 2810.1(B). The Hospital argues that the costs classified as variable are actually semifixed costs because they were essential for the hospital to maintain operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Hospital's argument misses the mark. The Hospital ignores the definition of variable costs that appears in the Manual: \"those costs for items and services that vary directly with utilization[,] such as food and laundry costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Manual explicitly recognizes that food and laundry costs-two categories of expenses at issue here-are variable costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Hospital argues that whether an expense is classified [as] variable must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Although the decision to compensate\n   semifixed costs is determined on a case-by-case basis,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203050893\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203050893\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   the same cannot be said for variable costs. The regulation provides that when determining the VDA payment amount, the MAC should consider an \"individual hospital's needs and circumstances, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services in view of minimum staffing requirements imposed by state agencies\"; a hospital's \"fixed (and semi-fixed) costs\"; and \"[t]he length of time the hospital has experienced a decrease in utilization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.92\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3)(i). At the time of the regulation's adoption, further explanation appeared in the Federal Register:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Fixed costs are defined as those over which management has no control. Many truly fixed costs, for example, rent, interest and depreciation, are capital-related costs and are paid on a reasonable cost basis, regardless of patient volume. Variable costs, on the other hand, are those costs for items and services that vary directly with utilization. However, in a hospital setting, many costs are neither perfectly fixed nor perfectly variable, but are semifixed. Semifixed costs are those costs for items and services that are essential for the hospital to maintain operation but which will also vary with volume. For purposes of this adjustment, many semifixed costs, such as personnel-related costs, may be considered as fixed costs on a case-by-case basis.\n   <em>\n    An adjustment will not be made for truly variable costs, such as food and laundry services.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Medicare Program, Fiscal Year 1990; Mid-Year Changes to the Inpatient Hospital Prospective Payment System,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015150\">\n    55 Fed.

Given its proper context, the Hospital argues that, \"[t]he VDA statute ... addresses reimbursement outside of and in addition to the normal [DRG] system in order to compensate hospitals for their fixed costs in certain extraordinary circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.

The Hospital does not address whether the Secretary's interpretation of the statute is entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference, or whether an exception to such deference applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Hospital's argument that it must be reimbursed for variable cost beyond those covered in the normal DRG system is without support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DRG system compensates a hospital for a set amount of both variable and fixed costs associated with treating a particular patient.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(a)(4) (\"[T]he term 'operating costs of inpatient hospital services' includes all routine operating costs, ancillary service operating costs, and special care unit operating costs with respect to inpatient hospital services\n   <em>\n    as such costs are determined on an average per admission or per discharge basis\n   </em>\n   ,\" (emphasis added) ); \u00a7 1395ww(a)(1)(A)(i) (\"The Secretary ... shall not recognize as reasonable ... costs for the provision of such services by a hospital for a cost reporting period to the extent such costs exceed the applicable percentage ....of the average of such costs for all hospitals in the same grouping as such hospital for the comparable time periods\"). However, the fact that a DRG payment will typically cover some variable costs is a factual reality, not a legal requirement. As Judge Mahoney noted, the DRG payment is set at a standard rate to encourage hospitals to provide services at lower costs. Thus, a hospital is rewarded for treating a patient efficiently and punished for treating a patient inefficiently.\n   <em>\n    Cnty. of L.A. v.

Thus, while the DRG system allows for variable costs, the VDA system specifically excludes them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Hospital incorrectly frames the issue by claiming to have lost reimbursement for variable expenses otherwise authorized by statute.

The Hospital objects that Judge Mahoney \"interpreted the VDA's statute's silence regarding the usual reimbursement of a hospital's variable costs as ambiguous\" and relatedly \"admitted that the statute was ambiguous and that the Hospital's interpretation best served the purpose of the VDA, but then failed to recommend that this Court overturn the Secretary's decision.\" Doc.

Thus, the CMS Administrator found that the Hospital's VDA payment should be $531,177 ($8,348,116-$1,543,034-$6,273,905) (the MAC would have come to the same conclusion but for some mathematical errors).

From my review, no federal court has ruled on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The statute provides that the VDA payment serves to \"adjust[ ]\" the DRG payment \"as may be necessary to fully compensate the hospital for [its] fixed [Medicare] costs ..., including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(D)(ii). The Secretary calculated the VDA payment as the difference\n   between the Hospital's fixed Medicare costs and its DRG payment. Thus, the Secretary's position is that the Hospital was fully compensated for its fixed Medicare costs by the DRG payment and VDA payment in combination, the amount of which totaled the Hospital's fixed Medicare costs. The Hospital argues that because the DRG payment compensates it for both fixed and variable Medicare costs, only that portion of the DRG payment related to fixed costs should be subtracted from its fixed Medicare costs to determine the amount of the VDA payment. The Hospital argues that under the plain language of the statute, it is entitled to payment for a portion of its fixed and variable Medicare costs as usual (by the DRG payment), plus an adjustment (the VDA payment) to compensate it for its total fixed Medicare costs. The Secretary rejected the methodology advocated by the Hospital (and employed by the Board) precisely because it would compensate the Hospital for the totality of its fixed Medicare costs, plus some of its variable Medicare costs, which the Secretary does not believe is required by the statute. AR 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Secretary's interpretation does not violate the plain language of the statute. The statute requires that a hospital be \"fully compensate[d]\" for its fixed Medicare costs through a combination of the VDA payment and the DRG payment (indeed, the Hospital recognizes that the VDA payment need not equal its fixed Medicare costs and that whether its fixed costs have been fully compensated is based on both the VDA and DRG payments). Here, the Hospital received payment (through both the DRG and VDA payments) totaling its fixed Medicare costs. That is all that the plain language of the statute requires. The statute is ambiguous whether a hospital must also receive its usual share of reimbursement (through the DRG payment) for its variable costs. Although the Secretary could have reasonably interpreted the statute to require the usual partial payment for variable Medicare costs in addition to payment for the totality of a hospital's fixed Medicare costs, as advocated by the Hospital, the Secretary's interpretation is also reasonable. It is therefore entitled to deference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Hospital relies heavily on the Secretary's adoption of new regulations that apply prospectively to cost-reporting periods beginning on October 1, 2017.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.92\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3).

Nevertheless, we understand why hospitals might take the view that CMS should make an effort, in some way, to ascertain whether a portion of [DRG] payments can be allocated or attributed to fixed costs in order to fulfill the statutory mandate to \"fully compensate\" a qualifying [hospital] for its fixed costs. Accordingly, after considering these views, ... we proposed to prospectively change how the MACs calculate the [VDA payment] and require that the MACs compare estimated Medicare revenue for fixed costs to the hospital's fixed costs to remove any conceivable possibility that a hospital that qualifies for the [VDA payment] could ever be less than fully compensated for fixed costs as a result of the application of the adjustment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <em>\n    Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System and Policy Changes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2037990\">\n    82 Fed.

In cases where, like here, a hospital's fixed Medicare costs were less than the previous year's fixed Medicare costs adjusted for inflation, the Secretary's employed methodology ensured that all of a hospital's fixed costs would be covered by the DRG and VDA payments in combination. That the Hospital's fixed Medicare costs may not have been fully reimbursed if subject to the cap has no bearing on the reasonableness of the Secretary's action here: the Hospital was not subject to the cap and its fixed Medicare costs were fully reimbursed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Merely because the Secretary changed his interpretation of the statute does not prove that the previous interpretation was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   [T]hat an agency interpretation contradicts a prior agency position is not fatal.

The Hospital cites no final agency decision to support its argument that the Secretary applied inconsistent methodologies, relying instead on a statement in the preamble to the proposed new regulations in the Federal Register: \"[I]n ... adjudications, the [Board] and the CMS Administrator have recognized that ...

The Hospital is correct that when read in isolation, examples in the Manual support that the VDA payment should be calculated as a hospital's total Medicare costs (including variable costs) less a hospital's DRG payment: the examples explain that when a hospital's \"Program Inpatient Operating Cost [is] less than\" the cap, \"its [VDA payment amount] is the entire difference between [its] Program Inpatient Operating Cost and [its] DRG payments.\" PRM 15-1 \u00a7 2810.1(D), Example A (illustrating VDA payment not subject to the cap);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PRM 15-1 \u00a7 2810.1(D), Example B (illustrating VDA payment affected by the cap).

Thus, the VDA payment \"allows an increase in cost up to the prior year's total Program Inpatient Operating Cost ... increased\" for inflation.\" PRM 15-1 \u00a7 2810.1(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   On the other hand, the Manual makes clear that a VDA payment should compensate a hospital for its fixed and semifixed costs, but not its variable costs. PRM 15-1 \u00a7 2810.1(B). And the Manual recognizes that a MAC should \"evaluat[e] semifixed costs\" to determine whether a hospital could have \"take[n] action to reduce unnecessary expenses\"; if so, the Manual instructs that \"some of the semifixed costs may not be included in determining the amount of the [VDA] payment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3387206\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/768/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This provision seems at odds with the example's use of total Medicare costs (as opposed to fixed and semifixed costs) in determining the VDA amount. The Board explained in a 2006 decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   [T]he text [of the Manual] explicitly dictates that fixed (and semi-fixed) costs may comprise the [VDA payment], [but] the use of the term \"operating costs\" in the subsequent examples may suggest that variable costs could be included.

That \"Program Inpatient Operating Cost\" in the example does not include a hospital's variable costs is further supported by another example in the Manual, which involves calculating whether a hospital had excess staff that could have been reduced:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Hospital B's nursing staff[ ] ... exceeds the core staff [allowed].... Hospital B is eligible for a [VDA] payment ..., but its cost ... must first be reduced to eliminate the salary costs of the ... excess of core staff.

Thus, \"Program Inpatient Operating Cost\" does not necessarily mean a hospital's total Medicare costs, but rather, the costs a hospital is eligible to have reimbursed (which does not include variable costs). The Secretary could reasonably read the Manual as supporting its methodology of\n   the difference between a hospital's fixed and semifixed costs (a hospital's eligible costs) and a hospital's DRG payment. And as discussed above, the Secretary has consistently employed the methodology used here and is not bound by the Manual. Thus, any inconsistency with the Manual is irrelevant. The methodology employed by the Secretary was reasonable, and the Secretary's resulting decision was not arbitrary and capricious nor inconsistent with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV. VARIABLE COSTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Hospital argues that even if the Secretary's methodology was permissible, the Secretary's exclusion of certain costs as variable was arbitrary and capricious and not supported by substantial evidence. The Secretary determined that the Hospital's costs related to purchased laundry services, food, central distribution supplies, drugs, IV solutions, operating room supplies, and implantable devices were variable and thus, not compensable. The Hospital argued below that none of its costs should be classified as variable because it reduced its costs as much as possible, and \"[t]he only costs incurred by [the Hospital] for ... supplies and services were directly related to the care provided to its actual patients,\" so all its costs were necessary for the hospital to maintain operation. AR 77, 256. The Hospital essentially makes that same argument on appeal, although the Hospital clarifies that not all its costs were used in connection with treating patients (as suggested below), arguing instead that certain minimum levels of food and supplies must be maintained in case of emergency and thus, cannot be reduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Neither the statute nor the regulation defines fixed costs. The Hospital relies on the definitions of fixed and semifixed costs that appear in the Manual: fixed costs are defined as costs \"over which management has no control,\" and semifixed costs are defined as costs \"for items and services that are essential for the hospital to maintain operation but also vary somewhat with volume.\" PRM 15-1 \u00a7 2810.1(B). The Hospital argues that the costs classified as variable are actually semifixed costs because they were essential for the hospital to maintain operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Hospital's argument misses the mark. The Hospital ignores the definition of variable costs that appears in the Manual: \"those costs for items and services that vary directly with utilization[,] such as food and laundry costs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203050893\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Manual explicitly recognizes that food and laundry costs-two categories of expenses at issue here-are variable costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Hospital argues that whether an expense is classified is variable must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Variable costs, on the other hand, are those costs for items and services that vary directly with utilization. However, in a hospital setting, many costs are\n   neither perfectly fixed nor perfectly variable, but are semifixed. Semifixed costs are those costs for items and services that are essential for the hospital to maintain operation but which will also vary with volume. For purposes of this adjustment, many semifixed costs, such as personnel-related costs, may be considered as fixed costs on a case-by-case basis.\n   <em>\n    An adjustment will not be made for truly variable costs, such as food and laundry services.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Medicare Program, Fiscal Year 1990; Mid-Year Changes to the Inpatient Hospital Prospective Payment System,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015150\">\n    55 Fed.

Neither the statute nor the regulation prevents the Secretary from categorically excluding certain costs as variable, and guidance issued at the time of the regulation's adoption (as well as the Manual) supports the Secretary's decision to categorically exclude certain costs as variable.

The DRG payment, on the other hand, compensates the hospital for costs it incurs treating patients, which necessarily include variable costs it incurs, such as for a patient's food and laundry. Thus, a hospital could not \"take action ... to reduce\" the variable costs covered by the DRG payment, because those costs are being incurred due to utilization-for example, a hospital treating patients who have to be fed and whose sheets have to be laundered. Nevertheless, it is unclear from the statute (and the regulation) whether these variable costs should be compensated, regardless of whether the hospital can do anything to avoid them. The Secretary's interpretation of the statute is reasonable and thus owed deference, and I may not reject it merely because I find a \"competing interpretation[ ] [would] best serve[ ] the regulatory purpose.\"\n    <em>\n     Thomas Jefferson Univ.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39585\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/504/#p510\">\n     512 U.S. at 512\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39585\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/504/#p510\">\n     114 S.Ct. 2381\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    Language in the Manual itself also supports that the examples relied on by the Hospital here are not meant to bind the Secretary: the Manual includes a note after the examples, stating that \"[i]f [a MAC] determines that the procedures in this section, when applied to a specific adjustment request, generate an anomalous result, the [MAC] may request a review by [the Board and CMS Administrator].\" PRM 15-1 \u00a7 2810.1(D).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
