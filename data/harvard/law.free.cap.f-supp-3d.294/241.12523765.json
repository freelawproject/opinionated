Both parties have moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, the Commissioner's motion is granted and Brush's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 12, 2012, Brush applied for disability and disability insurance benefits under Sections 216(i) and 233(d) of the Social Security Act for allegedly disabling injuries to her back and neck, as well as severe anxiety and depression.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certified Administrative Record, filed Apr. 25, 2017 (Docket # 13) (\"R.\"), at 17, 167, 331-34. The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied Brush's application on July 12, 2012. R. 167, 196-207. She requested a review of the SSA's decision by an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), R. 208-09, and hearings were held on June 14, and September 20, 2013,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 46-72, 73-104. In a written decision dated November 25, 2013, the ALJ found that Brush was not disabled. R. 168-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brush appealed the decision to the Appeals Council, which remanded the case on May 13, 2015, for rehearing before the ALJ. R. 190-93. The Appeals Council instructed the ALJ to update the medical record, reassess Brush's maximum residual functional capacity during \"the entire period at issue,\" and obtain additional evidence from a vocational expert.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On December 4, 2015, a supplemental hearing was held before the same ALJ. R. 105-60. In a written decision dated March 14, 2016, the ALJ again found Brush not disabled. R. 14-36. Brush requested review by the Appeals Council, which denied her request on August 25, 2016. R. 1-4. This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Hearings Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Brush was represented by attorney John Lindholm at the June 14, and September 20, 2013 hearings before the ALJ, R. 48, 75, and by attorney Scott Goldstein at the December 4, 2015 hearing, R. 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Brush injured her neck and back while she was working as a custodian for a school district where she had held various jobs for about twelve years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 52-53, 117-19. On the date of the incident, June 21, 2011, a dolly she was using slipped and she awkwardly moved her body while trying to catch it. R. 432. She was 38 at the time of the accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 50, 182. Brush said that after the accident she had chronic neck and lower back pain with weakness in both arms and frequent numbness in her fingers causing her to \"drop mugs constantly.\" R. 133, 135. The numbness in her fingers was \"really frustrating,\" because it limited her ability to enjoy her hobbies, R. 61-62, while the weakness in her arms made lifting objects \"difficult\" and she could not lift more than \"a gallon of water.\" R. 138. In addition to upper body issues, she also lost sensation in her right leg and could not sit for more than a half-hour at a time or walk for more than 15 to 20 minutes without rest. R. 136-37. As a result, she started to use a cane while walking outside. R. 64, 137. Additionally, because of the numbness in her right leg and unpredictable back spasms, she also worried about falling. R. 67. In fact, she claimed to have \"fallen in [her] home four times because of [the spasms]\" and, out of an abundance of caution, installed a shower bar. R. 55-56, 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The accident also aggravated her anxiety and depression, making it \"100 times worse,\" R. 121, and she began to experience panic attacks \"probably about once a week,\" R. 139. She relied on her partner to avoid more frequent panic attacks and generally avoided \"go[ing] into stores by [her]self.\" R. 139-40. Her pain also reduced her ability to concentrate, making her \"thoughts just wander\" when she tried to read. R. 140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With regard to her daily activities, Brush testified that she started her days by lying for \"about an hour\" on a heating pad, and then would repeat this practice in the afternoon and evening. R. 66. It usually\n   would \"take[ ] [her] several hours to get ready.\" R. 137. Most days, she would stay at home with her partner, who was also disabled, and watch movies and television, \"sitting for probably 15 to 20 minutes\" at a time and frequently changing positions. R. 64, 67, 138. She would also go on walks \"every now and then, outside.\" R. 64. When not otherwise occupied, she performed \"light\" household chores, such as cleaning the kitchen and laundry, and reported that she \"just ha[s] to be careful how [she] do[es] things.\" R. 65-66. Being careful reportedly included employing a back brace when cleaning to minimize pain and lying on her heating pad after completing a chore to treat the resulting pain.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   She would also leave the house \"several times a week\" to attend doctors' appointments, physical therapy, and to make \"small trips to the grocery store\" and the post office. R. 137;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   R. 56. She testified that she drove, but frequently pulled to the side of the road because she would \"get dizzy and panicky.\" R. 54, 65. She was usually accompanied by her partner on these trips and testified that \"if it was just myself, I would probably hardly ever leave the house.\" R. 65, 67. At the time of her first hearing in 2013, she was not a member of any social organizations, houses of worship, or any other similar organization. R. 67. She also reported losing her friends and hobbies as a result of the injury and, as an example, noted that she would miss her sister's wedding the following day because she was \"not even up to attending [it].\" R. 81, 140. While she vacationed with her parents every summer on Cape Cod, \"it was pretty difficult because of my sleeping patterns, just everything.\" R. 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following her injury, Brush reported that she was initially prescribed Tramodol and Motrin, but was later transitioned to Oxycodone (which reportedly \"help[ed] with the pain ... [but was] exhausting\") and Advil. R. 55, 129-30. She also continued to take anti-anxiety medications, which her psychiatrist increased in the period following her injury, and was prescribed an antidepressant. R. 79-80, 119-21. In 2012, she underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, but felt \"that [she] got worse. Because the pain in [her] back [ ] increased.\" R. 55. She also reported falling twice after the surgery, as a result of back spasms. R. 56. She subsequently explained, however, that in the six months after the surgery, the numbness in her fingers had, for the most part, \"gotten better.\" R. 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the third hearing, the ALJ called a vocational expert (\"VE\") as a witness. R. 147. Brush had testified that her past work as a custodian involved \"mop[ping] the halls [and] large bathrooms[,] ... clean[ing] after functions,\" R. 52, and \"empty[ing] wastepaper baskets,\" R. 149. Based on this testimony, the VE classified Brush's past work as a custodian as \"heavy work\" and \"unskilled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ALJ then asked the VE to consider a person of the plaintiff's age, education, and work history, who could perform sedentary work, but who could only occasionally push, pull and crouch; must employ a cane to ambulate; could frequently flex, extend, and rotate the neck, and handle and finger objects; could understand, remember, and execute simple work and adapt to routine work place changes; and could occasionally interact with supervisors, coworkers and the general public. R. 150. The VE testified that such a person could perform the jobs of document preparer, stem mounter, addresser, and final assembler, all of which existed in significant numbers in the economy. R. 150-51. Upon clarification by the ALJ that the hypothetical individual could frequently move her neck, including but not requiring holding the neck in a \"flexed position\" for\n   most of the work day, the VE confirmed that such a person could still perform those jobs. R. 153-54. The VE acknowledged that while the Dictionary of Occupational Titles does not address neck movement, based on the VE's own experience he believed that an individual \"limited to being only able to flex, rotate, or extend the neck on only an occasional basis\" could still perform such jobs. R. 155. But if the hypothetical person \"can't keep their head in a flexed position downward\" on at least an occasional basis, it would \"make it difficult\" to perform such jobs. R. 156. Last, in response to questioning by Brush's attorney, the VE testified that if the hypothetical person could sit, stand, and walk for only two hours each out of an eight-hour day, could do each for only 15 minutes at a time, and could lift only up to ten pounds occasionally, then there would be no jobs available at a significant level in the economy. R. 157.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Both Brush and the Commissioner have provided summaries of the medical evidence contained in the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 5-7; Comm'r Mem. at 4-21. The summaries are substantially consistent with each other. The Court had directed the parties to specify any objections they had to the opposing party's summary of the record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, filed Apr. 27, 2017 (Docket # 14), \u00b6 5, and neither party has done so. Accordingly, the Court adopts Brush's and the Commissioner's summaries of the medical evidence as accurate and complete for purposes of the issues raised in this suit. We discuss the medical evidence pertinent to the adjudication of this case in section III below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The ALJ denied Brush's application for disability benefits on March 14, 2016. R. 14. Following the five-step test set forth in SSA regulations, the ALJ found at step one that Brush had not engaged in \"substantial gainful activity\" since her alleged disabling injury on June 21, 2011. R. 19. At step two, the ALJ found that Brush had the following \"severe impairments\": adjustment disorder, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, status post anterior cervical discectomy and fusion operation, chronic pain syndrome, lumbago, and cervical, thoracic, and lumbar pain syndrome.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At step three, the ALJ concluded that none of Brush's severe impairments singly or in combination met or medically equaled an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. part 404, subpart p, appendix 1. R. 20. The ALJ gave \"special consideration ... to Listing 1.04\n   <em>\n    Disorders of the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    spine\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 \u00a7 1.04 (\"Listing \u00a7 1.04\"), but concluded that Brush did not meet or equal the listing because there was \"no evidence in the record of motor loss accompanied by sensory or reflex loss,\" \"spinal arachnoiditis,\" or \"spinal stenosis with pseudoclaudication,\" and Brush \"retain[ed] the ability to ambulate effectively.\" R. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The ALJ also considered whether Brush's mental impairments\"considered singly and in combination\" met Listings 12.04, Affective disorders, or 12.06 Anxiety-related disorders,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 12.04, 12.06 (\"Listing \u00a7 12.04\" and \"Listing \u00a7 12.06\"). R. 20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The ALJ found that Brush did not meet any of the \"paragraph B\" criteria for Listing \u00a7\u00a7 12.04 and 12.06. R. 20-21. In her activities of daily living, the ALJ noted that Brush's pain and resultant loss of concentration \"do not prevent her from living independently, driving, shopping, cooking, cleaning, attending parties, going on family vacations, and applying for 'hundreds' of jobs as required by the State of New York,\" and the ALJ therefore found that she has only a mild restriction in activities of daily living. R. 20. While recognizing that her anxiety and depression caused interference with her relationships, the ALJ found that Brush was still able to \"participate in celebrations, function[ ] appropriately in the clinical setting, ha[ve] a long-term relationship with her domestic partner, and attend[ ] family gatherings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the ALJ concluded that Brush experienced only \"moderate difficulties\" in social functioning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As for her claim that she had difficulties with concentration, persistence, or pace, the ALJ credited Brush's claim that her chronic pain interferes with her concentration, but concluded these difficulties were less than marked because she \"report[ed] watching television, reading, and applying for multiple jobs,\" engaging in hobbies, and managing her own funds and condo. R. 20-21. Finally, the ALJ found no evidence of decompensation of an extended duration. R. 21. Because Brush exhibited no \"marked\" limitations or any episodes of decompensation, she did not satisfy the paragraph B criteria. R. 20-21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Having found that Brush could not meet Listing \u00a7\u00a7 1.04, 12.04, or 12.06, the ALJ next assessed Brush's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"). R. 21. The ALJ found that Brush could\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   perform sedentary work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(a) except can only occasionally\n   push and pull; must ambulate with an assistive device; can handle and finger frequently bilaterally; can frequently flex, extend, and rotate the neck; can constantly hold the neck in one position including the flexion position; can occasionally crouch and stoop; can understand, remember, and carry out simple work; adapt to routine workplace changes; occasionally interact with supervisor, co-workers, and the public; and cannot work at unprotected heights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As for her physical impairments, the ALJ credited Brush's claim of back and neck impairments caused by her June 2011 fall, but found that the available neurological findings and other objective medical tests did not support her subjective claims as to the degree of resulting impairment or the persistence of the pain. R. 22-25. For instance, the ALJ noted that despite her claims of numbness, neurological diagnostic tests were repeatedly negative and she exhibited no signs of sensory or reflex deficits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, while MRIs had at one time revealed disc herniation and levoscoliosis, she had since undergone various forms of treatment which she reported were effective and, according to her doctor, she \"retained [a] normal range of motion in her upper and lower extremities, normal strength, and normal sensation.\" R. 23. The ALJ noted that in December 2011, she reported pain medication brought her \"80% relief,\" and that in August 2014, she claimed massage therapy resulted in \"an almost complete relief of her pain.\" R. 23, 25. In fact, one doctor around this time viewed Brush's pain as attributable to \"muscular issues and not neurological ones.\" R. 23. The ALJ noted that, after Brush underwent an anterior cervical discesctomy and fusion in 2012, her reported pain and range of motion did not change apart from temporary reported improvements, that imaging was negative for abnormalities, and that she \"retained [an] essentially normal range of motion, strength, and sensation in all other body parts,\" except her neck and low back. R. 24. In accordance with these findings, the ALJ found that Brush could perform \"sedentary work with restrictions regarding neck use, crouching or stooping, lifting, pushing, and pulling.\" R. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In reaching this RFC conclusion as to Brush's physical abilities, the ALJ evaluated the opinions of the various treating physicians and considered opinion evidence as to Brush's functional capacities. R. 25, 27-32. He specifically relied on the August 2013 medical opinion of Dr. Jean Bachar, finding that the neurological results supported \"the above noted residual functional capacity.\" R. 24. The ALJ also accorded great weight to the opinions of Dr. Marc Berezin, an impartial medical examiner, and Dr. Steven Weinstein, an independent medical examiner, who both examined Brush on multiple occasions, reviewed her medical history, issued opinions \"consistent with the record as a whole\" and possessed \"a longitudinal understanding of her condition.\" R. 27-28. Both doctors were also specialists in relevant fields: Dr. Berezin in orthopedics, and Dr. Weinstein in physical medicine, rehabilitation, and pain management.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The opinions of Dr. Enrique Sanz and Dr. Sunitha Polepalle were accorded \"some weight,\" because they were \"generally consistent\" with the notes and opinions of contemporaneous examining physicians, but accorded less weight because they were given prior to Brush's surgery and the doctors did not review Brush's other medical records. R. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The ALJ accorded little weight to the opinions of Dr. Ammaji Manyam, Mr. Kevin Stafford (a physical therapist), Dr. Jean Bachar, Dr. Robert DeSantis, and Dr. Marc Levinson because the opinions either predated Brush's surgery, were not based on or consistent with the medical records,\n   or were not supported by \"objective\" medical evidence. R. 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As for her mental impairments, the ALJ found that the record \"reflects the claimant has limitations, but not to the degree alleged.\" R. 29. The ALJ relied extensively on the notes of Dr. Nelson Hidalgo, observing that the 'bulk of the[ ] records ... discuss the claimant's relationship with her boyfriend, living independently in her condo, traveling to Cape Cod for a family vacation, relationships with her nephew, and the claimant's displeasure with having to look for other work.\" R. 25. The ALJ noted, however, that the notes did not reflect side effects of medication or functional deficits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither did the record reflect functional loss associated with panic attacks R. 26. Rather, the ALJ weighed heavily Brush's own testimony that \"she can feel a panic attack coming on and uses medicine and coping techniques to prevent the panic attack from manifesting in any significant way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ also credited the opinions of several doctors that Brush had mild limitations with concentration. R. 30-31. As a result, the ALJ found that the record did not reflect a deterioration in Brush's functioning commensurate with her alleged functional loss related to her mental impairments. R. 26, 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In reaching his conclusion on Brush's mental RFC, the ALJ accorded great weight to Dr. Leslie Helprin, a consultative examiner; Dr. J. Dambrocia, a New York state agency medical examiner; and Dr. Robert Conciatori, an independent medical examiner, because all their opinions were \"consistent with the medical record as a whole\" and they were \"familiar with the disability program.\" R. 30-31. Dr. Conciatori also had a \"longitudinal understanding\" of Brush's condition. R. 31. In contrast, Dr. Robert Hidalgo, Dr. Paul Schefflein, Dr. Martin Ogulnick, and Dr. Jeffrey Newton's opinions received little weight because the ALJ found their conclusions were inconsistent with their notes and the record as a whole or not based on mental status exams.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the ALJ accorded little weight to Global Assessment Functioning scores\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   provided by many of the above mental health practitioners because they represented Brush's functioning only \"at the time of the exam.\" R. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Having weighed the credibility of various doctors' opinions, the ALJ then evaluated Brush's credibility. R. 32-33. The ALJ concluded that Brush's claims as to her impairments were \"not wholly credible.\" R. 32. First, the ALJ questioned the candidness of her account of her abilities. He noted that despite allegations that she was completely disabled, Brush could reportedly attend birthday parties, a July 4th gathering, a Memorial Day celebration, and family vacations on Cape Cod, in addition to living and driving independently, and enjoying various hobbies requiring concentration and fine finger movement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With this view of the evidence, the ALJ characterized Brush's testimony as \"fraught with inconsistencies\" and \"lack[ing] veracity to support her complaints.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, Brush received various treatments following her injury and regularly reported to her physicians that the treatments were improving her condition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ viewed this testimony as contradicting her claim of disability. R. 32-33.

To determine whether an individual can meet\n   the exertional requirements of work in the national economy, the ALJ must determine how many pounds a claimant can lift and how frequently she can lift that weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Here, Eghazaly's statement provided no such guidance. For this reason alone, the ALJ did not err in discounting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, the ALJ fairly concluded that the opinion \"was not supported by the medical evidence\" in the record, R. 29, because the opinion contradicts a March 2013 report of Dr. Jacobs, a treating source, who observed that Brush had 5/5 strength in her shoulders and wrists, normal reflexes, intact sensation, and that she walked with a normal gait and station. R. 716.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As a result, the ALJ had \"good reasons,\"\n   <em>\n    Halloran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p31\">\n    362 F.3d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for giving very little weight to Eghazaly's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Veino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319613\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/578/#p588\">\n    312 F.3d at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (treating sources \"need not be given controlling weight where they are contradicted by other substantial evidence in the record.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Additionally, as the contemporaneous physical exam findings were indeed \"largely normal,\" the ALJ did not mischaracterize them. R. 29. The most adverse finding in the June 2013 examination (actually conducted by Eghazaly) is that Brush had 12 degrees of extension in her lumbar region while a normal individual has a 25 degree extension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 765-66. Otherwise, the examination reports cervical and lumbar testing close to a normal range (e.g., 40 degree right lateral flexion when normal is 45 degrees) and reports negative straight leg raise tests bilaterally.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319613\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/578/#p588\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, in the October 2011 exam that Brush cites extensively,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 13, Dr. Levinson reports testing \"within normal limits\" for sensation, strength, and tenderness in the upper extremities; some decreased range of motion, tenderness, and bilateral spasm in the lumbar spine, but \"normal\" lumbar rhythm, bilateral sacroiliac mobility, and right rotation with flexion; and testing \"within normal limits\" of range of motion, muscle strength, and tenderness in the lower extremities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 433-34. Brush does correctly note some abnormal findings in the cervical spine,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 13, but these results are not overwhelmingly negative,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 433. Additionally, Brush quotes the doctor's observations of her limited ability to ambulate during both the June 2013 and October 2011 exams,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 13, but such observations were not the objective \"physical exam findings\" that the ALJ was referring to,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 29, which were rather those identified by Dr. Levinson in the June 2011 exam underneath the heading \"Physical Examination,\" R. 433. Accordingly, we find that the ALJ did not err in his decision to accord little weight to Eghazaly's opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Brush also objects to the \"very little weight\" given Dr. DeSantis's opinion that she could not perform sedentary work, contending that the ALJ misconstrued Brush's hearing testimony about her lifting capacity in rejecting Dr. DeSantis's opinion. Pl. Mem. at 14-15. As the ALJ noted, however, Dr. DeSantis is a chiropractor, and because a chiropractor is not an \"acceptable medical source,\" an ALJ is not required to give a chiropractor's opinions controlling weight under the Commissioner's regulations for treating sources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diaz v.

Sept. 12, 2017) (citing cases). Thus, the ALJ did not need to consider the treating source rule in giving his opinions \"very little weight.\" R. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In any event, Brush's testimony was only one of several reasons why the ALJ gave Dr. DeSantis's opinion little weight. The ALJ also reasoned that Dr. DeSantis's opinion was \"not well supported by the claimant's admitted activities of daily living, the exams from multiple independent medical examiners [i.e., Drs. Weinstein and Berezin], [and] the objective findings in the record.\" R. 29. We find that these reasons support the ALJ's decision. For instance, the ALJ correctly observed that Dr. Weinstein, a specialist in physical medicine, rehabilitation, and pain, contradicted Dr. DeSantis's accounts of Brush's capacity, because Dr. Weinstein found only \"limited objective abnormality that [would] prevent[ ] this claimant from working in some capacity\" and that Brush could \"exert up to 20 pounds of force occasionally and up to 10 pounds of force frequently.\" R. 969. Likewise, Dr. Berezin, another orthopedic specialist, concluded in December 2015 that Brush had only a \"moderate (50%) degree of disability.\" R. 1028. Additionally, the claimant testified to her ability to clean, cook, sit, stand, walk outside, and leave the house for shopping.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 54, 65-66, 137, 143, 612-13, 967. Last, objective testing from Dr. Jacobs in 2012 and 2013 showed that Brush's surgery had been successful, that she reported consistent improvement and reduced pain and numbness, and that she showed five out of five upper extremity strength and two plus reflexes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 715-16, 722-24, 725-26. From Brush's testimony, Dr. Jacob's examinations, and the contrary opinions of Drs. Weinstein and Berezin, it was reasonable of the ALJ to conclude that Dr. DeSantis had not accurately assessed Brush's functional limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In contrast to the weight given to the opinions of Drs. DeSantis and Levinson, the ALJ gave great weight to the opinions of Drs. Berezin and Weinstein. R. 27. We find no error in that choice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ALJ granted these opinions deference because each doctor had a longitudinal view of the case, the opinions changed with\n   Brush's various treatments, the doctors' opinions were consistent with the record as a whole, the doctors cited to objective medical evidence to support their conclusions, and both doctors were specialists in relevant areas. R. 27. In so reasoning, the ALJ referenced each of the \u00a7 404.1527 factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341296\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/370/#p374\">\n    802 F.3d at 375-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Having examined these doctors' reports,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 962-69 (Dr. Weinstein's second evaluation), 1025-29 (Dr. Berezin's fourth evaluation), we find the ALJ's reasons supported by substantial evidence. Both doctors had access to Brush's medical records at the time of their examinations and provided summaries of her medical history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 496-97, 881-84. Each saw Brush more than once: Dr. Berezin, for instance, examined Brush in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 496, 500, 834-35, 1025-29; while Dr. Weinstein examined Brush in both 2014 and 2015,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 881-87, 962-69. And both grounded their opinions in objective medical evidence and the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 835 (Dr. Berezin in 2013 noting that \"[t]here is discrepancy [between] her current complaints [to him with the] office note of Dr. Jacobs of 03/25/13 where she states she has been progressively improving since the surgery\"), 882 (Dr. Weinstein also noting the discrepancy between her current complaints and Dr. Jacobs' office notes from March 25, 2013), 969 (Dr. Weinstein noting that \"[a]side from the claimant's history of ACDF at C5-6, there is limited objective abnormality that prevents this claimant from working in some capacity,\" and then citing the objective evidence). We also note that an ALJ may give more weight to non-treating doctors' opinions as long as he or she provides good reasons for doing so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halloran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p31\">\n    362 F.3d at 32-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding ALJ decision to accept examining source's findings as more consistent with the record where the ALJ provided \"good reasons\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valentin v.

Dec. 17, 2015) (ALJ properly apportioned more weight to consultative psychiatric examiner than to treating source since it was more consistent with record).

Hidalgo, Ogulnick, and Newton. Pl. Mem. at 16, 18-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The ALJ apportioned little weight to the opinions of Dr. Newton because he offered opinions inconsistent with his notes. R. 31-32. Specifically, the ALJ concluded that Dr. Newton's opinion that Brush had moderate to extreme limitations in most mental abilities was not supported by \"the record as a whole,\" and remarked that Dr. Newton \"supported his conclusions with inconsistent narratives.\" R. 31. We agree. Dr. Newton concluded that Brush could not work and that she exhibited marked to extreme limitations in her mental abilities, R. 1000-02, but his contemporaneous notes mostly reflect concerns over fraud allegations, her changing doctors, her financial resources, and her chronic pain, R. 974-75, 979, 983-85, 1016. Were Brush exhibiting severe mental impairments, one would expect a treating psychiatrist to note them and potentially to adjust medication based on such findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valentin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203917004\">\n    2017 WL 3917004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (ALJ properly attributed little weight to psychiatric opinions that ignored positive signs in providing a functional limitations opinion and contradicted the record as a whole). Here,\n   however, we find no indication in Dr. Newton's notes that Brush was exhibiting extreme limitations in her mental functioning. Additionally, Brush's own testimony did not corroborate Dr. Newton's opinion that Brush \"barely takes care of her needs.\" R. 1021. Rather, Brush testified to regularly driving, grocery shopping, applying for jobs, cleaning her apartment, reading and watching TV, attending biweekly therapy sessions and other doctors' appointments, and to maintaining an eight-year relationship,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 54, 65-66, 110-11, 137, 143, 612-13, 967. Finally, the ALJ accorded little weight to Dr. Newton's opinions because they contradicted the findings of Drs. Helprin, Dambrocia, and Conciatori, whose opinions are examined below. Given these inconsistencies, the ALJ was not required to give Dr. Newton's opinions controlling weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halloran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p31\">\n    362 F.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (treating physician's opinion not controlling where opinion internally inconsistent or inconsistent with the record as a whole).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The ALJ was also justified in discrediting Dr. Hidalgo's opinions. Although Dr. Hidalgo asserted that Brush's mental abilities were deteriorating, R. 775, his notes did not reflect any deterioration in functional abilities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 597-603, 666-67, 679-83, 711, 713, 716, 775, 801, 816-20. Dr. Hidalgo's May 2012 report consisted of mostly normal findings with regard to concentration, memory, understanding, persistence, and social interaction and adaptation. R. 597-603, 793-99. By November 2012, Dr. Hidalgo reports moderate restrictions of daily living, marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning, and constant deficiencies of concentration and deterioration, R. 667-71, but his notes do not support these opinions. Moreover, Dr. Hidalgo's opinions were contradicted by the opinions of Dr. Helprin, who found in May 2012 that Brush was cooperative, had an adequate manner of relating to others, exhibited normal social skills, talked coherently, could concentrate within a normal range, and had an unremarkable overall presentation. R. 611-14. Likewise, Dr. Dambrocia\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   observed in July 2012 that Brush \"retained adequate cognitive functioning,\" \"[was] able to understand and remember instructions, and sustain attention and concentration for tasks,\" though \"[she] may have difficulties relating with others and/or adapting to changes.\" R. 654. Additionally, Dr. Conciatori found in November 2012 that Brush was \"alert and oriented,\" \"cooperative,\" \"coherent and goal-directed,\" and that her short term memory and concentration were intact. R. 754. Nonetheless, in June 2013, Dr. Hidalgo reaffirmed his November 2012 conclusion in a letter provided to Brush, opining in a vague fashion that \"it is highly improbable that at this time she can hold or sustain any work needing a healthy emotional make-up.\" R. 775. On this record, the ALJ had sufficient evidence to discount Dr. Hidalgo's opinions. In doing so, the ALJ also considered all the \u00a7 404.1527 factors, including the length and nature of the treating relationship, the support of the opinion with relevant evidence, the opinion's consistency with the record, and the doctor's speciality. R. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the same reasons, the ALJ did not err in rejecting Dr. Ogulnick's opinion, expressed in a November 2015 \"mental residual functional capacity assessment\" questionnaire, R. 998-1005, that\n   Brush had moderate to marked impairments in most functional areas. R. 26, 31. The questionnaire diagnoses Brush with major depression, single episode, severe, and notes that she exhibits anhedonia or pervasive loss of interests, sleep disturbance or dysfunction, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, poor memory, short attention span, suicidal ideation, anxiety (generalized, persistent), motor tension, apprehensive expectation, intrusive recollection of a traumatic experience, mood disturbance and emotional liability. R. 998-99. In the questionnaire, Dr. Ogulnick opines that Brush had marked limitations in \"remember[ing] and understand[ing] detailed instructions,\" \"carry[ing] out detailed instructions,\" \"maintain[ing] attention and concentration for extended periods,\" \"maintain[ing] regular attendance,\" \"perform[ing] consistently without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods,\" \"complet[ing] a normal workweek without interruption from psychologically based symptoms,\" and \"accept[ing] instructions and respond[ing] appropriately to criticism from supervisors.\" R. 1000-02. Dr. Ogulnick's treatment notes, however, do not support such extreme limitations and noted symptoms. For instance, his notes from 2015 largely report Brush's concerns about her treatment by the workers' compensation system and the SSA, and stress over her finances, while observing that she exhibits no delusions, that her insight and judgment are fair to good, and that she is applying for jobs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 946, 948, 950-51. The treatment notes also do not reference reductions in functioning capacity, apart from observations that Brush spoke in a choppy, hesitant, and distracted manner, that her thinking was scattered, that she was experiencing panic attacks, and that she claimed reductions in concentration when driving at night. R. 838-42, 939-41, 942-55, 998-1005. Moreover, the treatment notes were contradicted by the report from Dr. Conciatori provided in December 2015,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 1033-37, which found that Brush had \"a mild degree of psychiatric treatment,\" after observing, inter alia, that Brush \"correctly interpreted proverbs and was able to abstract without difficulty,\" R. 1035-36. The ALJ specifically noted that he rejected Dr. Ogulnick's opinion that Brush has \"the ability to take care of 'basic daily activities such as grooming, but is limited ... [in] such activities as cleaning, shopping, etc.' \" R. 31 (quoting Dr. Newton at R. 1004). Dr. Ogulnick's assertion sharply contrasts with Brush's repeated testimony to the contrary about her abilities to drive, clean, cook, and perform other routine daily activities beyond grooming.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 54, 65-66, 137, 143, 612-13, 967. For all these reasons, the ALJ could properly choose to give little weight to Dr. Ogulnick's functional assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, Brush challenges the weight given to Dr. Helprin's opinion about Brush's ability to deal with stress in the workplace. Pl. Mem. at 17. While the ALJ generally gave \"great weight\" to Dr. Helprin's opinion, the ALJ did not give significant weight to Dr. Helprin's opinion about Brush's capacities for stress. R. 30. Giving different weight to different parts of a medical opinion is generally acceptable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howe v.

Aug. 27, 2013). Dr. Helprin had opined that Brush could follow and understand simple directions and instructions, perform simple rote tasks, maintain attention and concentration, maintain a regular schedule, make appropriate decisions, but had difficulties with relationships and dealing with stress \"due to her anxiety in public places.\" R. 613. The ALJ found that last opinion \"unsupported by the record,\" because the record suggested that with medication and therapy Brush could deal with stress from work. R. 30. The ALJ pointed to Brush's\n   past work experience while also suffering from anxiety and panic attacks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204534940\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, Brush testified at the hearing that she started taking antianxiety medications at about age 20.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 120-21, 141. And while she also alleges that her anxiety worsened following her injury, R. 120-21, the ALJ also had available Dr. Conciatori's opinion in November 2012 that the work accident only accounted for 30% of her psychiatric symptoms at the time, R. 751. Given the lack of evidence negating Brush's ability to handle stress in the workplace using medicine and psychotherapy treatment, the support for both sides from the record, and \"the ALJ's duty, as the trier of fact, to resolve conflicts between conflicting medical opinions,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hayes v.

Following the Commissioner's regulations, the ALJ first determined that Brush's reported symptoms were consistent with her medically determinable impairments, R. 22, but also concluded that Brush's testimony regarding the extent of her functional limitations was \"poorly supported by the contemporaneous treatment notes of her medical providers\" and therefore not credible, R. 32. The ALJ noted that Brush had reported limitations in her daily activities consistent with her symptoms, but also noted that she did \"not appear to [ ] provide a candid account of abilities [that] she [did] retain.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858702\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/638/#p642\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Brush, noted the ALJ, also told several medical providers-in contradiction to her testimony-that treatment was improving her condition and reported no side effects to her medications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858702\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/638/#p642\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ further noted that Brush's testimony contradicted the results of objective medical testing concerning her neurological deficits and lingering problems in her back after surgery. R. 33. Last, the ALJ noted that her \"treatment notes do not reflect a deterioration of her functioning as alleged\" and that she was previously able to work in spite of the psychological impairments she now claims totally disable her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858702\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/638/#p642\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Brush argues that her testimony \"has been consistent throughout\" and \"consistent with the medical evidence in the record,\" Pl. Mem. at 20, but she does not specify where the ALJ erred in his opposite finding and we find the record supports the ALJ's finding. For example, Brush provided conflicting testimony to Dr. Jacobs and Dr. Berezin concerning the effect of surgery on her back pain,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 835 (Dr. Berezin noting conflicting testimony);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   R. 715-16 (Dr. Jacobs' report noting that \"patient states the neck pain has progressively improved since the surgery\"), 722-24 (same), 727 (same), and she asserted that she feels numbness in her fingers and radiating pain from her\n   neck, R. 61, all while having no observable neurological deficits and normal x-rays and MRIs, R. 958. Accordingly, we find no error in the ALJ's credibility determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Psychological Impairment Listings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Brush argues that the ALJ erred in determining that she did not meet the elements of Listing \u00a7 12.04, Affective Disorders. Pl. Mem. at 16-20. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The ALJ had substantial evidence to support his conclusion that Brush met none of the paragraph B factors. R. 20. As for daily activities, the ALJ found only a mild restriction, observing that Brush lived independently, drove, shopped, cooked, cleaned, attended parties and family getaways, and applied for \"hundreds\" of jobs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858702\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/638/#p642\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These findings are supported by Brush's hearing testimony and the notes in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 54 (driving), 65-66 (shopping and chores), 110-11 (job search), 137 (describing daily activities, such as visits to post office), 143 (going to Cape Cod each summer, considering trip to San Francisco), 612-13 (reported daily activities for 2012 psychiatric evaluation), 967 (daily activity report for 2015 IME). The ALJ found greater impairments in Brush's social functioning, but ultimately concluded that they were only moderate. R. 20. In support of this finding, the ALJ noted that Brush had maintained a long-term relationship with her domestic partner, and occasionally attended parties and family gatherings, though the ALJ accepted that her anxiety and depression had interfered with her relationships.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858702\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/638/#p642\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This finding is also supported by Brush's testimony. R. 82 (4th of July Party), 116 (long-term relationship with her partner), 146-47 (Cape Cod). Next, the ALJ found that Brush possessed moderate difficulties with concentration, persistence, and pace. R. 21. As the ALJ noted, Brush managed her own finances, applied for multiple jobs, completed craft hobbies, watched television, and read. R. 110-11, 606, 612-13. Additionally, Dr. Helprin had opined that Brush was able to maintain attention and concentration. R. 613. Finally, the ALJ found no episodes of decompensation. R. 21. This finding is supported by extensive treatment notes from her treating and examining psychiatrists that do not document a hospitalization or other acute exacerbation of her symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The ALJ also had substantial evidence to support his finding that Brush met none of the Paragraph C criteria. The ALJ found no evidence that Brush \"cannot function outside a highly supportive living arrangement,\" R. 21, a finding supported by Brush's testimony that she has lived independently and managed her own affairs outside and inside the home throughout her application process,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 967 (daily activity report for 2015 IME). The ALJ also found no repeated episodes of decompensation in the record or a \"residual disease process\" that leaves Brush vulnerable to predictable decompensation, R. 21, and neither do we. The record does demonstrate that Brush experienced persistent panic attacks, anxiety, and depression, but she has never been hospitalized or otherwise experienced an acute deterioration in her functioning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 423-31 (notes from February 2011 hospitalization for panic attack, predating her allegedly disabling injury). She also reported an ability to preview her panic attacks and manage her depression and anxiety through medication and coping techniques.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 946-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    RFC Determination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   With regard to the ALJ's determination of Brush's physical RFC, Brush argues that the ALJ \"should have found greater limitations on the plaintiff's ability to sit, use her hands for fingering and handling, and rotate/extend and flex the\n   neck, ... a greater need for unscheduled breaks .... [and] considered ... claimant's likeliness to be absent from work at least three times per month.\" Pl. Mem. at 20. While some evidence in the record supports these limitations, we find ample evidence to the contrary that supports the ALJ's RFC determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As for the RFC generally, two treating sources and three examining sources concluded that Brush was capable of performing a wide range of sedentary work with limited exertional capacities. Dr. Polepalle, a treating physician, concluded in April 2012 that Brush was restricted only in pushing, pulling, or lifting more than 15 pounds, R. 540-a weight that is more than five pounds over the requirement for sedentary work,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (sedentary work requires \"lifting no more than 10 pounds at a time\"). Likewise, Dr. Jacobs, Brush's surgeon, noted his agreement with the functional limitations opinion of Physical Therapist Kevin Stafford who had opined, seven months after Brush's surgery, that Brush was capable of sedentary work, so long as she could alternate positions as needed, walk at her own pace, and was not expected to constantly manipulate small objects with her fingers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 692-93 (letter from Stafford to Dr. Jacobs containing Stafford's functional capacity assessment), 717 (Dr. Jacobs noting that he concurred with Stafford's opinion), 724 (same). Additionally, Dr. Berezin, who evaluated Brush four times, concluded in 2011 that Brush could perform sedentary work with minimal lifting, R. 500, and in 2013 after Brush's surgery, opined that Brush could \"work in modified capacity involving activities that require no repetitive bending, lifting, no repetitive turning over neck, and no lifting greater than 10 to 15 pounds,\" R. 835. Supporting this opinion, Dr. Weinstein concluded in late March 2015 that Brush was \"capable of working at a light duty demand level with the expectation of being able to exert up to 20 pounds of force occasionally and up to 10 pounds of force frequently.\" R. 969. As explained in Section III.A.1 above, the ALJ properly attributed great weight to the medical opinions of Dr. Berezin and Dr. Weinstein, as they were based on a review of medical records and objective medical testing, and reflected variations in Brush's condition over time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Brush contends that the ALJ should have found greater limitations in the use of her hands for fingering and handling. Pl. Mem. at 20. But the medical record supports the ALJ's finding that Brush could frequently use her hands for fingering and handling. Dr. Manyam in May 2012 noted that Brush's \"[h]and and finger dexterity [was] intact,\" and that her \"grip strength [was] 5/5 bilaterally.\" R. 607. Dr. Jacobs in March 2013 found that Brush had full five out of five strength bilaterally in her shoulders and wrists, that her reflexes were intact, and endorsed an opinion from Stafford that limited Brush to frequent manipulation of small objects with her fingers. R. 716. Dr. Weinstein similarly found Brush's reflexes intact and strength \"well preserved\" bilaterally in her upper and lower extremities in March 2015, R. 967-68, as did Dr. Berezin in December 2015, R. 1028. And Dr. Bachar, a treating source, opined in June 2015 that Brush could grasp, turn, and twist objects and feel objects with her hands and arms at work on a \"regular basis.\" R. 935. Additionally, testing in August 2015 discovered no new neurological abnormalities or significant changes in Brush's abilities to use her hands. R. 957-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Brush also argues that the ALJ made two findings with respect to Brush's neck flexibility that were improper,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 20-first, that Brush can \"frequently flex, extend, and rotate the neck,\" and second, that she \"can constantly hold\n   the neck in one position,\" R. 21. We find substantial support in the record for these findings. The ALJ noted that Brush herself testified that she can drive, that she cooks and cleans, and that she uses a computer for around thirty minutes at a time, all activities that require either frequent moving the neck or constantly holding it one position, or a mixture of both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 63, 65, 115. The ALJ also noted various medical opinions that found Brush had no remaining neck impairments, had undergone a successful surgery to repair a disc injury in her neck, and retained flexibility in her neck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 717-728 (Dr. Jacobs reporting after surgery that Brush \"is making a steady improvement\" and reporting normal muscle tone bilaterally), 835 (Dr. Berezin noting that Brush's neck showed \"no tenderness, no spasm, active range of motion, forward flexion 30 degrees, extension 30 degrees, rotation 60 degrees, forward rotation 45 degrees\"), 886 (Dr. Weinstein noting that although Brush complained of neck discomfort, there were \"no objective residual clinical findings and no postsurgical imaging findings\" to corroborate her complaints), 958 (Dr. Peretz's tests in 2015 discovered no neurological abnormalities and reaffirmed that the surgery had been a success). Dr. Berezin did recommend against \"repetitive\" turning of the neck, R. 835, but we do not view this as inconsistent with the ALJ's RFC which limits Brush to \"frequent\" flexing of the neck. R. 835.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Finally, we reject Brush's argument that the ALJ erred in declining to find that Brush was likely to be absent from work at least three times a month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 20. While Dr. Newton opined that Brush would be absent from work two to four times a month because of her depression and anxiety, R. 1021, we have already explained why the ALJ could properly discount Dr. Newton's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.2. Additionally, other evidence in the record contradicted that opinion. Dr. Helprin, for example, concluded that Brush could maintain attention and concentration and maintain a regular schedule. R. 613. This opinion was supported by findings that Brush was cooperative, and had intact concentration and attention. R. 612. Accordingly, we find substantial evidence support the ALJ's RFC determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Docket # 22) is granted and Brush's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Docket # 16) is denied.
