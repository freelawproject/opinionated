Mr. Chen's letter explains that the tables were provided pursuant to the US-Taiwan CMAA after the Government requested that information. Chen Aff. &amp; Letters. That Taiwan responded to the Government's requests to provide the tables pursuant to the US-Taiwan CMAA does not suggest any bias on the part of Taiwan Customs. Likewise, that the previous version of the tables contained fewer categories of information does not suggest bias by Taiwan Customs. Instead, these facts merely show that Taiwan sought to be responsive to the Government's requests in the spirit of cooperation reflected in the US-Taiwan CMAA. Therefore, as the party opposing the introduction of these tables, Univar has failed to point to negative factors sufficient to cause the court to conclude that the tables are untrustworthy, and the court has no reason to believe that they are untrustworthy so as to preclude their admission under Rule 803(8)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant's next challenge to the tables' admissibility is premised on Rule 1002, which states that \"[a]n original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content unless these rules or a federal statute provides otherwise.\" Fed.

Although the court is not persuaded by this argument, a recent filing by the Government indicates that the Government has since provided Univar with an electronic version of the tables with access to the full contents of each data field, including the \"mesh size\" in the commodity\n   description column, so that this particular issue is moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Suppl.

As an economist whose sub-specialties include international trade and transportation, among other things, Dr. McFarland is qualified to opine on the likelihood of transshipment. Even more importantly, Dr. McFarland relied on his experience and expertise as an economist in analyzing numerous economic data in forming his opinions. For example, Dr. McFarland's report is based on a review of publicly available data from Taiwan's Ministry of Finance on the origin of all of Taiwan's imports of saccharin, McFarland Report at 3-6; Japanese export data as compared to Taiwan's import data,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6;\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   U.S. trade statistics on the unit values of Japanese imports into the United States compared to unit value of all imports as well as the percentage share of imports from Japan from 2002 to 2012,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10 &amp; Charts 4-5; and data from Taiwan Customs related to timing of saccharin imports from China by LH Chemical and exports to the United States and LH Trading from 2009 to 2012, i.e., the Taiwan Customs Tables discussed above,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant also argues that Dr. McFarland's experience, which involved reliance on \"country-level data,\" does not render him an expert to analyze statistics on specific shipments, as he did here. Def.'s Second Mot.\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. Defendant, thus, argues that Dr. McFarland's general training in interpreting aggregate data is insufficient to qualify him as an expert in analyzing shipment-specific data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant also compares Dr. McFarland to the experts in\n   <em>\n    In re Live Concert Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4000318\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/863/966/\">\n    863 F.Supp.2d 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D.

In contrast to the witness in\n   <em>\n    In re Live Concert Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   , Dr. McFarland relied on his experience and expertise in analyzing the various economic data, including the shipment-specific data, as outlined above, in rendering his opinion. For the same reasons, the court finds that there is a nexus between his credentials and the subject matter of his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant also argues that Dr. McFarland has no specialized knowledge on informal economies, either generally or specific to Taiwan's informal economy, to give an opinion that while Taiwan may have an \"underground (or shadow) economy,\" the saccharin in question was not likely produced in Taiwan. Def.'s Second Mot.\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   at 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   McFarland Rebuttal Report at 2. Defendant further argues that Dr. McFarland's \"good deal of work\" in industrial organization and international trade do not provide him with the specialized knowledge to render an opinion on profitability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21. Defendant posits there is no indication in Dr. McFarland's report that he has ever calculated profits in a like manner, suggesting that his opinions were created specifically for the purpose of litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. These arguments are unavailing. Dr. McFarland's rebuttal opinion regarding the likelihood of saccharin production in Taiwan's shadow economy was rendered on the basis of the information supplied by Professor Winn regarding the declining nature of the shadow economy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McFarland Rebuttal Report. He is qualified to provide a rebuttal report based on his analysis of the information supplied by Dr. Winn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant's challenge to one aspect of Dr. McFarland's testimony has merit. In his supplemental report, Dr. McFarland stated that it takes approximately four hours to \"drive from the inner harbor at Keelung to Kaohsiung Harbor ..., which indicates that the imports that arrived at Keelung could easily have reached the port of export before the time of the export shipment.\" McFarland Suppl. Report at 2. By his own admission, Dr. McFarland only has \"general knowledge about the size of the island and how fast trucks go.\" McFarland Dep. at 158:16-21. In the absence of any other basis for his testimony, the court will preclude Dr. McFarland from providing expert testimony on the length of time it takes to travel from Keelung to Kaohsiung Harbor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court also finds that Dr. McFarland's testimony is reliable. Dr. McFarland gave a detailed explanation for how he reached his opinion. He testified that as an economist, he would (1) look at trade data; (2) follow methods used by those who typically study underground economies; and (3) look at the various costs and benefits and the incentives of the economic actors. McFarland Dep. at 71:2-20. A review of his reports shows he employed that methodology. First, Dr.\n   McFarland reviewed publicly available data from Taiwan's Ministry of Finance on the origin of all of Taiwan's imports of saccharin, including unfinished acid saccharin and sodium saccharin, from 2003 to 2012, which showed that 98.8 percent of the saccharin imports were from China. McFarland Report at 3-4, 6. Because Univar identified Japan as a possible source of the saccharin, Dr. McFarland collected Japanese export data and compared that with Taiwan's import data. McFarland Report at 4-6. This comparison showed that Taiwan's imports from Japan amounted to less than the volume of Univar's entries at issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 &amp; Chart 2. Dr. McFarland also analyzed the data on the value of those imports from Japan and determined that they had a \"substantially higher value per kilogram than the Chinese imports,\" making it unlikely that the imported saccharin was in unfinished form that was later converted and shipped to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. He considered the potential profitability of a company importing unfinished saccharin from Japan, converting it, and then shipping it to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. In so doing, he relied, in part, on information regarding the conversion process of saccharin provided by Dr. Pearson, an expert in saccharin production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 n.14, 8 n.27. He concluded that the conversion process would necessitate selling the saccharin in the United States for a higher price than the unfinished saccharin from Japan if the company were to make a profit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Yet, his data comparison showed that in most instances, saccharin imported into Taiwan from Japan cost more per kilogram than saccharin exported to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. He also considered the fact that Japan was not very competitive in world saccharin trade.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. For instance, he looked at the U.S. trade statistics on the unit values of imports from Japan, which Univar identified as a possible source of the subject saccharin, into the United States compared to unit value of all imports as well as the percentage share of imports from Japan from 2002 to 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 &amp; Charts 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Dr. McFarland tied the data to the facts of this case, for example, concluding that \"[t]he relatively high price of the Japanese product makes it less likely that Japan was a source of the saccharin at issue in this case,\" and that the United States imported no saccharin from Japan in 2010 and 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. He contrasted Japanese trade data with those from China, which showed that from 2003 to 2012, the subject merchandise exported from Taiwan to the United States had a higher value per kilogram than the merchandise imported into Taiwan from China.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Next, he looked at the timing of shipments, which included the Taiwan Customs Tables.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13. Further, he considered the possibility of Taiwan's production of the saccharin at issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Reviewing publicly available data from Taiwan's Ministry of Finance, Dr. McFarland gathered that this data indicates that from 2003 to 2012, Taiwan imported more than twice as much saccharin as it exported.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Next, considering the possibility that there could have been an unlicensed, thus illegal, producer, Dr. McFarland considered the cost disadvantages of doing so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18. His rebuttal report is based, in part, on the interpretation of studies and data cited by Dr. Winn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McFarland Rebuttal Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court further finds that Dr. McFarland's analysis of these various sources will assist the trier of fact to assimilate this economic data. Although Defendant complains of Dr. McFarland \"interpret[ing] certain documents,\" such as certain email correspondence, which the jury is able to interpret on its own, Def.'s Second Mot.\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   at 8-10 (internal quotation marks omitted), the court finds that the primary\n   function of Dr. McFarland's testimony is to analyze and interpret the various economic data, which will be helpful to the jury.

The case to which\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   cites supports this proposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869476\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/556/617/#p643\">\n    556 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   643-44 (citing\n   <em>\n    Waco Int'l Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398833\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/278/523/#p533\">\n    278 F.3d at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Although a lawyer may not testify as to purely legal matters, he or she may testify as to legal matters that involve questions of fact.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Additionally, citing Rule 704, Defendant also argues that Mr. O'Rourke's opinion is not objectionable \"just because it embraces an ultimate issue.\" Def.'s Resp. at 14 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 704 advisory committee's note to the 1972 proposed rules). While expert testimony may embrace an ultimate issue, such testimony does not go unchecked. The advisory committee's note to Rule 704 plainly states\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The abolition of the ultimate issue rule does not lower the bars so as to admit all opinions. Under Rules 701 and 702, opinions must be helpful to the trier of fact, and Rule 403 provides for exclusion of evidence which wastes time. These provisions afford ample assurances against the admission of opinions which would merely tell the jury what result to reach, somewhat in the manner of the oath-helpers of an earlier day. They also stand ready to exclude opinions phrased in terms of inadequately explored legal criteria.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Fed. R. Evid. 704 advisory committee's note to the 1972 proposed rules. Simply put, under Rule 702, the judge determines the law-in this case, the standard for reasonable care-and instructs the jury as to that applicable law; the question of whether Univar acted with reasonable care is a question reserved for the jury. Mr. O'Rourke's opinion on the standard of reasonable care usurps the court's role and his conclusion that Univar acted with reasonable care is, in effect, telling the jury what result to reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Consequently, because Mr. O'Rourke's testimony would invade the province of the court and the jury, it exceeds the scope of permissible expert testimony under Rule 702, and will be excluded. Therefore, the Government's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's first motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 142),\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   , in part, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   , in part, Defendant's second motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 163), and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Government's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 152).
