In support of his motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff argued that because the Government was aware that the mailings to his last known address were returned as undeliverable, the Government was obligated to take additional reasonable steps to notify him of any action taken upon the Petition before denying it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-1 at 14-17). Plaintiff relied heavily on\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   in support of his argument, and, in ruling in his favor, the Court agreed with Plaintiff's position under the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in that decision.

In fact,\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   prevailing party could ever secure a fee enhancement under the \"special factor\" exception if the knowledge and skill of the plaintiff's attorney suggested that the government's position was \"substantially justified.\" This reasoning flips the Government's burden of establishing its position to have been \"substantially justified\" on its head.

Although the Government did not dispute that Plaintiff was a \"prevailing party\" for purposes of the EAJA, it argued both that its position was \"substantially justified,\" and that \"special circumstances\" warranted the denial of the application.

Plaintiff also requested fee enhancements under both the \"cost of living\" and \"special factor\" statutory exceptions, and the Government disputed the application of the \"special factor\" exception.

Fee Award Calculations on the Supplemental Fee Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Since Plaintiff's timekeeper hours are divided among paralegals and attorneys, the Court must determine how much of the new total should be ascribed to paralegal work. Since the paralegal work represented approximately 8.5% of the original 82.1 hours requested, the Court will reduce the requested 7.0 paralegal hours proportionately to the new value of 42.3 total timekeeper hours. Thus, the Court attributes 3.6 hours to the work performed by paralegals on the initial fee application. The remaining 38.7 hours are attributed to the work performed by Wadsworth and Rooney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Having decided the appropriate number of hours to ascribe to the supplemental fee application, the Court must also determine the reasonable rate to assess each hour of work performed. For the reasons discussed above, the Court assesses the paralegal work at a rate of $100 per hour. Plaintiff again contends that a \"cost of living\" enhancement be applied to the attorneys' hours. (Dkt. 38 at \u00b6 8). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The appropriate hourly rate for the work performed by the attorneys is again determined by reference to the CPI-U numbers and the associated equation used for making a cost of living enhancement. At the time this motion was filed, it appears that the United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics had only calculated the CPI-U values for the months of January 2017 through May 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 38 at \u00b6 8 n.1). Plaintiff used the average of those CPI-U values to come to his requested hourly rate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Since that time, the average annual CPI-U for 2017 has been calculated to be 259.538, and the Court will use that value in determining an appropriate hourly rate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thangaraja\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280345\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/870/#p876\">\n    428 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   876-77 ;\n   <em>\n    Butts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758029\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/565/403/\">\n    565 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   406 n.3 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, CPI-All Urban Consumers: 1996-2018,\n   <em>\n    https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet\n   </em>\n   (last visited March 16, 2018).
