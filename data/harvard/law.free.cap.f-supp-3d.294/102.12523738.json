Plaintiff makes no plausible claim, and offers no evidence, that their inclusion in plaintiff's vehicle was the result of a mistake or fabrication flaw. To the contrary, plaintiff specifically claims that the entire 2007-2012 Santa Fe product line suffered from the same defect (premature corrosion of the braking system), resulting from the intentional use of inferior or defective materials. Plaintiff simply urges the Court to depart from recent precedent and find that a design defect resulting from an \"intentional selection of defective materials [is] as violative of the Warranty and covered thereunder as much as a negligent or inadvertent one.\" (Dkt. # 103 at 27). Bound as it is by well-settled precedent and finding no flaw therein, the Court declines to depart from it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As such, plaintiff's claims that the entire Santa Fe product line, as designed, contained a defective rear braking system, are appropriately viewed as design defect claims rather than manufacturing defect claims. They are therefore not covered by the express terms of the Warranty, and fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Plaintiff avers that this omission was material, in that no reasonable customer-plaintiff included-would have purchased a Santa Fe if they had been informed about the defect and/or the fact that it would not be covered by the Warranty. Plaintiff alleges that she was injured when defendant denied Warranty coverage for repair and replacement of the defective brake system parts in her vehicle, causing plaintiff to incur out of pocket costs of $438.58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   I find that multiple questions of material fact preclude summary judgment on plaintiff's consumer protection claim. These include factual disputes concerning nearly every element of the claim, including: whether the brake parts at issue were actually defective; whether and to what extent defendant was aware of the defect; whether defendant concealed or omitted information concerning the defect and/or the scope of relevant Warranty coverage to plaintiff in connection with plaintiff's purchase of her vehicle; whether the omission of such information is material; and whether and to what plaintiff's damages are attributable to the concealment or omission of information by defendant, rather than to plaintiff's alleged failure to perform regular vehicle maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For example, first and foremost, the parties dispute whether the brakes on plaintiff's vehicle were defective: plaintiff contends that the brakes were prone to \"premature\" corrosion, while defendant contends that the brakes performed similarly to those of other vehicles driven in the same geographical area, under comparable weather and road conditions. Defendant also claims that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that knowledge of premature brake corrosion would be material to a reasonable consumer (e.g., through use of surveys), while plaintiff claims that a defect in vehicle performance and quality is material to consumers as a matter of practical inference, or at least is \"a question of fact for the jury.\" Plaintiff further claims that the brakes posed a safety issue which would naturally be material to consumer, while defendant disputes that premature rusting is a safety concern. (Dkt. # 103 at 7, Dkt. # 113 at 15). With regard to causation, plaintiff testified that she was never informed about the need to perform certain maintenance or pre-winterization on her vehicle's braking system, while defendant claims that plaintiff's Owner's Manual was incorporated by reference into the Warranty itself, and explicitly informed plaintiff of the required maintenance in a manner sufficient to place her on notice of the need to perform regular brake servicing, and/or the risks of failing to do so. (Dkt. # 103 at 26, Dkt. # 113 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because the facts material to plaintiff's\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20General%20Business%20Law%20%C2%A7%20349\">\n    N.Y.

Plaintiff's breach of warranty claims are dismissed in their entirety, with prejudice.
