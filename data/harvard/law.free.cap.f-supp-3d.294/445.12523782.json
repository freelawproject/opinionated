(Defs.' Mem. (Doc. 7) at 6.) Plaintiff responds that disputed issues of fact remain and judicial notice of the\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   proceedings would be inappropriate. (Pl's. Mem.

First,\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   was disposed of at the motion to dismiss stage, meaning that the court reviewed the sufficiency of the Complaint and did not engage in any fact finding. Second, the present motion is likewise a motion to dismiss, which does not involve or require any fact finding or weighing.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7.) Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that because\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   was disposed of on a Rule 12(c) motion to dismiss-which only determined the sufficiency of the pleadings rather than looking to the merits of her case-it should not be considered a final judgment on the merits.

Mem. (Doc. 13) at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff's argument is without merit. As Defendants correctly point out, this quoted language from\n   <em>\n    Massey\n   </em>\n   comes from a portion of the opinion describing the appellate standard of review for Rule 12(c) motions and is not on point as to the issue presently before the court. Instead, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), the controlling authority on this question, provides that \"[u]nless the dismissal order states otherwise,\" an involuntary dismissal \"except one for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19 [ ] operates as an adjudication on the merits.\" Fed.

Mem. (Doc. 13) at 8.) Plaintiff's argument is without merit for two reasons. First, the cited case considered res judicata in a diversity case, and thus relied on state law, rendering it inapplicable to this case.\n   <em>\n    Quicksilver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305666\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/155/535/#p549\">\n    155 F.Supp.3d at 542-44, 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, as a general matter, this quotation and the cases underlying it speak to instances of \"multiple wrongs,\" unlike the single wrong at issue in this case. Here, as discussed below, Plaintiff's claims arise from a single alleged\n   wrong-that is, the events of November 5, 2014, and FTCC and its employees' subsequent response thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants, on the other hand, assert that although the present case alleges contract and due process claims which were not asserted in\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   , the present claims are barred by res judicata nonetheless because they could have been raised in\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   . (Defs.' Mem. (Doc. 7) at 8.) Defendants contend that the Fourth Circuit employs the transactional approach to determine whether there is identity between the causes of action in the two suits, and argues that this standard has been met here. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendants are correct that, in considering the second prong of the res judicata analysis, the Fourth Circuit \"follow[s] the 'transactional approach' ... meaning that 'res judicata will bar a \"newly articulated claim[ ]\" if it is based on the same underlying transaction [involved in the first suit] and could have been brought in the earlier action.' \"\n   <em>\n    Providence Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259282,4175078\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/273/\">\n    816 F.3d at 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, the dispute underlying the claims in the present case arose out of the same occurrence as Plaintiff's claims in\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   : the events of November 5, 2014, and FTCC and its employees' subsequent response.

Although the Complaint in the present case includes more in-depth facts than that in\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff challenges the legality of these same events in both lawsuits. Plaintiff has not pointed to any reason why the present claims could not have been brought in the earlier action.

These new parties are considered in turn to determine whether the third prong of the res judicata analysis is established nonetheless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    (a)\n    <em>\n     Defendant FTCC Board of Trustees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff claims that Defendant FTCC Board of Trustees \"oversees the activities of [FTCC] and its teachers and administrators\" and is thus responsible for the alleged violations of law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. (Doc. 1) \u00b6\u00b6 19, 96-102.) Defendants contend that, although the FTCC Board of Trustees was not named as a Defendant in\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   , FTCC was. (Defs.' Mem. (Doc. 7) at 11.) Because \"the Board\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   FTCC,\" Defendants argue, there is an identity of parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In\n   <em>\n    Alvarado v. Board of Trustees of Montgomery Community College\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit considered whether an administrative complaint that named a community college as a defendant could be maintained against the\n   <em>\n    board\n   </em>\n   of the community college.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783378\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/457/#p460\">\n    848 F.2d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460 (4th Cir. 1988). In answering this question in the affirmative, the court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   An examination of the Maryland statutes creating Montgomery Community College and conferring powers and duties on the college's board of trustees clearly reveals that\n   <em>\n    the board of trustees is identical with the college itself\n   </em>\n   for purposes of suits such as that brought by Alvarado. Maryland has by statute created boards of trustees and empowered them to establish and operate community colleges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Educ. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-203 (1985). Maryland has specifically created the Board of Trustees of Montgomery Community College.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783378\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/457/#p460\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-510. Another section of the statute,\n   dealing with labor relations, defines \"Public employer\" as \"the Board of Trustees of Montgomery Community College.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783378\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/457/#p460\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-510.1(a)(15). The statute specifies: \"Each board of trustees may sue and be sued.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783378\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/457/#p460\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-203(k). No such provision is included in the statutes to empower the college itself to sue or be sued. Once he retained counsel to bring his lawsuit against the college, Alvarado properly filed suit against the board of trustees, in accordance with \u00a7 16-203(k).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783378\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/457/#p460\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Embarking on a similar line of reasoning, Defendants point to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 115D-20, which outlines the powers and duties of North Carolina community college trustees. (Defs.' Mem. (Doc. 7) at 11.) These statutory powers include but are not limited to the election of officers, employment of personnel, adoption of rules for the operation of the institution and discipline of students, the power to enter into loans, and the ability to enter into contracts. \u00a7 115D-20. Additionally, and more pertinently, \u00a7 115D-14 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The board of trustees of each institution shall be a body corporate with powers to enable it to acquire, hold, and transfer real and personal property, to enter into contracts,\n   <em>\n    to institute and defend legal actions and suits\n   </em>\n   , and to exercise such other rights and privileges as may be necessary for the management and administration of the institution in accordance with the provisions and purposes of this Chapter. The official title of each board shall be \"The Trustees of ..........\" (filling in the name of the institution)\n   <em>\n    and such title shall be the official corporate name of the institution\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00a7 115D-14 (emphasis added). Under North Carolina law, a community college necessarily acts through the board. This statutory language makes apparent that the board of trustees-having the power to hold and transfer property, contract, sue, and be sued-shares an identity with the community college itself. That the college and the board are a single entity is further evidenced by a straightforward application of \u00a7 115D-14, which makes clear that \"The Trustees of [Forsyth Technical Community College]\" is \"the official corporate name of the institution.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783378\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/457/#p460\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, the court concludes that FTCC and the FTCC Board of Trustees share an identity for purposes of res judicata, and the third prong of the res judicata analysis is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Taking into account the two final practical considerations, this court notes, first, that Plaintiff certainly knew about claims she might bring against Defendant FTCC Board of Trustees at the time of\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   , as evidenced by her naming the college in her first Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Providence Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259282,4175078\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/273/\">\n    816 F.3d at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants contend that, although Defendant Winebarger was not named as a Defendant in\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   , this is inconsequential because Winebarger was subpoenaed for a deposition in\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   and Plaintiff \"told the Defendants that she intended to add him as a defendant in\n   <em>\n    Chandler I\n   </em>\n   .\" (Defs.'

Furthermore, different legal theories of liability are required for the plaintiff, and different defenses are available to the defendant, in a personal-capacity action than in an official-capacity action.

The\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Ryan\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   court permitted a narrow claim to move forward, which alleged a specific, identifiable provision (an ob/gyn rotation) of the contract that the University failed to provide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 302,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=494%20S.E.2d%20789\">\n    494 S.E.2d at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather than holding that all educational handbooks are enforceable contracts, the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Ryan\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   court simply permitted an action to proceed based on an identifiable contractual provision specifically incorporated into an agreement that addressed both employment and medical residency. Because the\n   <em>\n    Giuliani\n   </em>\n   plaintiff did not allege the existence of a contract specifically incorporating the student handbooks or their terms,\n   this court concluded that\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   was inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    Guiliani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201292321\">\n    2010 WL 1292321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Next, this court looked to\n   <em>\n    Mercer v.

Referencing North Carolina law governing whether employee handbooks are part of a contract between an employer and an employee, the\n   <em>\n    Mercer\n   </em>\n   court found such handbooks to only be part of the employer-employee contract when they are explicitly included by reference therein.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14-15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Black v.
