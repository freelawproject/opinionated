The Motion to Dismiss is before the court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and the Order of Reference dated November 21, 2017 [# 19]. The court has carefully considered the Motion and related briefing, the entire case file, and the applicable case law, and, for the reasons stated below, GRANTS the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Sue Cirocco (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Ms. Cirocco\") initiated this lawsuit through counsel on June 29, 2017, by filing a Complaint asserting unlawful sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1), and for retaliation. [# 1].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court draws the following facts from Ms. Cirocco's Complaint, and accepts them as true for the purposes of considering the Motion to Dismiss. Ms. Cirocco began working at the United States Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") in August 2009 as a Finance Division Manager. [# 1 at \u00b6 9]. In December 2012, she was promoted to Finance Director over two male colleagues, Mr. Bates and Mr. Berges, who \"vocally expressed\" their displeasure, suggested the promotion was on account of gender, and \"went as far to file an EEO complaint regarding Mr. Cirocco's selection.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-13]. In October 2013,\n   Mr. Gribben was hired as the Deputy Chief Financial Officer and he became Ms. Cirocco's manager. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16]. Ms. Cirocco alleges that Mr. Gribben and Mr. Bates began working together to her exclusion and \"outside the normal chain of command.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17]. At one point, Mr. Gribbon reversed Ms. Cirocco's performance review of Mr. Bates, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-22]; he also instructed Ms. Cirocco not to issue written discipline to Mr. Bates after Mr. Bates had been insubordinate to her and verbally abusive toward one of his female co-workers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27-28, 31-32]. Mr. Gribben also instructed Ms. Cirocco against further communicating with Mr. Bates, an employee whom she managed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33-34].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Cirocco alleges that not only was Mr. Gribben \"complicit in supporting Mr. Bates' discriminatory behavior,\" he reprimanded her for retaliating against Mr. Berges for his filing of an EEO complaint, when in fact Mr. Berges \"routinely confided in Ms. Cirocco about the stress he experienced in filing his complaint.\" [# 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 37-38, 40]. Ms. Cirocco asserts that Mr. Gribben gave her a poor annual review (\"FY14\") that was lower than any review she had ever received at the SBA, and in stark contrast to her mid-year performance review that she was \"doing a fabulous job.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, 49]. When Plaintiff asked Mr. Gribben about the FY14, he said he \"based his decision on 'complaints about [her] professional conduct,' \" which Plaintiff alleges referred to her \"efforts to discipline Mr. Bates for verbally berating a female employee.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 45, 47]. Ms. Cirocco lost the opportunity for a raise as a result of the FY14. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed her own EEO complaint in February 2015, and alleges the retaliation continued thereafter. She was moved to a less desirable office away from her team; she received a written reprimand for failing to treat Mr. Bates \"with respect\"; and she was placed under investigation in February and March 2015. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60-62]. In March, the chief financial officer of the SBA visited the Denver office and announced that Ms. Cirocco's staff would be reduced by approximately 50 percent so as to comply with \"best practices.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65]. Ms. Cirocco alleges that, without adequate staffing and no change in the description of her position, it was impossible to perform her job. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72]. Ms. Cirocco thereafter took a medical leave of absence and ultimately sought employment elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant filed the instant Motion to Dismiss on October 10, 2017, [# 7], and, three days later, counsel for Plaintiff moved to withdraw his representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [# 8, # 9]. Plaintiff has proceeded\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   since that time. The Parties then consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by a United States Magistrate Judge pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), [# 18]. On November 28, 2017, the court held a telephonic Status Conference at which the undersigned discussed with the Parties the Motion to Dismiss, and Ms. Cirocco represented that she had intended for certain email correspondence, which she had sent to counsel for Defendant, to serve as her response to the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [# 22]. Accordingly, the court docketed the correspondence as Plaintiff's Response,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [# 23], and Defendant thereafter filed a Reply, [# 25]. The Motion to Dismiss is now ripe, and the court has determined that oral argument would not materially assist in its disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Specifically, after filing the EEO Complaint in February 2015, Plaintiff \"failed to participate in its adjudication\n   and ultimately abandoned her administrative claims\"; and Plaintiff \"never pursued any administrative remedies,\" with respect to the retaliation claim. [# 7 at 1]. Defendant further argues that Plaintiff's Complaint is subject to dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because she alleges only in conclusory terms that she exhausted her administrative remedies. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2]. In support of these arguments, Defendant attaches to her Motion the declaration of William L. Gery, an attorney in the SBA's Office of General Counsel, [# 7-1], to which the following exhibits are attached: Ms. Cirocco's EEO Complaint, [# 7-2]; a letter from the SBA Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Civil Rights, [# 7-3]; a copy of the EEO investigator's Memorandum to File regarding the EEO Complaint, [# 7-4]; and an order of dismissal issued by the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") assigned to the matter, [# 7-5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23; # 7-5].

In relevant part, Ms. Cirocco states that her \"former attorney advised me to file my case in federal court after discussions with SBA attorneys,\" and that her attorney \"did not believe the SBA attorney's acted in good faith with him [sic].\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2]. Ms. Cirocco also details the retaliation she allegedly endured after she filed her EEO Complaint. Finally, she represents that she is \"out resourced at this point,\" that her \"attorney has said it could cost up to $100k to pursue this case,\" and \"[s]ince I am only looking to be made whole with the time I was forced to take in medical leave and I would like to retire soon, I simply cannot proceed with this expense.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3]. Notably, however, Ms. Cirocco does not address Defendant's contention that she failed to participate both in Mr. Gay's investigation and the proceedings before the\n   ALJ. As a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant, Ms. Cirocco is entitled to a liberal construction of her Response; however, the court is not tasked with articulating the pertinent arguments on her behalf. Neither legal training nor expertise is required for Plaintiff to describe her version of events with respect to what transpired during the EEOC investigation and before the ALJ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons, I find Plaintiff fails to demonstrate the court has subject matter jurisdiction over her Title VII claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

For the reasons explained below, the court denies defendant's Motion for Partial Dismissal of Plaintiff's Complaint and also grants plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint.

In April 2012, plaintiff's work gloves caught in a conveyor belt, injuring the smallest finger on her right hand to the point that one of the joints was immovable. Plaintiff received medical attention for her injury through workers compensation benefits, and began using a splint at work per her doctor's orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Over time, plaintiff's injury worsened. She began experiencing intermittent muscle and tendon pain in her right hand, wrist, and forearm. Eventually, the pain spread to her shoulder. Worker's compensation again allowed plaintiff to seek medical attention. But, when plaintiff's treating physician advised her to see a hand specialist, defendant refused and would not allow her to seek further treatment. Plaintiff told defendant about her continuing pain and discomfort several times between 2012 and 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff's supervisor questioned whether plaintiff truly was injured and the supervisor got angry with her. Plaintiff's supervisor physically pushed plaintiff twice, \"yelling at [her] for using her left hand instead of her injured right hand.\" Doc. 1 at 5. Some time later, plaintiff went to human resources to inform them of the pushing incident and to complain, again, about her continuing injury.

The Complaint also alleges a retaliation claim under the Kansas Workers Compensation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendant has filed a Motion for Partial Dismissal. In its Motion, defendant contends that plaintiff's ADA claims exceed the scope of her Charge, and so plaintiff has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as the ADA requires.

While defendant labels its motion to dismiss as one under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the legal standards section of its Memorandum in Support begins with the following propositions: \"Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Under the ADA, a plaintiff must exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit. 'In the Tenth Circuit, exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.' Thus, a district court must dismiss unexhausted claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\" Doc. 7 at 4 (citations omitted). This language invokes Rule 12(b)(1). Defendant then continues, mentioning-albeit briefly-the legal standard for a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Defendant's Reply does not clarify its intentions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 10 at 8 (\"KCSC argues that Plaintiff did not exhaust her administrative remedies at all -whether her Charge was verified or not-with respect to any claims based on her own disability, which clearly is a jurisdictional requirement.\" (citation omitted)). So, defendant's papers alone do not permit the court to discern whether defendant brings a Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   But the court must determine which subdivision of the Rule applies because \"[d]ifferent standards apply to a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    Muscogee (Creek) Nation v.

But her Charge never alleges that she, herself, has a disability, or that she suffered adverse employment actions because of her disability. Her Charge therefore does not contain facts about the discrete incident of discrimination and retaliation relied on by Counts One through Three of her Complaint. No \"administrative investigation [could] reasonably be expected to follow from\" plaintiff's administrative allegations about her son's disability to plaintiff's judicial allegations that she was disabled.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5526532\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/1176/#p1183\">\n    502 F.3d at 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1186 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews v.

Defendant objects to plaintiff's use of the questionnaire, arguing that the court cannot consider the questionnaire without converting defendant's motion into one for summary judgment. This argument creates a dilemma that the court cannot resolve from the current record. On one hand, defendant argues, correctly, that the court cannot consider the contents of the administrative questionnaire because plaintiff's Complaint does not allege it or otherwise invoke it under Rule 10(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pacheco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052220\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/1178/#p1186\">\n    627 F.3d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing exceptions to the rule against looking beyond the four corners of the pleadings). On the other hand, plaintiff may not have alleged that the questionnaire's contents provided a platform to establish the jurisdictional requisite-administrative exhaustion-because she did not know that defendant would challenge her administrative charge's sufficiency for that requisite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    *7\n   </strong>\n   In the end, the court concludes that it is not proper to resolve this dilemma on the current motion. The parties' filings manifest one dispute, in particular, that leads the court to this conclusion. Plaintiff contends that a KHRC questionnaire establishes that she exhausted her claims based on her own alleged disability. And, indeed, the Circuit's most recent comment on this idea-\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Needham\n   </em>\n   -leaves room for this argument to succeed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277048\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/1284/#p1290\">\n    856 F.3d 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1290 (10th Cir. 2017) (\"[T]here are times in which a different filing such as an intake questionnaire, can constitute [an administrative] charge for certain purposes.\" (citations omitted)).

Also, defendant's Reply raises a series of unanswered questions. Did defendant receive the questionnaire before plaintiff filed this lawsuit?

The court denies the current motion because it concludes that the current record is insufficient to decide the first question in every federal court case: Does subject matter jurisdiction exist? On its own motion, then, the court grants plaintiff leave to amend her Complaint. The court establishes a comprehensive schedule at the end of this order. Plaintiff's amended complaint must plead sufficient material so the court can decide whether its jurisdiction reaches plaintiff's claims. This obligation includes each fact she relies on to establish administrative exhaustion and thus, jurisdiction. If defendant contends that plaintiff's amended allegations do not suffice to establish exhaustion, it may renew its motion to dismiss. If defendant believes the new\n   filing establishes jurisdiction-for the moment, anyway-it should file an Answer. If defendant renews its motion to dismiss, the parties' filings should discuss the implications of the Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Needham\n   </em>\n   , a case decided after briefing on the current motion concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The following interim schedule governs the proceedings in this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (1) No later than 10 days from the date of this Order, plaintiff must file an amended complaint alleging all facts she relies on to establish subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (2) Within 15 days of plaintiff filing her amended complaint, defendant may file a renewed motion to dismiss challenging the jurisdictional sufficiency of plaintiff's amended allegations. If defendant elects not to file such a motion to dismiss, it must file a timely Answer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (3) Within 15 days of any new motion to dismiss filed by defendant, plaintiff must file her Opposition to the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (4) Defendant must file any Reply within 10 days of plaintiff's Opposition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, consistent with Rule 1's mandate that the court must apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to promote the just, speedy, and inexpensive resolution of every civil case, the court stays discovery and all other pre-trial proceedings until the jurisdictional questions are resolved. If defendant does not file a renewed motion to dismiss, the parties are directed to notify Deputy Clerk Megan Garrett (by email at KSD_Crabtree_Chambers@ksd.uscourts.gov) so that the court can lift the stay and return the case to normal case-management procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    *8 IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT\n   </strong>\n   defendant Kansas City Steak Company, LLC's Motion for Partial Dismissal of Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. 6) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT\n   </strong>\n   plaintiff must file an amended complaint within 10 days of the date of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    All Citations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Slip Copy,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202985748\">\n    2017 WL 2985748\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201551990\">\n    2017 WL 1551990\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   United States District Court,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   D.

[Doc. 7] Plaintiff L.J. Dolin (Dolin) responded on August 19, 2016. [Doc. 13] TKE replied on September 2, 2016. [Doc. 15] The Court has considered the parties' submissions and the relevant law, and is otherwise fully informed. For the following reasons, the\n   Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   TKE's\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   as to Dolin's hostile-work-environment claim. The Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   TKE's\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   TKE manufactures, installs, and services elevators throughout the United States. [Doc. 7-1, pg. 3 (asserting this fact); Doc. 13 (not disputing this fact) ] Its mechanics who maintain those elevators are represented by the International Union of Elevator Constructors (IUEC). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The IUEC and TKE entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) which governs wages and employment of those mechanics. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In addition, \"Local Representative (LR)\" agreements govern mechanics who work in remote locations and provide for additional terms and conditions of employment. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Dolin worked in such a remote location and was subject to an LR agreement. [Doc. 7-1, pg. 3 (referencing the LR agreement applicable to Dolin); Doc. 13, pg. 3 (not disputing this fact) ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The LR agreement governing Dolin in 2008 included a wage provision stating that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   [t]he Employee will be paid based upon the Local No. 131 wage rate in accordance with the prevailing wages, fringes, and Local Expense Agreement negotiated between the Company and the Local., [sic] During the first six (6) months of this assignment, she will be paid six-percent (6%) above the mechanic rate and shall thereafter be paid twelve and one-half (12.5%) above scale as long as she is assigned to the Roswell, NM Local Office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   [Doc. 7-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 13, Ex. A, pg. 5 (2009 local office assignment with the same provision) ] Dolin was paid consistently with this provision until March, 2010, when she was terminated. [Doc. 7-1, pg. 4 (stating this fact); Doc. 13, pg. 3 (not disputing this fact) ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In April, 2010, Dolin filed a complaint with the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions/Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging wrongful termination on the basis of sex and sexual orientation. [Doc. 7-1, pg. 4 (stating this fact); Doc. 13, pg. 3 (not disputing this fact) ] The parties settled the dispute in August, 2010. As part of the settlement, Dolin agreed to withdraw her complaint and the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions closed its file related to Dolin's charge. [Doc. 7-1, pg. 4 (stating that the file was closed); Doc. 13, pg. 3 (stating that Dolin requested that the file be closed) ] In addition, TKE agreed to pay Dolin a lump sum of $29,266 and to reinstate her to \"her former position\" at the \"prevailing negotiated Mechanic's wage rate of IUEC Local 131.\" [Doc. 7-1, pg. 4 (stating these facts); Doc. 13, pg. 3 (not disputing these facts); Doc. 7-5 (the Settlement Agreement) ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    *2\n   </strong>\n   The present dispute arises out of TKE's failure to pay Dolin the 12.5% supplement over the base wage rate for Service Mechanics. From August, 2010 to February, 2016, when Dolin was transferred to another TKE location, she was paid the base mechanic's wage without the 12.5% supplement. [Doc. 1, \u00b6 44 (stating that TKE discriminated against her \"whenever [it] issued [Dolin] pay checks that withheld the 12.5% LR Service Mechanic rate.\"); Doc. 7-1, pg. 4 n. 4; Doc. 13, pg. 3 (referencing the \"plus rate\") ] Dolin contends that she never agreed in the Settlement Agreement to a wage rate that did not include the 12.5% supplement. [Doc. 13, pg. 3, \u00b6 4]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Dolin filed a second EEOC complaint in January 2014, alleging discrimination based on sex and sexual orientation, as well as retaliation. [Doc. 7-8] The form alleged that the discrimination was a \"continuing action\" that took place from August\n   11, 2010 to January 17, 2014. [Doc. 7-8] The EEOC issued a \"Notice of Right to Sue\" to Dolin in March 2016. [Doc. 1, \u00b6 7]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In June 2016, Dolin filed a\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   in this Court alleging that TKE discriminated against her based on her sex by paying her less than it paid similarly situated male workers performing similar work. [Doc. 1] Dolin also alleges that TKE retaliated against her for filing the 2010 claim of discrimination with the EEOC. [Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 51, 53-54; Doc. 13, pg. 4, \u00b6 9]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   TKE now moves for dismissal of Dolin's claims. TKE argues that some of Dolin's claims should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and that other claims should be dismissed for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). TKE also argues, in the alternative, that it should be granted summary judgment on Dolin's pay discrimination claims under Rule 56. [Doc. 7]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   TKE makes three arguments. First, that Dolin's hostile-work-environment and retaliation claims must be dismissed because Dolin failed to exhaust administrative remedies. TKE argues that such failure deprives this Court of jurisdiction over these claims under Rule 12(b)(1). Second, that Dolin has inadequately pled sex discrimination and retaliation claims under Rule 12(b)(6). Third, that it is entitled to summary judgment because there is no dispute that Dolin agreed to forego the 12.5% supplement in the 2010 Settlement Agreement. These arguments are addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   TKE argues that this Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over Dolin's harassment/hostile-work-environment and retaliation claims because Dolin failed to exhaust administrative remedies regarding those claims. [Doc. 7-1, pg. 7-8]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1)\"generally take one of two forms: (1) a facial attack on the sufficiency of the complaint's allegations as to subject matter jurisdiction; or (2) a challenge to the actual facts upon which subject matter jurisdiction is based.\"\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v. McDonnell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453321\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/1173/#p1180\">\n    299 F.3d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1180 (10th Cir. 2002). Here, TKE's challenge rests on the facts behind Dolin's 2014 EEOC complaint. Therefore, TKE mounts a factual attack on this Court's jurisdiction. \"In reviewing a factual attack, a court has wide discretion to allow affidavits, other documents, and a limited evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed jurisdictional facts,\" and a court's reference to such materials does not necessarily convert such a factual attack into a Rule 56 motion.\n   <em>\n    Stuart v.

Unless it is shown that no re-drafting of the pleadings could cure the jurisdictional defect, a dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction generally is not a decision on the merits and, therefore, constitutes a dismissal without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Hollander v. Sandoz Pharm.

[Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 59] To the extent that Dolin makes harassment or hostile-work-environment claims, such claims must be dismissed because they were not exhausted through the EEOC administrative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Although there are cases stating that failure to exhaust administrative remedies raises jurisdictional questions, recent cases have held that some aspects of exhaustion are merely preconditions to suit, not jurisdictional. In\n   <em>\n    Shikles v. Sprint/United Management Co.\n   </em>\n   , our Tenth Circuit stated that \"a plaintiff's exhaustion of his or her administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit under Title VII-not merely a condition precedent to suit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8920816\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/1304/\">\n    426 F.3d 1304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1317 (10th Cir. 2005). In\n   <em>\n    Gad v. Kansas State University\n   </em>\n   , however, the Tenth Circuit held that Title VII's requirement that an EEOC charge be verified, although a requirement for filing for an administrative remedy, is not jurisdictional.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228395\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1032/\">\n    787 F.3d 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1038 (10th Cir. 2015). Instead, the verification requirement is an important component of an EEOC claim that may be raised (or waived) as a defense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228395\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1032/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228395\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1032/\">\n    at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"[h]olding verification non-jurisdictional does not imply any diminution in the need for plaintiffs to comply with this Title VII requirement\" and that \"an employer that identifies and raises a verification defect may still achieve the dismissal of a plaintiff's suit,\" and calling the verification requirement \"a waivable claim processing provision that does not invoke our subject matter jurisdiction\" (alterations, internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Although the\n   <em>\n    Gad\n   </em>\n   Court did not expressly overrule\n   <em>\n    Shikles\n   </em>\n   , it stated that\n   <em>\n    Shikles\n   </em>\n   depended on earlier cases that preceded United States Supreme Court cases addressing Title VII jurisdictional issues and that \"the subsequent development of the law underscores the limited force our earlier cases retain today.\"\n   <em>\n    Gad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228395\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1032/\">\n    787 F.3d at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The only reference to \"hostile work environment\" in the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   includes a statement that Dolin \"became aware\" that some of her male colleagues \"believed [that Dolin's] persistent complaints about the LR rate pay inequity caused co-workers to lose pay.\" [Doc. 1, \u00b6 50] This paragraph also alleges that \"some, not all, male LR Service Mechanics\" did not receive annual increases as provided for by the CBA.

TKE argues that, to the extent that Dolin argues that TKE retaliated against her for her 2010 EEOC claim by withholding the 12.5% supplement, the retaliation claim must be dismissed because the decision to pay her the base wage rate only was made over 300 days before the 2014 EEOC charge was filed. [Doc. 7-1, pg. 9; Doc. 15, pg. 6]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Court understands Dolin's claims to be that 1) TKE paid her less than it paid male workers in similar positions based on her sex, and 2) TKE paid her less than workers in similar positions in retaliation for her 2010 EEOC charge. Dolin's retaliation claim is, therefore, an alternative theory for why she was paid less than other workers. Because Dolin's retaliation claim is grounded in the way TKE paid Dolin, it is differentiated from retaliation claims grounded in a discrete, nonrecurring, act such as termination or failure to promote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Some background on the law related to timing requirements for Title VII claims is necessary to place the parties' arguments in context.

In the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , Dolin states that the 12.5% supplement was paid when the Service Mechanic was required to work under certain conditions, to wit, the Service Mechanic \"was required to be 'on call' on a 24/7 basis, was required to respond to client service calls within two (2) hours, and when the Mechanic's assigned route included servicing clients located outside the geographic area identified in the collective bargaining agreement as the 'primary zone.' \" [Doc. 1, pg. 3, \u00b6 16] Dolin states that, when she was hired, she accepted assignment to the \"same client service route\" as had been assigned to her male predecessor, who was paid the 12.5% supplement. [Doc. 1, pg. 4, \u00b6 17] She states that in March 2010, when Dolin was terminated, TKE \"continued to pay other LR Service Mechanics who were male and whose job assignments met the conditions for the LR rate.\" [Doc. 1, pg. 4, \u00b6 21] She alleges that when she was reinstated, she was \"assigned [a] client route outside the primary zone, required ... to be in on call status 24/7 for all clients in her route, and required ... to respond to calls within two (2) hours.\" [Doc. 1, pg. 4-5, \u00b6 23] She further alleges that in spite of being assigned work subject to the conditions meriting\n   the 12.5% supplement, she was not paid the supplement. [Doc. 1, pg. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28] The references to the \"conditions\" for the 12.5% supplement are sufficient to support Dolin's assertions that 1) the 12.5% supplement is paid on performance under certain conditions, 2) she worked under those conditions, 3) she was not paid the supplement, but 4) male workers working under those conditions were paid the supplement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    *9\n   </strong>\n   While these allegations in the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   do not reference skills and specific duties, the lack of such reference does not constitute a failure to state a claim. Dolin's suit does not rest on TKE's failure to pay her as a Service Mechanic. Instead, it depends entirely on a failure to pay the 12.5% supplement. Since the supplement is dependent on working conditions, not skills or duties, Dolin's factual allegations are sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Moreover, the Court is unpersuaded by TKE's argument that Dolin failed to allege facts related to male workers within the same \"establishment\" because Dolin did not identify comparators who worked in Roswell, as she did. [Doc. 15, pg. 2] Dolin does not dispute TKE's assertion that while she was assigned to Roswell, NM, she was the only Service Mechanic so assigned. [Doc. 7-1, pg. 4, \u00b6 2 (stating this fact); Doc. 13, pg. 3 (not disputing this fact) ] Consequently, there were no Service Mechanics working in Roswell at the same time as Dolin to whom Dolin could point as comparators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Nevertheless, TKE's argument fails on two fronts. First, Dolin identifies a Roswell employee who both preceded her and succeeded her as a comparator and asserts that he was paid the 12.5% supplement throughout his assignment to Roswell. [Doc. 1, pg. 4, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20]\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201620.13\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1620.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4) (1998) (referencing a successor as a comparator).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Second, under the circumstances here, the \"establishment\" inquiry must be broader than TKE suggests. Both the EPA and the NM Fair Pay for Women Act reference \"the establishment\" in prohibiting discrimination based on sex.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   No employer shall discriminate,\n   <em>\n    within any establishment\n   </em>\n   in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees\n   <em>\n    in the establishment\n   </em>\n   at a rate less than the rate that the employer pays wages to employees of the opposite sex\n   <em>\n    in the establishment\n   </em>\n   for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort and responsibility and that are performed under similar working conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   \u00a7 28-23-3 (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   TKE's argument rests on a narrow construction of the term \"establishment.\" The Secretary of Labor defines \"establishment\" as a physical location, stating that \"establishment\" \"refers to a distinct physical place of business rather than to an entire business or 'enterprise' which may include several separate places of business. Accordingly, each physically separate place of business is ordinarily considered a separate establishment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201620.9\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1620.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). However, the Secretary also recognized that in \"unusual circumstances,\" \"two or more distinct physical portions of a business enterprise [may warrant] being treated as a single establishment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201620.9\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1620.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

[Doc. 7-1, pg. 3, \u00b6 1 (stating this fact); Doc. 13 (not disputing this fact) ] These agreements indicate centralized control of job descriptions, salaries, and assignments. In addition, it is the very nature of Dolin's assignment by TKE that renders her unable to identify any Roswell comparators. Indeed, it appears that, under TKE's reasoning, none of their employees working under \"local representative agreements\" would ever be able to identify comparators in the same town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Given that TKE hires Service Mechanics to work independently out of remote locations, Dolin appropriately identified other Service Mechanics as comparators (in addition to the one Roswell employee) for her wage discrimination claims, even if those mechanics work in other locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <em>\n    Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   In its final argument, TKE argues that it \"paid Dolin based on a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, which was based on a factor other than sex-settlement of a grievance and EEOC charge.\" [Doc. 7-1, pg. 14]\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (permitting \"a [wage] differential based on any other factor other than sex\").

For instance, TKE maintains that it paid Dolin \"the prevailing negotiated mechanic's wage rate of IUEC Local 131, as provided for in the [S]ettlement [A]greement.\" [Doc. 7-1, pg. 4, \u00b6 6] TKE apparently understands the \"prevailing negotiated mechanic's wage rate of IUEC Local 131\" to mean the base wage rate only. In contrast, Dolin understands the \"prevailing negotiated mechanic's wage rate of IUEC Local 131\" to mean the base wage rate plus 12.5% as negotiated in the Local Representative Agreement. [Compare Doc. 7-1, pg. 4 with Doc. 13, pg. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    *11\n   </strong>\n   In her\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   , Dolin disputes that she agreed to forego the 12.5% supplement in settlement negotiations. [Doc. 13, pg. 3, \u00b6 4] However, in her own affidavit, which Dolin attached to her response to TKE's motion to dismiss, Dolin states that \"[i]n order to get my job back, I was left no choice by TKE except ... to accept only the elevator mechanic base wage rate under the CBA.\" [Doc. 13, Exh. A] She also states that she\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   was advised by [her] union representative ... that if [she] accepted this settlement,\n   <em>\n    including the agreement between the IUEC and TKE that my pay would only be the base mechanic rate\n   </em>\n   upon my re-hire and assignment to the same customer route, that once I resumed performing the work ... the union would negotiate the 12.5% LR rate again as soon as feasible.... On this basis and to get my job back, I agreed to accept the settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   [Doc. 13, Exh. A (emphasis added) ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Hence, Dolin's own affidavit contradicts her assertion that she did not agree to forego the supplement in the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   However, even if there were no question of fact as to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, TKE is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Although Dolin has the burden of proof at trial to demonstrate that TKE discriminated against her, the fact that she may have agreed to forego the 12.5% supplement is not dispositive on this issue because \"the mere existence of a wage agreement cannot be considered a 'factor other than sex' if the contract perpetuates pay differentials which would themselves violate the [Equal Pay] Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

The Letter is addressed to Defendant's counsel and alleges several violations of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, including that Mr. Gery's declaration \"intentionally misleads the court and was made in bad faith,\" that Plaintiff's former counsel and Mr. Gery \"attempted in good-faith to engage in constructive conversation starting in February 2017 to resolve Ms. Cirocco's case,\" and that, as part of those efforts, \"the parties stayed discovery among other deadlines in the EEO process.\" [\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1]. Plaintiff's former counsel also wrote that he had sent a separate email to Defense counsel, on October 11, 2017, \"detailing more facts with regard to Mr. Gery's bad-faith affidavit.\" [\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ] In its Reply, Defendant contends that \"Plaintiff has not complied with the 'safe harbor' provision of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(2) - which requires that a motion for sanctions must be served, but not filed or presented to the court until 21 days after service,\" and thus the allegations asserted in the Letter are not properly before the Court; Defendant additionally contends, \"[i]n any event, it is wholly without merit.\" [# 25 at 2 n.1]. If true, the allegations in the Letter would suggest that Plaintiff's participation in phases of the EEO proceeding ceased as a result of her attorney's agreement with SBA representatives and their efforts at reaching a resolution, and, at a minimum, creates an issue as to whether Ms. Cirocco failed to cooperate during the EEOC process, which is not properly resolved at the motion to dismiss phase. However, Plaintiff fails to provide any account of what occurred prior to filing her lawsuit, and, therefore, Defendant's assertion that Plaintiff did not participate in the EEOC investigation remains uncontroverted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    In so finding, the court must dismiss the action; it cannot then assume jurisdiction exists and address Defendant's Rule 12(b)(6) argument in the alternative.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Colorado Outfitters Ass'n v.
