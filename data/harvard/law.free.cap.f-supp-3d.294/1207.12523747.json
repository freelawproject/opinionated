The evidence regarding Denny's level of intoxication at the time he purchased gasoline and the effect the alcohol had on his appearance when he encountered Pine is genuinely disputed. Plaintiff presented Dr. Goldstein's calculation that Denny's blood alcohol level would have been approximately .21 at the time he purchased the gasoline, a level unlawful under New Mexico's drunk driving statute,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2066-8-102\">\n     N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 66-8-102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(1) (West 2016). At this level of intoxication, Dr. Goldstein extrapolated that Denny's physiological manifestations could have included muscular incoordination, a staggering gait, slurred speech, lethargy, exaggerated emotional states, and disorientation and drowsiness. However, Defendant presented testimony from Yazzie suggesting that Denny did not present some of the manifestations that Dr. Goldstein describes. For example, Yazzie testified that Denny operated the gas pump, spoke in an intelligible manner, and walked to and from the gas station without problems. Moreover, as Defendant notes, although Dr. Goldstein can guess Denny's likely blood alcohol level, no actual record evidence establishes the exact concentration of alcohol in Denny's blood at the time he made the purchases.\n   </opinion>\n   <p type=\"majority\">\n    <p id=\"p-7\">\n     <strong>\n      <em>\n       MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     <strong>\n      THIS MATTER\n     </strong>\n     comes before the Court on Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Negligent Entrustment.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     The following facts are either undisputed or are relevant facts, established by admissible evidence, that most favor Defendant Giant Four Corners, Inc.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     On the evening of December 29, 2011, Andy Denny drove to a high school basketball tournament in Window Rock, Arizona, which was about an hour and fifteen minutes away from his home. [Doc. 48-1, p. 2 at 18:11-18] Around 8:00 P.M, after watching about 40 or 45 minutes of a basketball game, Denny drove to Gallup, New Mexico, where he stopped to purchase beer at a grocery store. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 6 at 46:8-10; 46:13-19] Denny drank three or four beers before heading to a bar in Gallup. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 6 at 47:3-8] Denny remained at the bar until it closed around 2:00 A.M. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 6 at 47:23-25] Denny testified at a later deposition that he consumed five more beers and two shots of hard liquor in the five hours he was at the bar. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 6 at 47:14-48:5]\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     Later, in the early morning hours of December 30, 2011, before the accident, Denny went to Tohatchi to pick up his friend Cecilia Yazzie. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 3 at 27:3-21] Although Yazzie could not remember if Denny appeared intoxicated at that time, she testified that she was not scared to get in the car with him. [Doc. 48-2, p. 8 at 50:16-20; p. 11 at 69:22-25] Denny and Yazzie provide conflicting testimony about who then drove Denny's vehicle-Denny stated that Yazzie drove throughout the time they were together, while Yazzie explained that Denny drove at all times she was with him. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 8 at 50:7-25-51:1; p. 11 at 67:18-22; p. 9 at 63:17-25-64:1-4] At approximately 5:00 A.M., Denny's car ran out of gas. [Doc. 43-1, p. 3 at 28:20-23] Denny and Yazzie walked approximately one mile to the nearest gas station, the Tohatchi Giant gas station. [Doc. 43-2, p. 2 at 19:14-25-20:1-2; p. 5 at 52:1-8] During the walk to the gas station, Denny drank two more beers. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 2 at 20:14-22; 21:2-4] Yazzie testified that Denny walked to the gas station without problems and that she had no trouble understanding his speech. [Doc. 48-2, p. 8 at 52:25-53:1-14] At the gas station, Yazzie was intoxicated, and believed that Denny was too. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 4 at 22:4-16] However, Yazzie could not remember whether Denny displayed manifestations of intoxication, such as slurred speech or difficulty walking, though she recalls his breath smelling like alcohol. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 2 at 8:16-25; 9:1-5]\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     The Giant gas station did not have any gasoline cans available for purchase, so Yazzie suggested they buy a liter of soda and use the bottle to carry gasoline back to Denny's car. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 9 at 58:3-12; Doc. 43-2, p. 6 at 56:2-3] Yazzie stated that the clerk, Gloria Pine, refused to sell anything to her and believed that was because Pine knew Yazzie was intoxicated. [Doc. 48-2, p. 4 at 22:1-3] She also testified that when she asked whether they could purchase the soda bottle and use it for gas, Pine responded \"no\" and \"both of you look intoxicated.\" [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 9 at 58:13-15] However, there is no evidence in the record that Pine initially refused to sell anything to Denny, and, Pine did sell Denny a gallon of water and a gallon of gasoline at approximately 5:20 A.M. [Doc. 43-2 p. 3 at 25:6-8; p. 7 at 60:20-25-61:1-5; Doc. 43-5]. Denny and Yazzie then went to a gas pump, dumped the jug's contents, and Yazzie held the gallon jug while Denny pumped gas into it. [Doc. 48-2, p. 5 at 26:1-4] Denny and Yazzie then returned to Denny's vehicle on foot. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 10 at 62:10-12] Yazzie testified that on the return trip Denny again walked without problems. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 10 at 63:18-22] They deposited the gallon of gasoline into the car, and returned to the gas station about twenty minutes later. [Doc. 43-2, p. 4 at 28:11-14] Denny went into the store, and around 5:40 A.M.,\n     Pine sold Denny an additional nine gallons of gasoline, a pack of cigarettes, and a soda. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 4 at 29:5-14; Doc. 43-5]\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     After dropping Yazzie off at her house, at about 6:40 A.M., Denny, alone in his car, drove his vehicle across the center line on U.S. Highway 491 and collided with Marcellino Morris's vehicle. [Doc. 48-2 p. 5 at 29:23-25; Doc. 43-6] Denny survived the collision but Mr. Morris died as a result of the crash. [Doc. 43-6, p. 3] Officer Daniel Kalleco was the first officer to arrive to the scene of the collision and reported that he observed signs of intoxication when he spoke to Denny. [Doc. 43-7, p. 2 at 21:17-21] More than three hours after the crash, Denny's blood alcohol level was .176. [Doc. 43-3, p. 2 at 32:7-8] Expert toxicologist, Dr. Paul Goldstein, later calculated that Denny's blood alcohol level would have been approximately .21 at the time he purchased the gasoline. [Doc. 43-8, p. 2]\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     The Tohatchi Giant store did not sell alcohol. [Doc.48-3, p. 5 at 97:18-20] Criminal Investigator Christopher Reyes Tsosie testified that in his experience, gas stations in the area sell gasoline to intoxicated persons. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 7 at 109:21-24] And both Tsosie and Kalleco testified that they did not know of a gas station that would refuse to sell gasoline to an intoxicated person. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 4 at 93:15-25; Doc. 48-4, p. 3 at 42:3-6] Pine had discretion to refuse a sale of gasoline to an intoxicated person, and she received training to identify the signs of intoxication in a person. [Doc. 43-4, p. 2 at 28:12-25-29:1-8; p. 3 at 38:1-10] However, Pine testified to having no memory of her work shift on December 30, 2011. [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 3 at 40:4-7]\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-17\">\n     In a later deposition Denny described himself as an alcoholic at the time of the crash. [Doc. 48-1, p. 10 at 68:7-24] He admitted to driving while drunk before, and would sometimes drink to the point of \"blackout.\" [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     p. 11 at 70:10-21] Both parties agree that Denny consumed at least ten beers and two shots of hard liquor from the time he starting drinking around 8:00 P.M. until the time he encountered Pine around 5:20 A.M. the next day, but the parties disagree about his level of intoxication at the time he purchased gasoline and what effect the alcohol had on his appearance when he encountered Pine.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-18\">\n     <strong>\n      II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-19\">\n     Plaintiff originally filed suit in the District Court of the Navajo Nation in Crownpoint, New Mexico. [Doc. 38-1] That court granted Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the basis that Plaintiff's suit was filed after the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims under the Navajo Nation Code.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     7 N.N.C. \u00a7 602(A)(1). [Doc. 38-5] Plaintiff has appealed the decision to the Navajo Nation Supreme Court and is currently awaiting a ruling on that appeal.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-20\">\n     Before the District Court of the Navajo Nation issued a decision on the summary judgment motion, Plaintiff filed a wrongful death complaint alleging vicarious liability for negligent entrustment of a chattel and direct liability for negligent hiring, training, and supervision in New Mexico state district court, [Doc. 1-1], which Defendant removed to this Court. [Doc. 1] On November 5, 2015, Defendant filed motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), or, in the alternative to stay the case pending Plaintiff's exhaustion of tribal court remedies, arguing the case should be precluded under the doctrine of res judicata. [Doc. 38] This Court denied Defendant's motion to dismiss, concluding that the tribal court's dismissal on statute of limitations grounds had no preclusive effect on the current proceedings.

For purposes of deciding this Motion only, the Court will assume without deciding that Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to refrain from making an entrustment that created an appreciable risk of harm.

Defendant argues that gasoline is not \"chattel\" that is entrusted, but rather is merchandise that is sold. Because a seller like Defendant loses ownership of merchandise at the time of sale, Defendant claims that it cannot be liable for negligent entrustment (citing\n     <em>\n      AAA Cooper Transp.

Since Defendant sold the gasoline, it had no control over it, thereby extinguishing Defendant's liability.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-38\">\n     New Mexico courts have not squarely answered whether merchandise is chattel capable of being negligently entrusted. However, New Mexico courts do follow \u00a7 390 of the Restatement which provides that, in the context of a sale, negligent entrustment liability under \u00a7 390 attaches to any supplier of chattel, including \"\n     <em>\n      sellers\n     </em>\n     , lessors, donors or lenders ....\" Restatement \u00a7 390 cmt. a.

These authorities represent a nearly unanimous trend-if not the weight-of authority. Keeping with this trend, and applying \u00a7 390 of the Restatement, the Court believes that negligent entrustment applies to sales of chattel, and that merchants such as Defendant can be held liable for negligent entrustment.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-39\">\n     Defendant next argues that negligent entrustment liability ends at the point of sale. A minority of courts agrees with Defendant, reasoning that once a sale is completed, the seller no longer has control of the chattel, and so cannot be liable for\n     its misuse.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      AAA Cooper Transp. Co.,\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7064082\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/18/909/#p914\">\n      18 So.3d at 914\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . On the other hand, other authorities have noted \"severe[ ] critici[sm]\" of that view. The Tennessee Supreme Court overruled 50 years of precedent holding that entrustment ends at the point of sale.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      West\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8917959\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/172/545/#p548\">\n      172 S.W.3d at 554-55\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . As explained by that court, \"[i]t is negligent entrusting which creates the unreasonable risk; and this is none the less when the goods are conveyed.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8917959\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/172/545/#p548\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8917959\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/172/545/#p548\">\n      at 554\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Thus, negligent entrustment occurs \"at the moment when control of chattel is relinquished by an entrustor to an incompentent user.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8917959\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/172/545/#p548\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     at 555 ;\n     <em>\n      Delana\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802963\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/486/316/#p325\">\n      486 S.W.3d at 325-26\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (overruling three lower court opinions holding that a sale of goods extinguished a seller's liability for negligent entrustment, noting that those opinions were contrary to the \u00a7 390 of the Restatement). And, many of the authorities cited in the previous paragraph suggest that a sale of merchandise does not extinguish a seller's liability, since in most cases a seller was found liable for negligent entrustment after it had sold an item. The trend of authority suggests that a seller's liability for negligent entrustment does not end at the point of sale.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-40\">\n     Next, noting that New Mexico negligent entrustment cases arise primarily from automobile entrustments, Defendant contends that there is a difference between an instrumentality such as an automobile-which can be used in a dangerous manner-and the gasoline involved here. According to Defendant, it is not liable for furnishing gasoline to Denny because \"Denny used the gasoline in precisely the manner that it was designed to be used: to serve as fuel for an automobile. Denny's negligence thus does not stem from his use of the gasoline he purchased; instead, it arose from his operation of a motor vehicle while he was intoxicated.\" [Doc. 48, p. 11] Defendant represents that it is liable to Plaintiff \"only if the Court equates using gasoline to fuel a car with operating the fueled vehicle in a negligent manner.\" [\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     ]\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-41\">\n     However, by focusing on Denny's negligence Defendant misunderstands that negligent entrustment is based on the negligence of the entrustor, not that of the entrustee. \"[T]he crux of the negligence is the knowledge of the entruster of the ... known propensity towards reckless and irresponsible behavior, or other quality of the entrustee, indicating the possibility that he will cause injury.\"\n     <em>\n      Douglass v. Hartford Ins.

Liability for negligent entrustment arises from the act of entrustment, not from the entrustee's conduct.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      McCarson\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1984-NMCA-129\">\n      1984-NMCA-129\n     </extracted-citation>\n     at \u00b6 13,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1580074\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/102/151/#p155\">\n      102 N.M. 151\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1580074\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/102/151/#p155\">\n      692 P.2d 537\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (\"it is negligent\n     <em>\n      to make an entrustment\n     </em>\n     that creates an appreciable risk of harm.\") (emphasis added). Defendant's liability for negligent entrustment does not hinge on Denny's use of the gasoline-even if the gasoline was used for its avowed purpose of powering his vehicle. The tort is not based on an entrustee's use of the chattel; it is based on the entrustor's negligence in entrusting a chattel to an incompetent user.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-42\">\n     Finally, Defendant suggests that since no New Mexico case has examined whether vended gasoline is an instrumentality for purposes of a negligent entrustment claim, New Mexico law confines the tort to automobiles only. However, any doubt about whether negligent entrustment applies outside of the automobile context is resolved by New Mexico's jury instruction on negligent entrustment. The instruction expressly provides that it \"may apply to chattels other than automobiles,\" UJI 13-1646 NMRA 2017, indicating that New Mexico's negligent entrustment law anticipates application to various chattels.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-43\">\n     In sum, the Court concludes that a sale of gasoline is an entrustment of chattel under \u00a7 390 of the Restatement, which\n     New Mexico follows; that a sale of that chattel does not extinguish a seller's liability; and that negligent entrustment claims are not restricted to the automobile context. Plaintiff has carried his summary judgment burden to show that Defendant made an entrustment when it sold Denny gasoline, thereby satisfying the first element of his negligent entrustment claim.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-44\">\n     <strong>\n      ii.\n      <em>\n       Whether Defendant Knew or Should Have Known Denny Was Intoxicated\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-45\">\n     The next element that Plaintiff must prove is that Defendant knew or should have known that Denny was intoxicated when it sold him gasoline. Construing all reasonable inferences in Defendant's favor as the Court must on a motion for summary judgment, the Court finds that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether Defendant, through its gas station clerk Gloria Pine, knew or should have known that Denny was intoxicated such that entrusting him gasoline posed the risk of injury to others. The record indicates that the first time Yazzie and Denny went to the Giant gas station Pine told them \"both of your look intoxicated\" and refused to sell them a soda bottle to use for gasoline. On the other hand, the record also indicates that while Pine refused to sell anything to Yazzie, she did not refuse a sale to Denny in the same manner. In fact, Pine did sell Denny a gallon of water and gasoline-twice.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-47\">\n     The Court cannot say that Pine's statement to Denny and Yazzie that they both looked intoxicated, Yazzie's statements about whether she perceived Denny as intoxicated, and Dr. Goldstein's report is evidence \"so powerful that no reasonable jury would be free to disbelieve it.\"\n     <em>\n      Leone\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061586\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/1149/#p1153\">\n      810 F.3d at 1153\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .

Since Denny's use of the gasoline \"could ... have been used for any purpose, from fueling a generator to cleaning engine parts to killing weeds or fueling a car,\" [Doc. 48, p. 11] Defendant asserts that Denny's choice to use the gasoline in a reckless and criminal manner broke the causal chain that resulted in Plaintiff's injury. Plaintiff responds that Denny's use of the gasoline was not so fortuitous. Likening selling gasoline to Denny to supplying a car key to a drunk driver, Plaintiff contends that Defendant's negligence in selling gasoline to a clearly intoxicated person was a substantial factor in causing injury, thereby satisfying proximate causation. Gasoline was the \"needed part to get [Denny] back on the road.\" [Doc. 43, p. 9] Since Defendant gave it to him, Defendant created a foreseeable risk of harm, according to Plaintiff, thereby making Defendant liable\n     even though Denny drove in a tortious and criminal manner.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-53\">\n     Applying\n     <em>\n      Herrera\n     </em>\n     , Denny's criminal driving does not as a matter of law foreclose Defendant's liability.
