The only two issues for the Court is 1) whether Kavulich's actions violate GBL \u00a7 349 and 2) whether Kavulich's conduct was egregious enough to allow a jury to decide the issue of punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    GBL \u00a7 349\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Morales argues that Kavulich violated \u00a7 349 by 1) enforcing non-existent judgments, 2) sending out Restraints and Executions that systematically fail to credit money paid on those judgments, and 3) falsely implying he had performed a meaningful review in signing and serving the Restraint and Execution. Defendants counter with two arguments. First, Kavulich's conduct falls under GBL \u00a7 601(8), which prohibits a creditor or an agent thereof from \"claim[ing], or attempt[ing] or theaten[ing] to enforce a right with knowledge or reason to know that the right does not exist,\" and thus Morales cannot bring an action alleging a violation of \u00a7 349 based on those acts. Second, pointing to Morales's affidavit, he was not deceived or misled into believing there was a judgment against him and thus Kavulich's conduct was not materially misleading. Both arguments fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Regarding the first argument, Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Gomez v.

In\n   <em>\n    Conboy\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that a plaintiff could not plead a claim for violation of \u00a7 349 by alleging that a violation of GBL \u00a7 601(6) necessarily constitutes a deceptive act under GBL \u00a7 349.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136679\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/242/#p258\">\n    241 F.3d at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court finds\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   unpersuasive and joins the weight of the authority in finding that a plaintiff can bring a \u00a7 349 claim based on conduct that is also violative of a \u00a7 601 claim, as long as the conduct meets all of the elements of a \u00a7 349 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   GBL \u00a7 349 prohibits \"[d]eceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service.\" GBL \u00a7 349(a).

The undisputed facts are that Morales received a restraining notice and execution that misrepresented that he had a judgment entered against him. Accordingly, the information subpoena and restraining notice were materially misleading, and Morales is entitled to summary judgment on his \u00a7 349 claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Punitive Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Morales argues that he is entitled to punitive damages under two different claims: conversion and \u00a7 349.

Here, Kavulich repeatedly enforces either non-existent or vacated judgments; he is aware that this occurs but has not changed his business practices by fixing his computer system or meaningfully reviewing documents to stop it. Kavulich downplays the severity of his conduct by characterizing it as motivated by a desire to increase profits rather than by maliciousness or malice. In contrast, Morales characterizes Kavulich's actions as evincing criminal indifference towards the rights of himself and others. Because this is an issue of interpreting the character of Kavulich's actions, it creates a material question of whether his conduct qualifies as wanton and reckless or malicious. It is a question best left to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tillery v.
