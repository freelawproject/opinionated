Plaintiff timely filed objections to the M &amp; R, and the issues raised are ripe for ruling.

The claims were denied initially and upon reconsideration. Plaintiff requested hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\"), who, after hearing held May 21, 2015, denied plaintiff's claims by decision entered June 25, 2015. Following the ALJ's denial of her applications, plaintiff timely filed a request for review before the Appeals Council. The Appeals Council denied plaintiff's request, leaving the ALJ's decision as defendant's final decision. Plaintiff then filed this action seeking judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.

At step two, the ALJ found that plaintiff had the following severe impairments: lumbar degenerative disc disease, status post fusion, and left foot drop. At step three, the ALJ determined that these impairments were not severe enough, either individually or in combination, to meet or medically equal one of the listings in the regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that plaintiff had the residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to perform sedentary work with the following restrictions: sit/stand option at one hour intervals; use of a cane; never climb ladders; occasional climb stairs, balance, stoop, crouch, or crawl; no concentrated exposure to hazards such as moving machinery or unprotected heights; and further limited to unskilled work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At step four, the ALJ concluded plaintiff was unable to perform any past relevant work.

Because the ALJ's analysis of Listing 1.04A was insufficient, the court found it \"impossible for a reviewing court to evaluate whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ's findings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718319\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/288/#p295\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this case, the ALJ's explanation as to why plaintiff did not meet Listing 1.04A was insufficient. The ALJ acknowledged that plaintiff suffered from lumbar degenerative disc disease, (Tr. 29), but found that the evidence shows that plaintiff's spinal disorder does not involve compromise of a nerve root or the spinal cord. In support of this conclusion, the ALJ cites a June 7, 2011 assessment by Dr. Eric Laxer (\"Laxer\"), wherein Laxer notes a broken right S1 screw but no other problems visible on x-rays. (Tr. 368). The ALJ notes also that a January 2015 CT scan showed grade I anterolisthesis of L5 on S1, surgical changes with posterior hardware and fusion, and no significant protrusions or stenosis. (Tr. 29 (citing Tr. 544) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   However, the administrative record includes also discussion by Dr. Kenneth Wolfson (\"Wolfson\") of an August 30, 2010 MRI. (Tr. 459-60). Wolfson concluded that the MRI showed \"[t]here is significant flattening of the thecal sac at the L5-S1 level from spondylolisthesis and broad disc protrusion although a decompression laminectomy has been performed.\" (Tr. 460). On January 14, 2011, plaintiff complained of persistent low back pain and right foot weakness, and a physical examination showed limited flexion of the lumbar spine, positive straight leg raise, diminished patellar and Achilles jerks on the right compared to the left, notable dorsiflexion in the right foot, and right foot drop. (Tr. 333-34). Following another physical exam conducted March 8, 2011, Laxer concluded that plaintiff exhibited weakness in the left foot that shows chronic changes affecting\n   the left L4-L5 and S1 nerve roots. (Tr. 370). In sum, although the record contains no specific diagnosis of \"nerve root compression\" expressed in those terms, the foregoing evidence is germane to existence of \"flattening\" of the thecal sac, neuro-anatomic distribution of pain, limitation of motion of the spine, motor loss, sensory reflex loss, and presence of a positive straight leg raise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Listing 1.04A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Nothing indicates whether the ALJ considered any of the foregoing evidence. On these facts, where there exists \"a fair amount of evidence[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Radford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718319\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/288/#p295\">\n    734 F.3d at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that plaintiff exhibited the symptoms which Listing 1.04A associates in its text with nerve root compression, and where the ALJ did not discuss whether \"flattening\" of the thecal sac, as that term appears in the administrative record, is synonymous with or may imply \"nerve root compression,\" as that term is used in Listing 1.04A, the \"ALJ fails to discuss relevant evidence that weighs against his decision[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Ivey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8905343\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/393/387/#p390\">\n    393 F.Supp.2d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and fails to describe expressly what reasoning led to conclusion that such evidence does not require a finding that plaintiff suffered a compromised nerve root and nerve root compression characterized by the relevant symptoms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324803\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/176/#p189\">\n    826 F.3d at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These gaps in the ALJ's reasoning require remand for further consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324803\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/176/#p189\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant argues that any conclusion regarding existence of nerve root compression grounded in Wolfson's August 30, 2010, evaluation is speculative where Wolfson's evaluation \"fails to confirm\" the presence of nerve root compression characterized by symptoms noted in Listing 1.04A. (Def.'s Br., DE 22 at 5). This argument fails, however, because remand is required by virtue of the ALJ's failure to\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   this evidence and to explain the reasons for any conclusions that may follow therefrom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Radford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718319\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/288/#p295\">\n    734 F.3d at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, defendant's argument in address of persuasiveness of plaintiff's evidence on the merits is inapposite at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant argues further that, notwithstanding any other errors in the ALJ's decision, plaintiff cannot prevail under Listing 1.04A because the administrative record contains no evidence that any straight leg raise test was performed in both the sitting and supine positions, as Listing 1.04A requires. However, as another judge in this district reasoned, where an examiner performs a straight-leg raise test, it must be performed in some position.\n   <em>\n    Newkirk v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   , No. 7:15-cv-273-BO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201102615\">\n    2017 WL 1102615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D.N.C. Mar 22, 2017). Therefore, if the ALJ was presented with insufficient information to determine whether a straight leg raise test was performed in both the sitting and supine positions, the ALJ was required to \"try to resolve the ... insufficiency by\" recontacting a medical source, requesting additional existing evidence, requesting that plaintiff undergo a consultative examination, or asking plaintiff for more information.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .1520b(b)(2). Moreover, where the ALJ did not identify as a basis for denying plaintiff's claims any deficiencies in plaintiff's straight leg raise test results, the court cannot affirm defendant's decision on that ground.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.
