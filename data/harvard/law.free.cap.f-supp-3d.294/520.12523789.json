Doc. 42) filed by Defendants, New Orleans Metalworks, Inc. and David Waldheim; and Plaintiffs' reply (Rec. Doc. 53). Having considered the motion and legal memoranda, the record, and the applicable law, the Court finds that the motion should be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is a collective action filed by Plaintiffs, Osman Maldonado, Josue Nunez, Mauricio Hernandez, and Marvel Guerrero, under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (\"FLSA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs brought this suit on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated to recover allegedly unpaid overtime wages for manual work they performed for Defendants, O &amp; G Construction, LLC, Olan David Del Arca Sabat, New Orleans Metalworks, Inc, and David Waldheim. O &amp; G Construction, LLC (\"O &amp; G\") is a commercial construction company that is owned and managed by Olan David Del Arca Sabat and specializes in providing manual labor for general contractors, including New Orleans Metalworks, Inc. (\"NOMW\"). NOMW, owned by David Waldheim, is a general contractor that provides construction services in the greater New Orleans area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   NOMW allegedly engaged O &amp; G to provide labor for its jobsites. Plaintiffs allege that they were hired by O &amp; G as laborers prior to March 2015 to perform work such as painting, sheet-rocking, and finishing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Initially, this lawsuit was brought by Plaintiff Osman Maldonado against New Orleans Millworks (\"Millworks\") and its owner Scott Taranto. (Rec. Doc. 1.) By two subsequent amendments to his complaint, Plaintiff Maldonado added O &amp; G and Olan David Del Arca Sabat and replaced Millworks and Scott Taranto with NOMW and David Waldheim as Defendants. (Rec. Docs. 4, 9.) On June 8, 2017, the Court granted in part and denied in part NOMW's\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , holding that Plaintiff Maldonado had adequately alleged an individual FLSA overtime claim\n   but had not sufficiently pleaded a FLSA collective action. (Rec. Doc. 32 at 7, 9.) The Court granted Plaintiff an additional twenty-one (21) days to file an amended complaint alleging a FLSA collective action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. On June 16, 2017, a third amended collective action complaint was filed by Osman Maldonado, Josue Nunez, Mauricio Hernandez, and Marvel Guerrero (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. (Rec. Doc 35.) On August 22, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the instant\n   <em>\n    Motion for Conditional Class Certification, Judicial Notice, and for Disclosure of the Names and Addresses of Potential Opt-In Plaintiffs\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    (Rec. Doc. 39.)\n   </strong>\n   Defendants opposed the motion (Rec. Docs. 41, 42), and Plaintiffs filed a reply (Rec. Doc. 53). The motion is now before the Court on the briefs and without oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PARTIES' ARGUMENTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to maintain their FLSA claim as a collective action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). As such, Plaintiffs move the Court to conditionally certify a collective action of employees limited to the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   All individuals who worked or are working performing manual labor for O &amp; G Construction, LLC, during the previous three years, and who are eligible for overtime pay pursuant to the FLSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and who did not receive full overtime compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Rec. Doc. 39-1 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the allegations in their complaint as well as their attached sworn declarations and timesheets demonstrate clear violations of the FLSA that are not personal to Plaintiffs, but rather are part of Defendants' general policy not to pay their employees overtime. O &amp; G foremen allegedly supervised Plaintiffs and would send the employees' timesheets to a NOMW supervisor. Plaintiffs allege that they and their co-workers were paid by check bearing the name O &amp; G Construction, LLC, and would be paid an hourly rate regardless of the number of hours that they worked per week and that they often worked in excess of 40 hours per week. Plaintiffs argue that this information establishes that there is likely a group of similarly situated individuals entitled to receive notice of this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    at 13-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate the existence of a class of similarly situated individuals. First, O &amp; G opposes conditional class certification, arguing that Plaintiffs have failed to establish that they were the victims of a single decision, policy, or plan. Defendants also assert that the Plaintiffs' proposed class definition violates Federal Rule Civil Procedure 20(a)(2) regarding the joinder of defendants. Because NOMW and O &amp; G are both named Defendants in the litigation, Defendants argue that the potential class must be comprised of employees who have worked for both NOMW and O &amp; G, rather than limiting the class to current and former employees of O &amp; G exclusively. (Rec. Doc. 41 at 2.) NOMW also filed an opposition to the motion, adopting and incorporating by reference O &amp; G's arguments and further contending that conditional class certification is improper because Plaintiffs have not established their status as employees. (Rec. Doc. 42 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The FLSA \"establishes the general rule that employees must receive overtime compensation at one and one-half times the regular rate for hours worked in excess of 40 hours during a seven-day workweek.\"\n   <em>\n    McGavock v.

However, the Fifth Circuit has recognized that courts have followed two methods of determining whether the putative class members are \"similarly situated\" and whether notice should be given: the two-stage class certification approach typified by\n   <em>\n    Lusardi v. Xerox Corp.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the \"spurious\" class action approach espoused by\n   <em>\n    Shushan v.

However, this Court traditionally follows the\n   <em>\n    Lusardi\n   </em>\n   two-step analysis to determine whether plaintiffs are similarly situated and will do so here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Banegas v. Calmar Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 15-593,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204730734\">\n    2015 WL 4730734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D.

Dec. 30, 2011) (noting that the\n   <em>\n    Lusardi\n   </em>\n   approach is \"the more common approach and routinely used by courts in this District\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Lusardi\n   </em>\n   approach is comprised of two stages. First, during the \"notice stage,\" the Court determines whether to grant \"conditional certification\" and issue notice to potential members of the putative collective class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chapman v.

La. 2015). In other words, the Court conducts an initial inquiry into \"whether the putative class members' claims are sufficiently similar to merit sending notice of the action to possible members of the class.\"\n   <em>\n    Acevedo v. Allsup's Convenience Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224213\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/516/#p519\">\n    600 F.3d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519 (5th Cir. 2010).

At the notice stage, the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate that \"(1) there is a reasonable basis for crediting the assertion that aggrieved individuals exist; (2) those aggrieved individuals are similarly situated to the plaintiff in relevant respects given the claims and defenses asserted; and (3) those individuals want to opt in to the lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6823526\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/126/711/#p720\">\n    126 F.Supp.3d at 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because of the limited evidence available at this stage, \"this determination\n   is made using a fairly lenient standard, and typically results in 'conditional certification' of a representative class.\"\n   <em>\n    Mooney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413039\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/54/1207/\">\n    54 F.3d at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).
