INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Darlene Murdoch (\"Ms. Murdoch\") initiated this employment case against her former employer Medjet Assistance, LLC (\"Medjet\") and its Chief Executive Officer, Roy Berger (\"Mr. Berger\") on April 21, 2017. (Doc. 1). Ms. Murdoch generally maintains that Mr. Berger sexually harassed her for a period of 6 to 7 months and that Medjet fired her in retaliation for reporting his harassment to Medjet (in a letter from her lawyer) and subsequently filing an EEOC charge about that same alleged conduct. Ms. Murdoch's complaint contains both federal and state law claims: (1) Title VII sexual harassment against Medjet (Count One); (2) Title VII retaliation against Medjet (Count Two); (3) negligent and/or wanton hiring, retention, training, and supervision against Medjet (Count Three); (4) invasion of privacy against both Mr. Berger and Medjet (Count Four); (5) assault and battery against both Mr. Berger and Medjet (Count Five); and (6) tort of outrage against both Mr. Berger and Medjet (Count Six).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the Court is Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (doc. 19) (the \"Motion\") filed on March 10, 2017. The Court has reviewed the parties' filings offered in support of and opposition to the Motion. (Docs. 20, 21, 25-28).

Ms. Murdoch's Employment with Medjet\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Murdoch was employed by Medjet as its Assistant Controller from August 2014 until August 28, 2015. AF No. 1.4. When Ms. Murdoch began her employment with Medjet, she reported to Michelle Lowery (\"Ms. Lowery\"), who was employed as the Controller. AF No. 2.1. As the Assistant Controller, Ms. Murdoch was responsible for accounts payable, accounts receivable, preparation of the daily sales report (\"DSR\"), reconciliation of the DSR on a monthly basis and other duties as needed to assist the Controller. AF No. 2.2. The preparation and reconciliation of the DSR was one of Ms. Murdoch's primary responsibilities. AF No. 2.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ms. Lowery separated from employment with Medjet in mid-December of 2014, leaving Medjet without a Controller for approximately a month. AF No. 3.1. During that month, Ms. Murdoch took on additional responsibilities and reported directly to and worked more closely with Mr. Berger. AF No. 3.2. Ms. Murdoch performed her duties satisfactorily during that time period, and Mr. Berger decided to give her a pay increase to begin 2015 based upon her willingness to step in as needed after Ms. Lowery's unexpected departure. AF No. 3.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 12, 2015, Mona Roy (hereinafter \"Ms. Roy\") became employed as the Controller for Medjet. AF No. 4.1. Ms. Roy had previously been employed by Medjet and, on January 12, 2015 (doc. 21-1 at 4 at 12),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   was brought back to help restore order to the company's accounting functions, which had suffered due to Ms. Lowery's performance and departure. AF No. 4.2. When Ms. Roy was rehired, it was expected that she would serve as the Controller for a couple of years to supervise Ms. Murdoch and eventually train Ms. Murdoch to take over her duties.

Despite being aware of the variances, Ms. Murdoch failed to notify Ms. Roy or take any other action to remedy the problem.

The Court is unconvinced by Medjet's\n   <em>\n    Gupta\n   </em>\n   -based position that complimenting someone about her looks or making similar comments about a person's appearance can never meet\n   <em>\n    Mendoza'\n   </em>\n   s second prong of \"unwelcome sexual harassment, such as sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other conduct of a sexual nature.\" (Doc. 20 at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Importantly,\n   <em>\n    Gupta\n   </em>\n   does not hold that compliments about a person's attractiveness or beauty are never objectively sexual under the second prong.

Further, although the Eleventh Circuit expressed doubt over whether the remaining evidence before it was sufficiently sexual, the court never directly decided that issue, and opted \"for present purposes [to] assume it to be.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747480\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/571/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf. also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747480\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/571/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    It is debatable whether such a compliment is sexual in nature, but assuming that it is\n   </em>\n   , we do not believe that a reasonable person would deem it to be offensive.\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Gupta\n   </em>\n   court then proceeded to analyze the plaintiff's sexually-related, or at least arguably-sexually-related, allegations (including the compliment) to determine if they met\n   <em>\n    Mendoza's\n   </em>\n   severe or pervasive prong-the fourth prong. With respect to the compliment more particularly, the Eleventh Circuit \"d[id] not believe that a reasonable person would deem it to be offensive.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747480\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/571/\">\n    212 F.3d at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Gupta\n   </em>\n   does not substantiate Medjet's challenge to Ms. Murdoch's sexual harassment allegations under the sexual component of\n   <em>\n    Mendoza's\n   </em>\n   second prong. Further, Medjet offers no other authorities to support its contention that the conduct was non-sexual and, therefore, not cognizable under Title VII. Accordingly, that part of Defendants' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Medjet's second contention also applies to\n   <em>\n    Mendoza's\n   </em>\n   second prong. More specifically, Medjet maintains that, with respect to most of her allegations, Ms. Murdoch cannot show unwelcomeness. As the Supreme Court has explained the meaning of this term:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   The gravamen of any sexual harassment claim is that the alleged sexual advances were \"unwelcome.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201604.11\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1985). While the question whether particular conduct was indeed unwelcome presents difficult problems\n   of proof and\n   <em>\n    turns largely on credibility determinations committed to the trier of fact\n   </em>\n   , the District Court in this case erroneously focused on the \"voluntariness\" of respondent's participation in the claimed sexual episodes.\n   <em>\n    The correct inquiry is whether respondent by her conduct indicated that the alleged sexual advances were unwelcome\n   </em>\n   , not whether her actual participation in sexual intercourse was voluntary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v.

The Eleventh Circuit has similarly stated that \"[i]n order to constitute harassment, this conduct must be unwelcome in the sense that\n   <em>\n    the employee did not solicit or incite it\n   </em>\n   , and in the sense that the employee regarded the conduct as undesirable or offensive.\"\n   <em>\n    Henson v. City of Dundee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"539065\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/682/897/#p903\">\n    682 F.2d 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 903 (11th Cir. 1982) (emphasis added) (citing collection of authorities). Thus, the presence of unwelcomeness is contingent upon Ms. Murdoch's interactions with Mr. Berger and not the comparable experiences that other Medjet employees claim to have had with him. (\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Doc. 25 at 13 (suggesting that Mr. Berger's treatment of Ms. Murdoch was \"objectively offensive\" in light of testimony from other Medjet employees \"who had been subjected to [and were offended by] the same or similar conduct from [Mr. Berger]\") ). Additionally, Ms. Murdoch does not maintain that she had any knowledge of these other situations during the period in which she is claiming harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Austal, U.S.A., L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055976\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/1240/#p1250\">\n    754 F.3d 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1250 (11th Cir. 2014) (\"The totality of a plaintiff's workplace circumstances\n   <em>\n    does not include other employees' experiences of which the plaintiff is unaware\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In response to the issue of unwelcomeness, Ms. Murdoch states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   Defendants argue that [Mr.] Berger's conduct toward [Ms. Murdoch] was welcomed because [she]...did not verbally object to the conduct and comments made by the President and CEO of the corporation during the first few months of her employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   [Ms. Murdoch] did, however, testify that on those occasions when [Mr.] Berger hugged her, she did not hug him back. Further, she testified that she indicated to [Mr.] Berger that she was uncomfortable with the prying questions he was asking about her personal life. [Mr.] Berger testified that, while [Ms. Murdoch] was out following surgery, [she] deflected [Mr.] Berger's offer to come visit her at her house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   (Doc. 25 at 13-14 (citations omitted) ). Thus, Ms. Murdoch concedes that, with the exceptions of Mr. Berger's full-body hugs, his prying questions, and an offer to come visit her at her house post-surgery, she lacks conduct-on her part-indicating that Mr. Berger's alleged harassing comments and actions involving her were unwelcomed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Further, the totality of the record confirms why Ms. Murdoch's limited opposition to the unwelcomeness factor of\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   's second prong makes sense. More specifically, for the approximate 6 to 7-month period in which she claims that Mr. Berger sexually harassed her, Ms. Murdoch undisputedly engaged in her own pattern of inciting and/or engaging in flirtatious conduct toward him. Such examples include referring to Mr. Berger as \"Dear\"; adding smiley faces to several messages that she sent to him; grabbing his hand in the car and telling him words to the effect of, \"I just want to thank you for being so nice to me and caring about me\"; complimenting him on his nice tan and his kindness and generosity as a boss; lamenting that things in the office are \"just so-so\" when he is not there; and informing him (via text) after one of their lunches that\n   she would \"pretend\" lunch was his idea rather than Ms. Roy's and joking with him that \"I have an imagination and that's all I'm saying!\" These undisputed facts reflect a mutual welcomeness between Ms. Murdoch and Mr. Berger (for most of the challenged conduct) rather than actionable unilateral unwelcoming behavior by Mr. Berger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Given this record, no reasonable jury could conclude that Ms. Murdoch found Mr. Berger's conduct from the start of her employment until March 2015 (other than arguably those categories specifically excepted by her above) to be undesirable or offensive in the Title VII sense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the lack of unwelcomeness portion of Medjet's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Now the Court turns to Medjet's third challenge to Ms. Murdoch's Title VII sexual harassment claim-the absence of severe or pervasive conduct. More specifically, Medjet maintains that even if \"some of Mr. Berger's actions were unwelcome and based on sex,\" such conduct falls short of being severe or pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of Ms. Murdoch's employment. (Doc. 20 at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In light of the ruling immediately above, there are three categories of conduct remaining that Ms. Murdoch relies upon to satisfy the fourth\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   prong: Mr. Berger's 7 to 10 unwanted full-body hugs, his prying questions, and his offer to come visit her at her house post-surgery. With respect to evaluating the fourth element of a hostile work environment claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   [T]he Supreme Court and [the Eleventh Circuit] have identified the following four factors that should be considered in determining whether harassment objectively altered an employee's terms or conditions of employment: (1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee's job performance.\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

As an initial matter, the Court points out that Ms. Murdoch has made no attempt to analyze her sexual harassment allegations in the context of the foregoing framework. Regardless, for purposes of the fourth-prong analysis, the Court assumes without deciding that Ms. Murdoch can satisfy the subjective component and proceeds with determining whether a \"reasonable person would perceive the environment to be hostile and abusive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1738102\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/195/1238/#p1245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The Court first turns to the 7 to 10 unwanted hugs from Mr. Berger that Ms. Murdoch endured over the span of 6 to 7 months. While Ms. Murdoch describes these encounters as full-body hugs, she does not contend that Mr. Berger's hugs ever went beyond that into rubbing, groping, or some other more sexually-aggressive touching. She also does not assert that Mr. Berger said anything of a sexual nature when he hugged her. Thus, there is no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that these (at most) twice-monthly hugs were objectively severe, physically-threatening, or humiliating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Ms. Murdoch also has not offered any evidence to show how these infrequent hugs caused her to miss work or otherwise interfered with her job performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meritor\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 65,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203537\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/57/#p68\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he Guidelines provide that such sexual misconduct constitutes prohibited 'sexual harassment,'..., where 'such conduct has\n   <em>\n    the purpose or effect\n   </em>\n   of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment' \" (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201604.11\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ) );\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v.

Thus, Mr. Berger's undesired hugs do not objectively meet the severe or pervasive prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   As for Mr. Berger's prying questions about her personal matters including her dating life and marriages, Ms. Murdoch maintains that these occurred over lunch and that she informed Mr. Berger that such questions made her feel uncomfortable. Unlike the unwanted hugs, the summary judgment record does not reflect how many dating or marriage-related questions Mr. Berger asked Ms. Murdoch. However, because these inquiries took place at lunch and there were no more than 3 such lunches, then at most Mr. Berger asked Ms. Murdoch a series of personal questions that made her uncomfortable over 3 lunches during the 6 to 7 months of his alleged harassing behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   To the extent that Mr. Berger's questions were frequent, the other factors are objectively lacking. A boss's questions to a subordinate about who she is dating and how many times she has been married may be perceived as rude or uncivilized by some. However, they do not-without\n   more-objectively translate into severe or pervasive conduct or create a hostile work environment. Importantly, the record lacks any indication that Mr. Berger probed Ms. Murdoch about more provocative areas of her personal life. For example, Mr. Berger never asked her how often she had sex or whether she had ever considered having an affair when she was married. He also never asked her to go on a date with him or to have sex. Ms. Murdoch additionally does not claim that Mr. Berger ever touched her inappropriately during these lunches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Further, Ms. Murdoch has not shown how these questions taking place at lunch\n   <em>\n    between just the two of them\n   </em>\n   were physically-threatening, humiliating, or interfering with her ability to do her job.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453017\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/277/1269/#p1277\">\n    277 F.3d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1277 (11th Cir. 2002) (\"The very nature of the coworkers' utterances, coupled with the fact that they were directed at Miller and were sometimes used in the course of reprimanding him\n   <em>\n    in front of others\n   </em>\n   , establishes this factor [of humiliating conduct].\") (emphasis added). Thus, Ms. Murdoch lacks sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the personal questions from Mr. Berger were objectively severe or pervasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Finally, Ms. Murdoch relies upon her successful \"resistance\" to Mr. Berger's offer to come visit her at home post-surgery to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Mendoza's\n   </em>\n   fourth prong. Importantly, Ms. Murdoch does not contend that Mr. Berger's offer to see her was coupled with any \"sexually explicit remarks or innuendos.\"\n   <em>\n    Gupta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747480\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/571/\">\n    212 F.3d at 584-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ms. Murdoch also does not allege that Mr. Berger expressed a willingness to come to her home on other occasions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gupta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747480\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/571/\">\n    212 F.3d at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Neither the content of Rhodd's remarks nor the number of the phone calls suggests obsessive or stalker-like behavior by Rhodd.\"). Especially in the absence of Mr. Berger's actually coming to her house, no reasonable juror could conclude that such an unfulfilled offer objectively meets any of the severe or pervasive factors. Instead, Mr. Berger's post-surgery offer was an isolated incident that did not ever materialize, much less result in any serious physical or emotional consequences for Ms. Murdoch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183137\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/742/#p765\">\n    524 U.S. at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183186\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/775/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (pointing out that \"isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the 'terms and conditions of employment' \"). Also, the situation had no conceivable impact on Ms. Murdoch's job performance as she was on medical leave when it occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Thus, no category of claimed unwanted conduct meets\n   <em>\n    Mendoza's\n   </em>\n   fourth prong. Further, considering the totality of circumstances, no reasonable person would perceive Ms. Murdoch's environment to be hostile or abusive in a Title VII cognizable manner.

Medjet points to the protected activity of the letter sent by Ms. Murdoch's attorney on June 25, 2015, and argues that \"Medjet and [Mr.] Berger had long since been aware of [Ms.] Murdoch's protected activity before the charge was filed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11168939\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/1248/#p1253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As Medjet maintains, if Defendants \"were motivated by retaliation, then they wouldn't have waited two months after gaining knowledge of [Ms.] Murdoch's protected activity to terminate her employment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25).

Without more development, the Court is not inclined to conclude that Mr. Berger's undisputed notice of two Title VII protected acts both occurring less than 2 months before (and the second one occurring within 1 week of) Ms. Murdoch's discharge are inadequate to show temporal proximity. The Court is particularly dubious about Mejet's position here where the alleged harasser and the ultimate decisionmaker are the same person (which means that Ms. Murdoch is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   relying\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   upon temporal proximity to demonstrate causation for her retaliation claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   While Medjet purports to offer authority in support of its second point, it misstates the scope of\n   <em>\n    Thomas's\n   </em>\n   holding-\n   <em>\n    it is a 3-month gap case\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a 2-month one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3167839\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/1361/\">\n    506 F.3d at 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Thomas failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could find any causal connection between her April 2005 complaint(s) of sexual harassment and the termination of her employment\n   <em>\n    three (3) months later\n   </em>\n   in July 2005.\") (emphasis added). Consequently,\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   does not mean Ms. Murdoch's pre-EEOC letter to Medjet is too old to be causally related to her discharge as a matter of law. Therefore, the Court is unconvinced by Medjet's\n   two-part causal-connection challenge and, to the contrary, finds that Ms. Murdoch has provided sufficient evidence to show a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of Title VII retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Medjet-through Mr. Berger-has articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for discharging Ms. Murdoch-her August client-crediting error and that mistake's consistency with Ms. Murdoch's prior performance problems as reported to him by Ms. Roy.
