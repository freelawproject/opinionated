By report and recommendation dated February 20, 2018, Judge Reyes recommended that the Court grant Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (\"R&amp;R\"). (R&amp;R, Docket Entry No. 33.) On March 5, 2018, Rath filed a timely objection to the R&amp;R. (Def. Rath Obj. to R&amp;R (\"Rath Obj.\"), Docket Entry No. 34.)

Defendant ITG is a New York corporation doing business in New York. (Compl. \u00b6 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the period spanning August 18, 2010 through February 18, 2011, U.S. Underwriters issued ITG an insurance policy numbered CP 3552516 (the \"Policy\"), covering 2107 5th Avenue New York, New York 10035 (the \"Premises\"). (Pl. Statement of Material Facts Pursuant to Local R. 56.1 (\"Pl. 56.1\") \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17, Docket Entry No. 30-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 7, 2010, Rath, while working as an independent contractor for Bellmarc Realty LLC (\"Bellmarc\"), fell and sustained injuries at the Premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3; Def. Rath Resp. to Pl. 56.1 (\"Rath 56.1\") \u00b6 34, Docket Entry No. 32-4.) Subsequently, on September 30, 2011, Rath filed the Rath Action against ITG, alleging that ITG's \"negligence in ownership, operation, maintenance, repair and control of the premises\" caused his injuries. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rath served ITG with the summons and complaint of the Rath Action by personal delivery at the Office of the Secretary of the State of New York on November 4, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) On January 28, 2013, the Honorable Peter Sweeney issued an order granting Rath's motion for default judgment against ITG in the Rath Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Consequently, on August 23, 2013, the Kings County clerk of court had entered judgment against ITG in the Rath Action in the amount of $2,674,800.90. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) ITG notified U.S. Underwriters of Rath's injury and the Rath Action on March 11, 2014, over six months after the Kings County clerk of court had entered a default judgment against ITG. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) As a condition precedent to coverage, the Policy required ITG to notify U.S. Underwriters \"as soon as practicable\" of any \" 'occurrence' or an offense which may result in a claim\" and any \"claim\" or \" 'suit' ... brought against [the] insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The R&amp;R\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Judge Reyes recommended that the Court grant Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment because ITG's delay in providing Plaintiff notice of Rath's injury violated the terms of the Policy and prejudiced Plaintiff. (R&amp;R 4-8.) He found the service on ITG through the Secretary of State to be sufficient notice, requiring ITG to have timely notified Plaintiff about the Rath Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6.) In addition, Judge Reyes found the delayed notice to be prejudicial because of the length of the delay, and the resulting inability \"to acquire any documentation related to the incident, or to speak with potential witnesses contemporaneous with the incident.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) In granting summary judgement to Plaintiff on the basis of delay in notification and resulting prejudice, Judge Reyes also considered but dismissed Plaintiff's additional\n   arguments based on the following four limitations of coverage in the Policy: (1) Vacancy of the Premises; (2) Construction Operations Exclusion; (3) Independent Contractor Exclusion; and (4) Bodily Injury Exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addressing the \"Vacancy of the Premises\" and \"Construction Operations Exclusion\" limitations, Judge Reyes found there remained a material dispute of fact as to whether \"there was construction, remodeling or renovation at the time Rath was injured,\" precluding summary judgment on those bases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 11.) As to the \"Independent Contractor Exclusion\" and \"Bodily Injury Exclusion\" limitations, Judge Reyes found a material dispute of fact as to whether Bellmarc and ITG formed a contractor/subcontractor relationship, precluding summary judgment on those bases.
