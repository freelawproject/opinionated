As a result of the housing crisis, Fannie Mae obtained title to a \"significant number of REO dwellings covered by the Fair Housing Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Once an REO property, Fannie Mae \"assumes all duties and responsibilities of ownership, including ordinary maintenance, while it markets the dwelling for sale to the general public.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Fannie Mae's stated strategy is to \"maintain each property in [its] inventory at a level of market-readiness both inside and outside of the property, supporting neighborhood stabilization.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The stated mission of the maintenance team is \"to ensure the quality of our REO property maintenance services, consistently producing best-in-class, market-ready properties and maintaining them until removal from our inventory.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Fannie Mae is required, under the Fair Housing Act, to maintain all REO properties, regardless of their location, \"without regard to race, color, ... or national origin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Between July 2011 and October 2015, Plaintiffs allege that they \"conducted a comprehensive investigation of [Fannie Mae]'s real estate related activities in communities of color, including predominantly African-American and Latino neighborhoods, and predominantly white neighborhoods in 38 metropolitan areas throughout the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Plaintiffs allege that over the course of four years, they investigated over 2,300 properties owned and maintained by Fannie\n   Mae, and accumulated over 49,000 photographs. (\n   <em>\n    Id. \u00b6\n   </em>\n   7.) Plaintiffs allege that their investigation revealed that \"Fannie Mae has failed to conduct routine exterior maintenance and marketing of REO properties in communities of color, thereby leaving those REOs in a state of neglect, while satisfactorily conducting routine exterior maintenance and marketing of its REO properties in predominantly white neighborhoods, therefore leaving those REOs in a materially better condition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although Plaintiffs alerted Fannie Mae regarding the findings of their investigation in order to secure voluntary compliance with the Fair Housing Act, Plaintiffs allege that Fannie Mae \"did not change its behavior. With deliberate indifference to the purpose and effects of its discriminatory policies and practices, Fannie Mae continued to maintain its REO properties differently based on the predominant race and national origin of neighborhoods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) As a result of these practices, Plaintiffs allege that \"Fannie Mae stigmatizes communities of color as less desirable than predominantly white neighborhoods. The prospects for integration in the affected neighborhoods are reduced because white buyers are deterred from purchasing homes in neighborhoods with poorly maintained REO properties, leaving the existing segregated racial composition of these neighborhoods unchanged.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs, a collection of twenty-one fair housing community organizations, allege that they have expended considerable resources and time away from their other projects and programs and have forgone other opportunities in an effort to address the effects of Fannie Mae's conduct. Plaintiffs set out in detail the frustration of their mission and purpose in the diversion of resources to address Fannie Mae's alleged conduct and remediation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 142-150, 152-247.) In addition, Plaintiffs further allege that the \"discriminatory conduct extends beyond Plaintiffs, also harming the communities Plaintiffs serve. Defendant's failure to maintain REO properties in communities of color has created deteriorating eye sores and depressed property values in communities of color, undermining neighborhood stabilization, and curtailing economic recovery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 248.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs filed suit to allege violation of the Fair Housing Act which makes it unlawful to discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race or national origin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 261, citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).) Plaintiffs allege that Fannie Mae's conduct discriminates in the marketing and sale of dwellings to persons because of race or national origin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that Fannie Mae has \"designed a national practice and policy of having its lower-level agents and employees determine whether to conduct an REO exterior maintenance task and how to conduct it. Fannie Mae's practice thus gave these agents and employees the ability to exercise high levels of discretion with minimal input from Fannie Mae. [This] practice and policy ... ha[s] caused a disproportionately adverse impact on communities of color.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.) This unguided delegation of discretion without independent quality checks \"resulted in REO properties in communities of color receiving less exterior maintenance than REO properties in predominantly white neighborhoods. The observed disparities persist even after a regression analysis for non-racial factors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The complaint is replete with allegations that the maintenance decisions were delegated to low-level employees and agents to decide when and how maintenance tasks would be undertaken. Plaintiffs allege that\n   Fannie Mae did not specify when exterior REO maintenance should be performed, where in contrast, \"Fannie Mae provided detailed instructions to its agents with regard to other REO services, including directing them to perform tasks on a monthly basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129.) The complaint details Fannie Mae's practices which allowed for little or any knowledge of whether properties actually required exterior maintenance and their failure to perform independent quality control on the majority of the properties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130.) Plaintiffs also detail how, after a report by the Office of the Inspector General of the Fair Housing Finance Agency criticized Fannie Mae's quality control protocol, \"noting that there was 'significant risk' that it would be insufficient to assess the quality of REO maintenance activities over a sustained period of time,\" Fannie Mae still did not alter its practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that the data from their investigation establishes that \"the exterior maintenance of REO properties under Fannie Mae's maintenance practices and policies varied based on the age and/or the value of the properties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132.) Plaintiffs allege that \"Fannie Mae's maintenance policies and practices are the direct and proximate cause of the statistical disparities in the maintenance of properties in the neighborhoods with different racial and ethnic compositions as alleged [in the complaint] and revealed by Plaintiffs' investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After a temporary stay of the case, Fannie Mae moved to dismiss all claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim and pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for failure of Plaintiffs to establish standing. The Court shall address other specific facts as necessary in the remainder of its order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Fannie Mae argues that the mere delegation of authority over decisions regarding maintenance is insufficient as a policy to withstand dismissal. However, the Court finds this argument unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McReynolds v.

At this procedural posture, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts to support their theory that the policy of delegation of discretion or failure to supervise and differential maintenance based on the properties' age and value as the robust cause of discriminatory impact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fair Housing Alliance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266307\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/20/#p28\">\n    261 F.Supp.3d at 28-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, Fannie Mae contends that, regardless of the policy stated, Plaintiffs have failed to pled sufficient facts tending to show causation. The Court finds, however, that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged statistical evidence demonstrating a causal connection between the delegation of duties and the differential maintenance. Ultimately, \"the question of causation-to what extent the discrepancy is explainable by objective data or race-is premature. It seems clear that Plaintiff's complaint gives rise to a fair inference of causation; the question of proof will become an issue at later stages in the proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Considering the breadth and extensive coverage of the investigation, Fannie's Mae's contentions regarding whether the Plaintiffs' methodology is flawed are best reserved for resolution at summary judgment. The Court finds the specific contentions about alleged deficiencies in methodology go to the weight of the evidence and are not dispositive of the determination whether Plaintiffs have adequately pled discrimination at this procedural stage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maduka v.

Plaintiffs allege a continuing violation of the Fair Housing Act on the basis of a policy and practice that extends beyond the statute of limitations period, although it clearly includes conduct during the actionable time period. There is \"no legal bar to the use of pre-liability period evidence in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250981\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/285/492/#p531\">\n    285 F.R.D. at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). \"[P]re-statute of\n   limitations data is generally both relevant and frequently used in such matters as evidence of the alleged discriminatory practice, even when a plaintiff may not directly recover as to events occurring outside the applicable time period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250981\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/285/492/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Chin v.
