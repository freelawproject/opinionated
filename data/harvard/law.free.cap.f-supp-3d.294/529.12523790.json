In December 2007, GAI contracted with the City to provide financial advisory services relating primarily to the restructuring of the City's multiple interest rate swaps and adjustable rate bonds, which had potential losses to the City's general fund of over $100 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.

Title 28, United States Code, Section 1658(a) states, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, a civil action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this section may not be commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action accrues.\" This four-year \"catchall\" statute of limitations applies to actions arising under federal statutes enacted after December 1, 1990, the date of the enactment of that law.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

In the present action, like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , GAI argues that its\n   Section 1981 cause of action should have a four-year statute of limitations pursuant to this standard. However, unlike\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , this case involves post-formation conduct rather than pre-formation conduct. In\n   <em>\n    Patterson v. McLean Credit Union\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that Section 1981 did not protect post-formation conduct, which prompted Congress to amend Section 1981.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211653\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/164/#p177\">\n    491 U.S. 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211653\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/164/#p177\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2363,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211653\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/164/#p177\">\n    105 L.Ed.2d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). Accordingly, GAI's claim under Section 1981 would only have been actionable after the enactment of the 1990 federal four-year \"catchall\" statute of limitations.

Second, the court must determine whether the constitutional right at issue was \"clearly established\" at the time of the defendant's alleged misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 232, 129 S.Ct. at 816. GAI is alleging a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

GAI's Complaint details the relationships of the parties involved and the actions that transpired as a result of such relationships; nonetheless, GAI has only offered conclusory allegations as to how the City Council Defendants and City Attorney Defendants violated its Fourteenth Amendment right. Furthermore, even if the Court were to find that the City Attorney Defendants violated a clearly established constitutional right, the Court finds that the action taken by the City Attorney Defendants in altering a prior legal opinion to be objectively reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Therefore, as alluded to\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the City Council Defendants and City Attorney Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity based on their actions.

Lastly, the contract expressly provides that the City can terminate the contract at any time without cause. Therefore, the City had the right to terminate the contract with GAI at any time as long as the City provided GAI with written notice, which occurred once the City initiated the state court lawsuit. Consequently, GAI has failed to state a claim for breach of contract because they have failed to plead facts that establish a breach on the part of the Defendants.

As alluded to\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , GAI is seeking both a declaration by this Court that the Defendants actions in initiating the state court suit was improper and an injunction of that suit. However, the state court suit and this present action are factually similar in that that state court suit concerns the recoupment of an alleged overpayment and part of this suit concerns why that recoupment is misguided. Accordingly, the Court finds in the interest of justice that the state court suit proceed and GAI's claim for declaratory and injunctive relief as it concerns the state court suit be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As to the third claim, requesting a declaration by this Court that ordinances 47, 48, 49, 50, and 52 of 2013 violate U.S. Const. Amend XIV and La. Const. art. I, \u00a7 3 because the ordinances infringe on the fundamental right of African American financial advisors to receive equal treatment and hiring by the City, the Court finds the relief sought by GAI to be improper. Furthermore, GAI requests the Court to declare the ordinances to be invalid and provide injunctive relief to GAI. Upon examination of the ordinances, which are public record and referenced throughout GAI's Complaint, the ordinances strictly restricted the Mayor's authority during the 2013 budget year to obtain and pay for financial advisory services for the City without regard to race. The Complaint fails to meet the plausibility standard in that GAI has failed to offer factual support that shows racial animus motivated the Defendants' decisions in passing the ordinances. Moreover, the Court ruling on the legality of the ordinances may potentially impact the state court proceeding. Accordingly, GAI's request that this Court declare the ordinances invalid is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss (Record Document 55) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . All claims brought against the Defendants are hereby\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A judgment consistent with the terms of the instant Memorandum Ruling shall issue herewith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    THUS DONE AND SIGNED\n   </strong>\n   , in Shreveport, Louisiana, on this the 14th day of February, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Court has dismissed the federal law claims lodged against the City Council Defendants on the basis of absolute legislative immunity. However, in the alternative, the Court finds the City Council Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
