(Docket No. 1). For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   this case with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 41(b) and 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 15, 2017, Plaintiff arrived at the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Marin International Airport, to pick up a friend. (Docket No. 14 \u00b6 2). Upon her friend's arrival, Plaintiff exited the building, carrying her friend's luggage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff then proceeded through an area outside the building that was not lit adequately.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Due to the insufficient lighting and Plaintiff's inability to see, the wheels of the luggage became stuck, causing Plaintiff to fall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In pain, Plaintiff was transported by ambulance to Carolina's Medical Hospital where she was diagnosed with a fracture to the femur and underwent an emergency surgery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Aided by a wheelchair, Plaintiff eventually traveled back to her home in Sacramento, California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Plaintiff's orthopedic doctor, Dr. Fernando Torres Zayas, believed Plaintiff had a 60% chance of not being able to walk again.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In April 2017, Plaintiff underwent a second operation to ease her pain and enable her to make a full recovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. As of June 26, 2017, Plaintiff could stand, but was still unable to walk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A full recovery is expected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff seeks $20,000 reimbursement for her medical expenses, as well as $300,000 in compensation for emotional damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff filed her initial complaint on March 21, 2017 (Docket No. 1). Aerostar filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and a motion for a more definite statement. (Docket No. 11). Before the Court ruled on Aerostar's motion, Plaintiff inexplicably responded with a motion for reconsideration of dismissal. (Docket No. 12). The Court denied both motions while noting that the \"complaint is not properly presented and fatally deficient under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a).\" (Docket No. 13). The Court instructed Plaintiff to file an amended complaint and on June 27, 2017, Plaintiff did so. (Docket Nos. 13; 14). Aerostar thereafter filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. (Docket No. 16). Plaintiff did not respond, and Aerostar moved to deem its motion unopposed. (Docket No. 17). The Court denied Aerostar's motion without prejudice and ordered Plaintiff to file a response by August 10, 2017. (Docket No. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff again failed to respond and on August 16, 2017, Aerostar filed a second motion to deem its motion to dismiss unopposed. (Docket No. 20). The Court denied Aerostar's motion without prejudice, and ordered Plaintiff to respond by August 22, 2017, noting that Plaintiff's failure to do so would result in the case being submitted. (Docket No. 21). Plaintiff again failed to respond, and on August 22, 2017, Aerostar filed a third motion to deem its motion to dismiss unopposed. (Docket No. 22). Plaintiff did not respond. On January 9, 2018, Aerostar moved to dismiss for lack of prosecution pursuant to Federal Rule of Procedure\n   41(b). (Docket No. 23). The Court ordered Plaintiff to respond to the pending motions on or before the final deadline of January 16, 2018. (Docket No. 24). Yet again, Plaintiff ignored the Court's order. On January 19, 2018, Aerostar filed a motion renewing its motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution. (Docket No. 25). The Court denied Aerostar's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on January 25, 2018, noting that Plaintiff's complaint was still fatally deficient and ordering her to file an amended complaint by February 5, 2018. (Docket No. 26). In the Court's order, Plaintiff was explicitly warned that failure to comply would result in sanctions, including dismissal for failure to prosecute under Rule 41(b).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Severity of the Violation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff's violations were severe. The last time she filed anything was June 27, 2017. (Docket No. 14). As of today, 225 days have passed without any action from Plaintiff. While this is not multiple years, it is not the only factor the Court considers. Plaintiff has also ignored four Court orders concerning her response to various motions that Aerostar filed, including a motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution. (Docket Nos. 18; 21; 24; 26). The Court finds this \"extremely protracted inaction\" violates Rule 41(b) and a district court's inherent power to regulate its docket.\n   <em>\n    Cosme Nieves v.

The Court warned Plaintiff on multiple occasions to respond to Defendant's motions and Plaintiff has not complied. Plaintiff's continuous disregard for this case and failure to comply with the Court's orders constitute severe indifference\n   to the Court's authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Solis-Rivera v.

Adequacy of Lesser Sanctions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Lesser sanctions would not be adequate. While true that the Court could sanction counsel in several ways, including a warning, formal reprimand, a fine, imposition of costs or fees, temporary suspension, and dismissal, Plaintiff has already been warned multiple times. Following the second motion to deem Aerostar's motion to dismiss unopposed, Plaintiff was explicitly informed that failure to respond would result in the case being submitted. (Docket No. 21). In the Court's fourth order to respond, Plaintiff was explicitly warned that failure to respond would result sanctions, including dismissal for failure to prosecute. (Docket No. 26). These warnings did not elicit a response from Plaintiff. There is nothing to indicate that fining counsel or imposing costs and fees would prove a more effective catalyst.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Rule 12(b)(6) Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) provides that a defendant may move to dismiss an action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter \"to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.
