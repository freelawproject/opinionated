INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on several post-trial motions filed by both parties, plaintiff National Products, Inc. (\"NPI\") and defendant Arkon Resources, Inc. (\"Arkon\"), following a five-day jury trial for trade dress infringement. Dkts. 182, 186, 188, 190, 196. The Court, having considered the parties' motions, all submissions filed in support of and opposition to the motions, the governing law, and the balance of the record, hereby ORDERS as follows: NPI's renewed Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law that Arkon violated the Washington Consumer Protection Act (Dkt. 182) is DENIED; Arkon's unopposed motion to seal several exhibits (Dkt. 188) is GRANTED; Arkon's renewed Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law (Dkt. 186) is DENIED; Arkon's motion for a new trial as to damages or remittitur (Dkt. 190) is DENIED, conditional upon NPI accepting a remittitur reducing the damages award from $193,598 to $167,239.55; and Arkon's motion to alter or amend the judgment (Dkt. 196) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    NPI's Renewed Motion under Rule 50(b) for Judgment as a Matter of Law that\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arkon Violated the Washington Consumer Protection Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    1. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court conducted a jury trial in this matter from December 4, 2017 to December 8, 2017, on NPI's claims against Arkon for infringement of NPI's federally registered\n   trademark\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in violation of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), as well as the Washington Consumer Protection Act (\"WCPA\"). NPI's trade dress is the hourglass shaped design of a mounting arm, which is used to attach a cell phone (or similar device) to a base in the interior of a vehicle. Arkon denied NPI's claims, arguing that NPI's trade dress was invalid as functional, as lacking secondary meaning, and as generic. Alternatively, if the jury found that NPI's trade dress was valid, Arkon argued that there was no infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 8, 2017, the jury returned a verdict in NPI's favor on its trade dress infringement claim, finding that NPI's trade dress was valid, and infringed, and that the infringement was \"deliberate or willful.\" However, the jury found in favor of Arkon on NPI's WCPA claim. The jury awarded NPI money damages in the amount of $193,598. Dkt. 177 (jury verdict). The Court entered judgment on December 11, 2017. Dkt. 179.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the trial, NPI moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1) that Arkon had infringed NPI's hourglass shape trade dress, that this infringement was willful, and that Arkon's conduct violated the WCPA. Dkt. 169. NPI argued that the infringement took place in Washington, and that Arkon's conduct automatically satisfied four of the five elements necessary to establish a violation of the WCPA pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc. v. Safeco Title Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1199153\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/105/778/#p780\">\n    105 Wash.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 780,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20P.2d%20531\">\n    719 P.2d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). With respect to the fifth and final element of the\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge\n   </em>\n   test, NPI argued that Arkon has not presented evidence of \"usual or unforeseen circumstances\" as required to show that the infringement did not satisfy the remaining \"public interest\" prong of the\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge\n   </em>\n   test. The Court denied NPI's Rule 50(a) motion on the record on December 7, 2017. Dkt. 170; Dkt. 195 (Karish Decl.), Ex. A (Trial Tr. 12/07/17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the jury's verdict, NPI timely filed the instant renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). Dkt. 182. NPI argues that although the jury found in favor of Arkon on NPI's WCPA claim, Dkt. 177, this finding is incorrect as a matter of law because Washington law mandates that trademark infringement is a violation of the WCPA absent evidence of \"unforeseen or unusual circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nordstrom, Inc. v. Tampourlos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1192361\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/107/735/#p740\">\n    107 Wash.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 740-42,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=733%20P.2d%20208\">\n    733 P.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). NPI asserts that there was no evidence of \"unforeseen or unusual circumstances\" presented at trial, and the jury's finding that Arkon's infringement was willful establishes that it was of the kind that necessarily establishes a violation of the WCPA. Dkt. 182. Arkon responds that a finding of trademark infringement does not mandate a finding that the WCPA has been violated, and therefore the Court should not disturb the jury's reasonable finding as to NPI's WCPA claim. Dkt. 194.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    2. Legal Standard for Rule 50(b) Motions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court may grant NPI's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on its WCPA claim if it \"finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis\" to find for Arkon on this claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a). The Court must view the evidence and\n   draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, Arkon, in whose favor the jury returned its verdict on this claim.\n   <em>\n    Ostad v. Oregon Health Sci. Univ.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9141128\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/876/#p881\">\n    327 F.3d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 881 (9th Cir. 2003). The jury's verdict is upheld if substantial evidence supports the jury's conclusion, even if a contrary conclusion could have been reached.\n   <em>\n    Harper v.City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038849\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/1010/#p1021\">\n    533 F.3d 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1021 (9th Cir. 2008). Granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law is proper if \"the evidence permits only one reasonable conclusion, and the conclusion is contrary to that reached by the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038849\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/1010/#p1021\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Judgment as a matter of law \"is appropriate when the jury could have relied only on speculation to reach its verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Lakeside-Scott v.

The Washington Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff bears the burden of proving the following elements to establish a violation of the WCPA: (1) an unfair or deceptive practice; (2) occurring in trade or commerce; (3) affecting the public interest; (4) that injures the plaintiff in his or her business or property; and (5) a causal link between the unfair or deceptive act and the injury suffered.\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc. v.

As discussed below, the Court declines to disturb the jury's reasonable finding that this case constitutes just such an exception. Specifically, because NPI's trade dress was not inherently distinctive\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or a strong mark, and the jury could reasonably conclude that the \"public interest\" element of the\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge\n   </em>\n   test was not satisfied in this case.

NPI contends that by finding that Arkon infringed NPI's trade dress, the jury necessarily found the existence of likelihood of confusion, which affects the public interest. Dkt. 182 at 6. NPI argues that, unlike the case of\n   <em>\n    Seattle Endeavors\n   </em>\n   , this case did not involve \"unusual or unforeseen circumstances\" that could warrant a departure from the general rule that the likelihood of confusion inherent in trademark infringement pursuant to the Lanham Act will also\n   violate the WCPA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=733%20P.2d%20208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As noted above, in\n   <em>\n    Seattle Endeavors\n   </em>\n   , the Washington Supreme Court held that two specific factors-\"inadvertent infringement\" by the defendant and the \"weak\" nature of the mark at issue-constituted an \"unusual and unforeseen circumstance\" that did not satisfy the public interest element of the WCPA. The Court will briefly address each of these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    (i) Willful versus Inadvertent Infringement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   NPI argues that the two factors identified by the Washington Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Seattle Endeavors\n   </em>\n   are not present here, because the jury found that Arkon's infringement was \"deliberate or willful\"-the opposite of \"inadvertent\"-and the jury rejected Arkon's arguments that the infringed mark was \"weak\" through either genericness or lacking secondary meaning. Dkt. 182 at 6 (citing Dkt. 177). NPI asserts that substantial evidence at trial established that NPI's mark was not \"weak,\" and therefore there was no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to depart from the general rule in\n   <em>\n    Nordstrom\n   </em>\n   that the public interest element is automatically satisfied through the likelihood of confusion resulting from trade dress infringement. Dkt. 182 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court finds that, contrary to NPI's arguments, the\n   <em>\n    Seattle Endeavors\n   </em>\n   case illustrates exactly why a reasonable jury in this case could have concluded that Arkon's trade dress infringement did not affect the public interest. Although the jury did indeed find that Arkon's infringement was \"deliberate or willful\" rather than \"inadvertent,\" the jury was instructed that \"willful infringement carries a connotation of deliberate intent to deceive,\n   <em>\n    or willful blindness to facts that would put Arkon on notice that it was infringing NPI's trade dress; that is, Arkon suspected wrongdoing and deliberately failed to investigate.\n   </em>\n   Deliberate, false, misleading, or fraudulent conduct meets this standard.\" Dkt. at 30 (Jury Instr. No. 23-Willfulness) (emphasis added). The jury submitted a single question to the Court during their deliberations: \"Is there a legal definition of willful blindness? If so, please send it to us.\" Dkt. 176. In response, the Court advised the jury that the answer to their question was contained in Jury Instruction No. 23. Thus, it is possible that the jury found that Arkon did not, in fact, intend to deceive the public by infringing NPI's trade dress, but deliberately failed to conduct an adequate investigation. The jury could reasonably find that the \"willful blindness\" resulting from Arkon's failure to conduct an adequate investigation would satisfy the definition of \"willfulness\" provided to them. Arkon's conduct-although damaging to NPI-was not equally harmful to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Based upon the testimony from Arkon's representatives at trial, the jury could have reasonably concluded that Arkon was not actually aware of NPI's trade dress. Substantial evidence at trial showed that Arkon's goal in copying NPI's mounts was to compete in the marketplace by creating a product based upon NPI's expired U.S. Patent 5,845,885, an act that actually promotes the public interest and consumer welfare by ensuring that consumers do not bear the high prices that come from a patent monopoly after the innovations in the patent have been dedicated to the public.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Chanel, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2132206\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/402/562/#p567\">\n    402 F.2d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 567-68 (9th Cir. 1968) (\"Since appellee's perfume was unpatented, appellants had a right to copy it, as appellees concede. There was a strong public interest in doing so, for imitation is the life blood of competition. It is the unimpeded availability of substantially equivalent unit that permits the normal operation of supply and demand to yield the fair price society must pay for a given commodity.\") (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, although the jury did not find that Arkon's infringement was \"inadvertent,\" substantial testimony at trial (as well as the jury's question to the Court seeking a definition of \"willful blindness\") indicated that the jury's finding of willfulness was likely predicated on Arkon's\n   <em>\n    failure to investigate\n   </em>\n   whether NPI had a registered trade dress, rather than knowing infringement. Trademark law makes clear that the public interest in protecting trademarks is only in preventing consumer confusion. Here, the jury was not presented with a consumer survey or other evidence of widespread consumer confusion, apart from testimony by plaintiff's representatives and two of its resellers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the scant evidence of actual consumer confusion presented in this case, the jury could reasonably conclude that although Arkon's infringement of NPI's registered trade dress likely caused some harm to NPI, it was not equally harmful to the public under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    (ii) NPI's Weak Mark\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As noted above, in\n   <em>\n    Seattle Endeavors\n   </em>\n   , the Washington Supreme Court found that unlike in the\n   <em>\n    Nordstrom\n   </em>\n   case, which involved a strong mark that \"is closely associated with the business it designates\" along with \"intentional infringement that was apparent,\" the mark at issue in\n   <em>\n    Seattle Endeavors\n   </em>\n   was a \"weak mark\" and the defendant acted \"without improper intent.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"812802\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/123/339/\">\n    123 Wash.2d at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=868%20P.2d%20120\">\n    868 P.2d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the Supreme Court held that \"\n   <em>\n    inadvertent\n   </em>\n   infringement of a\n   <em>\n    weak\n   </em>\n   mark is not sufficient to qualify as a public interest for the purpose of awarding attorney fees under the Consumer Protection Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=868%20P.2d%20120\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Similarly, the Court finds that substantial evidence at trial would support a finding that NPI's mark was weak. In\n   <em>\n    Seattle Endeavors\n   </em>\n   , the court explained that a mark is weak if \"it is not particularly effective in distinguishing the product or service from others,\" such as where the mark is used by a \"significant number\" of businesses operating in the same field and geographic area.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"812802\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/123/339/\">\n    123 Wash.2d at 344-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=868%20P.2d%20120\">\n    868 P.2d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Beyond the trade dress registration, the testimony of two resellers of NPI's products, and testimony from plaintiff's own representatives, there was no evidence at trial (such as a consumer survey or other evidence) showing that the hourglass shape trade dress was \"particularly effective\" in distinguishing NPI's product from others because the public associates the \"hourglass shape\" with NPI's RAM Mounts brand. In the absence of such evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that although NPI had a valid trade dress, it was a \"weak mark.\" NPI's argument that its trade dress should be considered a strong source-identifier simply because \"it has sold over 17 million products bearing the trade dress, and that even more pocket brochures have been distributed that specifically call out NPI's trade dress\" is unpersuasive in light of the fact that NPI owned a patent on this product for two decades. Dkt. 197 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Thus, the Court finds that just as in\n   <em>\n    Seattle Endeavors\n   </em>\n   , \"unusual or unforeseen circumstances\" in this case such as the scant evidence of actual consumer confusion, the weakness of NPI's trade dress, and the fact that Arkon's infringement likely resulted from a willful failure to investigate rather than knowing infringement, would support a finding that Arkon's infringement of NPI's trade dress did not implicate the public interest element of the WCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Arkon asserts that the financial and sales documents contained in these three exhibits were designated as \"ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\" pursuant to the Stipulated Protective Order entered by the Court on June 13, 2016, and should therefore be sealed to protect the non-public, highly sensitive information contained therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Having reviewed Arkon's unopposed motion, Dkt. 188, as well as the exhibits at issue, the Court GRANTS Arkon's motion to seal Exhibits C, D, and H to the Declaration of Marc Karish (Dkt. 191) filed in support of Arkon's motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Arkon's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law Pursuant to Rule 50(b)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At the close of the evidence, Arkon moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(a) on issues including willfulness, non-infringement, invalidity of the trademark, and lack of harm to Washington consumers.

Dkt. 190 at 2. Arkon asserts that it legally copied NPI's expired patent, but in doing so, had no intention of confusing customers as to the source of the product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. With respect to \"willful blindness,\" Arkon asserts that there are two separate periods at issue, and Arkon was not \"willfully blind\" for either.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The first period of time is the twenty (20) months between January 2014 (when NPI's President Mr. Carnevali approached Arkon's representatives at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas), and October 2, 2015, when NPI served the complaint, because NPI did not send a cease and desist letter in the interim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Arkon points out that the Court excluded damages for any sales during the period of time prior to the service of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. 150 at 27-28). Nevertheless, Arkon asserts that it \"is clear from the jury's question regarding willful blindness\" that \"the jury considered this period of time in assessing willfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Dkt. 176). With respect to this time period preceding service of the complaint, NPI's President, Mr. Carnevali, testified that he told Arkon's representative at the CES tradeshow that there are other protections other than just that patent that they may want to look into that it still may infringe. Dkt. 191 (Karish Decl.), Ex. B (Trial Tr. 12/5/17). Arkon's President Mr. Brassard testified that he reviewed NPI's webpage about its patents and trademarks, and saw no information about the alleged trade dress. Dkt. 191, Ex. C (Trial Tr. 12/6/17), Ex. F (Trial Ex. 585). Arkon argues that it was error to allow a jury instruction regarding willful blindness, and this constituted grounds for a new trial even though Arkon did not timely object to this instruction at trial. Dkt. 190 at 4 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(d)(2) (\"A court may consider a plain error in the instructions that has not been preserved as required by Rule 51(d)(2) if the error affects substantial rights.\") ). Arkon contends that the Court should have adopted its proposed alternative instruction, and the cases cited by NPI in support of this instruction were distinguishable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With respect to the second period of time at issue, the seven months of sales of Arkon's accused products from October 2, 2015 through April 2016 when Arkon finished its sales of the originally designed product (thus terminating the second period of damages), Arkon contends that the parties were engaged in settlement discussions and Arkon was redesigning its products. Prior to trial, Arkon sought a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   under Fed. R. Evid. 407 to bar the jury from hearing that Arkon redesigned its products, fearing that the jury would unfairly construe Arkon's attempts at amelioration to be an admission of liability. Over NPI's objection, Arkon's motion was granted. Dkt. 150 at 27. Now, however, because the jury was not informed of the settlement discussions pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 408\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   or the fact that Arkon had redesigned its products after the lawsuit was initiated (pursuant to Arkon's own\n   motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   ), Arkon contends that the jury was left to speculate as to what happened during this seven month period. During closing arguments, counsel for NPI argued that Arkon's trade dress registration was in effect during this seven month damage period, and therefore Arkon's infringement was deliberate and willful for that period of time. Dkt. 191 (Karish Decl.), Ex. E (Trial Tr. 12/8/17). As a result, Arkon argues that the Court's ruling to exclude testimony regarding settlement discussions after the service of the complaint was also error. Dkt. 190 at 5. Because willfulness was a prerequisite to awarding Arkon's profits, and Arkon maintains there was no willfulness in this case, Arkon asks the Court to reverse the jury's award of all damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stone Creek, Inc. v.

Arkon's President Paul Brassard was familiar with NPI and RAM Mounts from trade shows, online searches, consulting NPI's website, and receiving NPI's marketing materials. Arkon referred internally to its Robust Mounts as \"RAM style mounts,\" and identified RAM Mounts as a \"top tier competitor.\" Evidence at trial established that Arkon knew that the RAM Mount was the only double-ball socket mount on the market when it introduced its Robust Mounts products, and in fact, Mr. Brassard purchased RAM Mounts in 2013 (which likely included pocket brochures showing the hourglass shape trade dress) and used the RAM Mounts to design Arkon's Robust Mounts. Dkt. 203, Ex. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mr. Brassard testified that he hired legal counsel due to his perception that Mr. Carnevali was legally savvy about protecting his intellectual property. However, apart from Mr. Brassard's testimony that he did not personally see any trade dress rights listed on NPI's website alongside its patents, Arkon did not introduce any evidence, such as testimony from its trademark attorney, showing what (if any) kind of investigation was conducted by Arkon to determine whether NPI had other rights apart from the expired patent rights in the accused products. Moreover, the jury heard the undisputed testimony of NPI's President Mr. Carnevali that he told Arkon's representative at the CES tradeshow that there were other protections\n   <em>\n    other than just that patent\n   </em>\n   that Arkon may want to look into that may still infringe NPI's rights. Dkt. 191 (Karish Decl.), Ex. B (Trial Tr. 12/5/17) (emphasis added). Arkon's president Mr. Brassard also testified that he purchased NPI products for his designer to copy in 2013, which was after NPI began packaging its products with a pocket brochure identifying the distinctive hourglass shape on the cover. Dkt. 203, Ex. 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Especially after Mr. Carnevali advised Arkon's representatives that there were other protectable rights, apart from the expired patent, pertaining to the RAM mounts at issue, the jury could find that Arkon acted with \"willful blindness\" by failing to conduct a thorough investigation and ascertain NPI's registered trade dress before copying NPI's product to launch its own line of Robust Mounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, viewing\n   the evidence in the light most favorable to NPI, substantial evidence supported the jury's verdict finding of willfulness, and Arkon's motion for judgment as a matter of law on this issue is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    2. Substantial Evidence Supported the Jury's Verdict on Likelihood of Confusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Arkon contends that when the evidence is construed in the light most favorable to NPI, there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of likelihood of confusion. Dkt. 190 at 7. Specifically, Arkon contends that \"although Arkon and NPI sold similar products, through the same marketing channels to similar customers, the weakness of the mark, the dissimilarities of the products, and the lack of evidence of actual customer confusion show that the jury's verdict was not supported by substantial evidence.\" Dkt. 204 at 4. First, Arkon argues that the sole evidence of actual confusion was from a longtime customer of NPI, Timothy Petersen, who testified that he was momentarily confused, and this is insufficient to establish confusion among an appreciable number of customers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5745545\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/1059/#p1074\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Entrepreneur Media v.

Arkon further argues that there was no evidence beyond the trade dress registration, testimony of two NPI resellers, and testimony from NPI's owners that the public associates the \"hourglass shape\" with NPI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Similarly, apart from a letter from Mr. Brassard to Arkon's supplier stating that he wanted to produce a product related to NPI's expiring patent, Arkon contends that there was no evidence that Arkon attempted to derive a benefit from NPI's reputation, because Arkon prominently displayed its own name on the knob of the products and packaging.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court finds that Arkon's limited analysis of the\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factors does not show that the jury's finding that there was a likelihood of confusion is unsupported by substantial evidence. The Ninth Circuit considers eight \"\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   \" factors to determine whether a likelihood of confusion (and therefore trademark infringement) exist, and these factors include: (1) strength of the mark; (2) proximity or relatedness of the goods; (3) similarity of the marks; (4) evidence of actual confusion; (5) marketing channels used; (6) type of goods and the degree of care customers are likely to exercise in purchasing the goods; (7) defendant's intent in selecting the mark; and (8) likelihood of expansion into other markets.\n   <em>\n    AMF, Inc. v.

The Ninth Circuit has also recognized that \"some factors-such as the similarity of the marks and whether the two companies are direct competitors-will always be important.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11626525\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/1036/#p1054\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As discussed above, the Court agrees with Arkon that NPI's trade dress is quite weak. Contrary to NPI's contention, the commercial success of the RAM mounts-in light of the many years the design of these mounts were protected from market competition by a patent-does not provide evidence of a strong mark in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GoTo.com Inc. v.

Thus, the first\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of Arkon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The second\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factor, proximity or relatedness of goods, weighs strongly in NPI's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brookfield Commc'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11626525\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/1036/#p1054\">\n    174 F.3d at 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that some factors, such as \"whether the two companies are direct competitors ... will always be important.\"). NPI presented evidence that the products are so similar in design that the parts can be used interchangeably, and they are used for identical mounting applications. Dkt. 202, Ex. 3 (Trial Tr. 12/6/17). Although Arkon's products were not as widely distributed as NPI's mounts, NPI and Arkon are direct competitors in substantially the same markets. Dkt. 202, Exs. 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The third\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factor, the similarity of the marks, also weighs in NPI's favor. Based solely on the appearance of the RAM and Arkon mounts, a reasonable jury could find that the hourglass shape of Arkon's mount is similar to a RAM mount. Arkon's president referred to their mounts as \"RAM style mounts\" and called them nearly identical in appearance and quality. Dkt. 202, Ex. 20 (Trial Ex. 249). He also admitted that Arkon specifically sent an NPI RAM mount he had purchased to his designer so that the designer could copy the RAM mount arm, and the RAM and Arkon parts are so similar they are interchangeable with each other. Dkt. 202, Ex. 3 (Trial Tr. 12/6/17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The fourth\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factor, evidence of actual confusion, tips in favor of NPI, but only slightly. Two witnesses at trial, Mr. Petersen and Mr. Carnevali, testified about instances of actual confusion. Dkt. 202, Ex. 2 (Trial Tr. 12/5/17). Mr. Carnevali testified that he had heard of an incident of actual confusion the same week of the trial. Mr. Petersen described entering a conference room and seeing what he thought was a RAM mount attached to a GPS lockbox product, only to realize upon closer inspection that it was actually an Arkon mount. The Court finds that neither of these instances are strong evidence of actual confusion. Mr. Carnevali's testimony was vague, at best, and Mr. Petersen did not make a mistaken purchasing decision based upon his initial confusion. He also testified that he quickly realized his error when he read the word \"Arkon\" printed on the knob of the product. Even assuming that Mr. Petersen falls within the category of a \"reasonably prudent consumer in the marketplace,\" because he purchases vehicle mounts for his company PeopleNet Communications, a single instance of actual confusion which was quickly rectified by reading the name printed on the product's knob is not strong evidence. Dkt. 202, Ex. 2 (Trial Tr. 12/5/17).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rearden\n   </em>\n   , 683 F.3d at 1213-1214 (holding that likelihood of confusion is relevant from the perspective of a \"reasonably product consumer in the marketplace,\" but not the non-purchasing general public). Thus, this factor only slightly weighs in favor of NPI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The fifth\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factor weighs substantially in NPI's favor, as evidence at trial showed that NPI and Arkon used the same marketing channels including Amazon.com, their own websites, catalogs, and trade shows (including the annual Consumer Electronics trade show in Las Vegas). The Court finds that the sixth\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factor, the degree of care customers are likely to use in purchasing the goods in light of the type of goods, also weighs in favor of NPI and likelihood of confusion. The NPI and Arkon mounts are not so expensive that consumers would be expected to do a great deal of research before purchasing the product, and are therefore more likely to be confused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The seventh\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factor, defendant's intent in selecting the mark, is neutral. As discussed above, the evidence of record shows that Arkon wanted to produce a product related to NPI's expiring patent and to compete with NPI, not that Arkon deliberately sought to confuse customers into purchasing Arkon's products. Dkt. 204 at 7. Finally, with respect to the eighth\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factor, it is highly likely that both Arkon and NPI's products will continue to expand into similar markets, and therefore this factor weighs in favor of NPI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Although there is no single factor which is dominant in this case, the majority of the\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of NPI. In light of the evidence presented, the court cannot conclude that the jury's finding of likelihood of confusion was not supported by substantial evidence. Arkon's motion for judgment as a matter of law that the jury could not reasonably have found trade dress infringement is therefore DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    3. Substantial Evidence Supports the Jury's Verdict on Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Arkon contends that, even construing the evidence in the light most favorable to NPI, NPI has not provided evidence that Arkon's conduct caused harm to NPI, which is a prerequisite to damages.

Dkt. 190 (Karish Decl.), Ex. C (Trial Tr. 12/6/17). Arkon also asserts that the only evidence of a lost customer was Mr. Carnevali's testimony that an employee in NPI's sales department notified him in 2015 that NPI had lost GPS Lockbox as a customer to Arkon, and there was no proof that this lost sale was due to any confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 203 (Ware Decl.) (Trial Tr. 12/4/17). Finally, Arkon argues that NPI did not provide any evidence that Arkon's sales of its products caused any injury to NPI's reputation or goodwill, and the jury rejected NPI's request for $470,000 for corrective advertising damages. Dkt. 190 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   NPI responds that a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) is limited to the grounds asserted in the Rule 50(a) motion, and Arkon failed to argue that NPI did not prove any damages in its Rule 50(a) motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v.

Rather, Arkon only argued that NPI should not have been allowed to present evidence regarding corrective advertising based on a purported failure to timely disclose those alleged damages. Dkt. 203, Ex. 4 (Trial Tr. 12/7/17). In any event, NPI argues that evidence of harm to NPI includes evidence that NPI and Arkon were direct competitors in many of the same markets, Arkon's infringing sales caused NPI to lose customers, Arkon sold its infringing products at a discount to RAM Mounts and an even steeper discount to win sales from NPI customers, confusion regarding Arkon's products damaged NPI's reputation for quality, and Arkon's use of the trademark shape detracted from the public identification\n   of that shape as a source indicator for RAM.

Even if Arkon had preserved the issue, the Court finds that the jury's finding of causation and damages was supported by substantial evidence at trial. The jury awarded NPI money damages in the amount of $193,598. Dkt. 177. This $193,598 damages award is the precise amount that NPI's damages expert, Drew Voth, testified was his calculation of Arkon's gross sales (not profits) of the accused products from October 2, 2015 through April 30, 2016 based upon Arkon's financial documents.

Dkt. 186 at 11. Specifically, Arkon argues that it rebutted the presumption of validity created by the registration by showing that NPI had previously claimed the alleged trade dress in NPI's expired patents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11199543\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/1060/#p1068\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Arkon further argues that it provided evidence showing that the materials considered by the USPTO during prosecution were inadequate to find secondary meaning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11199543\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/1060/#p1068\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Arkon contends that NPI failed to provide evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the public associated the alleged trade dress with NPI prior to January 2014 when Arkon introduced the accused products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court finds that substantial evidence at trial supports the jury's finding that NPI's registered trade dress was valid. NPI presented evidence that the trade dress was shown, described, and claimed only in expired patents, and argued that reference to a trade dress outside the claims of a final issued patent do not support invalidity. Dkt. 202 at 12. NPI also presented evidence to show that its trade dress was valid, apart from the registration, because it was non-functional, not claimed in any patent, and has acquired secondary meaning. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the jury's conclusion that NPI's trade dress is valid, and Arkon's motion for judgment as a matter of law as to invalidity is also DENIED.

However, the Court does order a remittitur of the jury's damages award to properly account for the testimony of NPI's damages expert regarding Arkon's costs that should have been deducted from Arkon's gross sales for the relevant period, to arrive at an accurate estimate of Arkon's infringer's profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Arkon's Motion for a New Trial is Denied\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Arkon contends that a new trial on the issue of damages is warranted because (1) the period itself was incorrect and included substantial sales of redesigned products, (2) half the sales were to entities that testified they were not confused, (3) the jury failed to take into consideration any cost of Arkon's products (despite the admission of supporting evidence and a duty to deduct proven costs), and (4) NPI's corrective advertising testimony should have been excluded. Dkt. 190 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   First, Arkon argues that \"one large sale of $56,700 was made to Nexlink Communications, LLC ...on April 29, 2016, one day before the Court's cutoff.

Dkt. 212 (Off. Trial Tr. 12/5/17) at 203:10-12. Attorney argument is not evidence, and Arkon's attempt to rely on documents outside the trial record to argue for the first time that Mr. Voth's calculation of Arkon's gross sales was inaccurate does not provide grounds for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chen v.

Dkt. 191 (Karish Decl.), Ex. F (Trial Tr. 12/6/17). Arkon asserts that of the total sales from the relevant time period, $114,501.35 were to Innovative Intelligent Products/GPS Lockbox and Nexlink Communications. Dkt. 191 (Karish Decl.), Exs, C, D (Trial Exs. 410, 411). Arkon asserts that these sales should not have been awarded to NPI as profits attributable to the infringement, or even included in the jury's calculations of gross profit, because they were not the result of any confusion. If these sales were removed, the gross sales would be reduced to $79,097. Dkt. 190 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Arkon misses the point. The standard for trademark infringement liability is whether commercial use and sale of the infringing article is likely to confuse consumers,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the consuming public generally and not only specific customers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AMF Inc. v.

Arkon has not cited any authority to support its assertion sales to customers who stated they were not confused, although they purchased goods bearing the infringing trade dress, should be excluded from damages calculations. NPI is entitled to infringer's profits,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , profits from sales of the infringing products during the relevant period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Third, Arkon argues that the jury's verdict showed that it deducted no costs whatsoever from Arkon's gross sales from October 2, 2015 through April 30, 2016, although Arkon presented evidence of costs that should have been deducted from its gross sales. Dkt. 190 at 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the jury instead awarded NPI the entire amount of Arkon's gross sales during the relevant period, Arkon believes that \"it can be concluded that the jury was swayed by the testimony of corrective advertising\" which Arkon believes should have been excluded due to NPI's untimely disclosure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917962\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/1199/#p1208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Arkon asserts that \"the jury was likely biased into thinking they were 'splitting the baby' by not awarding corrective advertising damages, when that issue should never have been before them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917962\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/1199/#p1208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Arkon asks the Court to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial on the issue of damages, or enter a remittitur to $41,130.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Court finds that Arkon overstates the significance of its own evidence regarding costs. For example, the jury may have considered testimony regarding Arkon's \"profit margins\" somewhat unhelpful in determining what the costs were \"of actual assistance in the production, distribution or sale of the infringing product.\"\n   <em>\n    Kamar Int'l, Inc. v. Russ Berrie and Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"297120\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/752/1326/#p1332\">\n    752 F.2d 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1332 (9th Cir. 1984). Similarly, the jury was not required to credit Mr. Brassard's testimony regarding Arkon's \"basic costs\" or his testimony that total costs associated with Arkon products during the relevant period was $93,125.71. The jury could reasonably credit Mr. Voth's testimony instead, and Mr. Voth stated that Mr. Brassard had not identified any proven costs or supported the numbers he was claiming with the financial documents he produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Despite the deficiencies in Arkon's arguments, the Court does find that the jury's failure to subtract\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of Arkon's costs, which even NPI's own damages expert, Mr. Voth, testified could properly be deducted from Arkon's gross sales of $193,598 during the relevant period, resulted in an excessive award of infringer's profits to NPI. As discussed above,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) grants the Court the authority\n   to reduce an excessive calculation of infringer's profits and \"enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just, according to the circumstances of the case.\" Once a plaintiff has proven sales, the burden shifts to the defendant to \"prove all elements of cost of deduction\" claimed to arrive at profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On a motion for a new trial or remittitur, if the Court, after viewing the evidence concerning damages in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, determines that the damages award is excessive, it has two alternatives: it may grant defendant's motion for a new trial or deny the motion conditional upon the prevailing party accepting a remittitur.

Although Mr. Voth initially testified that Arkon had not appropriately proven deductible costs, he acknowledged that Arkon would have incurred\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   costs to manufacture the accused products. Dkt. 191 (Karish Decl.), Ex. E. Mr. Voth subsequently testified that he had performed his own analysis of Arkon's invoices reflecting costs incurred over the relevant period. Mr. Voth testified that when he added up the units sold over the damages period, he calculated $26,358.45 of costs that were supported by Arkon's invoices. Mr. Voth created a spreadsheet using the invoices (Trial Exhibit 422) which he showed to the jury reflecting $26,358.45 of potentially deductible costs. Thus, the testimony of NPI's own damages expert established that Arkon should have been entitled to at least a deduction of $26,358.45 in costs from the $193,598 in gross sales, resulting in an \"infringer's profits\" award to NPI of $167,239.55 rather than the jury's award of $193,598 in gross sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, the Court rejects Arkon's fourth and final contention that the jury was somehow biased by NPI's request for $470,000 damages for corrective advertising. From the outset of this action, NPI has claimed that Arkon damaged NPI's business, reputation and goodwill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harper House, Inc. v. Thomas Nelson, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527046\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/889/197/#p209\">\n    889 F.2d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209 n.8 (9th Cir. 1989) (remedy for damage to reputation and goodwill may be corrective advertising). Arkon's assertion that the jury must have been \"splitting the baby\" by awarding gross sales, and declining to award NPI's requested corrective advertising, is speculative at best. The jury's verdict, which did not award any damages to NPI for corrective advertising, more likely reflects a finding that NPI's corrective advertising damages\n   were unsubstantiated, rather than some kind of bias. In any event, Arkon's argument that it was prejudiced by this testimony is not supported by any evidence in the record, as the jury declined to award any damages for corrective advertising.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Accordingly, the Court DENIES Arkon's motion for a new trial, Dkt. 190, conditional upon NPI's acceptance of a remittitur reducing the damages award from $193,598 to $167,239.55, which is the maximum amount supported by the evidence consistent with the testimony of NPI's own expert, Mr. Voth, regarding Arkon's deductible costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oracle Corp. v.

Thus, by limiting their claims to federal trademark infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and unfair business practices under the Washington Consumer Protection Act, NPI avoided presenting numerous overlapping claims to the jury. The claims which NPI raised in the complaint, but did not present at trial, were not frivolous and did not waste valuable time, or cause unnecessary expense or delay. It is a common pretrial practice for parties to narrow their list of claims to be tried at trial, and NPI is not liable for attorney's fees simply because it wisely avoided trying overlapping and duplicative claims. Indeed, Arkon's request overlooks the fact that NPI prevailed on its trademark infringement claim at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Moreover, Arkon's assertion that it will be harmed if the judgment is not amended to explicitly include a reference to each of these claims is incorrect. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require the judgment to explicitly address each claim that was asserted in a complaint, including those claims that the parties ultimately elected not to try.\n   <em>\n    Res judicata\n   </em>\n   bars litigation in a subsequent action of any claims that were raised,\n   <em>\n    or could have been raised\n   </em>\n   , in the prior action.\n   <em>\n    Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11120106\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/244/708/#p713\">\n    244 F.3d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 713 (9th Cir. 2001) ;\n   <em>\n    W.

Arkon's motion to amend the judgment to address NPI's untried claims is therefore DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Similarly, Arkon's attempt to argue the merits of its unclean hands and estoppel defenses for the first time in its Rule 59(e) motion is improper, as Arkon has once again failed to identify any proper basis for relief under that provision. Arkon has failed to show that NPI engaged in inequitable conduct necessary to establish unclean hands. Arkon also waived the affirmative defense of laches by failing to raise it in Arkon's Answer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, the\n   trial record does not establish that Arkon suffered prejudice as a result of NPI's alleged delay in filing suit, as Mr. Brassard testified that Arkon would not necessarily have stopped selling the infringing products if it had received a copy of NPI's trademark registration certificate prior to the CES Trade Show, because he thought the trade dress looked pretty weak. Similarly, Arkon did not immediately stop selling the infringing products when it was served with the complaint, and instead waiting another seven months to fully cease such sales.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Arkon's motion to alter or amend the judgment, Dkt. 196, is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court ORDERS as follows: NPI's renewed Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law that Arkon violated the Washington Consumer Protection Act (\"WCPA\") (Dkt. 182) is DENIED; Arkon's unopposed motion to seal several exhibits (Dkt. 188) is GRANTED; Arkon's renewed Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law (Dkt. 186) is DENIED; Arkon's motion for a new trial or remittitur (Dkt. 190) is DENIED, conditional upon NPI accepting a remittitur reducing the damages award from $193,598 to $167,239.55 and advising the Court of its position within thirty (30) days; and Arkon's motion to alter or amend the judgment (Dkt. 196) is DENIED.

It is irrelevant that settlement negotiations were underway during that time period, or that Arkon was also redesigning its product, as Arkon did not cease sales of the accused product following service of the complaint for months even after the redesign was complete. Moreover, the jury did not hear any testimony regarding Arkon's redesigned product, because the Court granted Arkon's own motion\n    <em>\n     in limine\n    </em>\n    to exclude such testimony to prevent any prejudice to Arkon.
