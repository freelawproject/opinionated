WOLFORD, United States District Judge\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Presently before the Court are the Government's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 37) and a cross-motion for summary judgment by Plaintiffs Uniquest Delaware LLC and Uniland Holdings LLC (\"Plaintiffs\") (Dkt. 41). The material facts are largely undisputed. The parties primarily disagree about whether grants valued at $11 million provided to Plaintiffs by the New York State Empire State Development Corporation (\"Empire State Corporation\") for the restoration of a building in Buffalo, New York, constitute income to Plaintiffs for federal income tax purposes. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that the grants are income. As a result, the Court grants the Government's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 37) in part, denies the motion as moot insofar as it seeks summary judgment on the Government's counterclaim, and denies Plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties agree on the material facts, and the facts laid out below are taken from the parties' Rule 56 statements. (Dkt. 37-1; Dkt. 41-1; Dkt. 41-2; Dkt. 47-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Uniquest Delaware LLC (\"Uniquest\") is a limited liability company organized under the laws of New York State. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 1; Dkt 41-1 at \u00b6 1). Uniquest is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20761\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 2; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 2). Uniquest has two members, Uniland Holdings LLC (\"Uniland\") and UQD Holdings LLC (\"UQD Holdings\"). (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 1; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 1). UQD Holdings and Uniland are both owned by two corporations, Univest I Corporation and Univest II Corporation (collectively, the \"Univest Corporations\"). (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Dkt. 47-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). The Univest Corporations are subject to tax under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\"). (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Dkt. 47-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2006, Uniquest purchased the Avant Building, formerly the Dulski federal office building, in the City of Buffalo. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-6; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-6). At the time of the purchase, Uniquest was an unincorporated joint venture between Uniland and another limited liability company known as Acquest TP Acquisition, LLC (\"Acquest\"). (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 7; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 7). In 2008, Acquest sold its interest in Uniquest to UQD Holdings. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 9; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 9). Uniland and UQD Holdings each own a 50% interest in Uniquest. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 10; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When Uniquest purchased the Avant Building, it had been closed due to environmental concerns. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 11; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 11). Uniquest expected to receive tax credits under New York State's Brownfield Cleanup Program to help fund the expected asbestos remediation. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 12; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 12). In August 2007, Uniquest received an opinion from its attorney that it was unlikely to be eligible for those tax credits; by that point, Uniquest had already commenced an asbestos remediation project. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 13; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 13). Uniquest contacted Empire State Corporation to discuss other possible state funding options. (\n   Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 14; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 14). To obtain funding from the state, Uniquest represented that it planned to develop the Avant Building as \"an approximately 150-room full service hotel, 37 condominium residential units, and a 128,000 square ft. Class A office condominium.\" (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 16; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 16). Uniquest also represented that the project would result in hundreds of additional jobs related to business activities associated with the Avant Building. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 17; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 17). Empire State Corporation in turn provided Uniquest with a draft proposal regarding the Avant Project. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 15; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Empire State Corporation proposed three separate grants, each for specified purposes, with an aggregate grant amount of $7 million. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 18; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 18). As described by the proposal, the V784 grant, in the amount of $2,314,000, would be used for \"[r]eimbursement for a portion of demolition, construction and building development costs associated with the office component of the project.\" (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 19; Dkt. 37-4 at 5; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 19). The V806 grant, in the amount of $1,886,000, would be used for \"[r]eimbursement for a portion of the demolition, construction and new building construction costs associated with the hotel and restaurant component of the project.\" (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 19; Dkt. 37-4 at 6; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 19). The V785 grant, in an amount of up to $2.8 million, would be used \"for a portion of costs associated with the building shell renovation and interior expansion of the hotel component of the project.\" (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 19; Dkt. 37-4 at 7; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 19). That proposal was later superseded by a revised proposal, which the parties signed in early 2008, but the above-quoted portions remained the same. (Dkt. 37-4 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The November 12, 2007, version of the proposal contained the following language in its introductory paragraph: \"There is no element of compensation of specific, quantifiable or other services to the government agencies involved; the grants contemplated by this offer are being offered solely for the purpose of obtaining an advantage for the general community.\" (Dkt. 37-1 \u00b6 23; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 23). That version of the proposal also stated that \"[t]he development of [Uniquest's] property includes the construction of residential units, a hotel, parking facilities, offices and retail facilities and are major assets in the [Uniquest] capital structure.\" (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 24; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 13, 2007, George LaPoint, an employee of Empire State Corporation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   sent another employee an e-mail that said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [J]ust a heads-up, if this becomes an issue: The IRC section 118 exclusion for nonshareholders contribution of capital to a corporation, by definition, is applicable only to corporations. If [Uniquest] elects to be taxed as a corporation, the \"taxation of grants\" issue should not be a problem; if, however, Uniquest is regarded as a partnership, IRC section 118 would not apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 25; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 25). Within hours, that email was sent to Uniquest. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 25; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The final version of the proposal does not contain any language regarding the purpose or beneficiary of the Avant Project. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 29; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 29). However, some of the other proposed changes remained. For example, the December 14, 2007, version of the proposal still provides that \"[t]he development of [Uniquest's] property includes the construction\n   of residential units, a hotel, parking facilities, and retail facilities.\" (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 29; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The proposal provided a schedule for the distribution of the grants, with no portion of the grants to be distributed until the corresponding aspect of the project was substantially completed. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 30; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 30). Accordingly, none of the grants were paid in 2007 or 2008, as none of the necessary conditions for payment were met during those years. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 30; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In June 2008, Uniquest began discussions with Empire State Corporation in an effort to obtain additional grants. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 31; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 31). In January 2009, Uniquest submitted a revised grant proposal to Empire State Corporation. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 32; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 32). In that proposal, the grants to which Empire State Corporation had previously committed would be increased by a total of $4 million, such that the total amount of the payments would now be $11 million. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 32; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 32). Empire State Corporation agreed to the additional funding, and the total amount of $11 million was paid by the end of the year. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 33; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 33). Throughout the remainder of this Decision and Order, the Court will refer to the $11 million payments as the \"ESD grants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Uniquest did not include the ESD grants on its 2009 Form 1065 partnership return as taxable income. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 34; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 34). Uniquest took the position that the grants were nontaxable contributions to capital and thus excludible from income. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 34; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 34). However, the IRS determined that the ESD grants constituted income to Uniquest. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 38; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 38). The IRS also determined that the $11 million in income permitted Uniquest to claim additional depreciation deductions for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax years. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 39; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 39). Adding $11 million to Uniquest's income (which the taxpayer had reinvested into assets) raised the taxpayer's basis in the Avant Project, thus allowing an increased depreciation deduction based upon the higher basis. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 39; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the IRS examiner proposed making an $11 million adjustment to Uniquest's taxable income for the 2009 year (reduced by the additional depreciation), Uniquest sought a hearing with the Appeals Branch of the IRS. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 40; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 40). The Appeals Branch of the IRS sustained the proposed adjustment to income, such that the final action of the IRS proposed an $11 million increase in Uniquest's taxable income for the 2009 tax year. (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 41; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs brought this action seeking judicial review of an IRS Final Partnership Administrative Action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206226\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6 44; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6 44). The Government filed a counterclaim, seeking penalties pursuant to IRC \u00a7 6662. (Dkt. 19 at 7-10). On February 28, 2017, the Government filed a motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 37). Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on March 21, 2017. (Dkt. 41). On April 11, 2017, the Government filed its response/reply papers in opposition to Plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment and in support of its motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 47). On April 19, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file supplemental briefing. (Dkt. 49;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 48). On May 2, 2017, Plaintiffs filed reply papers in support of their cross-motion for summary judgment and in opposition to the Government's motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 50). On July 31, 2017, the Government filed a consent motion to dismiss its counterclaim. (Dkt. 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 8, 2017, the Court heard argument on the motions for summary judgment and the motion to voluntarily dismiss. The parties agreed to the dismissal of the Government's counterclaim, with prejudice, and, thus, the Court granted the Government's motion to voluntarily dismiss its claim for penalties by Text Order on January 3, 2018. (Dkt. 53). The Court otherwise reserved decision on the parties' motions for summary judgment. On February 14, 2018, the Government filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental statement identifying newly decided authority. (Dkt. 54). On February 20, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a response to the Government's supplemental statement. (Dkt. 56).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The Competing Motions for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As noted above, the material facts are undisputed. The parties primarily disagree about whether the ESD grants constitute \"income\" to Uniquest, and, if they do, whether any income exclusion applies. More specifically, the Government argues that summary judgment is appropriate because the ESD grants constitute \"income\" as a matter of law pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Comm'r v. Glenshaw Glass Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931705\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/426/\">\n    348 U.S. 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931705\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/426/\">\n    75 S.Ct. 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20L.%20Ed.%20483\">\n    99 L.Ed. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1955) (Dkt. 37-2 at 4-8), and no IRC or common law exclusion from income applies (Dkt. 37-2 at 8-21). In opposition to the Government's motion and in support of their cross-motion, Plaintiffs argue that\n   <em>\n    Glenshaw Glass\n   </em>\n   should not be read as broadly as the Government suggests and that the ESD grants should be excluded from Uniquest's federal income tax liability under the \"common law inducement doctrine.\" (Dkt. 42 at 15-24). Plaintiffs also contend that the ESD grants are not income to the Univest Corporations, which are entitled to exclude the grants pursuant to IRC \u00a7 118 and \u00a7 702.

(Dkt. 47 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   According to the Government,\n   <em>\n    Glenshaw Glass\n   </em>\n   compels the conclusion that the BSD grants in this case were a \"form of enrichment\" to Uniquest. (Dkt. 37-2 at 7). Furthermore, the Government contends that the grants were conditioned on completion of the work and the provision of documented employment for a certain number of people; therefore, the grants are income for the additional reason that they are a form of \"compensation for services\" within the meaning of \u00a7 61(a)(1). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2061\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (including in gross income \"[c]ompensation for services\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At oral argument, Plaintiffs, for the first time, argued that the ESD grants were not an \"accession to wealth,\" but rather a discount or \"rebate\" on the purchase price of the building. Plaintiffs contend that they would not have proceeded with the Avant Project but for the ESD funding. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41-2 at 6 (referencing statement by President of Upstate Empire State Development Corporation that \"[w]ithout ESD funding, Uniquest would not have proceeded with the project....\") ) ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The IRS has ruled that when retail customers purchase an automobile and receive a rebate, the rebate represents a reduction in the purchase price of the automobile, and the customer's basis is the actual price, after the rebate. Rev. Rul. 76-96, 1976-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20C.B.%2023\">\n    1 C.B. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    suspended in part on other grounds\n   </em>\n   , Rev. Rul. 2005-28. Plaintiffs contend that this situation is analogous, but the Court disagrees. Here, unlike a retail customer who purchases a car with the knowledge that a rebate is forthcoming, Plaintiffs purchased the Avant Building and then subsequently sought and received the ESD grants. Therefore, the ESD grants cannot be considered a discount or reduction in the purchase price of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs also take issue with the Government's characterization of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Glenshaw Glass\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs argue that if, as the Government contends, gross income was an \"all-encompassing concept,\" it would not be necessary for the IRC to list 32 items, at \u00a7 61(a)(1)-(15) and \u00a7\u00a7 71 - 90, specifically\n   <em>\n    includable\n   </em>\n   as gross income. (Dkt. 42 at 43). The Government replies that that interpretation conflicts with the text of \u00a7 61, which provides that \"gross income means all income from whatever source derived,\n   <em>\n    including (but not limited to\n   </em>\n   ) the following items,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2061\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added), before listing specific inclusions (Dkt. 47 at 17). The Government is correct that the phrase\n   <em>\n    including (but not limited to)\n   </em>\n   signals that the definition of income is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   limited by the listed examples. Furthermore, Plaintiffs' argument has been expressly rejected by the Second Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herbert v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792561\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/32/#p34\">\n    850 F.2d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34 (2d Cir. 1988) (\"The mere fact that Congress specifically included certain payments as 'income' does not mean that all other payments not specifically included are therefore not 'income.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Section 721 of the IRC Does Not Apply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Next, the Government argues that Uniquest cannot benefit from any IRC section\n   that would permit the exclusion of the ESD grants from its taxable income. (Dkt. 37-2 at 8-12). The Government first argues that Plaintiffs cannot invoke the exclusion for partnership income tax liability found in IRC \u00a7 721. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10). The general rule set forth therein provides that \"[n]o gain or loss shall be recognized to a partnership or to any of its partners in the case of a contribution of property to the partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20721\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Here, there is no evidence that the ESD grants were extended \"in exchange for an interest in the partnership,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mas One Ltd. P'ship v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140551\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/427/#p432\">\n    390 F.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432 (6th Cir. 2004) (denying the application of \u00a7 721 where \"no partnership interest was at issue\" during the transaction), and Plaintiffs disclaim any reliance upon such an argument, (Dkt. 42 at 42 n.6);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twenty Mile Joint Venture, PND, Ltd. v.

Accordingly, the Court finds that IRC \u00a7 721 does not apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The ESD Grants Are Not \"Gifts\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Government next argues that the ESD grants do not constitute \"gifts\" pursuant to the exclusion set out in \u00a7 102 of the IRC. (Dkt. 37-2 at 10-11). The general rule provides that \"[g]ross income does not include the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Under the IRC, a gift \"proceeds from a detached and disinterested generosity... out of affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses. And in this regard, the most critical consideration ... is the transferor's intention.\"\n   <em>\n    Comm'r v. Duberstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165077\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/278/#p285\">\n    363 U.S. 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165077\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/278/#p285\">\n    80 S.Ct. 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165077\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/278/#p285\">\n    4 L.Ed.2d 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1960) (quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, again, there is no evidence that the ESD grants were \"gifts\" for purposes of federal income tax law, and Plaintiffs disclaim any reliance upon this provision of the IRC. (Dkt. 42 at 42 n.6). Accordingly, the Court also determines that the ESD grants are not excludable from Uniquest's taxable income as \"gifts\" pursuant to IRC \u00a7 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The ESD Grants are Not Excluded under a Common Law Inducement Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs' primary argument, as set forth in their cross-motion for summary judgment, is that the ESD grants-which Plaintiffs characterize as \"incentive grants\"-are excludable from income under the \"inducement doctrine.\" (Dkt. 42 at 16). According to Plaintiffs, inducement payments are treated as purchase-price reductions and are excluded from gross income, and the taxpayer must correspondingly reduce its cost basis in the acquired asset. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs argue that, taken together, the cases that they rely on in support of their inducement theory establish three principal requirements for a contribution to constitute an inducement payment: (1) the inducement payment must be intended by both the payor and payee to induce the payee to enter into a specific transaction; (2) the inducement payment must be a necessary condition for the transaction-but for the payment, the transaction would not be completed; and (3) the payor must expect to realize a benefit from the transaction. (Dkt. 42 at 19). Plaintiffs contend that the ESD grants were inducement payments because the communications between Uniquest and Empire State Corporation establish that both parties intended the grants to induce Uniquest to complete its plans to construct the building; the funding was a necessary condition for the project; and the ESD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   grants were premised on the benefit that Empire State Corporation expected to receive from completion of the project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The first case that Plaintiffs cite in support of their position that an inducement doctrine applies in this case is\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Comm'r\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12116359\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/bta/10/1036/\">\n    10 B.T.A. 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1928). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the question was whether payments made to the petitioner to induce him to purchase stock constituted \"a reduction of the cost of the stock to [the petitioner] or whether it [was] to be treated as taxable income.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12116359\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/bta/10/1036/\">\n    10 B.T.A. at 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that the amount paid was not taxable income because it was \"paid in furtherance of an understanding\" that the amount \"represented a reduction of the investment by [the] petitioner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12116359\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/bta/10/1036/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Government responds that\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   cannot survive the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in\n   <em>\n    Glenshaw Glass\n   </em>\n   ; if the same fact pattern occurred today, the money would be income to the taxpayer. (Dkt. 47 at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs also cite\n   <em>\n    Freedom Newspapers, Inc., v.

As the Government correctly notes, the IRS did not appeal the decision in\n   <em>\n    Freedom Newspapers\n   </em>\n   , despite the fact that it had not acquiesced to the\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   decision.

The IRS reasoned that the tax court's finding was not \"clearly erroneous\" because the broker was a party intimately involved in the sale of the newspapers, and therefore any payment received by petitioner was \"merely a reduction of his Commission and thus a reduction in petitioner's basis in the [newspaper].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Freedom Newspapers\n   </em>\n   , here, Empire State Corporation was involved only after the purchase of the Avant Building and there is no contention that it had a financial interest in the project before it awarded Uniquest the ESD grants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Later, in\n   <em>\n    General Motors Corp. v.

In\n   <em>\n    General Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the payor, General Motors, and the payee, General Motors' financing arm, were part of the same consolidated taxpayer and filed a consolidated return; thus, there was no accession to wealth.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11544074\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/112/270/\">\n    112 T.C. at 301-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The cases Plaintiffs cite in support of their contention that a common law inducement doctrine applies in this case to exempt the ESD grants from Uniquest's income are either factually distinguishable or grounded in an outdated definition of income.

However, the case law that has followed the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Glenshaw Glass\n   </em>\n   , as well as the text of the IRC, overwhelmingly indicate that gross income includes \"all realized gains and forms of enrichment... except those specifically exempted,\"\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513571\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/625/\">\n    3 F.3d at 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted), and that no common law inducement doctrine survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-42). Plaintiffs contend that because Uniquest's two partners-the Univest Corporations-are S Corporations, the \"contribution to capital\" income exclusion provided for in \u00a7 118 is applicable to the Univest Corporations, and should be applied to the ESD grants pursuant to \u00a7 702 of the IRC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). The Government responds that leave to amend should not be granted because Plaintiffs have not established the necessary \"good cause\" required under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. 47 at 7-9). The Government also opposes Plaintiffs' arguments on the merits by asserting that Plaintiffs rely on outmoded precedent, and that insofar as an \"inducement\" doctrine once existed at common law, it has since been codified as \u00a7 118-which is inapplicable to Uniquest as a partnership entity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-25). The Government further contends that Plaintiffs' reliance on the\n   corporate status of its partners in challenging the income taxable at the partnership level is contrary to the procedures set forth in TEFRA and Second Circuit precedent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs' request to file an amended complaint is denied. Plaintiffs seek to amend their complaint to allege a claim for income exclusion under IRC \u00a7 118. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42 at 13). The Government argues, correctly, that because Plaintiffs seek leave to amend after December 11, 2015-the deadline for making amendments to the pleadings as set forth in the Court's scheduling order (Dkt. 18 at \u00b6 6)-Plaintiffs must not only satisfy the requirements of Rule 15(a), but must also demonstrate \"good cause\" for the amendment as required by Rule 16(b).\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

(Dkt. 50 at 2). Plaintiffs also argue that they acted diligently by immediately inserting their request to amend within their motion papers once the Government asserted that the Court should consider the ESD grants as income to the partners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs further contend that the Government would suffer no prejudice because it was on notice that Plaintiffs could raise this argument in the course of this litigation. (Dkt. 42 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court does not agree with Plaintiffs that the Government has raised a new legal theory within its motion papers that would suggest that the Court should consider the ESD grants as income to the partners. The parties' memoranda of law were thoroughly drafted, and the fact that the Government may have anticipated Plaintiffs' future arguments does not suggest that the Government has raised a new theory in this case. Indeed, it appears the Government's attorneys merely possessed the foresight to address Plaintiffs' possible IRC \u00a7 118 and \"inducement doctrine\" arguments after considering Plaintiffs' allegations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 49 (\"Upon information and belief, the FPAA based this adjustment on the position that no common law Inducement Doctrine applies to the ESD grants, that there is no common law Contribution to Capital Doctrine, and that the Non-shareholder contribution to Capital Doctrine, codified by statute for corporations in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20118\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not apply to entities taxed as partnerships.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court notes that the Government does, at times, state that the income in question is \"income to the partners.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 37-2 at 3). That word choice is, perhaps, inapt at this stage of these tax proceedings, but it does not detract from the clear substance of the Government's contentions. The Government consistently argues that Uniquest, as a partnership, cannot avoid its tax liability under the prevailing definition of \"income,\" and cannot avail itself of any income \"exclusions\" found in the IRC or otherwise asserted by Plaintiffs. (Dkt. 37-2 at 4-21). To this point, the fact that the Government notes that the partners ultimately pay the partnership taxes is a mere statement of law, and it does not mean, as Plaintiffs suggest, that the Government has asserted that the Univest Corporations are the \"real parties in interest\" to this proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 37-2 at 8,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42 at 12). Accordingly, the Court does not find that Plaintiffs have established \"good cause\" to amend their complaint at this late hour\n   and in the midst of competing motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   However, even if Plaintiffs did satisfy the requisite \"good cause\" standard under Rule 16, the Court would deny Plaintiffs' request under Rule 15. \"Although generally leave to amend is freely granted, where there is no merit to the proposed amendment, leave to amend should be denied.\"\n   <em>\n    Ocean Grp., LLC v.

United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Fed.%20Cl.%201\">\n     136 Fed.Cl. 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2018), which the Government posits determined whether \"a payment received from a state agency that was not in exchange for a partnership interest constituted income to the partnership's members.\" (Dkt. 54 at 1).\n    <em>\n     Ginsburg\n    </em>\n    concerned tax credit payments to a partnership entity, principally owned by an individual, under a New York State tax credit program.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Fed.%20Cl.%201\">\n     136 Fed.Cl. at 2-3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court held that the approximately $1.8 million tax credit was taxable income because it \"was nothing more than a cash transfer from the state to the taxpayer,\" who was \"free to spend, save, or transfer the excess credit in whatever way [it] pleased.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Fed.%20Cl.%201\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Fed.%20Cl.%201\">\n     at 4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, Plaintiffs are partnerships owned by corporate entities, not individuals. (Dkt. 41-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Dkt. 47-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). In addition, it appears that the ESD grants had at least\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    \"strings attached\" relating to the use and payment of the grant monies. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 37-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 30; Dkt. 41-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 30);\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ginsburg\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Fed.%20Cl.%201\">\n     136 Fed.Cl. at 4-5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Ginsburg\n    </em>\n    court also addressed the \"recovery of capital\" doctrine,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Fed.%20Cl.%201\">\n     136 Fed.Cl. at 5-6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , which has little relevance to this case. The court rejected the plaintiffs' theory that the tax credits were a \"nontaxable contribution to capital,\" stating that \"[t]here is no evidence, nor is there federal law specifically allowing for such an exclusion, that New York paid $1,864,618 to plaintiffs in exchange for partnership interests.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20Fed.%20Cl.%201\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This brief explanation is of little persuasive value, and, as will be discussed below, Plaintiffs do not dispute that the ESD grants were not tendered in exchange for a partnership interest. (Dkt. 42 at 42 n.6). Insofar as the\n    <em>\n     Ginsburg\n    </em>\n    court also determined that the plaintiffs \"freely chose to participate and take advantage of New York's state tax credit program,\" and that New York State did not induce the plaintiffs to invest, this Court finds that analysis rather cursory. Accordingly,\n    <em>\n     Ginsburg\n    </em>\n    is of little significance to this Court's disposition of the present matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
