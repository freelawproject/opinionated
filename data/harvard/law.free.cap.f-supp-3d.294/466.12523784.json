NORTON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Plaintiff Raven Renee Ray (\"Ray\") brought this admiralty action against Defendant Steve A. Lesniak (\"Lesniak\") pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(h). Ray is suing Lesniak for personal injuries and other damages she sustained as a result of being struck by the main\n   sheet during a sailing race on Lesniak's boat \"the Celadon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The court tried this case without a jury on September 18, 2017. Having considered the testimony and the exhibits admitted at trial, as well as the parties' pre-trial briefs and post-trial proposed findings and conclusions, the court now makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). It finds that Lesniak was negligent in his captaining of the Celadon, that Ray suffered an injury while an invited guest on the Celadon as a result of Lesniak's negligence, and that as a result of this injury Ray has a permanent traumatic brain injury. It awards $958,758.15 in damages. This award, in the court's eyes, gives Ray what she deserves-\"just some justice, some recognition and help.\" Tr. 135:24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1. At the time of the incident at issue, Ray was a 29-year-old female working two jobs in the food and beverage industry, volunteering at an acupuncture clinic, and simultaneously pursuing advanced degrees in psychology and clinical counseling at The Citadel. Ray had never been on a sailboat before the day of the incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2. At the time of the incident, 57-year-old Lesniak was the owner, operator, and captain of the sailboat Celadon on which the incident occurred. Lesniak is an experienced captain, who has 35 years of sailing experience-including 25 years of sailing experience in Charleston. Tr. 205:15-17. He has captained \"several hundred, maybe a thousand\" sailboat races. Tr. 205:18-20. He has been sailing with some of the crew members that were on the Celadon at the time of the incident for \"15, 20 years.\" Tr. 205:24-206:7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   3. The sailboat Celadon on which the incident occurred is a fifty-one foot, 1995 Beneteau Oceanis 510 registered in Charleston County, South Carolina. At the time of the incident, Lesniak had owned and operated the Celadon for approximately fifteen years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   4. Operation of the sailboat during a race requires several crewmembers. Thirteen crewmembers and a number of guests were aboard the sailboat on the day of the incident. Tr. 182:1-183:1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Accident:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. The court now turns to the day of the incident, May 21, 2014. Ray was invited to a sailboat race by Colin Skinner (\"Skinner\"), who Ray knew as a \"regular\" customer at the Oak Bar Tavern where she worked. Tr. 106:14-20. Skinner was a crew member on the Celadon. Tr. 184:3-6. Skinner has been sailing with Lesniak for \"[r]oughly five years.\" Tr. 206:20-22. Lesniak allowed Skinner to invite a guest on the boat. Tr. 184:5-6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. The other crew members who were on the Celadon during the incident had years of sailing experience, many as crew members with Lesniak. Tr. 206:10-208:4. Of the crew members on the boat at the time of the incident, at least three had medical backgrounds, ranging from Emergency Room nurse to thoracic surgeon. Tr. 206:10-208:9. Lesniak testified that these crew members had previously taken action if anyone suffered an injury on the boat\n   during sailing races and trips. Tr. 209:21-210:5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3. Lesniak testified that all of his crew members \"[knew] to look after new people.\" Tr. 208:18-21.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4. Lesniak authorized crew members to perform tasks during the race, including telling guests when and where to move during the course of the race. Tr. 209:1-20.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   5. Ray and Skinner arrived at the Carolina Yacht Club, the marina where the yacht was docked. Tr. 107:7-12. When she got to the boat, there were \"many\" people on the boat, including crew members and guests. Tr. 108:1-4. Ray testified that she did not know anyone on the boat other than Skinner. Tr. 108:5-6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   6. Before May 21st, 2014, Ray had never been on a sailboat. Tr. 106:21-107:1. She knew nothing about how a sailboat worked. Tr. 107:2-4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   7. Lesniak did not give safety instructions to any of the guests, including Ray, who was on the Celadon. Tr. 184:12-17. He also did not give any written instructions to guests. Tr. 187:2-6. Furthermore, he did not have a written safety checklist or conduct a safety and operational briefing before the Celadon left the marina. Tr. 187:16-21. At the time of the incident, there were no safety placards or visual displays on the Celadon stating that there were dangerous places to sit on the boat, such as \"around any rope, boom.\" Tr. 186:20-187:1. Lesniak delegated the giving of safety instructions to two crew members, neither of whom testified during the trial. Tr. 14:16-185:6. Lesniak did not hear what safety talks were given to guests because he was at the helm of the boat. Tr. 185:5-9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   8. Ray was late to the start of the boat race and was given an abbreviated version of the \"safety talk\" by crew members, which involved an instruction on where not to sit on the boat. Tr. 192:10-18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   9. Upon arriving on the Celadon, Skinner placed Ray at the position where she was sitting when the main sheet hit her. Tr. 264:8-265:19. Ray was seated on the deck of the Celadon, near the main sheet. Ex. 13.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   10. The crew was aware of where Ray was sitting. Tr. 204:4-6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   11. Within 5-10 minutes of Ray stepping on board the Celadon, the incident occurred. Tr. 194:2-5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   12. Before she was hit, Ray was given instructions by crew members to \"get more neighborly, get closer together.\" Tr. 114:2-3. Specifically, crew member Dawn Truog (\"Truog\") asked Ray, who was sitting in front of the main sheet, to \"move back from the [main] sheet.\" Tr. 250:16-25. There was no evidence presented that Ray knew what a \"main sheet\" was. Crew member Mary Anne Becker (\"Becker\") also testified, stating that she \"told [Ray] specifically to move, move up front, move forward\" multiple times, because Ray \"was going to be brushed by the sheets\" when the boat gybed. Tr. 257:6-12. Becker further testified that even after these verbal warnings to move, Ray \"didn't move,\" and \"the next thing\" Becker knew was Ray \"down on the gutter\" of the boat. Tr. 257:17-20.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   13. Lesniak made the decision to gybe, which is the action that caused the main sheet to strike Ray. Tr. 199:16-17. When the captain executes a gybe maneuver, as Lesniak\n   did here, the main sheet moves across the deck of the boat. Tr. 221:14-25.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   14. Lesniak testified that members of his crew told Ray to move \"several times\" and that the crew members were aware that she did not move-even after Lesniak had called for the gybe maneuver. Tr. 213:22-214:5. For example, Truog was aware that Ray was sitting in front of the main sheet when Lesniak gybed. Tr. 254:25-255:3. Truog saw \"the boom [come] over, and that [Ray] was pushed down to the side of the boat.\" Tr. 251:9-18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   15. If Lesniak had waited to gybe or made sure that Ray was in a safe location, Ray would not have been hit by the main sheet. Tr. 202:9-13.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   16. After Lesniak did the gybe maneuver, Ray was hit by the main sheet, the force of which threw her from her seated position onto the deck of the boat. Tr. 115:14-20. The main sheet carries a significant amount of pressure, \"absolutely\" enough to cause a serious injury. Tr. 237:6-25. Lesniak saw the main sheet strike Ray. Tr. 198:25-199:6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   17. The court considered the testimony of various crew members who were on the Celadon during the incident. For example, Dr. Bill Lynch testified about the main sheet hitting Ray. Additionally, he testified that he did not give any safety instructions to Ray, and was not aware of any sailing experience that she had. Tr. 247:1-6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   18. Ray was left with an abrasion on her forehead as a result of the main sheet hitting her. Pl.'s Ex. 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   19. After Ray was injured, Lesniak did not turn the boat around. Tr. 117:5-12. Lesniak continued with the boat race. Tr. 148:10-18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Breach of Safety Protocol:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1. Ray testified about the instructions she was given when she got on the Celadon. Specifically, Ray stated that she was \"told where the lines were\" and where to sit. Tr. 109:18-23. She was given these instructions and told where to sit by a crew member, \"Peggy.\" Tr. 110:6-9. She was not warned that she \"might get hit in the head with a boom or a rope or anything like that.\" Tr. 110:10-17. There were also no written instructions on the \"hull or deck of the boat or bow or the stern, starboard side\" that said where to sit, and no one gave written instructions to Ray when she was on the boat. Tr. 110:18-24. There was also no formal verbal safety briefing. Tr. 111:4-7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2. Ray did not hear, and \"wouldn't have understood\" any instructions on whether the boom or main sheet were going to swing during the course of the race. Tr. 115:1-4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   3. The court also credits the testimony of Ray's expert Captain Ken Wahl (\"Wahl\"), who the court qualified as a boating expert and marine safety consultant. Tr. 214:20-215:9. Wahl opined that competitive sailboat racing \"requires a large number of experienced crew to adequately handle the fast-paced activities normally observed during this often dangerous and close quarters style of competitive sailing.\" Ex. 1 at 8. Wahl further opined that \"[o]nly highly experienced persons should be aboard for these events.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on his review of the evidence, Wahl testified that \"there appeared to be a lot of people\" on the Celadon, and that \"safe places...were probably a little bit difficult to find.\" Tr. 220:1-9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   4. Wahl opined that Lesniak, who had captained hundreds of races, became \"complacent\" by delegating the \"safety orientation\" for guests to crew members. Tr. 225:9-226:3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   5. Wahl testified that when a boat race begins, \"[t]here's some very dangerous places to be on board the boat...[a]nd it's certainly not a safe place to be right near the main sheet.\" Tr. 221:10-13. Accordingly, Ray, who was seated on the deck of the boat near the main sheet, was in a dangerous position. Tr. 222:1-6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   6. Specifically, Wahl opined that \"[m]oving isn't quite enough\" \"when somebody doesn't know anything about a sailboat, because they don't know where to move to.\" Tr. 223:23-25. The proper procedure for a crew member to ensure that Ray was moved safely to another area of the boat was for Lesniak or a crew member to physically ensure that she had been moved to a safer place. Tr. 226:14-227:16. Simply telling a novice passenger like Ray who had never been on a sailboat to move was insufficient, and a breach of safety protocol. Tr. 227:9-21.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   7. Wahl further opined that it was in contravention of boat safety protocol for Lesniak to gybe while Ray was sitting next to the main sheet, as gybing the boat necessarily causes a movement of the main sheet. Tr. 223:14-19. Wahl offered suggestions on what safety protocol Lesniak should have followed in that scenario, such as \"[d]elay the gybe, get somebody to move that person, tell them where to sit, where the safe spot is.\" Tr. 223:16-22. Lesniak did none of these things.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   8. When a captain changes the position of the sails, such as the gybe maneuver that Lesniak performed, Wahl testified that the captain \"typically\" will call out to the crew and let the crew members know that he will be changing the position of the sails. Tr. 238:16-239:4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Comparative Negligence:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   1. Ray was told to move away from the main sheet by multiple crew members, including Truog and Becker, but did not move. Tr. 257:17-20.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   2. After getting hit by the main sheet, Ray did not ask anyone for medical attention and did not appear to be in need of any medical attention. Tr. 210:6-23.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   3. When Ray got off the Celadon at the conclusion of the race, Lesniak asked her if she was \"okay\" and she replied that \"she was fine.\" Tr. 210:24-25.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   4. A few days after the incident, Lesniak contacted Ray to give her the option of going to see Bill Lynch, a crew member on the Celadon during the incident and a doctor, at no cost. Tr. 210:1-5. Ray declined. Tr. 210:1-5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Causation of Traumatic Brain Injury :\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   1. Two days after the incident, Ray went to Nason Medical Center because she was experiencing \"extreme body pain.\" Tr. 119:17-24. Within seven days of the incident, Ray began experiencing different symptoms-namely, debilitating nausea and headaches. Tr. 120:11-21. Ray was \"extremely\" confused when she went to the Medical University of South Carolina (\"MUSC\") the week after the incident as a result of her new symptoms. Tr. 121:1-6. At MUSC, Ray was referred to a neurologist who diagnosed\n   Ray with a concussion and prescribed medications for a head injury. Tr. 121:7-25.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   2. The only medical expert who testified during the trial was Dr. Marshall Allen White (\"Dr. White\"), a board-certified neurologist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. 8:15-16. Dr. White treats patients with traumatic brain injuries as part of his practice on \"nearly a daily basis,\" and has done so since 1991. Dr. White has testified in the past as to both the diagnoses and causation of traumatic brain injuries. The court credits Dr. White as an expert in the field of traumatic brain injuries. Tr. 9:21-10:17. Dr. White examined Ray, and reviewed the following medical records: (1) Nason Medical Center; (2) MUSC; (3) Dr. Jeffrey Buncher, a pain management physician in Charleston, South Carolina; (4) physical therapy records; (5) acupuncture records; (6) neuropsychological testing performed by Dr. Randolph Waid; and (7) psychiatric records from Dr. Kurtzman. Tr. 11:1-21. Dr. White testified that, based on his examination of Ray, a review of her medical records, and consulting with peer-reviewed articles, Ray sustained a traumatic brain injury. Tr. 12:5-12. Specifically, Dr. White testified that Ray had the symptoms of a concussion immediately following the incident, in that she was \"dazed, confused,\" and the morning after the event she felt \"that she was not going to be able to wake up,\" which Dr. White testified indicated \"a level of hypersomnolence, which is typical following a concussion.\" Tr. 12:17-13:1. Dr. White further testified that compared to \"baseline records\" that were \"pretty close in proximity\" to the incident, he observed that Ray had \"heightened levels of anxiety, trepidation, moodiness, difficulty sleeping after the period of hypersomnolence, difficulty focusing, poor memory, and anxiety levels which were dramatically increased from her baseline levels.\" Tr. 13:2-10. All of these symptoms of traumatic brain injury, according to Dr. White, were caused by the head trauma that Ray suffered during the incident. Tr. 13:11-15.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   3. According to Dr. White, Ray's traumatic brain injury is \"permanent.\" Tr. 13:16-18. All three of these opinions-that Ray had a traumatic brain injury, that the brain injury was permanent, and that the brain injury was the result of the incident on the Celadon-Dr. White testified that he held to a \"reasonable degree\n   of medical certainty.\" Tr. 13:19-22. Specifically, in his report, Dr. White states that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   It is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Ms. Ray experienced traumatic brain injury as a result of her sailing incident, which occurred in 2014. There is ample evidence of headache, nausea, vomiting, and worsening in her neuropsychiatric syndrome and cognitive abilities following the incident...It is further my opinion that Ms. Ray would clearly have academic, social and occupational difficulties throughout every facet of her life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Pl.'s Ex. 4. Dr. White further testified that when he examined Ray, she was having emotional and concentration issues that he attributed to her \"residual [traumatic brain injury ] symptomology,\" and that this was consistent with a patient with her level of brain injury. Tr. 28:13-23.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   4. Dr. White also testified at length about Ray's post-incident treatment in the week after the incident, based on his review of her medical records. At Nason, Dr. White testified that no diagnostic testing was performed, and instead Nason \"basically gave her pain medicine and sent her home.\" Tr. 17:9-11. Then, Ray went to the MUSC emergency room, where she was \"evaluated and treated\" for \"neck and back pain.\" Tr. 17:14-15. Ray then returned to MUSC with \"complaints of pain,\" and returned once again within five days of the injury \"complaining of headaches\" as well as nausea and vomiting. Tr. 17:19-23. These symptoms of headaches, nausea, and vomiting, were, Dr. White testified, symptoms of a concussion. Tr. 18:11-14. Based on his review of Ray's medical records and after taking her medical history, Dr. White concluded that Ray had \"a lot\" of the symptoms of the postconcussive syndrome. Tr. 20:5-9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   5. Lesniak argued at various points during the bench trial that Ray did not immediately experience any symptoms of headaches, nausea, and vomiting while on the Celadon or the next day. However, Dr. White testified that there can be \"delayed effects from concussion.\" Tr. 35:24. Furthermore, Ray had consumed at least one beer immediately before the incident. Alcohol consumption, Dr. White testified, would impair Ray's ability to recognize her symptoms. Tr. 36:6-11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   6. Dr. White testified that postconcussive headaches such as the ones that Ray experienced can be developed \"within seven days of the concussion itself.\" Tr. 18:22-24. Indeed, Dr. White testified on the types of symptoms during the \"days and weeks\" after a concussion, and stated that there can be \"difficulty concentrating, moodiness, hypersomnolence...[a]nxiety...headaches, nausea, and vomiting.\" Tr. 19:1-17.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   7. Ray had a CT scan done at MUSC, which had normal results, but Dr. White testified that the normal CT scan did not disturb his opinion that Ray had a traumatic brain injury, as mild traumatic brain injury patients will have \"under almost all circumstances...normal imaging.\" Tr. 21:18-22:2. Indeed, Dr. White testified that a normal CT scan was \"expected\" for patients with mild traumatic brain injury. Tr. 22:3-6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   8. The court considered that Ray was not diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, or indeed any injury at all, by any emergency room physicians\n   in her visits to Nason or the MUSC ER. But, according to Dr. White, the peer-reviewed literature in the field is clear that mild traumatic brain injuries\"can be overlooked,\" even by emergency room physicians. Tr. 36:2-5. Furthermore, in none of the medical visits that Ray had in the immediate aftermath of the incident did she have any cognitive testing done that would have detected such cases of traumatic brain injury. Tr. 52:11-60:4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   9. Dr. Kurtzman, a psychiatrist who examined Ray on May 1st before the incident, indicated that Ray was working on her graduate thesis and had no \"uncontrolled anxiety or crying spells.\" This psychiatric record is closest in proximity to the incident. Tr. 14:13-15:11. Dr. Kurtzman's psychiatric record further indicates that as of May 1st, Ray was a \"student, working doing marketing, volunteering, and doing research-all while supporting herself financially.\" Tr. 15:12-20. In his treatment notes for Ray after the incident, Dr. Kurtzman stated that Ray had \"suffered...emotionally and physically from an injury sustained from being hit by a sailboat boom...I'm concerned about her emotional prognosis and her emotional upset secondary to the accident.\" Tr. 23:6-24:4. Dr. Kurtzman also prescribed Ray the medication Adderall, which Dr. White testified is an \"amphetamine stimulant\" that is \"used for patients with [traumatic brain injury ] who are having difficulty concentrating.\" Tr. 24:5-15. Concentration and attention problems such as those treated with Adderall are consistent with the diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury, Dr. White testified. Tr. 24:16. Dr. White further testified that during his examination and interview with Ray, she stated that she experienced those symptoms for the first time after the date of the incident. Tr. 24:19-22. Ray testified that she had never been prescribed Adderall or psychostimulants before the incident. Tr. 101:14-102:7. At the direction of her doctor, Ray has been taking Adderall in increasing doses since the incident. Tr. 126:22-11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   10. The court acknowledges that prior to the incident, Ray was on the medication Klonopin to treat anxiety. Tr. 16:2-9. However, Dr. Kurtzman was on a successful program to wean Ray off of Klonopin. Tr. 16:10-16. Ray testified that she was in the process of \"taper[ing] off\" the anti-anxiety medication. Tr. 102:16-103:4. The court also acknowledges that Ray suffered from general anxiety disorder, which can have symptoms similar to those found in someone with a concussion. Relatedly, the court has considered Ray's testimony about the circumstances of her unfortunate upbringing, including her time in foster care and her intermittent history with prescribed antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication. Tr. 92:1-99:3. The court credits Dr. White's opinion-that the temporal relationship between the incident and the onset of symptoms supports a finding that Ray was not suffering from her historical general anxiety disorder, but from the head trauma she received as a result of the incident. Tr. 48:4-20.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   11. Ray was seen by Dr. Woodard, a neurologist at MUSC, \"several months\" after the incident. Dr. Woodard also diagnosed Ray as having postconcussion syndrome, and placed her on gabapentin and\n   nortriptyline. Nortriptyline is used to treat headaches, while gabapentin is used to treat headaches, mood disturbances, and sleep. Tr. 20:12-21:14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   12. On July 28, 2015, Ray had neuropsychological testing, which discerns whether there are \"cognitive or emotional deficits related to injury\" performed by Dr. Randolph Waid. Tr. 25:1-14. Specifically, Dr. Waid employed the Conners Continuous Performance Test II to assess Ray's \"attentional abilities.\" Tr. 25:14-24. Based on Ray's pre-incident level of functioning, Dr. Waid felt that Ray's concentration abilities, which were in the ninth percentile, were low. Tr. 26:2-5. Ray had a \"very high GPA\" in her college and graduate work before the incident. Tr. 26:11-12. Ray had a 3.7 GPA at the College of Charleston. Tr. 101:5-7. The cause of the decrease in Ray's attention between college and the day that Dr. Waid performed his neurophysical testing was, in Dr. White's opinion, the traumatic brain injury that she suffered as a result of the incident. Tr. 26:15-18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   13. Ray also saw Dr. Jeffrey Buncher for injuries related to the incident. Ray had pain management issues before the incident, specifically with chronic neck and back pain. Ex. 8. But Ray's pain problems with her sacrum were, in Dr. White's opinion, \"exacerbated\" by the incident. Tr. 27:1-21.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   14.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Based on the testimony of all of Lesniak's crew members and all experts, including Ray's expert Captain Wahl, Lesniak was negligent in doing a gybe maneuver when he and his crew members knew or should have known that Ray was sitting in front of the main sheet which is a dangerous place to sit. Prior to undertaking the gybe maneuver during the sailboat race, Lesniak had a duty to: (1) properly administer safety briefings to Ray that included where the safe places to sit on the boat were during the race; (2) warn Ray that the gybe maneuver was going to be undertaken; (3) not gybe until Ray was no longer sitting in front of the main sheet; and (4) not hit Ray with the main sheet rope during the gybe maneuver. A failure to follow safety precautions, including telling Ray where to move and delaying the gybe maneuver until Ray had moved to a safe place, was a breach of Lesniak's duty to Ray. The court further finds that it was completely foreseeable to Lesniak that Ray could be injured by his failure to warn her that a gybe maneuver was going to be undertaken that would involve moving the main sheet that she was sitting directly in front of, and his failure to prevent the main sheet from hitting Ray. Lesniak's negligence was a proximate cause of Ray's injuries; but for this breach of duty, Ray's injuries would not have occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   However, Lesniak has presented sufficient evidence to support the allegation in his Answer that Ray was comparatively negligent. Specifically, Ray failed to pay attention to warnings from multiple crew members to move from her position in front of the main sheet rope. Ray was to\n   blame, in part, for being hit by the main sheet. The court finds that Ray was 25% to blame, and so reduces her damages by 25%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As a direct result of Lesniak's failure to exercise the proper degree of skill required, Ray sustained injuries and damages, as discussed below. In making the above findings of fact, reference has been made to pertinent portions of the testimony and exhibits introduced into evidence; however, the court has taken into consideration all of the evidence presented. The court specifically finds the evidence, after considering the appearance, demeanor and qualifications of the witnesses and the testimony as a whole, supports each of its findings by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Ray was Lesniak's passenger and guest. Although Lesniak designated his crewmembers to administer safety instructions to the passengers, as captain, Lesniak was ultimately responsible for the safety of the crewmembers and guests. Thus, Lesniak owed Ray a duty to maintain a proper lookout at all times during the Celadon's outing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Breach\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Ray offered the testimony of Captain Wahl as her liability expert with regard to safe vessel operation. Captain Wahl has extensive knowledge about the safe operation of vessels. He obtained this knowledge from his many years of personally operating vessels, obtaining credentials, holding an array of maritime positions, authoring several books, and teaching well over 18,000 students in the subject. The court finds the testimony of Captain Wahl to be credible. Lesniak offered no liability expert at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Captain Wahl testified that as the captain of the Celadon at the time of the incident, good seamanship practices required Lesniak to have the ultimate responsibility to look out for persons aboard his vessel-even if he delegated some of those responsibilities to crew members. Wahl testified that this ultimate responsibility includes providing adequate instructions, warnings, guidance, or lessons to all passengers, including late arriving ones, regarding the potential dangers of movement and position on his vessel and how to\n   avoid those dangers. He also testified that looking out for passengers aboard a vessel includes refraining from performing a gybe maneuver until ensuring that all of the passengers are seated safely out of the path of the boom and its related parts such as the main sheet. Captain Wahl further testified that, even if a passenger is told verbally to move from a certain spot before a maneuver is performed, it would be a best practice to physically ensure that the person, especially if that person is a novice passenger with no sailing experience, has been moved to a safer place on the sailboat before proceeding to perform the maneuver. It is also Captain Wahl's opinion that only highly experienced persons should be aboard for racing events, because inexperienced persons may not be able to handle the fast-paced activities normally observed during competitive sailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The court finds that Lesniak failed to act as a prudent mariner in failing to: (1) provide adequate posted, written, or verbal warnings to Ray regarding the potential dangers of movement and position on the Celadon and how to avoid those dangers; and (2) in failing to make sure that his passengers were in a safe location at all times, especially before performing a gybe maneuver which causes the boom and its related parts to swing quickly from port to starboard or vice versa. The court finds that these acts and omissions constitute a breach of Rule 5 of the Inland Navigation Rules, the common-law lookout duty, and the general duty of due care under Admiralty and South Carolina law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c.

Ray admits that she was aware of potential dangers on the Celadon, and that she was told to \"get closer together\" and to \"get more neighborly\" in the moments immediately before the main sheet hit her. Lesniak and all four members of his crew who testified at trial indicated that there was a safety protocol, that Becker, an individual with sixty plus years of sailing experience, and her fellow crew member Truog, were delegated the duty of administering safety instructions and watching out for new, inexperienced passengers. Becker and Truog testified at trial that these were duties bestowed by their captain, Lesniak, and that they had a present-day recollection of communicating with Ray directly. The court further finds that Ray did not follow the instructions to move. Thus, Ray failed to take responsibility for herself, a duty which is imposed under the law.

The court is convinced that Dr. White's written report and opinion of Ray's permanent injury gave Lesniak adequate notice that Ray would need continued medical evaluation and treatment for her condition for the rest of her life. Ray disclosed Dr. White as an expert in neurological medicine and pain management in compliance with all relevant expert disclosure requirements and deadlines. Lesniak made the decision to decline to take Dr. White's deposition, offer his own medical expert disputing the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury or offer an alternative future treatment plan, or to request any additional information from Dr. White regarding his evaluation of Ray. At the very least, Lesniak was on notice that as a result of the incident, Ray had already spent a significant amount of money on medical treatment including $2,255.70 on medication alone.
