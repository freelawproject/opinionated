(Dkt. 1 at 11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, which is the operative pleading in this\n   action, increasing the amount of damages alleged from $75,000.00 to $125,000.00. (Dkt. 21 at 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 at 11). Specifically, Plaintiff claims that on April 13, 2005, he was scheduled for transport from the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility (the \"Facility\") in Batavia, New York, where he was detained, to a court proceeding at the federal courthouse in Rochester, New York. (Dkt. 21 at 6). The United States Marshals Service (the \"USMS\") was responsible for transporting Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The USMS used a black 2001 Ford Expedition (the \"Expedition\" or the \"Vehicle\") for court transport. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Generally, the USMS deputies escorted prisoners into the Expedition through its rear passenger-side door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Plaintiff, on this occasion the USMS deputies told him to enter the Vehicle through the rear driver-side door so that they would avoid the inconvenience of having to reset a loose piece of weather stripping that hung over the rear passenger-side door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7). Plaintiff, who was handcuffed and secured by a waist chain and ankle shackles, alleges that he attempted to climb into the Vehicle through the rear driver-side door. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202671\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202671\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Expedition's second-row seating contained a 70/30 foldable split-bench seat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Plaintiff alleges that in order for him to reach the third row via the rear driver-side door, the USMS deputies had to fold down the 70% portion of the split-bench seat (the \"three-quarters seat\"), and then Plaintiff had to climb over it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202671\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202671\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Had Plaintiff entered through the rear passenger-side door, the USMS deputies could have folded down the 30% portion of the split-bench seat (the \"one-quarter seat\") and rotated it forward to permit unimpeded walkable access to the third row. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that as he began to climb over the three-quarters seat, his \"right foot and/or leg chain [became] caught on the back of the folded down (but not slid [sic] forward) second row seat causing him to trip and fall.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). Plaintiff landed on his left elbow, which he claims caused him injury to his left shoulder, including a possible torn rotator cuff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff claims that had the USMS deputies acted with reasonable diligence by resetting the loose weather stripping and directing him through the rear passenger-side door, he would not have had to climb over the three-quarters seat and would not have injured himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The most critical distinction between Plaintiff's account of the accident and the Government's version is Plaintiff's point of entry into the Vehicle. Whereas Plaintiff contends he was instructed to enter the Vehicle through the rear driver-side door, the Government maintains that Plaintiff, in fact, entered through the rear passenger-side door. After considering all of the evidence, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to carry his burden, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Government was negligent in loading him into the Vehicle. This Decision and Order constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on January 24, 2007, by filing a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Complaint, alleging a cause of action pursuant to the FTCA. (Dkt. 1). Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, the operative pleading, on September 6, 2007. (Dkt. 21). On September 20, 2007, the Government filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Dkt. 22). Specifically, the Government argued that Plaintiff's claim fell within the \"discretionary function\" exception to FTCA liability. (Dkt. 23 at 5-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 5, 2008, United States Magistrate Judge H. Kenneth Schroeder,\n   Jr. recommended that the Government's motion be denied. (Dkt. 31). Judge Schroeder stated that in \"[a]ccepting [P]laintiff's allegations as true,\" he must conclude that the USMS \"compromised [P]laintiff's safety to avoid pushing the loose weather-stripping back into place before closing the door,\" and that \"such a decision would not be based upon considerations of public policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). As such, Judge Schroeder determined that Plaintiff's claims fell within the so-called \"negligent guard\" theory of liability, which precluded the application of the discretionary function exception. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Neither the Government nor Plaintiff timely filed any objections, and, on November 28, 2008, United States District Judge Richard J. Acara issued an Order adopting Judge Schroeder's Report and Recommendation. (Dkt. 32). On January 22, 2009, the Government filed an Answer to the Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 35).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After discovery was completed, this case was reassigned to the undersigned for all further proceedings on January 30, 2015. (Dkt. 167). A bench trial commenced on August 21, 2017, and continued through August 23, 2017. (Dkt. 214; Dkt. 217). Prior to the commencement of the bench trial, the Government filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   -which remains pending-seeking to limit the amount of damages Plaintiff could be awarded if he carried his burden of proof on liability. (Dkt. 206).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the bench trial, Plaintiff submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on December 18, 2017. (Dkt. 222). The Government submitted its responsive proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on February 9, 2018. (Dkt. 224). Plaintiff submitted his reply papers on February 23, 2018. (Dkt. 227).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following section constitutes the Court's Findings of Fact pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(1).

On that date, Deputy United States Marshals Paul L. Nielsen, Jr. (\"Deputy Nielsen\") and David L. Say, Jr. (\"Deputy Say\") (collectively, \"the Deputies\"), secured Plaintiff at the Facility for transportation to a court appearance scheduled for 2:30 P.M. before United States Magistrate Judge Marian W. Payson at the United States District Court for the Western District of New York in Rochester, New York. Plaintiff was transported in the Expedition, which bore the license plate number \"ATM 6209\" and the VIN number \"1FMPU16LB04315,\" and which was owned by the USMS. The parties also stipulate that the accident occurred at the Facility as Plaintiff, who was handcuffed and shackled at his ankles and waist, entered the Expedition. At the time of the accident, Deputy Say and Deputy Nielsen were present and were working within the scope of their employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Credibility\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Resolution of the legal issues in this matter cannot be achieved without first making credibility determinations. Since Plaintiff was the only fact witness called to testify on his behalf, this case hinges upon the Court's assessment of Plaintiffs credibility. Although Deputy Nielsen's credibility was not left unscathed after the conclusion of cross-examination, the Court ultimately finds him to be a more credible witness than Plaintiff, and thus, credits his account of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Deputy Nielsen\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It appeared evident to the Court that Deputy Nielsen's memory of the accident had dulled over the twelve years that had passed since its occurrence. Although Deputy Nielsen testified that Plaintiff proceeded through the rear passenger-side door (Dkt. 219 at 284:18-25, 285:1-9), he could not recall whether he or Deputy Say had lifted and rotated the one-quarter seat to permit Plaintiff access to the third row (Dkt. 220 at 318:15-17). Deputy Nielsen could not remember exactly where Deputy Say was positioned in relation to the Vehicle at the time Plaintiff fell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 320:2-7). Until Deputy Nielsen was cross-examined with his own sworn declaration, he also could not recall exactly where Plaintiff landed when he fell in the Vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 342:14-20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 372-74). Furthermore, there were several instances during his testimony where it was unclear whether Deputy Nielsen was describing the standard operating procedures attendant to court transportation in general, or whether he was testifying as to the specific events of April 13, 2005, based upon his own independent recollection. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 320:21-25, 321:1-19, 335:9-25, 336:1-22, 347-49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Despite having trouble recalling certain facts surrounding the accident, Deputy Nielsen was resolute in testifying that Plaintiff entered the rear passenger-side door of the Vehicle (Dkt. 219 at 284:18-25, 285:1-9; Dkt. 220 at 350:12-17), and, when confronted on cross-examination, he confirmed that he held an independent recollection of the one-quarter seat being \"flipped up\" on April 13, 2005 (Dkt. 220 at 320:25, 321:1-19). Deputy Nielsen affirmed this recollection on redirect examination as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 350:22-25, 351:1-7). Deputy Nielsen also testified that he had an independent recollection of pushing the loose\n   weather stripping back into place within the rear passenger-side door on the date of the accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 329:12-15, 330:18-23). This action would not have been necessary had Plaintiff entered the Vehicle through the rear driver-side door. Based upon the Court's observations of Deputy Nielsen at trial, including his demeanor and conduct, as well as his testimony, the Court finds Deputy Nielsen's account of the April 13, 2005, accident to be largely credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In his reply papers, Plaintiff argues that, based upon Deputy Nielsen's own testimony, it would have been impossible for Plaintiff to have entered the rear passenger-side door and fall in a manner that permitted him to \"strike his left elbow on the upright portion of the middle seat.\" (Dkt. 227 at \u00b6 27). This is because the \"upright portion of the second row seat would have been on [Plaintiff's] right side and not his left side.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court disagrees with Plaintiff's assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Deputy Nielsen testified that he observed Plaintiff enter through the rear passenger-side door and step forward into the Vehicle-positioning the unlatched and folded-up one-quarter seat to Plaintiff's right-hand side. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 220 at 324:1-25, 325:1-3, 333:22-25, 340:9-19). At this point, the three-quarters seat remained in an upright position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 338:23-25, 339:1-2). Deputy Nielsen also testified that when Plaintiff fell, he did not simply fall straight towards the third-row seat; he also\n   <em>\n    twisted\n   </em>\n   himself and placed his elbow out in order to break his fall. (Dkt. 219 at 285:18-25; Dkt. 220 at 341:3). The Court does not accept Plaintiff's view that it was impossible for Plaintiff to have struck his left elbow on the upright three-quarters seat as recounted by Deputy Nielsen. Rather, crediting Deputy Nielsen's description of the fall, with Plaintiff twisting himself in an effort to catch his fall, Plaintiff could have fallen in a manner consistent with his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In assessing Plaintiff's credibility, the Court finds that his trial testimony was marred by several inconsistencies. For example, Plaintiff testified that he reported his alleged shoulder injury just three days after the accident occurred. (Dkt. 218 at 48:1-3). However, no medical record in evidence appears to document such a visit, which would have occurred on April 16, 2005. In fact, the first medical record noting any bodily complaint or evaluation of Plaintiff's shoulder was dated May 4, 2005 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Government's Trial Exhibit 430 at 1018)-three weeks after the injury allegedly occurred. In addition, a medical record entry, dated April 19, 2005, indicates that Plaintiff \"placed a sick call slip to receive vitamins,\" but it lacks any notation pertaining to complaints of shoulder pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Accordingly, the Court questions the veracity of Plaintiff's trial testimony in which he describes significant pain arising soon after the accident occurred. (Dkt. 218 at 47:18-25, 48:8-12). Plaintiff further explained that he waited to report his injury for the purported three-day duration because he was \"not one that likes to go to doctors or deal with the medical\" staff at the Facility. (Dkt. 218 at 48:5-7;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 105:6-12). Yet, Plaintiff also testified that he had visited medical personnel \"multiple times\" before the accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105:13-25, 106:1-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff further testified that the only reason the Deputies directed him to enter the Vehicle through the rear driver-side door was to avoid having to set the weather stripping back into place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:8-17, 81:25, 82:1-9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff confirmed that\n   the weather stripping was a constant problem and that despite this issue, the usual process before April 13, 2005-and in every instance thereafter-was for the Deputies to load the prisoners through the rear passenger-side door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29, 30:1-7, 81:16-24, 83:12-20). Plaintiff provides no persuasive explanation for why-on this single occasion-the Deputies decided to deviate from this procedure. Indeed, there is no logical explanation in the record to support any such deviation. It simply does not make sense that an alternative, more cumbersome means of egress into the Vehicle would have been selected on the date in question, all to avoid the relatively simple task of adjusting the weather stripping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   There is some suggestion in the trial record that the Deputies were in a hurry to secure Plaintiff for his court proceeding on the morning of the accident. Deputy Nielsen testified that he and Deputy Say performed two court trips from the Facility on April 13, 2005. (Dkt. 219 at 283:7-25, 302:19-23, 303:1-7). According to Deputy Nielsen, the Deputies failed to secure Plaintiff for transport on the first trip, which he explained may have been due to the fact that Plaintiff's court hearing had been rescheduled from April 14, 2005, to April 13,2005. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 220 at 355:24-25, 356-357). As a result, Deputy Nielsen testified that the Deputies felt a sense of \"urgency\" in returning to the Facility to secure Plaintiff for a second trip back to the federal courthouse in Rochester. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 330:25, 331:1-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   However, there is no indication that any initial untimeliness caused the Deputies to alter the standard process for transporting prisoners on April 13, 2005. Plaintiff even acknowledges that it would have taken the Deputies a matter of seconds to reset the weather stripping. (Dkt. 21 at 8 (alleging that it would take \"10 to 15 seconds ... to press the loose section of weather striping [sic] back into place after using the passenger-side door\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 220 at 351:20-25 (Deputy Nielsen testifying that it would take only \"[s]econds\" to reset the loose weather stripping), 366:12-15 (same) ). This fact is consistent with Deputy Nielsen's testimony that it would make little sense to require a restrained prisoner to climb through the rear driver-side door even if they were in a hurry, because to do so would take longer and cause greater difficulty than simply resetting the weather stripping. (Dkt. 220 at 360:1-20). Furthermore, Deputy Nielsen clarified that the procedures for prisoner transportation were followed in every instance where a prisoner was secured for court transport, and thus, time could only be \"made up\" while in-transit and not during the loading procedures undertaken at the Facility. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 358:14-25, 359:1-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is also undisputed that Plaintiff was handcuffed and secured by a waist chain (Dkt. 218 at 22:6-10, 16-21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Court Exhibit 1 at \u00b6 3), and that this was the standard procedure when transporting prisoners to court (Dkt. 219 at 264:25, 265:1-10; Dkt. 220 at 334:9-19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Trial Exhibit 1 (USMS Directive on the use of restraining devices) ). Although Plaintiff testified that it was the usual practice for the Deputies to either reset the weather stripping themselves or to instruct an inmate do so (Dkt. 218 at 81:16-19), Plaintiff also confirmed that he could only move his hands a \"couple inches\" while restrained by the waist chain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:18-25), Plaintiff's testimony regarding his freedom of motion is consistent with Deputy Nielsen's testimony that prisoners were never asked to reset the weather stripping because the\n   waist chain prevented them from reaching much higher than breast level. (Dkt. 219 at 266:17-25, 267:1, 275:8-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court also notes that the Expedition was equipped with a running board, which provided an extra step to assist one's entry into the passenger compartment of the Vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 218 at 38:25, 39:1-11). This fact appears inconsistent with Plaintiff's testimony that Deputy Nielsen used a milk crate as an extra step to assist with entry into the Expedition. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:5-9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 219 at 281:12-25, 282:1-6 (Deputy Nielsen testifying that a milk crate was not used to assist entry into the Vehicle because it was equipped with a running board) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the Government elicited the fact that there had been a judicial finding of perjury with respect to Plaintiff in a prior proceeding. (Dkt. 218 at 121-29). Specifically, Plaintiff testified that United States District Judge Charles J. Siragusa found that he had \"submitted false statements and testimony to the Court\" in a prior proceeding relating to his past criminal matter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129:18-21). The Court notes that Judge Siragusa's Decision and Order was not entered into evidence at trial, and the Court does not rely upon it in making this credibility determination. However, Plaintiff's testimony that he was found to have committed perjury is relevant to the Court's determination of his credibility in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R.

In evaluating the credibility of the parties, the Court is mindful that the ultimate burden of proof rests with Plaintiff. It was thus incumbent upon Plaintiff to establish his cause of action by a preponderance of the evidence. This Plaintiff failed to do. Accordingly, in setting forth its Conclusions of Law, the Court credits Deputy Nielsen's testimony that he and Deputy Say conducted themselves pursuant to the standard procedures for transporting a prisoner from the Facility to a court appearance, and that Plaintiff entered the rear passenger-side door of the Expedition at the time he fell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Material Facts Underlying the Accident\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On April 13, 2005, the Deputies arrived at the Facility in the Expedition at around 7:00 A.M. to proceed with the scheduled court transport of inmates to the Rochester federal courthouse, (Dkt. 219 at 276:17-24). In general, \"a list of prisoners that would be needed for court the next day would be faxed over to the [F]acility\" the night before, so that it would be clear which prisoners would be prepared for transport. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 263:21-25, 264:1). However,\n   Plaintiff was not named on the initial list for court transport. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 279:21-25, 280:1-9). After checking in at the Facility's guardhouse, and depositing their weapons in the holding area, the Deputies proceeded in the Expedition through the north entrance of the Facility's garage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 255:20-25, 256:1-5, 276:25, 277:1-5). The Deputies then entered the Facility and made their way to the \"processing area,\" where the inmates were searched for weapons and restrained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 277:13-24). Afterwards, the prisoners were escorted out of the Facility and into the garage where the Deputies loaded them into the Vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Deputies exited the garage in the Expedition through the south-facing garage door, and proceeded to Rochester. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 280:10-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After arriving at the federal courthouse and having unloaded the prisoners, the Deputies' supervisor asked whether they had also transported Plaintiff, and the Deputies responded that they had not done so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 283:9-13). The Deputies drove back to the Facility to secure Plaintiff for his afternoon court appearance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 283:20-24). Upon arriving back at the Facility, the Deputies executed the same process they had undergone in securing the first group of prisoners for transport. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 283:25, 284:1-17). Once Plaintiff had been secured from the processing area, he was led out into the garage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 284:10-14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 218 at 25:18-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Expedition was equipped with a barrier that divided the driver compartment from the passenger compartment. (Dkt. 218 at 30:15-23). The Deputies \"were having a private conversation,\" and thus, decided to sit Plaintiff into the third row of the Expedition to place him \"outside of earshot\" of their discussion. (Dkt. 219 at 284:20-24; Dkt. 220 at 359:11-16). In order to do so, Plaintiff entered through the rear passenger-side door. (Dkt. 219 at 284:25, 285:1-10). This was because the one-quarter seat was \"specifically designed for the seat back to flip down on to the base of the seat and then that whole seat, the back and the bottom, were designed to rotate forward.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 271:21-25, 272:1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 218 at 31:17-22). In other words, this mechanism \"would ease access into th[e] third row\" by providing enough room to permit a restrained inmate to \"step into th[e] third row.\" (Dkt. 219 at 272:21-22, 273:1-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   However, the adhesive that held the rear passenger-side door's weather stripping in place had begun to fail, causing anywhere from a \"few inches to 4 to 5 feet\" of the material to hang down over the doorframe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 274:6-25, 309:2-5, 15-20; Dkt. 220 at 328:12-15;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 218 at 29:8-15 (Plaintiff testifying that about \"4 or 5 inches\" of weather stripping would \"sag down\") ). This was a \"regular\" issue when loading prisoners through the rear passenger-side door of the Vehicle. (Dkt. 219 at 275:1-4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 218 at 29:2-7). As a result, a USMS deputy would have to push the weather stripping back into place when this occurred. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 219 at 275:5-19). The process of resetting the weather stripping would take only a matter of \"seconds\" to complete. (Dkt. 220 at 351:20-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On the date of the accident, one of the Deputies opened the rear passenger-side door for Plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 220 at 318:14-16), and then Deputy Nielsen reset the weather stripping above that door (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 329:12-19). One of the Deputies unlatched the one-quarter seat and flipped it up to permit entry into the third row of the Expedition. (Dkt. 219 at 272:2-22; Dkt. 220 at 320:15-19, 321:4-19, 350:22-25, 351:1). As Plaintiff entered the Vehicle, Deputy Nielsen stood about three or five feet behind him. (Dkt. 220 at 318:21-25, 319:1 -6). Plaintiff placed one foot on the Expedition's running board and was stepping inside the Vehicle with his other foot when\n   he slipped and fell (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 325:15-23)-twisting himself and hitting his left elbow on the upright three-quarters seat in an effort to break his fall (Dkt. 219 at 285:18-25; Dkt. 220 at 341:3-18). Plaintiff \"picked himself up\" and moved into the third row seat. (Dkt. 219 at 286:22-24; Dkt. 220 at 343:14-16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 218 at 46:1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff's fall \"startled\" Deputy Nielsen (Dkt. 220 at 343:19), who had \"never seen anybody actually do that\" (Dkt. 219 at 287:1-2). Deputy Say asked Plaintiff if he was all right and whether he wanted to see the medical staff, but Plaintiff responded with an \"expletive\" and said, \"just take me to court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 287:18-24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 218 at 47:4-9 (Plaintiff testifying that the Deputies asked if \"it was bad,\" and Plaintiff responded, \"I don't think so\") ). Deputy Nielsen then \"secured the seat\" and \"closed the door\" before entering the Vehicle. (Dkt. 219 at 287:25, 288:1). Before leaving the Facility, Deputy Say again asked Plaintiff whether he wanted to see the medical staff, and, again, Plaintiff responded that he \"just wanted to go to court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 288:2-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Deputies proceeded to transport Plaintiff to the federal courthouse in Rochester. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 288:12-18). When they arrived, Deputy Nielsen informed his supervisor of the incident, and made mention that they should expect a lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 292:9-12; Dkt. 220 at 361:17-22). Deputy Nielsen's testimony indicated that this comment was based upon his understanding that Plaintiff had filed previous lawsuits.

Put differently, by instructing a shackled inmate to enter the Vehicle's third row by climbing through the driver-side rear passenger door, over the folded-down three-quarters seat, instead of through the designed means of egress through the rear passenger-side door, the USMS deputies would have \"enhanced the risk [that a plaintiff] faced, created a new risk [or] induced [a plaintiff] to forego some opportunity to avoid risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Gauthier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"114097,114524\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/306/850/\">\n    306 A.D.2d at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"114524\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/306/850/114524/\">\n    762 N.Y.S.2d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Heard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2355942\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/82/66/#p72\">\n    82 N.Y.2d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2355942\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/82/66/#p72\">\n    603 N.Y.S.2d 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2355942\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/82/66/#p72\">\n    623 N.E.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). However, in crediting Deputy Nielsen's testimony that Plaintiff entered the Vehicle through the rear passenger-side door, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Deputies breached any assumed duty to protect him against reasonably foreseeable harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   There is no evidence that restrained prisoners frequently fell while entering the Expedition through the rear passenger-side door, and Deputy Nielsen's surprise after the accident occurred suggests that this was an unusual occurrence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 219 at 287:1-2; Dkt. 220 at 343:19-24). Furthermore, as Plaintiff acknowledges, the primary factual dispute on the issue of negligence is whether Plaintiff entered through the rear driver-side door or the rear passenger-side door. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 227 at \u00b6 24 (\"In determining the issue of negligence it would appear the only significant fact differing between [Plaintiff]'s testimony and [Deputy] Nielsen's testimony is whether [Plaintiff] entered the transport Expedition from the rear driver's side door or rear passenger door.\") ). Having determined that Plaintiff entered through the rear passenger-side door, and in light of the parties' agreement that entry through that door is the appropriate method of reaching the third row (Dkt. 222 at \u00b6 21; Dkt. 224 at 17), the Court finds no indication that the Deputies breached their duty of care towards Plaintiff in doing so. In other words, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that it was reasonably foreseeable that he would fall while entering the Vehicle through the rear passenger-side door. Accordingly, to the extent that Plaintiff's assertion of negligence is based upon the method of entry into the Expedition, Plaintiff's claim fails on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiff also makes a brief, but related argument that Deputy Nielsen \"failed to position himself in such a way\" as to adequately assist Plaintiff in entering the Vehicle. (Dkt. 227 at 8). New York negligence law recognizes a cause of action against a private individual for the \"failure to act\" as a reasonably prudent person under like or similar circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157220\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/502/#p525\">\n    133 F.Supp.3d at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"New York law recognizes 'failure to act' negligence claims.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Hove\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"389725\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/288/927/#p927\">\n    288 A.D.2d at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"389725\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/288/927/#p927\">\n    732 N.Y.S.2d 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a defendant's \"failure to act\" could form the basis for liability under the assumed duty theory if it \"placed the plaintiff in a more vulnerable position than if the obligation had not been assumed\"). Plaintiff relies on Deputy Nielsen's testimony that he did not stand \"close enough to the [V]ehicle to help [Plaintiff] if he slipped or fell.\" (Dkt. 220 at 337:10-14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 227 at \u00b6 30). The Court notes that even though Deputy Nielsen testified that he did not recall rendering any aid to Plaintiff as Plaintiff entered the Expedition (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 337:6-9), Plaintiff testified that Deputy Nielsen held onto his elbow as he entered the Vehicle (Dkt. 218 at 35:12-13). Indeed, Plaintiff explained that \"you can only go in about on the first step of the seat before you're too far away for them to hold on to.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:13-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiff did not present any evidence at trial to establish that had Deputy Nielsen stood closer to the Expedition, he would have been able to prevent Plaintiff from slipping or falling. Moreover, Plaintiff also failed to present any evidence that Deputy Nielsen did not exercise reasonable care under the circumstances by standing only several feet from the Expedition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 220 at 318:21-25, 319:1-3, 336:2-18 (Deputy Nielsen testifying that he would sometimes assist prisoners carry personal items, such as their lunches, if they appeared to be struggling, and that he had\n   no recollection of Plaintiff struggling on the morning of the accident); 320:12-14 (Deputy Nielsen testifying that he was watching Plaintiff \"as he loaded into the [V]ehicle\") ). There is simply no proof in the trial record to suggest that Deputy Nielsen's position in relation to the Vehicle \"enhanced the risk\" that Plaintiff faced, \"created a new risk,\" or \"induced [Plaintiff] to forego some opportunity to avoid [a] risk\" of injury that he otherwise faced while entering the Vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Gauthier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"114097,114524\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/306/850/\">\n    306 A.D.2d at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"114524\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/306/850/114524/\">\n    762 N.Y.S.2d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malpeli v.
