After considering the motion, briefs, pleadings, and\n   evidence, the court\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   Defendant Derick Evans's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 57) and\n   <strong>\n    dismisses with prejudice\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's claim against Derick Evans (\"Evans\") in his individual capacity based on Plaintiff Norvis Harmon's (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Harmon\") alleged right to petition or appeal the termination of his employment, whether premised on retaliation in violation of the First Amendment's Petition Clause, denial of equal protection, or violations of state and local law (\"Petition Claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because the court's ruling rests in part on its determination as to which claims by Plaintiff are before the court and remain after the court's March 31, 2017 memorandum opinion and order, the court addresses in detail the allegations in Plaintiff's pleadings regarding Plaintiff's Petition Claim and how this claim, which was originally pleaded as a constitutional claim involving the denial of equal protection,\n   <em>\n    morphed and expanded\n   </em>\n   over the course of this litigation into a constitutional claim for alleged violations of the First Amendment right to petition, and, most recently, into a claim encompassing alleged violations of Plaintiff's statutory grievance rights under Texas Government Code \u00a7 617.005 and Dallas County Code Chapter 86. For the reasons herein explained, the court determines that Plaintiff's Petition Claim, brought pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is either not properly before the court because it was not included in Plaintiff's pleadings, was abandoned by Plaintiff, or fails as a matter of law, regardless of whether it is characterized as a claim based on the denial of equal protection, retaliation in violation of the First Amendment's Petition Clause, or violations of statutory grievance rights under Texas Government Code \u00a7 617.005 and Dallas County Code Chapter 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Harmon brought this action against Defendants Dallas County, Texas (\"Dallas County\" or \"the County\") and former Dallas County Constable Evans (collectively, \"Defendants\") on June 3, 2013. Harmon was previously employed by Dallas County in Constable Office, Precinct 1, as a deputy constable. His employment was terminated on June 3, 2011. The termination of his employment is the subject of this lawsuit, as well as a prior state court action filed by Harmon and two other deputy constables against Dallas County on September 9, 2011, in the 44th Judicial District Court, Dallas County, Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the state court action, Harmon and the other plaintiffs asserted claims for alleged violations of the Texas Whistleblower Act (\"TWA\") and Texas Local Government Code \u00a7 617.004, and an equal protection claim for alleged violations of the Texas Constitution. On March 28, 2012, the Whistleblower claim, equal protection claim, and claim for alleged violations of Texas Government Code 617.005 brought by Harmon in the state court action were dismissed with prejudice. In this federal action, Harmon originally asserted two claims against Defendants, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for alleged constitutional violations based on the denial of equal protection to petition the government and retaliation in violation of his First Amendment right to free speech. In his Complaint, Harmon refers to these claims as his \"Denial of Equal Protection\" claim and \"Free Speech Claim.\" Pl.'s Compl. 4, 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First Amendment \"Free Speech Claim\" Included in Plaintiff's Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his Complaint, Plaintiff refers to his claim against Defendants under the First Amendment for alleged retaliation as his\n   \"Free Speech Claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regarding his Free Speech Claim, Harmon alleges in his Complaint that Defendants retaliated against him in terminating his employment in violation of his First Amendment right to speak out on matters of public concern. Specifically, Harmon contends that he was fired because he reported that Evans and the supervisors under Evans engaged in illegal conduct in requiring deputy constables, including him, to: (1) donate time and money to Evans's re-election campaign; (2) work unpaid for political allies and friends of Evans; and (3) tow citizens' vehicles after traffic stops. In addition, Plaintiff asserts that he reported Evans's illegal conduct in setting traffic citation quotas in violation of Texas Transportation Code \u00a7 720.002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Denial of Equal Protection Claim Based on Right to Petition Included in Plaintiff's Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his Complaint, Plaintiff refers to his claim against Defendants for alleged violations of his \"right to petition the government for redress of grievances\" as his \"Denial of Equal Protection\" claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Harmon alleges that Defendants refused to hear the appeal of his termination through the Dallas County grievance system because he was not employed as a Deputy Constable before August 19, 2003. Defendants do not dispute that Dallas County's formal grievance system applies only to deputy constables hired before August 19, 2003, and Harmon's appeal through Dallas County's formal grievance system was rejected because he was hired after August 19, 2003. Harmon contends that the right to petition the government is a fundamental right, and \"the actions of Defendants [in] depriv[ing] [him] of the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, when such right is granted to other similarly situated employees [deputy constables hired before August 19, 2003], is a denial of [his] right to equal protection of law guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's Rule 7(a) Reply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 7, 2013, Dallas County filed its Answer to Plaintiff's Complaint, asserting, among other things, that Plaintiff's claims against it were barred by res judicata as a result of the state court action. On March 15, 2014, Evans filed his Answer, similarly alleging that Plaintiff's claims against him were barred by res judicata, even though he was not a party to the state court action. Evans's Answer also included the defense of qualified immunity. Evans alleges that Plaintiff's claims against him are barred by qualified immunity because he did not engage in any conduct that could be \"characterized as objectively unreasonable and which all officials in his circumstances would condemn as violative of Constitutional rights.\" Evans's Answer \u00b6 5. On February 26, 2015, former United States Chief Judge Jorge A. Solis (\"Judge Solis\") ordered Plaintiff to file a reply under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 7(a) (\" Rule 7(a) Reply\") regarding \"Defendants' qualified immunity defense[ ]\" by March 18, 2015, and set a deadline for dispositive motions on qualified immunity for April 17, 2015. Order 1 (Doc. 24). On March 18, 2015, Plaintiff filed his Rule 7(a) Reply (Doc. 25) as directed. In his Rule 7(a) Reply, Plaintiff alleges in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. ...Defendant Evans was a Texas peace officer and an elected Constable for Dallas County, Texas when he terminated Harmon for speaking out on matters of public concern. In 2013, the law\n   was clearly established that public employees could not be terminated from their employment for speaking out on matters of public concern. As such, Defendant Evans is not entitled to prevail on his defense of qualified immunity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   30.

Norvis Harmon alleges his termination was a wrongful termination because Defendant Evans terminated Harmon in retaliation for Harmon's speaking to investigators hired by the Dallas County Commissioners Court, for speaking to the special prosecutor and for speaking to other law enforcement personnel about Evans' illegal conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   32. Harmon alleges Defendant Evans' illegal conduct, including his illegal lottery to support his re-election campaign that resulted in Evans' felony conviction, were matters of public concern.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   33. In 2011, every reasonable elected Constable in the State of Texas would have understood that Defendant Evans' conduct was objectively unreasonable as the law was clearly established that public employees cannot be terminated for speaking out on matters of public concern; because the law was clearly established that corruption and illegal conduct by elected officials is a matter of public concern; and because such a termination would and did violate Norvis Harmon's Constitutional rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   34. Defendant Evans claims that Norvis Harmon was terminated due to discrepancies related to a G.P.S. system in the vehicles Harmon used to perform duties serving civil process as a deputy constable, but this purported reason is merely a pretext for Evans' illegal termination of Harmon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   35.

Evans's Motion for Judgment and Plaintiff's Request to Amend his Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On April 17, 2015, Evans moved, based on his defense of qualified immunity, for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) (\"Motion for Judgment\") on Plaintiff's First Amendment \"Free Speech Claim\" claim. In his response to Evans's Motion for Judgment (Doc. 27), Plaintiff sought leave to supplement his Complaint and Rule 7(a) Reply and attached as an exhibit to his response his proposed Supplement to Original Complaint and Rule 7(a) Reply, which supplements the allegations with respect to his Free Speech Claim. Evans's reply in support of his Motion for Judgment does not address Plaintiff's request to supplement his pleadings. On December 1, 2015, Judge Solis entered an order denying Evans's Motion for Judgment. Judge Solis's order does not expressly rule on or address Plaintiff's request for leave, but the order states that the court's ruling is based on the facts in Harmon's Complaint and Rule 7(a) Reply. Order 1 n.1 (Doc. 29). The order contains several citations and references to the factual allegations in \"Doc. 25,\" which is Plaintiff's Rule 7(a) Reply, as well as \"Doc. 27.\" As noted, \"Doc. 27\" is actually Plaintiff's response to the Motion for Judgment, not the proposed supplement that is attached to Plaintiff's response, but it is apparent from Judge Solis's order that his citations to \"Doc. 27\" refer to Plaintiff's proposed supplement\n   (Doc. 27-1). This is the only time Plaintiff requested to amend his pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Partial Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The case was assigned to the undersigned on April 27, 2016, three days before Judge Solis retired. On July 17, 2016, although the deadline set by Judge Solis for filing dispositive motions had expired, the court granted the parties' request to file limited summary judgment motions\n   <em>\n    because the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    parties represented that their motion would significantly narrow and streamline the issues to be\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tried\n   </em>\n   , which was a gross overstatement as evidenced by the three lengthy opinions the court has had to write. In retrospect, the court should have never granted the parties leave, as it only opened a legal and procedural Pandora's box. In their Limited Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 39), Defendants contended that the two claims asserted by Plaintiff in this action based on denial of equal protection and First Amendment free speech/retaliation were barred by res judicata. Plaintiff contended in his partial summary judgment (Doc. 42) that he was entitled to judgment on his equal protection claim against Dallas County because his right to petition the government for redress of grievances is a fundamental right, and Dallas County's ordinance that limits grievance rights to deputy constables hired after August 19, 2013, denied him his right to equal protection of the laws under the United States Constitution and also violated his First Amendment right to petition the government. In support of his equal protection claim, Plaintiff contended that his claim against the County was based on the County's and Evans's conduct in terminating his employment and denying or refusing to hear his petition appealing the termination of his employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Summ. J. Br. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 21, 25 (Doc. 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In response to Plaintiff's summary judgment motion, Defendants asserted that Plaintiff's equal protection claim, whether based on the alleged right to petition the government or the allegedly discriminatory treatment of deputy constables, applied only to the County, not Evans, because the rule that precluded Harmon from appealing the termination of his employment was put in place by the County without input from Evans, and the denial of civil service protection to Harmon occurred because of the County rule and for no other reason. In addition to contending that Plaintiff's two claims were barred by res judicata, Defendants requested that the court treat their response to Plaintiff's summary judgment motion as a cross-motion for summary judgment in the County's favor on the equal protection claim, which the County contended could be decided as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    In\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    his reply brief, Harmon never challenged Defendants' contention that he had only asserted two claims, one for denial of equal protection against the County based on his alleged right to petition or appeal the termination of his employment and one for retaliation in violation of his First Amendment right to free speech against both Defendants; nor did Harmon challenge Defendants' assertion that his equal protection claim was only against the County.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Decision to Revisit the Denial of Evans's Motion for Judgment and Submission of Supplement Briefs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On January 16, 2017, before ruling on the parties' motions for partial summary judgment, the court gave the parties notice of its decision to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   revisit Judge Solis's ruling on Evans's Motion for Judgment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   In reviewing the parties' motions, the court also necessarily reviewed the record in this case, including...Judge Jorge A.

On February 2, 2017, the parties submitted briefing regarding the specific issue raised by the court as to whether the nature of the challenged conduct, with respect to Plaintiff's Free Speech Claim under the First Amendment, was clearly established in the specific context of this case. In addressing the issue raised by the court, Plaintiff advised in his supplemental brief that, in addition to his two claims for denial of equal protection and retaliation in violation of the First Amendment's Speech Clause, he also has a claim against Evans for violation of the First Amendment's Petition Clause that has not yet been challenged by Evans. According to Plaintiff, his First Amendment Petition Claim is based on his allegation that Evans refused to hear his grievance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Harmon alleges Defendant Evans illegally refused to hear Harmon's grievance over his termination, although Dallas County has claimed that all employees of Dallas County have the right to appeal terminations to their department head. While Harmon claims Dallas County's policy denying grievance rights to him and other deputy constables is a denial of equal protection, Harmon separately challenges Evans' refusal to hear his grievance as a violation of his FIRST AMENDMENT petition right that was clearly established in 1984. Evans has not sought a judgment on the FIRST AMENDMENT petition claim. Retaliation claims under the Speech Clause and the Petition Clause are analyzed in the same way. Accordingly, Harmon also shows Evans has no qualified immunity as to the petition claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Wherefore, Harmon shows Judge Solis correctly rejected the qualified immunity defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Pl.'s Supp. Br. on Qualified Immunity 7 (Doc. 54) (internal quotation marks and footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

The court further noted that any claim against Evans under section 1983 in his official capacity arising out of the events at issue in this case would in effect have been a claim against the County that was also barred by res judicata. The court further determined that Evans was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, based on qualified immunity, on Plaintiff's First Amendment Free Speech Claim against in his individual capacity, vacated the portion of Judge Solis's order dealing with his application of the clearly established law standard to this case, and dismissed with prejudice this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Based on its review of Plaintiff's pleadings and the parties' characterization of Plaintiff's claims, the court believed that resolution of the parties' motions on Plaintiff's two claims for denial of equal protection and retaliation in violation of Plaintiff's alleged First Amendment right to free speech disposed of all claims asserted by Plaintiff in this case and expressed surprise as follows regarding Plaintiff's assertion that he had a third \"First Amendment Petition Claim\" against Evans:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   That Plaintiff has a \"First Amendment Petition Claim\" is a surprise to the court, as this is the first time that Plaintiff has mentioned anything about this claim. This is likely the reason why Evans did not previously challenge the claim in his Motion for Judgment based on qualified immunity. As noted, Evans expressed the belief in his Motion for Judgment that Plaintiff's section 1983 claim was based only on alleged equal protection and First Amendment free speech violations. Dallas County and Judge Solis were similarly operating under the assumption that these were Plaintiff's only claims. Judge Solis refers in passing in his December 1, 2015 order to Plaintiff's allegation \"that Evans was fired and refused an appeal of his termination after a GPS audit showed a discrepancy-even though other employees were not fired for this same discrepancy or were at least given an appeal if they were fired,\" but it is clear that he was referring to this allegation in the context of Plaintiff's First Amendment free speech claim. Order 7 (Doc. 29).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, Judge Solis's order requiring Plaintiff to file a Rule 7(a) Reply was limited to \"the issue of Defendants' qualified immunity defenses,\" Order (Doc. 24), and did not grant Plaintiff leave to assert new causes of action or allegations supporting new causes of action. While Judge Solis impliedly granted Plaintiff's request for leave in his response to Evans's Motion for Judgment (Doc. 27), to supplement his Complaint and Rule 7(a) Reply, Plaintiff said nothing in his motion for leave or the proposed\n   supplement to his Complaint and Rule 7(a) Reply about asserting a new cause of action. Further, as noted in the factual background of this opinion, Plaintiff's allegation that he was deprived of a fundamental right to petition the government for redress of grievances was previously made in support of his equal protection claim, not the new \"First Amendment Petition Claim\" alluded to in his Supplemental Brief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Mem. Op. &amp; Order 16-17 (Doc. 55) (quoting J. Solis's Orders (Docs. 24, 29) ). The court went on to note that qualified immunity is \"immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability,\" and qualified immunity questions should, therefore, be determined at the earliest possible stage of litigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

Given the length of time that the case had been pending, the court expressed \"dismay[ ] with Plaintiff's recent assertion regarding a 'First Amendment Petition Claim.' \" Mem. Op. &amp; Order 17. Instead of dismissing this action, the court allowed Evans to file a dispositive motion regarding Plaintiff's new First Amendment Petition Claim. It did so in light of Evans's assertion of qualified immunity, and because it did not believe, based on the record in this case, that Dallas County or Evans was aware that Plaintiff was asserting a First Amendment Petition Claim against Evans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Evans's Summary Judgment Motion (Qualified Immunity as to Plaintiff's First Amendment Petition Claim)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On April 26, 2017, Evans moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff's First Amendment Petition Claim. As noted below and discussed more fully herein, Plaintiff contends in response to Evans's summary judgment motion that, in addition to his First Amendment Petition Claim, he has other \"petition claims\" claims remaining against Evans in his individual capacity. Briefing on this summary judgment motion by Evans was complete on May 30, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Plaintiff's Motion to Recuse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On May 30, 2017, Plaintiff filed his Motion to Recuse, which was denied by the court on August 8, 2017. In his Motion to Recuse, Plaintiff disagreed with the court's characterization of his First Amendment Petition Claim and contended that this claim was not new.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff makes a similar argument in response to Evans's summary judgment motion, contending that the facts alleged in his Complaint and Rule 7(a) Reply regarding his equal protection claim also support a First Amendment Petition Claim, and the same conduct constitutes a denial of equal protection and violation of his First Amendment right to petition the government. In addition to responding to Evans's summary judgment arguments regarding his remaining First Amendment Petition Claim, Plaintiff contends that Evans's refusal to hear his grievance also constitutes a denial of equal protection and \"violated [his] statutory grievance rights under TEXAS GOVERNMENT CODE \u00a7 617.005 and DALLAS COUNTY CODE Ch. 86.\" Pl.'s Summ. J. Resp. 17-18. In light of these arguments by Plaintiff, the court noted in its opinion on Plaintiff's Motion to Recuse that it appeared Plaintiff\n   might now be contending that he has additional individual capacity petition claims remaining against Evans, aside from his First Amendment Petition Claim, that are not barred by qualified immunity. The court indicated in its opinion on the Motion to Recuse that it would address this issue and the parties' arguments made with respect to Evans's pending summary judgment on Plaintiff's First Amendment Petition Claim by separate order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First Amendment Petition Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As noted, shortly before this case was set for trial, the court granted the parties' request to file limited motions for summary judgment that, according to the parties,\n   would narrow the issues to be tried. In reviewing the parties' summary judgment motions and the record in this case, the court also decided to revisit Judge Solis's denial of Evans's Motion for Judgment on Plaintiff's First Amendment Free Speech Claim and ordered supplemental briefing by the parties. In his supplemental brief, Harmon contended that, even if the court determined that Evans was entitled to qualified immunity on his First Amendment free speech/retaliation claim, he still had a \"petition claim\" for violation of his \"First Amendment petition right\" that remained against Evans and had not been challenged by him. Pl.'s Supp. Br. \u00b6 12 (footnotes omitted). To demonstrate in his Supplemental Brief on Qualified Immunity that he had pleaded a \"petition claim\" against Evans in his individual capacity for violation of his \"First Amendment petition right,\" Plaintiff cited paragraph 38 of his Rule 7(a) Reply, which states: \"Defendant Evans illegally refused to hear Harmon's grievance over his termination, although Dallas County has claimed that all employees of Dallas County have the right to appeal terminations to their department head.\" Pl.'s Rule 7(a) Reply \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Evans was permitted to and did move for summary judgment on what Plaintiff referred to in his Supplemental Brief on Qualified Immunity (Doc. 54) as his First Amendment Petition Claim under section 1983. Because the court expressed surprise to learn that Plaintiff had a claim, other than the claims pleaded in his Complaint for retaliation in violation of the First Amendment Free Speech Clause and denial of equal protection based on Plaintiff's alleged right to petition or appeal the termination of his employment, the parties dedicated a fair amount of argument in their summary judgment briefs on Plaintiff's First Amendment Petition Claim to the issue of whether Plaintiff had actually pleaded a claim against Evans personally for violating of his \"First Amendment petition right.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/#p308\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Evans contends that Plaintiff's pleadings contain no such claim and do not satisfy the heightened pleading standard for qualified immunity set forth in\n   <em>\n    Schultea v.

Evans contends that, even assuming the claim is properly pleaded, it fails as a matter of law because: (1) he committed no violation of Harmon's right to petition under the First Amendment and there was no clearly established law at the time that declared his conduct unconstitutional; (2) Harmon has no fundamental right to complain about the termination of his public employment; and (3) Harmon's grievance regarding his employment termination was a matter of personal concern, not public concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Although Plaintiff previously contended in his Supplemental Brief only that he had a \"petition claim\" under the First Amendment remaining against Evans, he now contends in response to Evans's summary judgment motion on his First Amendment Petition Claim that he has multiple \"petition claims\" remaining against Evans based on various legal theories. Specifically, Plaintiff contends that he has \"petition claims\" against Evans for alleged First Amendment, equal protection, and state and local violations. Pl.'s Summ. J. Resp.

J. Resp. Br. \u00b6 13 (quoting Pl.'s Rule 7(a) Reply \u00b6 45). Based on the equal protection petition and grievance allegations in his Complaint and the allegations in his Rule 7(a) Reply regarding the right to petition being a fundamental right under the First Amendment, Plaintiff contends that his petition claim or what he now refers to as his \"petition claims\" are not limited to the Denial of Equal Protection claim alleged in his Complaint against Dallas County but also encompass additional legal theories of recovery against Evans for equal protection violations; violations of the First Amendment Petition Clause; and violations of Texas Government Code \u00a7 617.005 and Dallas County Code Chapter 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Regarding the merits of his First Amendment Petition Claim, Plaintiff responds that the right to petition the government for redress of grievances is a well-established fundamental right that is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as Texas Government Code \u00a7 617.005, which, according to Harmon, \"protects the right of public employees to present grievances.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harmon contends that Evans's\n   refusal to hear his grievance regarding the termination of his employment violated his First Amendment right to petition because, once Dallas County voluntarily established a grievance process under Dallas County Code Chapter 86 for constables like him, who were hired after August 19, 2003, to present employment grievances, including those regarding termination, to their chain of command or elected constable for the precinct in which they worked, \"Evans was not free to refuse to hear [his] post[-]termination grievance\" and could not thereafter institute policies that infringe on his right to petition or discriminate and retaliate against him in administering the County's grievance process without violating the First Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harmon further asserts that Evans's \"policy [of] refusing to hear post[-]termination grievances from deputy constables hired after August 19, 2003,\" which denied him and other deputy constables their First Amendment right to petition, Pl.'s Summ.

In support of his summary judgment response, Plaintiff relies on the evidence (Doc. 44) he previously submitted in support of his Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on his equal protection claim against the County, as well as the evidence (Doc. 47) he submitted in response to Defendants' Limited Motion for Summary Judgment. He also relies on his related prior statements of undisputed facts (Docs. 43, 47-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Evans replies that \"Plaintiff misstates the applicable law regarding the burden of proof on the qualified immunity issue, for it is [he], not the Constable, who has the burden to prove that the latter is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   entitled to qualified immunity.\" Evans's Summ. J. Reply 4 (Doc. 64). Evans contends that Plaintiff has not met his burden in this regard. Evans also continues to maintain that Plaintiff's pleadings cannot be construed as including a claim based on the First Amendment's Petition Clause, and Plaintiff's allegations that he was not allowed to grieve his termination are not sufficiently specific and detailed to support such a claim. In addition, Evans reasserts that the First Amendment's Petition Clause does not grant employees like Plaintiff an absolute constitutional right to grieve the termination of their employment. To the extent Plaintiff urges arguments and authority in support of his First Amendment Petition Claim that were made in connection with the parties' prior motions for partial summary judgment regarding Harmon's Denial of Equal Protection claim based on Defendants' refusal to hear the appeal of his termination, Evans relies on the briefs previously submitted by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Harmon, however, does not allege anywhere in his Complaint or Rule 7(a) Reply that he was retaliated against by Evans in violation of the First Amendment and suffered an adverse employment action as a result of his petitioning or appealing the termination of his employment; nor does he allege any facts from which the court could reasonably infer that the appeal of his employment termination involved a matter of public concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Moreover, while Harmon alleges in his Complaint and Rule 7(a) Reply that \"the right to petition the government for redress of grievances is a fundamental right,\" this allegation is clearly made in connection with his claim for Denial of Equal Protection, as he contends that \"the actions of Defendants to deprive Plaintiff of the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, when such right is granted to other similarly situated employees, is a denial of the Plaintiff's right to equal protection of law guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution...that should be subjected to strict scrutiny.\" Pl.'s Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.

Harmon's contention in response to Evans's Rule 12(c) Motion for Judgment that he should be granted leave to amend his pleadings after expiration of the pleading deadline, two years after the lawsuit was filed, because Defendants had not previously pointed out the deficiencies in his pleadings via a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss or motion for more definite statement turns the heightened pleading standard and burden for qualified immunity on its head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In any event, Judge Solis's order requiring Plaintiff to file a Rule 7(a) Reply was limited to \"the issue of Defendants' qualified immunity defenses\" and did not grant him leave to assert new causes of action or allegations supporting new causes of action. Order (Doc. 24). While Judge Solis impliedly granted Plaintiff's request for leave, included in his response to Evans's Motion for Judgment (Doc. 27), to supplement his Complaint and Rule 7(a) Reply, Plaintiff said nothing about asserting a new cause of action for retaliation under the First Amendment Petition Clause; rather, his motion for leave and proposed supplement to his Complaint and Rule 7(a) Reply sought only to supplement his pleadings to correct deficiencies in his First Amendment retaliation/speech claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Evans's Mot. for J.

Thus, Harmon cannot use his Rule 7(a) Reply to add a new claim that was not included in his Complaint, and the court does not construe his Rule 7(a) Reply as amending his pleadings to add a new cause of action for retaliation in violation of the Fist Amendment Petition Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Similarly, the court does not construe Harmon's July 2016 summary judgment arguments as raising a new retaliation claim under the First Amendment's Petition Clause, even though he contended for the first time that Dallas County's order limiting access to the County's grievance system to constables hired before August 19, 2003, constituted a violation of his First Amendment right to petition the government for grievances, as well as a denial of equal protection.

It was only after Evans filed his Motion for Judgment on Plaintiff's Free Speech Claim, and after Plaintiff filed his Rule 7(a) Reply, that Plaintiff asked in response to the Motion for Judgment to supplement his pleadings and Rule 7(a) Reply as to his Free Speech Claim. During the parties' first round of summary judgments on his equal protection claim, he contended for the first time that Defendants had violated the First Amendment Petition Clause and attempted to blur the distinction between his equal protection petition claim and the newly asserted but unpleaded First Amendment Petition Claim by contending that Defendants' denial of or refusal to hear his petition appealing the termination of his employment was a violation of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   his right to equal protection\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the First Amendment's Petition Clause. Next, after the court announced its decision to revisit Judge Solis's ruling on Evans's Motion for Judgment as to Plaintiff's Free Speech Claim and ordered supplemental briefing on the motion, Plaintiff contended that, even if his Free Speech Claim was dismissed, he still had a First Amendment Petition Claim against Evans. Finally, after Evans was allowed to move for summary judgment on Plaintiff's new First Amendment Petition Claim, Plaintiff contended in response to Evans's motion on the First Amendment Petition Claim that he has additional \"petition claims\" remaining against Evans based on equal protection violations and violations of state and local law, even though he only previously contended that he had a First Amendment Petition Claim remaining against Evans in his individual capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Moreover, Harmon alleged only that he was seeking relief against Evans in\n   his individual capacity with respect to his First Amendment Free Speech Claim, Pl.'s Rule 7(a) Reply \u00b6 50, and when Evans moved for judgment on April 17, 2015, on \"all the claims against him in his individual capacity\" based on his qualified immunity defense, Harmon did not clarify that he had pleaded or intended to pursue claims against Evans in his individual capacity, other than his Free Speech Claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Evans's Mot. for J. 9 (Doc. 26).

There is no evidence that Harmon was using the petition appealing his employment termination as a platform to publicly air his concerns about Evans's conduct. He, instead, was merely using the petition to appeal the termination of his employment as any employee, private or public, would do. In other words, the point of Harmon's appeal was not to present concerns about Evans's conduct but to seek reinstatement of his employment as deputy constable with the County. Moreover, Harmon's allegation in the petition appealing the termination of his employment and this lawsuit that his employment was terminated in violation of the Texas Whistle Blower Act or the First Amendment is insufficient to convert what is a matter of private concern regarding Harmon's employment being terminated into a matter of public concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172988\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/476/#p485\">\n    838 F.3d at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The personal relief sought by Harmon in the petition appealing his termination, as well as the relief sought by him in this lawsuit, lend further support to the court's conclusion that Harmon's appeal of his employment termination involves a personal matter rather than one involving public concern.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172988\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/476/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172988\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/476/#p485\">\n    at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The suit asks only for\n   personal relief.

Specifically, the relief sought by Harmon in his 2011 appeal and this lawsuit merely seek to rectify the harm he allegedly suffered as a result of his being fired. In his appeal grievance form, Harmon requests that \"his termination be voided, that all back pay and benefits be restored to [him], and that any and all reference to this disciplinary action and the related investigation be removed from my personnel file.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s App. 51 (Doc. 44). Similarly, in this lawsuit, Harmon requests only damages he incurred as a result of Defendants' conduct in allegedly terminating his employment unlawfully and denying or refusing to hear the appeal of his termination. Pl.'s Compl. 35 (\"Plaintiff's professional career has been irreparably damaged due to Defendants' unlawful conduct and Plaintiff has suffered damages, including: emotional distress and suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-pecuniary losses in the past; and loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity in the future.\"); Pl.'s Rule 7(a) Reply (\"Norvis Harmon has been damaged as a result of his wrongful termination; because of Defendant Evans' refusal to hear any appeal of Harmon's wrongful termination; and as a result of his denial of grievance rights in the Dallas County Civil Service system by Defendant Dallas County.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Additionally, Harmon contends that his First Amendment Petition Claim is against Evans in his individual capacity, and he seeks to hold Evans personally liable for damages allegedly sustained as a result of his employment being terminated. In\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit addressed a closely analogous issue of whether a plaintiff's petition involved a matter of public concern and concluded that it did not because the defendant had been sued in his individual capacity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Importantly, Gibson's suit was against the mayor only in his personal (or individual) capacity. \"Personal-capacity suits seek to impose personal liability\"; they cannot establish governmental liability. \"[A]n award of damages against an official in his personal capacity can be executed only against the official's personal assets.\" For purposes of liability, a suit against a governmental official in his individual capacity is the equivalent of suing one's neighbor. Thus, because they do not concern the public [ ], personal-capacity suits are much less likely to be matters of public concern. Therefore, the form of Gibson's suit-personal capacity-provides significant support for the conclusion that it was not a matter of public concern.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172988\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/476/#p485\">\n    838 F.3d at 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes and internal citations omitted). For similar reasons, the court concludes that Harmon's petition or grievance appealing the termination of his employment, which is the subject of his lawsuit, is personal in nature, as he seeks to hold Evans personally liable for damages allegedly sustained as a result of his employment being terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Thus, for the foregoing reasons, and after considering \"the content, form, and context of [Harmon's petition], as revealed by the whole record,\" the court determines that Harmon's petition or grievance appealing his employment termination does not pertain to a matter of public concern. Moreover, even if the court were to construe the content of Harmon's appeal of his employment termination as a mix of private and public concerns, it concludes that private concerns predominate when considering the content, form, and context of the appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172988\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/476/#p485\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172988\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/476/#p485\">\n    at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Petition Claim Based on Denial of Equal Protection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   As noted, Plaintiff contends in his response to Evans's summary judgment motion regarding Plaintiff's First Amendment Petition Claim that Evans is not entitled to qualified immunity or summary judgment on his Petition Claim to the extent it is based on the alleged denial of equal protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff contends that, while deputy constables hired after August 19, 2003, have no civil service grievance rights, Dallas County previously admitted that deputy constables with no formal civil service grievance rights can still submit their grievances to their department head or human resources. Plaintiff contends that the undisputed evidence shows that Evans refused to hear his posttermination grievance; that Evans had a policy of refusing to hear grievances from terminated deputy constables; and that Evans has failed to present any compelling state interest for his refusal to hear employee grievances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In his reply brief, Evans accuses Plaintiff of failing once again to confine his arguments to the issue at hand and contends that Plaintiff relies on a \"shotgun\" approach in responding to his motion in an effort to distract the court from the issue to be decided. Evans contends that, instead of focusing on his contention that he is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Plaintiff's First Amendment Petition Claim, Plaintiff's response \"re-hashes\" or \"re-processes\" in large part matters briefed in the parties' prior summary judgment motions regarding equal protection, Government Code \u00a7 617.003, and Dallas County Code Chapter 86 that were rejected by the court. Evans's Summ. J. Reply 2. Evans asserts, for the reasons set forth in Defendants' prior briefs, that there is no general or fundamental \"right to petition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   It appears that Harmon's equal protection Petition Claim is limited to his contention that he was denied the opportunity to participate in Dallas County's informal grievance procedure that allows deputy constables with no formal civil service grievance rights to submit grievances to their department head or human resources. Because of the ever-changing nature of Plaintiff's claims in this case and his pleadings not being a model of pellucid draftsmanship, the court, out of an abundance of caution, determines, for the reasons previously explained in this opinion and the court's March 31, 2017 opinion, that Plaintiff has not asserted an equal protection Petition Claim against Evans in\n   his individual capacity based on the County's formal civil service grievance procedure or, if asserted, the claim was abandoned, and any such claim against Evans in his official capacity is barred by res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Further, although the court has already determined that Harmon's individual capacity claims against Evans are limited to his Free Speech Claim, it further determines that, even if Harmon can be said to have asserted and not abandoned an equal protection Petition Claim against Evans in his individual capacity based on his contention that he was denied the opportunity to participate in Dallas County's informal grievance procedure, the court concludes that this claim fails as a matter of law. Instead of coming forward with evidence to establish that \"two or more classifications of similarly situated persons were treated differently\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   by Evans, Harmon acknowledges and has consistently maintained that Evans had a policy or regular practice of refusing to hear grievances from terminated deputy constables,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and there is no evidence that Evans treated similarly situated terminated deputy constables hired after August 19, 2003, differently in hearing or deciding their employment termination grievances. Thus, Harmon has not satisfied the first requirement for an equal protection claim, and the court need not address the parties' contentions as to whether the claim should be reviewed under a strict scrutiny or rational basis standard.\n   <em>\n    Gallegos-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3498037\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/190/#p195\">\n    688 F.3d at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).
