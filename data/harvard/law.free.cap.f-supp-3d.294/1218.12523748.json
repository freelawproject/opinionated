The United States moves this Court to conduct a hearing on the record to inquire whether Defendant's counsel communicated to Defendant a plea offer extended by the United States.

On January 18, 2018, the Government filed the current motion to compel Defendant to answer questions on the record about whether Defendant received information from his attorney about a global plea agreement extended by the United States Attorney in the District of New Mexico. Doc. 40. According to the Government, the plea offer encompassed Defendant's pending case in the District of Arizona, as well as his case in the District of New Mexico. Doc. 40 at 3.

A change of plea hearing took place on January 31, 2018, during which Defendant expressed his desire to proceed to trial. Doc. 46 at lines 6-12. The Government's proposed colloquy did not take place at the January 31, 2018 hearing and this matter was not decided at that time.

Specifically, the Supreme Court determined in\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   that \"[i]f a plea bargain has been offered, a defendant has the right to effective assistance of counsel in considering whether to accept it.\" 566 U.S. at 168,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188541\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/156/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court ruled that \"[w]hen defense counsel allowed the offer to expire without advising the defendant or allowing him to consider it, defense counsel did not render the effective assistance the Constitution requires.\" 566 U.S. at 145,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Doc. 40. The Government argues that its purpose is to establish \"a clear record ... in the event the defendant subsequently brings a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging that his attorney failed to effectively convey the global plea offer to him, ....\" Doc. 40 at 2. The issue is whether\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   provide this Court with authority to establish a pretrial record of the terms of a formal plea offer, with the foresight of referencing such a record in a post-conviction hearing based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the plea bargaining process, and what the scope of such an inquiry may be. Defendant's counsel objects to the Government's request for this hearing on the\n   grounds that such an inquiry (a) places Defendant's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent in jeopardy and (b) contravenes the attorney-client privilege. Doc. 41 at 1. Defense counsel asserts that \"[m]inimally, these type of hearings should be held outside of the presence of government counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Government proposes the following colloquy (Doc. 40 at 2-3):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I am informed that the government made you a global plea offer, pursuant to Rule 20, Fed.

Relevant to the Court's role is the Supreme Court's suggestion of establishing a pretrial record: \"[F]ormal offers can be made part of the record at any subsequent plea proceeding or before a trial on the merits, all to ensure that a defendant has been fully advised before those further proceedings commence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining that the plea offer was \"formal\" and had a determinative expiration date). Thus, a trial court's adoption of measures to establish a record of a formal plea offer may work to ensure that the defendant receives effective assistance in the plea bargaining context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at 165,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188541\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/156/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at 145,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also in accordance with the Supreme Court's reasoning in these cases, the Court has an interest in not devoting limited judicial resources to handling post-conviction petitions when a fully-developed pretrial record potentially would alleviate the need for a later evidentiary hearing. Therefore, another rationale behind this recommendation is that the principles that flow from\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   create \"the need for additional precautions to guard against contrived ineffective assistance claims.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Legal Authorities that Restrict the Court's Role in a\n    <em>\n     Lafler / Frye\n    </em>\n    Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   provides this Court with discretion to conduct a pretrial colloquy for the purpose of creating a record of the formal plea offer, there are a number of authorities that restrict the role of the Court during such an inquiry. The Court has examined these authorities and finds that a carefully constructed colloquy should not offend them. Initially, the Court notes that the issue of a\n   <em>\n    Lafler / Frye\n   </em>\n   hearing is one of first impression for this Court. There is no Tenth Circuit precedent and a limited amount of Tenth Circuit district court opinions to reference regarding the authority of\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   to conduct this inquiry, and what the scope of the inquiry should be. There are, however, a number of district courts across the country that have conducted this kind of hearing, some of whom make it their practice to do so. Although many of their opinions are unpublished, they still provide guidance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1) prohibits the Court from participating in plea negotiations. Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1) (\"An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney ... may discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions.\"). The reasoning behind this rule is threefold: \"it minimizes the risk that the defendant will be judicially coerced into pleading guilty, it preserves the impartiality of the court, and it avoids any appearance of impropriety.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cano-Varela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616620,3618149\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/497/1122/\">\n    497 F.3d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1132 (10th Cir. 2007) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Violation of Rule 11(c)(1) occurs, for example, when the judge engages with a defendant to compare the outcomes of pleading guilty or going to trial, or when the judge offers guidance about favorable plea agreement terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1133 (collecting federal Courts of Appeals cases that affirmed Rule 11(c)(1) violations);\n   <em>\n    United States v.
