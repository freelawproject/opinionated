Plaintiff Under Armour is a Maryland corporation engaged in the sale of performance products. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 10.) UA uses the phrases \"I Can Do All Things\" and \"I Can. I Will.\" in association with and in the promotion of its products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) UA then uses the phrase \"I Can. I Will.\" in association with its products generally.

(ECF No. 17 at 6.) However, Under Armour alleges that \"Battle's aim was to interfere with Under Armour's business relationships, which emanate from and are directly affected in Maryland.\" (ECF No. 16 at 7.) Indeed, Defendant Kelsey Battle did not name Stephen Curry, his agent, or Droga5 as defendants in the North Carolina infringement suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Battle v. Under Armour\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 5:17-cv-00627-BO. Rather, he filed suit solely against Under Armour. These letters were efforts to notify individuals\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a target of Defendant Kelsey Battle's suit that Battle was accusing Under Armour of trademark infringement, and \"[g]iven the [third parties'] relationship[s] to Under Armour\" the third parties needed to preserve a wide range of documents and data. (ECF Nos. 17-2, 17-3, 17-4.) Accordingly, Battle's actions went further than merely informing Under Armour of its assertion of its rights but rather allegedly took steps to interfere with Under Armour's business in Maryland. \"Even a single contact may be sufficient to create jurisdiction so long as the 'principle of fair play and substantial justice is not thereby offended.' \"\n   <em>\n    Message Sys., Inc. v.
