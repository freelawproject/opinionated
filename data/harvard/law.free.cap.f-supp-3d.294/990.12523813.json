Despite Mr. Cazinha's decision to not recommend Plaintiff for a bonus, Plaintiff did receive a bonus that year.

ECF No. 60 \u00b6 11. Plaintiff states that he did not know about any task that was not completed and that he was prevented from completing them by Defendant when he was removed from the work center without prior notice. ECF No. 66-1, Pl.'s Decl. \u00b6 64. Plaintiff also states that Mr. Cazinha \"gave some employees $500.00, and others received $200.00.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. Plaintiff states that he received a $300.00 award.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff cannot establish that he suffered an adverse employment action. ECF No. 59-1 at 19. As noted above, Plaintiff concedes that he received a bonus for the year despite the fact that Mr. Cazinha did not recommend him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 66-1, Pl.s' Decl. \u00b6 63. However, based on Plaintiff's Declaration, other employees received larger bonuses than Plaintiff did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there is a factual dispute regarding whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action. Further, there are material facts in dispute regarding Defendant's proffered reason for not recommending Plaintiff for a bonus. Specifically, Plaintiff states in his Declaration that he was not aware of any work that was left uncompleted, and if any work was left uncompleted, it was because Defendant prevented him from returning to the work center when he was transferred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. Based on these factual disputes, the Court cannot find that Defendant is entitled summary judgment on these claims. There are material issues of fact regarding whether Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action and whether Defendant's proffered reason for the action is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's request for summary judgment as to these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that there is insufficient evidence that any conduct based on Plaintiff's age, race, color, and national origin was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive working environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Surrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556636\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/1097/#p1103\">\n    518 F.3d at 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There are no allegations or evidence that Plaintiff was subjected to any verbal or physical conduct because of his age. The only evidence regarding any conduct based on Plaintiff's race, color, or national origin are the statements in Plaintiffs' Declaration that another employee referred to that employee's son-in-law a \"black punk\" and that \"African American are referred to as the nigger or the popolo.\" ECF No. 66-1 \u00b6 108. Plaintiff does not present any evidence that his coworkers or supervisors directed any statements about age, race, color, or national original at him. Under Ninth Circuit case law, the conduct at issue \"was neither severe nor pervasive enough to alter the conditions of [Plaintiff's] employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Manatt v.

Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Defendant as to Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim based on age, race, color, and national origin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Second, the Court GRANTS summary judgment as to Plaintiff's retaliatory hostile work environment claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ray v.

Plaintiff's Complaints contain a number of specific examples of conduct that Plaintiff asserts created a hostile work environment in retaliation for Plaintiff's EEO activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 26(a), 26(b)(iii)(B), 29(a), 29(b), 29(c), 29(d), 29(e); Second Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-29, 31, 33-35. In its Motion, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim of hostile work environment based retaliation must fail because his allegations of harassment are simple work disputes, not acts based on his protected EEO activities. ECF No. 59-1 at 19-24. Defendant argues that an examination of the circumstances behind each incident shows that Defendant acted reasonably.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Defendant submitted the Declarations of Mr. Cazinha and Ms. Rodrigues to explain the circumstances behind each of the incidents alleged in the Complaints. ECF No. 60-2, ECF No. 60-3. In Opposition, Plaintiff provides statements in his Declaration regarding the incidents alleged in his Complaints as well as other incidents that are outside the scope of the allegations in his Complaints. ECF No. 66-1, Pl.'s Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-151. Importantly, the statements in Plaintiff's Declaration support Defendant's position that all of the incidents at issue involved workplace disputes. Specifically, Plaintiff's Declaration states that Mr. Cazinha yelled at Plaintiff about Plaintiff's knowledge of the power plant equipment, his report writing, missing or damaged files, and work place accidents, that Mr. Cazinha repeatedly emailed Plaintiff about work assignments, reassigned employees to Plaintiff's crew, gave him additional duties, and criticized Plaintiff about how he handled calls, overtime schedules, and\n   reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Declaration states that Ms. Rodrigues also criticized Plaintiff about his supervision of other employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff also details how Mr. Cazinha frequently yelled in his face and how Ms. Rodrigues regularly used rough language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 102. Although there is evidence that Mr. Cazinha and Ms. Rodrigues raised their voices in speaking with Plaintiff, there is also evidence that Plaintiff regularly raised his voice as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 66-5 at 4, Decl. of Richard Binek (stating that Plaintiff's interactions with Mr. Cazinha and Ms. Rodrigues were \"usually loud and very confrontational\"); ECF No. 66-6 at 3, Decl. of Valentino Lopez (stating that Plaintiff and Mr. Cazinha \"have a history of yelling and disrespecting each other\"). Although Mr. Cazinha's and Ms. Rodrigues' manner of speaking to Plaintiff about these workplace disputes may have been uncivil, there is no evidence that Plaintiff was treated this way because of his protected activity. The Court rejects Plaintiff's argument that the Declarations of Plaintiff's coworkers show that Mr. Cazinha treated Plaintiff differently because of his EEO activity. As noted by Defendant, speculation about a supervisor's motive is inadmissible to show retaliatory animus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hester v. BIC Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231244\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/178/#p185\">\n    225 F.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185 (2d Cir. 2000) (stating that \"Rule 701(b) bars lay opinion testimony that amounts to a naked speculation concerning the motivation for a defendant's adverse employment decision.\"). All of Mr. Cazinha's and Ms. Rodrigues' criticism of Plaintiff were related to certain aspects of Plaintiff's job and their perceptions that Plaintiff was not performing his job appropriately. In considering the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the evidence does not suggest that Plaintiff's supervisor's conduct was severe or interfered with Plaintiff's work performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGinest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164199\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/1103/#p1113\">\n    360 F.3d at 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
