(\"Chipotle\" or \"the Company\"), and Chipotle executives Steven Ells, Montgomery F. Moran, and John R. Hartung (collectively, the \"Chipotle Executives\" or the \"Individual Defendants,\" and including Chipotle, \"Defendants\"). Plaintiffs allege, and Defendants do not dispute, that after a rash of food-borne illness outbreaks in late 2014 and 2015, some of which were linked to Chipotle, the value of the Company's stock steeply declined. But while others attribute these losses to the adverse publicity surrounding the outbreaks, Plaintiffs instead claim that they are due, in part or in whole, to the Company's failure to disclose certain granular details and attendant risks of its produce-processing and food-safety procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs have brought securities fraud claims under \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5. The Court previously dismissed Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (the \"FAC\"), and Defendants now move to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (the \"SAC\"). Defendants also move to strike an expert witness declaration attached to the SAC. For the reasons that follow, the Court grants Defendants' motion to strike\n   in part, and grants their motion to dismiss in its totality. The Court is as concerned as the parties about food-borne illness outbreaks generally and about those described in the SAC specifically. That said, not all adverse events are the product of corporate misfeasance or nonfeasance, and the Court cannot find on this record that Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded securities fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court's prior opinion considering Defendants' motion to dismiss the FAC provided an extensive discussion of the alleged facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ong\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Chipotle I\n   </em>\n   \"), No. 16 Civ. 141 (KPF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n    2017 WL 933108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2017). Nevertheless, given the extensive additions to Plaintiffs' complaint, the Court again outlines the factual allegations, while noting at times where Plaintiffs' allegations have remained the same and where they have changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this case as a class action \"on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of Chipotle between February 5, 2015[,] and February 2, 2016, inclusive\" (the \"Class Period\"). (SAC \u00b6 1). \"Chipotle is a publicly traded fast-food restaurant chain,\" which, as of December 31, 2015, operated over 1,900 restaurants in the United States that offer cuisine containing produce items including tomatoes, lettuce, red onion, jalape\u00f1os, and cilantro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20). As of February 4, 2015, Chipotle had more than 31 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The SAC names, as individual defendants, three current and former Chipotle executives. Defendant M. Steven Ells is Chipotle's founder and, during the Class Period, was one of two of the Company's co-Chief Executive Officers, along with Defendant Montgomery F. Moran. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 21-22). Moran was also on Chipotle's Board of Directors during the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). Before serving in these capacities, Moran was Chipotle's outside counsel while working for the Denver law firm of Messner &amp; Reeves, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It is alleged that \"[o]n December 12, 2016, in light of the significant fallout from the Class Period food-borne illness outbreaks[,] Moran resigned as co-CEO and director at the Board's request.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant John R. Hartung is, and served throughout the Class Period as, Chipotle's Chief Financial Officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). In this capacity, Hartung was responsible for Chipotle's \"financial and reporting functions,\" as well as overseeing information technology; safety, security, and risk; and compensation and benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, given their positions in the Company during the Class\n   Period, the Chipotle Executives \"had access to the adverse undisclosed information about its business, operations, products, operational trends, financial statements, markets and present and future business prospects via internal corporate documents,\" as well as \"conversations and connections with other corporate officers and employees, attendance at management and/or Board meetings and committees thereof and via reports and other information provided to them[.]\" (SAC \u00b6 26). Drawing from this, along with other allegations, Plaintiffs posit that these Executives, and thus Chipotle, \"were aware of[ ] food-borne illness outbreaks at the Company,\" as discussed more fully below. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Chipotle's Food-Safety Practices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The SAC expands on the FAC's discussion of food-safety procedures that Chipotle had in place before, during, and after the Class Period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before the Class Period, Chipotle received its produce \"from a central commissary where it was processed, prepared[,] and tested at least twice for pathogens before being delivered.\" (SAC \u00b6 2). Plaintiffs contend that this is \"the industry standard practice in the fast food industry\" for ready-to-eat food, as it \"allows for much greater control over food safety than at individual restaurants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63). Commissary food-processing systems also provide \"the ability to conduct raw material testing and end product testing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64). Raw material testing involves testing food products for pathogens at their preliminary arrival at the commissary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Food product that passes these tests is then subject to end product testing, which involves sampling batches of the food at intervals and disposing of any batch that fails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 64-65). A negative test result may also trigger procedures for tracing the contaminated product back to its source to prevent further distribution of pathogen-ridden food. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65). Plaintiffs assert that \"any professional in the food safety business understands that raw material testing and end product testing are the industry standard for verifying that the food served at individual restaurants is safe.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In late 2014, Chipotle \"switch[ed] the cutting and processing of its produce to each of its 1,900 individual restaurants, instead of a central commissary, believing that this would improve taste and freshness.\" (SAC \u00b6 2). In Plaintiffs' view, because this entailed a drastic shift in the method in which Chipotle went about assuring food safety, maintaining the same standard of quality \"would have required a detailed hazard analysis of the food safety risks associated with this change in operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69). Failure to do so would \"exponentially increase\" the risk that Chipotle would experience food-borne illness outbreaks \"as soon as the switch was made,\" as Chipotle would be unable to recreate the safety mechanisms in place at commissary distributors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 70-76). Plaintiffs also allege that the switch away from commissary food distribution prevented Chipotle from being able to trace its ingredients back to specific suppliers, which in turn would frustrate investigations into the source of pathogens. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 82-85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs further claim that Chipotle maintained a practice of internally auditing\n   the food safety levels at individual locations, rather than what they claim is the \"industry standard\" of external auditing, which eliminates \"the possibility of collusion between the stores and the auditors.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 86-87). Chipotle would also \"pre-announce[ ]\" the audits, which would allow the restaurants \"ample time to hide or mask deficient food safety practices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 4, 2015, after Chipotle was involved in a number of food-borne illness outbreaks (discussed more fully below), the Company \"disclosed that it had begun high-resolution testing of produce as part of its remediation plan.\" (SAC \u00b6 77). High-resolution testing is a form of end product testing \"that uses a larger number of samples based on the timing of manufacturing ... or the lot size,\" and it \"can only take place at commissaries or food factories.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Plaintiffs, \"this means that Chipotle had switched back to commissary preparation for its produce by the time of this disclosure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78). As another remedial measure, on February 8, 2016, Chipotle closed all of its restaurants to train employees in food safety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 90). Plaintiffs allege that this decision indicates \"that employees were not properly safety trained before the[ ] outbreaks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Food-Borne Illness Outbreaks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As opposed to the seven food-borne illness outbreaks detailed in the FAC,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chipotle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n    2017 WL 933108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, the SAC alleges that \"Chipotle experienced no fewer than thirteen food-borne illness outbreaks during the Class Period, many of which have still not been disclosed to the public\" (SAC \u00b6 92). Specifically, Plaintiffs premised the FAC on the following outbreaks, all of which took place in 2015:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (i) an outbreak of E. coli ... in July [2015] in Washington State; (ii) an outbreak of Norovirus in August [2015] in Washington; (iii) an outbreak of Norovirus in August [2015] in California; (iv) an outbreak of Salmonella in August [2015] in Minnesota; (v) an outbreak of E. coli ... in October [2015] in Washington, Oregon, California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Kentucky; (vi) an outbreak of E. coli ... in November [2015] in Kansas, North Dakota, and Oklahoma; and (vii) an outbreak of Norovirus in December [2015] in Massachusetts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Chipotle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n    2017 WL 933108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition to these outbreaks, the SAC describes the following outbreaks involving Chipotle customers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (viii) an outbreak of Salmonella beginning in December 2014 involving customers in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington; (ix) an outbreak of Salmonella beginning in February 2015 involving customers in New York, Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, and Massachusetts; (x) an outbreak of E. coli beginning in March 2015 involving customers in California, Connecticut, and Nevada; (xi) an outbreak of Salmonella in May 2015 involving customers in New Jersey, Kentucky, and New York; (xii) an outbreak of Salmonella beginning in July 2015 involving customers in New York; and (xiii) an outbreak of E. coli beginning in October 2015 involving customers in California, Colorado, and Oregon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 93-110, 187-90). Plaintiffs' discovery of the additional outbreaks are a result of requests for documents from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (the \"CDC\") and state and local health officials. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92). In total, these outbreaks in the operative complaint include \"(i) five Salmonella outbreaks; (ii) five E. Coli outbreaks; and (iii) three Norovirus outbreaks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (footnote call numbers omitted)). All of the outbreaks-and the degree, if any, to which they were connected by public health officials to Chipotle-are discussed individually in the remainder of this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The December 2014 Multistate Salmonella Outbreak\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   From December 2014 through February 2015, 31 individuals in several states fell ill after being exposed to Salmonella. (SAC \u00b6 94). \"Within this group, the CDC found a link to four Chipotle customers, with at least one coming from Wisconsin and the others coming from at least one or more of the following states: Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The SAC acknowledges, however, that \"[t]he CDC did not conclusively link a specific ingredient or supplier as the source of this outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The February 2015 Multistate Salmonella Outbreak\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   From February 22, 2015, to June 5, 2015, 30 individuals in several states fell ill after being exposed to Salmonella. (SAC \u00b6 97). \"Within this group, the CDC found a link to eight Chipotle customers: four from a combination of New York, Wisconsin[,] and Ohio, two from Texas, and two from Massachusetts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Documents from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health indicate that an employee of Corporate Wellness, an agent of Chipotle, \"was apprised that this outbreak was plaguing Chipotle customers in Massachusetts by no later than May 13, 2015, and that these sicknesses had been observed in mid-April 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98). In addition, Chipotle employees \"participated in the response to the Massachusetts portion of this outbreak by at least May 18, 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Again,\n   however, \"[t]he CDC did not conclusively link a specific ingredient or supplier as the source of this outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

(SAC \u00b6 101). \"Within this group, the CDC found a link to five or six Chipotle customers from a combination of California, Connecticut[,] and Nevada.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Yet again, \"[t]he CDC did not conclusively link a specific ingredient or supplier as the source of this outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    d. The May 2015 Multistate Salmonella Outbreak\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Beginning on May 26, 2015, 79 individuals in multiple states fell ill after being exposed to Salmonella. (SAC \u00b6 104). \"Within this group, the CDC found a link to 19 Chipotle customers from New Jersey, Kentucky[,] and New York during the time period of July 7, 2015[,] to July 15, 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On August 24, 2015, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") held a conference call with Chipotle representatives \"to discuss the ongoing investigation and to request supplier information for the six Chipotle restaurants involved in the outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 105). But \"[b]ecause the CDC was unable to conclusively link a specific ingredient or supplier as the source of this outbreak, the CDC's and FDA's investigations\" ceased on October 13, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 107).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    e. The July 2015 New York Salmonella Outbreak\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   From \"mid-July to mid-August 2015,\" six Chipotle customers from New York fell ill after being exposed to Salmonella. (SAC \u00b6 109). \"These were all of the individuals associated with Salmonella that were identified as part of this outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"The CDC did not,\" however, \"conclusively link a specific ingredient or supplier as the source of this outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    f. The July 2015 Washington E.

(SAC \u00b6 111). The outbreak sickened five people between July 28 and 31, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"[B]y at least August 3, 2015, Chipotle was apprised of this outbreak and was involved in testing restaurant employees for the presence of E. coli[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112). But \"[t]he CDC did not conclusively link a specific ingredient[ ] or supplier[ ] as the source of this outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 111).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   According to a communications director for Seattle &amp; King County Public Health, \"Chipotle knew about and participated in the testing for the outbreak,\" and \"the CDC was made aware of this outbreak in July [2015], but no public disclosure was made because it took a long time to link this outbreak to Chipotle.\" (SAC \u00b6 113). Thus, when \"the link was discovered, Washington state health officials had determined that this outbreak posed no ongoing risk to the public.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The \"outbreak was not publicly disclosed until November 10, 2015, when\n   <em>\n    The Oregonian\n   </em>\n   published an article entitled 'Chipotle Involved in 4th Outbreak This Year That Was Kept Secret.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 116).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    g. The August 2015 California Norovirus Outbreak\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Starting on August 18, 2015, a Chipotle restaurant in Simi Valley, California experienced a Norovirus outbreak that left 243 customers ill. (SAC \u00b6 117). In response, on August 20, 2015, Chipotle closed its Simi Valley location to the public and initiated a corporate policy known as the \"Norwalk Protocol.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118). The Norwalk Protocol was Chipotle's policy for responding to a suspected Norovirus outbreak that required Chipotle to close any location at which two or more customers complain of food-borne illness, after which the restaurant\n   would dispose of any food items and bleach cooking and food-handling surfaces. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118 n.12). The Simi Valley location did not inform customers or public health officials of the outbreak, but instead posted a sign during its closure stating that the restaurant was \"closed for the rest of the day due to a severe staffing shortage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   One day later, on Friday, August 21, 2015, the restaurant reopened with a new crew of employees from other Chipotle locations, and the following day, Chipotle contacted the Ventura County Environmental Health Division to provide notice that 17 Simi Valley Chipotle employees were suffering from gastrointestinal illness and had been replaced with other Chipotle employees. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 119-20). The following Monday, Ventura County health officials determined that nine Chipotle employees had contracted Norovirus, although the officials could not carry out their normal testing because of the remedial measures taken as a result of the Norwalk Protocol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"On September 14, 2015, the Ventura County (CA) Environmental Health Division issued a Notice of Violation to Chipotle,\" noting among other violations that Chipotle failed to notify the Health Division \"when it was first aware of sick employees.\" (SAC \u00b6 126). This was not the only government action resulting from the Norovirus outbreak: In December 2015, Chipotle received \"a Federal Grand Jury Subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in connection with an official criminal investigation being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, in conjunction with the [FDA]'s Office of Criminal Investigations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 128). Chipotle first disclosed the subpoena on January 6, 2016, in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to a Form 10-K that Chipotle filed on February 7, 2017, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, the investigation remains ongoing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 129).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    h. The August 2015 Washington Norovirus Outbreak\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   From August 22, 2015, to September 1, 2015, Chipotle experienced a Norovirus outbreak at its restaurant in Hazel Dell, Washington. (SAC \u00b6 130). Plaintiffs claim that before they filed the FAC in this action, this outbreak was \"never ... publicly acknowledged,\" and, further, that Plaintiffs discovered it by accessing \"email communications between Washington State Department of Health officials and Chipotle corporate executives.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 131). According to those emails, a Chipotle employee at the Hazel Dell location reported to work sick and remained at work \"for four hours and was vomiting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 132). In response, Chipotle initiated the Norwalk Protocol, indicating \"that at least two Chipotle customers were sickened.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 133-35). On December 21, 2015, Clark County Public Health officials completed a report on the outbreak \"verif[ying] that 22 individuals were sickened,\" including 18 customers and four employees.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"According to the CDC,\" its \"investigation into this outbreak was hindered by Chipotle's inability to trace its ingredients to the point of sale,\" and \"[t]he CDC never conclusively linked a supplier or farm to this outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 139). \"By September 3,\n   2015, ... an epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health[ ] had informed Chipotle ... of [the] outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 140).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On September 10, 2015, the Minnesota Department of Health published a press release stating that 45 cases of Salmonella had been identified. (SAC \u00b6 146). The Minnesota Department of Health published an additional release on September 16, 2015, announcing \"that tomatoes were the source of this Salmonella outbreak, that 64 Minnesota customers had been sickened[,] and 22 Minnesota Chipotle locations had been linked to the outbreak, and that Chipotle had switched its supplier for tomatoes in light of this outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 150). Ultimately, however, the Minnesota Department of Health was not \"able to conclusively link a specific Chipotle supplier or farm to the tomatoes that were the suspected cause of this outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 155). This outbreak nevertheless \"had a negative impact on the Company's operations and financial performance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 156).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    j.

(SAC \u00b6 157). The following day, Chipotle closed 43 restaurants in those states. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 158). In similar fashion to the Simi Valley closure, Chipotle \"post[ed] signs on the closed Oregon restaurants blaming the closures on 'equipment issues,' \" and \"similar signs were observed at several closed Chipotle locations in Washington that were blamed on 'supply issues.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 159). Also on October 31, the CDC became involved in the response to the outbreak, after it had been \"apprised of the numerous food-borne illness outbreaks at Chipotle that had already taken place during the Class Period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 160-61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Beginning on the first of November, media outlets \"began reporting that Chipotle locations had been closed due to an E. coli outbreak.\" (SAC \u00b6 162). This news \"[a]lmost immediately ... began having a significantly negative impact on Chipotle's common stock price and same-store sales.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 163). A day following the reports in the press, the FDA notified Chipotle \"that the 'FDA, CDC[,] and the states [were] working together to respond to this outbreak.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 164). And a day following that, on November 3, 2015, a spokesman for the Oregon Public Health Division publicly announced that the produce under consideration as the source of the outbreak was cilantro, romaine lettuce, and tomatoes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 166). On that same date, Chipotle issued a press release addressing the outbreak. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 167).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The following day, November 4, 2015, the CDC publicly announced the status of its investigation into the outbreak online, and the CDC periodically updated that announcement. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 168-69). These updates reflected that the \"investigation was ongoing,\" which, in Plaintiffs' view, \"meant that the CDC believed there was an ongoing threat to the public because the specific cause of the outbreak had not yet been identified and/or because several weeks' time had not yet passed since the last reported case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 169). By November 17, 2015, the CDC connected the outbreak \"to Chipotle customers in California, Minnesota[,] and New York, in addition to those in Oregon and Washington,\" and Chipotle was apprised of those illnesses no later than that same date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 170-71). The CDC reported these findings online on November 20, 2015.

(SAC \u00b6 173). The update provided further that among the individuals for whom information was available, \"whole genome sequencing has been performed\" on the strain of E. coli producing the outbreak from ill people in Washington, California, Minnesota, and New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 174). The testing indicated that isolates of that strain taken from those individuals \"were highly related genetically to one another,\" thus suggesting that \"illnesses outside the Pacific Northwest [were] related to the illnesses in Oregon and Washington.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"On December 21, 2015, the CDC provided another\" update \"reporting that 53 people were ill in Washington, Oregon, California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Ohio[,] and Pennsylvania.\" (SAC \u00b6 175). The update provided further that \"the most recent person reporting Chipotle exposure became ill on November 10, 2015, and 'CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance ... to identify additional ill persons and to interview them.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The CDC finally closed its investigation on February 1, 2016, when it calculated a final count of those infected by E. coli consisting of 55 people across 11 states, ranging from one- to 94-years old. (SAC \u00b6 176). The CDC was unable, however, to link the outbreak to a particular ingredient or supplier conclusively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    k. The October 2015 Multistate E.

(SAC \u00b6 187). No other individuals with the same strain of E. coli were identified as being linked to this outbreak, and the CDC failed to suspect or link any ingredient to the outbreak. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). By November 24, 2015, the CDC notified Chipotle that it was monitoring the outbreak. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 188). The CDC's investigation lasted as late as December 21, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 189).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    l. The November 2015 Multistate E.

(SAC \u00b6 177). Five people fell ill as a result of the outbreak. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Chipotle was aware of this outbreak \"no later than when the CDC learned about these individuals' illnesses, which was on or about November 26, 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 178).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On December 21, 2015, the CDC announced these outbreaks and that two Chipotle restaurants, one in Oklahoma and one in Kansas, were involved in the outbreak. (SAC \u00b6 182). On that same date,\n   <em>\n    The New York Times\n   </em>\n   also reported on the outbreak. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 184). The report noted that according to the CDC, the strain of E. coli detected in both the October and November 2015 outbreak was \"rare, with the CDC seeing it previously on only three other occasions,\" but that the DNA of the E. coli differed from the October outbreak to the November outbreak, \"meaning that the two outbreaks were unrelated and likely came from different ingredient sources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 183-84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On February 1, 2016, the CDC \"officially closed its investigation\" into the October and November 2015 outbreaks. (SAC \u00b6 186). The CDC confirmed that the two outbreaks had \"different DNA profile[s].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Once again, the CDC did not conclusively identify the source of the E. coli outbreak. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    m. The December 2015 Massachusetts Norovirus Outbreak\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On December 7, 2015, a Chipotle restaurant in Brighton, Massachusetts, experienced a Norovirus outbreak. (SAC \u00b6 191).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \"According to Chipotle, 143 customers were reported ill\" and \"Norovirus was the confirmed source of this outbreak.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). An email from a Chipotle employee to a CDC official indicated that an employee reported to work sick on December 3 and was vomiting, yet the store did not initiate the Norwalk Protocol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 193-94). The restaurant remained open at least until December 7. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 194).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Chipotle's Remedial Measures and the Market's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although seven of the above-described outbreaks were not publicly disclosed immediately,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   negative publicity stemming from other outbreaks during the Class Period \"was significant enough to cause the Company to institute drastic remediation efforts.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 196-97). In relation to the October 2015 multistate E. coli outbreak, Chipotle issued a press release on November 3, 2015, stating that the Company was undertaking \"immediate steps to assist investigators,\" as well as \"[r]etaining two preeminent food safety consulting firms ... to help the [C]ompany assess and improve upon\" its food-safety standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 198). On December 4, 2015, Chipotle issued another press release detailing the recommendations the Company had received from its food-safety consultants, including \"high-resolution testing of all fresh produce ... before [it is] shipped to restaurants,\" and \"[e]nhanc[ed] internal training to ensure that all employees thoroughly understand the [C]ompany's high standards for food safety and food handling.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 199). Also on December 4, 2015, Chipotle issued a Form 8-K detailing the \"adverse impact\" of the October 2015 multistate E. coli outbreak on the Company's financial and operating results in the fourth quarter of 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 200).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Individual Defendants also made public statements about Chipotle's remedial measures. On December 8, 2015, at the Sanford C. Bernstein Consumer Summit, Ells stated that the Company made \"system-wide\" changes, including dicing tomatoes in a commissary because the Company \"found it impossible\" to \"test every tomato coming into the restaurants.\" (SAC \u00b6 201). Moran echoed this changed approach, stating that the Company would transport romaine lettuce to restaurants \"having been already washed and tested.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Hartung emphasized the costs associated with the Company's remediation efforts, stating, \"when it's all said and done we're going to have really safe food and the investment's probably going to be outsized.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On December 16, 2015, Ells and Moran were interviewed by CNBC's Jim Cramer. (SAC \u00b6 202). During the interview, Ells stated that the Company \"couldn't do ... high-resolution testing in the restaurants\" and that the new procedures would \"bring[ ] the risk of contamination in [a] tomato, for example, to near zero when we do it in the central commissary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs posit that this \"indicated that Chipotle had initiated a move back to central commissary preparation for produce.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ells made similar remarks at a January 2016 \"ICR Conference.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 203).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On January 19, 2016, Chipotle issued an additional press release detailing its remediation efforts. (SAC \u00b6 204). The press release stated that the Company would implement \"comprehensive new food safety programs,\" which included high-resolution testing and \"[c]hanges to food prep and food handling practices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The\n   press release also announced that the Company would hold a national employee meeting on February 8, 2016, during which every Chipotle restaurant would be closed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). And indeed, on that date, \"Chipotle closed all of its restaurants and held a food safety symposium for all of its employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 208).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On January 28, 2016, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California served Chipotle with a subpoena that superseded the prior subpoena and \"broaden[ed] the scope of the criminal investigation.\" (SAC \u00b6 205). Chipotle expressed its intention to cooperate fully, and as of the Company's 2016 Form 10-K, the investigation remains ongoing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On the final day of the Class Period, February 2, 2016, Chipotle held a conference call in which the Individual Defendants participated. (SAC \u00b6 206). During the call, Ells reiterated his earlier comments on the Company's plan to rework its food-safety procedures, stating, for instance, that \"[t]he plan is designed to prevent unsafe food from ever entering our restaurants through the use of extensive testing and through washing in central kitchens.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Moran stated, in relevant part, \"[w]e are also completing a comprehensive food tracing system that will allow us to locate each ingredient we use from its source,\" and that \"the CDC has confirmed [that the E. coli investigation] is behind us and resolved, which helps to serve as an all-clear signal to our customers that may have been hesitant in recent months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Hartung again emphasized the financial costs of the Company's remedial efforts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On February 5, 2016, Chipotle filed a Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015. (SAC \u00b6 207). The Form \"included pages of new information and risk disclosures pertaining to Chipotle's food-safety practices, the risk of Chipotle experiencing food-borne illness outbreaks, Chipotle's food safety remediation efforts, and the fallout from the seven food-borne illness outbreaks that the Company experienced during the Class Period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Chipotle also undertook a number of hiring decisions that reflected an emphasis on changing its food-safety management. On March 15, 2016, the Company disclosed that it had hired a new Executive Director of Food Safety; this occurred during the same month in which Chipotle's Director of Quality Assurance and Food Safety during the Class Period departed from the Company. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 209-10). The new Executive Director of Food Safety has since \"led a comprehensive assessment and enhancement of Chipotle's food safety practices\" and designed a \"Food Safety Advisory Council\" within the Company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 219-20). Also, on May 11, 2016, \"media outlets reported that, in late 2015, Chipotle hired two food safety experts in addition to\" the consultants whom the Company had already hired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 211).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Since the Class Period food-borne illness outbreaks, the Chipotle Board has been the target of a number of derivative shareholder actions. (SAC \u00b6 212). In particular, the SAC points to two such actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado in the second half of 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 212-13). Plaintiffs assert that the \"redacted complaint\" in one such action,\n   <em>\n    Lashkari v. Ells\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16 Civ. 3180 (D. Colo.), \"establishes that the most senior executives and directors at Chipotle had knowledge of, or recklessly disregarded, the pervasive food safety problems at the Company by at least August 2015 and did nothing to stop their continued proliferation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 216).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Chipotle's financial results for 2016, presented in conjunction with its 2016 Form 10-K, reflect a substantial drop in profitability for the Company. (SAC \u00b6 221). Specifically, for 2016, Chipotle reported $22.9 million in earnings, \"compared with $475.6 million in earnings for fiscal year 2015,\" which represents a \"95.2% drop in profitability year-over-year.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"The Company directly attributed this drop to the negative fallout from the numerous Class Period [food-borne illness] outbreaks[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Alleged Material Misrepresentations or Omissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Based on the above factual allegations, Plaintiffs point to six statements or categories of statements by Defendants that are alleged to have been false or misleading when made. These alleged misstatements and omissions are contained in financial statements filed by Chipotle with the SEC and in press releases issued by the Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Commissary Switch Omissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The first statement that Plaintiffs claim is false and misleading, contained in Chipotle's 2014 Form 10-K, reads as follows: \"Our food is prepared from scratch, with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in larger batches in commissaries.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 222-23). The 2014 Form 10-K also states, \"We may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 222). Plaintiffs claim these statements were \"materially false and misleading when made because the 2014 Form 10-K omitted and failed to disclose that the risk associated with Chipotle's produce was even greater following a transition in late 2014 to in-store processing of produce instead of commissary preparation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 223 (emphasis omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Building on this theory, Plaintiffs also allege that the following statement was materially false and misleading: \"There have been no material changes in our risk factors since our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.\" (SAC \u00b6 225). This statement is contained in Chipotle's Forms 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2015, filed April 22, 2015 (\"April 2015 Form 10-Q\"); June 30, 2015, filed July 22, 2015 (\"July 2015 Form 10-Q\"); and September 30, 2015, filed October 21, 2015 (\"October 2015 Form 10-Q\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 225-26). Plaintiffs also contend that the October 2015 Form 10-Q was materially false and misleading because it failed to disclose the food-borne illness outbreaks that had only been discovered by Plaintiffs' counsel; that such outbreaks harmed the Company's operations and financial performance; that the Company failed to take sufficient remedial steps to prevent further outbreaks; and that as these outbreaks were disclosed to the public, \"they were reasonably expected to have an increased damaging effect on the Company's operations and financial performance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 227).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Quality Assurance Omissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs allege that the following statement, contained in Chipotle's 2014 Form 10-K, under the heading \"Quality Assurance and Food Safety,\" is materially false or misleading:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   We are committed to serving safe, high quality food to our customers. Quality and food safety are integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do; from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line. We have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry, and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase. Our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs for our supply chain. Our training and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality, preparation, cleanliness and safety in the restaurants. Our food safety programs are also designed to ensure that we comply with applicable federal, state and local food safety regulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 250-51 (emphasis omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs contend this statement was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   materially false and misleading when made because Defendants omitted and failed to disclose that Chipotle's quality assurance department did not adequately monitor Chipotle's food safety programs, that in 2015 Chipotle failed to live up to its own food safety standards, that Chipotle executives ignored internal [safety, security, and risk (\"SSR\") ] audit reports designed to assess numerous food safety metrics in individual Chipotle restaurants, that these SSR audits were inherently deficient because the industry standard was to use external, not internal, audits and because Chipotle would pre-announce the audits to the restaurants, thereby allowing them time to cover up deficiencies, and that there were insufficient controls and procedures in place to ensure that operating standards had been properly implemented and adhered to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   (SAC \u00b6 251). Plaintiffs also contend Defendants had a duty to disclose that Chipotle's late-2014 transition away from commissary produce preparation \"greatly increase[ed] the risk of food-borne illness being contracted from its produce.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 252). In addition, Plaintiffs tether this theory to the alleged misstatements in the Company's Forms 10-Q as identified above. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 253-54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Traceability Omissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs claim that a statement contained in Chipotle's 2014 Form 10-K regarding the Company's use of a variety of produce types and produce suppliers, including \"local or organic produce\" and \"farmers markets,\" was materially false or misleading. (SAC \u00b6 289). The allegedly false or misleading statement reads as follows: \"These produce initiatives may make it more difficult to keep quality consistent, and present additional risk of food-borne illnesses given the greater number of suppliers involved in such a system and the difficulty of imposing our quality assurance programs on all such suppliers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted)). Plaintiffs argue that this statement was \"false and misleading when made because Defendants omitted and failed to disclose that, regardless of the number of suppliers used by the Company, Chipotle lacked any ability during the Class Period to effectively or accurately trace ingredients through its supplier system[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 290 (emphasis omitted)). Plaintiffs also claim this statement created a duty to disclose \"that any produce-related food-borne illness outbreak from those suppliers would cause additional harm to Chipotle because\" the Company lacked the ability to trace any contaminated produce back to its supplier. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 291). As with the alleged misstatements above, Plaintiffs also tie the alleged misstatements in the Company's Forms 10-Q to this alleged misstatement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 292).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs claim that the following statements in Chipotle's November 3 and 10, 2015 press releases, respectively, were materially false and misleading: \"no cause [for the October 2015 multistate E. coli outbreak] has yet been identified by investigating health officials,\" and \"[n]o cause has been established between this issue [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the October 2015 multistate E. coli outbreak] and any ingredient.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 293-94). Plaintiffs claim that these statements were \"materially false and misleading when made\" because they triggered a duty for Defendants to disclose that because Chipotle lacked the ability to trace contaminated ingredients to a specific supplier, a cause for the outbreak would not have been identifiable, and that this inability would prolong any investigation into the outbreak by the CDC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 295).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Guidance Misstatements and Omissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs claim that the following statements, contained in both Chipotle press releases announcing financial results for the first and second fiscal quarters of 2015 and Chipotle's Forms 8-K filed April 21, 2015, and July 21, 2015, were materially false and misleading: \"For 2015, management expects ... [l]ow-to-mid single digit comparable restaurant sales increases.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 326-28). Plaintiffs allege this statement was \"materially false and misleading when made because Defendants did not have a reasonable basis to issue such guidance,\" given that the Company switched away from commissary produce processing, followed faulty food-safety monitoring protocols, and lacked the capability to trace any contaminated produce to its source. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 327;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 329).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiffs allege that statements contained in both a Chipotle press release announcing the Company's financial results for the third fiscal quarter in 2015 and the Company's October 20, 2015 Form 8-K, were materially false and misleading. (SAC \u00b6 330). Those statements included an estimated sales performance for 2015 identical to those in the Forms 8-K above, as well as an expectation for 2016 of \"[l]ow-single digit comparable restaurant sales increases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs allege that these statements were \"false and misleading when made,\" in addition, because when Defendants made them, \"Chipotle had experienced numerous food-borne illness outbreaks\" that negatively impacted the Company's performance, that Chipotle failed to take sufficient remedial measures to avoid further outbreaks, and that the Company would suffer further damage when the outbreaks were publicized.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 344-45, 351).

As to Item 503, Plaintiffs claim Chipotle's 2014 Form 10-K failed to disclose sufficiently a \"discussion of the most significant factors that make the [securities] speculative or risky,\" and that the 10-Q Forms failed to provide \" 'any material changes from risk factors as previously disclosed' in Chipotle's 2014 Form 10-K.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 351).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

(SAC \u00b6 358). The press release was issued shortly after the October 2015 multistate E. coli outbreak, and stated that \" '[h]ealth officials have concluded that there is no ongoing risk from this incident[,]' and that there was 'no ongoing threat' related to\" the October 2015 multistate E. coli outbreak. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs contend that these statements \"were materially false and misleading when made because they misrepresented\" that investigations into the outbreak remained open and ongoing, that there remained \"an ongoing public health risk and/or threat from this outbreak,\" and the statements omitted \"that Chipotle lacked a reasonable basis to make representations on behalf of public health officials[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 359-60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

On March 8, 2017, the Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss the FAC. (Dkt. #79). In doing so, the Court held that alleged misstatements in Chipotle's 2014 Form 10-K, April 2015 Form 10-Q, and July 2015 Form 10-Q were not actionable because no alleged facts showed that they were inaccurate or \"support[ed] an inference that any Defendants were aware of [any] heightened risk\" associated with in-store produce preparation, and that statements \"regarding Chipotle's food-safety programs and protocols [were] generalized statements that courts in this Circuit have consistently deemed inactionable puffery.\"\n   <em>\n    Chipotle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n    2017 WL 933108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As to alleged misstatements in Chipotle's October 20, 2015 Form 8-K, October 2015 Form 10-Q, November 10, 2015 press release, and an October 20, 2015 conference call, the Court held that although these statements may have been actionable, the Court was \"skeptical\" that they were material \"given the highly publicized nature of the outbreaks documented in the Complaint,\" but even so, the claims based on these statements failed because the FAC did not sufficiently allege scienter.\n   <em>\n    Chipotle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n    2017 WL 933108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12-13, *15-19.

The Court thus dismissed the FAC but granted Plaintiffs leave to amend, while cautioning \"that additional clarity need not require additional length,\" and \"expect[ing] that Plaintiffs will consider carefully the Court's observations in [its] Opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Consequently, Plaintiffs filed the SAC on April 7, 2017, which includes as an exhibit the Declaration of L. Scott Donnelly, Ph.D. (the \"Donnelly Declaration\"). (Dkt. #80). On June 7, 2017, Defendants moved to dismiss the SAC and to strike the Donnelly Declaration along with any paragraphs in the SAC relying on the Donnelly Declaration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. #83-87).

On November 1, 2017, Plaintiffs provided a letter \"to apprise the Court of facts and information obtained ... as part of [Plaintiffs'] ongoing investigation into the events detailed in the [SAC].\" (Dkt. #96). Defendants responded to this letter two days later (Dkt. #97), and on November 6, 2017, the Court endorsed Defendants' letter, stating that\n   Plaintiffs' letter \"relies on factual allegations not contained in the [SAC] and responds to arguments raised in Defendants' reply papers,\" therefore, \"[i]n the absence of a motion to amend or a motion to convert the pending motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, the Court does not believe that it can consider Plaintiffs' newly-proffered factual information\" (Dkt. #98).

In that vein, Defendants move to strike the Donnelly Declaration and those paragraphs of the SAC that rely on it. Declarant L. Scott Donnelly holds a Ph.D. in Food Science and is \"the former Director of Product Safety for the Nutritional Business Unit of Wyeth (Pfizer) Pharmaceuticals.\" (Donnelly Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-6). The Declaration offers Donnelly's opinion on food-safety standards and practices for fast-food companies; the effects of Chipotle's alleged shift away from commissary produce processing; Chipotle's alleged inability to trace its ingredients to their source; and the efficacy of other food-safety practices at Chipotle. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-42). As set forth herein, the Court agrees that it may not consider the Declaration in judging the sufficiency of the SAC.

Commissary Switch Omissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Court previously dismissed Plaintiffs' claims premised on Defendants' alleged duty to disclose any heightened risk associated with Chipotle's switch from commissary produce processing to in-store processing, finding that the 2014 Form 10-K's disclosed risk factors were \"both accurate and candid,\" and the commissary switch itself did not \"change[ ] these disclosed risk factors in a material way.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n    2017 WL 933108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17-18. As to the misstatements contained in the Company's Forms 10-Q, providing that there had been \"no material changes\" in Chipotle's risk profile since the 2014 Form 10-K, the Court found this to be accurate until Chipotle filed its October 2015 Form 10-Q, at which point \"four food-borne illness outbreaks [had been] identified.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12. The Court therefore held that the alleged misstatement in that 10-Q, which declined to update the risk factors since the 2014 Form 10-K, \"may be actionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   After reviewing the SAC, the Court concludes again that the 2014 Form 10-K adequately disclosed the risks associated with Chipotle's food processing. Indeed, the 2014 Form 10-K contained a lengthy disclosure of risks associated with food safety and risks that might arise as a consequence of acquiring and processing produce. Because of its significance, the relevant portion of the disclosure is reprinted here as presented in the SAC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   <em>\n    Our food is prepared from scratch, with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in larger batches in commissaries.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   <em>\n    On a small number of occasions one or more Chipotle restaurants have been associated with customer illness, and on those occasions our sales have sometimes been adversely impacted, at times even in markets beyond those impacted by the illness.\n   </em>\n   If our customers become ill from food-borne or localized illnesses or if an illness is attributed to our food, even incorrectly, we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants, further impacting sales. In addition, reports linking nationwide or regional outbreaks of food-borne illnesses have caused us to temporarily suspend serving some produce items in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu. Similarly, past outbreaks of E. coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains, Asian and European countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu, and incidents of \"mad cow\" disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illness (such as hepatitis A or norovirus)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past, and could have in the future, an adverse effect on the price and availability of affected ingredients. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, would adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability. Furthermore, if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the Chipotle experience, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable. Customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient costs resulting from supply problems associated with outbreaks of food-borne illnesses, which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   Furthermore, as we grow, the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained. Moreover, we have made a significant commitment to serving local or organic produce when seasonally available, and a small portion of our restaurants also serves produce purchased from farmers markets seasonally as well.\n   <em>\n    These produce initiatives may make it more difficult to keep quality consistent, and present additional risk of food-borne illnesses given the greater number of suppliers involved in such a system and the difficulty of imposing our quality assurance programs on all such suppliers. Quality variations and food-borne illness concerns could adversely impact public perceptions of Food With Integrity or our brand generally.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysists and investors because of various factors, including ... negative publicity about the ingredients we use\n   <em>\n    or the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other problems at our restaurants.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   (SAC \u00b6 423 (emphases and alterations in original)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Despite the length of the above disclosure, Plaintiffs argue not only that it was insufficient, but further that Defendants had a duty to update this risk disclosure in the Company's subsequent Forms 10-Q, given the addition to the SAC of allegations concerning \"Defendants' contemporaneous knowledge of five 'new' outbreaks that took place from December 2014 to July 2015.\" (Pl. Opp. 6 (citing SAC \u00b6\u00b6 45, 92-110)). Yet the SAC does not, and cannot, allege that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of these outbreaks was conclusively tied to a specific ingredient or supplier, much less to any shift away from commissary produce processing. The Court thus finds no reason to revisit its previous ruling that \"[a]ny heightened risk posed by that transition [away from commissary produce processing] was only potential, and the Company's disclosure of its probable, imminent risks was both accurate and candid.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n    2017 WL 933108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18. Plaintiffs also attempt to \"buttress[ ]\" their argument by relying on the Donnelly Declaration for the proposition that \"Chipotle's switch from preparing produce in commissaries to the individual restaurants greatly increased the existing risk of food-borne illness outbreaks[.]\" (Pl. Opp. 6-7). But this statement of opinion is exactly the sort of conclusory allegation that this Court may not consider in this procedural setting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 32-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Thus, with respect to Chipotle's pre-October 2015 Forms 10-Q, Chipotle was under no duty to disclose any further information\n   than it had already provided, as Plaintiffs allege no facts showing any appreciable uptick in the Company's disclosed risk profile because of the illness outbreaks newly alleged in the SAC.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Citigroup Inc.

The Court will thus proceed on the assumption, based on its previous holding, that one or more statements in the October 2015 Form 10-Q \"may be actionable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n    2017 WL 933108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12. But even as to those statements, the SAC fails to allege the requisite scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   If the \"new outbreaks\" add little to Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants were under a duty to disclose greater risks associated with Chipotle's food safety, they add even less to Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants knew or should have known that such increased risk even existed. After all, none of the new outbreaks was linked to a specific ingredient or supplier. Plaintiffs do not propose how these risks would be quantifiable going forward, or some other basis for further tailoring of Chipotle's then-existing risk disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   And although Plaintiffs argue that \"the SAC plainly alleges that Chipotle executives had contemporaneous knowledge of customer sicknesses,\" the paragraphs of the SAC to which they cite do not sufficiently allege, with the precision required by Rule 9 and the PSLRA, that any Chipotle employee was aware of, or recklessly disregarded, the illnesses associated with the newly-alleged outbreaks. (Pl. Opp. 19). Instead, they merely discuss procedures by which customers and officials\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   reported illnesses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing SAC \u00b6\u00b6 45 (\"Upon information and belief, at least one [Chipotle food-safety employee] would be apprised by local, state and/or federal health officials anytime that a Chipotle customer was sickened by E. coli or Salmonella during the Class Period.\"), 52-54 (discussing \"Chipotle's corporate policy regarding food-borne illness complaints\" requiring \"customers [to] fill out an online Customer Incident Report\")). Even here, the SAC does not allege that any customers or regulators actually utilized those reporting procedures for the newly-alleged outbreaks. Defendants thus cannot be said to have recklessly disregarded information to which they never had access. In sum, the Court's previous holding still stands: \"[T]he Company's decision to transition to in-store produce production [did not] change[ Chipotle's] disclosed risk factors in a material way.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n    2017 WL 933108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17-18.

Indeed, Plaintiffs do not contend that Defendants relied (or claimed in their public statements to rely) on their suppliers to guarantee contaminant-free produce; any such reliance might have triggered a duty to disclose that Chipotle had no way of verifying which producers supplied produce with contaminants. To the contrary, Chipotle disclosed that its \"produce initiatives ... present[ed] additional risk of food-borne illnesses.\" (SAC \u00b6 289 (emphasis omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Plaintiffs also claim that press release statements from November 2015, issued shortly after the October 2015 E. coli outbreak, and stating that a cause for the outbreak had not yet been identified, were misleading for failing to disclose that Chipotle's inability to trace ingredients was the reason that (i) a cause had not and would not be identified and (ii) any investigation into the issue would be delayed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 295). But the cited statements did not give rise to such a duty to disclose for much the same reason that the Form 10-K did not trigger such a duty: Defendants did not purport to speak-and no reasonable investor would have understood them to speak-to the intricacies of investigating an outbreak, but only to the simple\n   fact (undisputed by Plaintiffs) that no cause for the outbreak had yet been discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   In addition, no reasonable investor would have considered significant Chipotle's ability to trace ingredients through its supply chain in deciding whether to invest in Chipotle, and the alleged misstatement is therefore immaterial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3180650\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/590/603/#p614\">\n    590 F.Supp.2d at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs seek to establish such knowledge by pointing to statements by a Chipotle employee providing that the Company was undertaking efforts to install a traceability program in September 2015, but that as of November 2015, the Company had not completed this effort. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 300, 307).

(\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 305, 308).

Moreover, the SAC contains no facts suggesting that Defendants should have known that such a minute detail in the overarching topic of food-borne illness would have any significant impact on the Company's profitability.

(SAC \u00b6 348). Using the same theory, Plaintiffs include a claim under Item 503, alleging a material omission of risk factors in the 2014 Form 10-K. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 351-53). In addition, Plaintiffs bring claims under Items 303 and 503 alleging material omissions from Chipotle's October 2015 Form 10-Q consisting of the Company's failure to disclose several outbreaks occurring from late 2014 through August of 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the impact of these outbreaks, that the Company \"had not taken sufficient remediation steps to prevent further outbreaks,\" and that the outbreaks would have further negative impact once they became public.

As the Court previously held, \"Chipotle provided disclosures regarding its risks that were company-specific and related to the direct risks it uniquely faced; there can be no argument that these were boilerplate statements insufficient to satisfy the Company's obligations under Items 303 or 503.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <em>\n    Chipotle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n    2017 WL 933108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. And as to the Item 503 claim involving the October 2015 Form 10-Q, it bears noting that of the eight outbreaks Plaintiffs allege Defendants were under a duty to disclose, four were never linked to a certain ingredient or supplier. The Company's disclosure that its restaurants \"have been associated with customer illness\" \"[o]n a small number of occasions,\" as of October 2015, thus satisfied its duty of disclosure. (SAC \u00b6 423 (emphasis omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   In addition, because the commissary-switch claims failed for lack of scienter, the claims here premised on that same theory fail because the SAC does not allege a \"\n   <em>\n    known\n   </em>\n   trend[ ] or uncertaint[y]\" as required under Item 303 related to any such omission, whether in the 2014 Form 10-K or in any of the relevant Forms 10-Q.\n   <em>\n    Stratte-McClure\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6885987\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/94/#p101\">\n    776 F.3d at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). As to the Item 303 claims that mirror Plaintiffs' quality-assurance claims under \u00a7 10(b), as held above, the SAC does not sufficiently allege a material omission based on Chipotle's food-safety procedures and standards. And Chipotle's execution of those programs was not \"reasonably likely to have material effects\" on the Company's financial condition as required for disclosure under Item 303.\n   <em>\n    Stratte-McClure\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6885987\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/94/#p101\">\n    776 F.3d at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Item 303 claims mirroring Plaintiffs' traceability claims similarly fail as they did under \u00a7 10(b): They were not reasonably likely to materially impact Chipotle's financial condition.

These claims, as repleaded in the SAC, continue to suffer from the same inadequacies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   At base, this category of alleged misstatements and omissions is a \"second bite at the apple\" for three categories of misstatements just discussed. In other words, Plaintiffs are alleging that Defendants failed to disclose, in the financial projections sections of several of Chipotle's Forms 8-K, information that replicates Plaintiffs' commissary-switch, quality-assurance, and traceability claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 327). But recasting such claims in the context of financial projections in a Form 8-K only further attenuates them. Put simply, and for the reasons stated above, by speaking on Chipotle's expected sales, Defendants did not thereby acquire a duty to speak also on its switch away from commissary produce processing, its compliance with its own food-safety standards, or its ability to trace ingredients to their original supplier. Indeed, Plaintiffs make no showing as to how these factors were tied to sales, aside from the risks that Chipotle already disclosed in its 2014 Form 10-K. Plaintiffs contend further, however, that given these \"material adverse facts existing at the time,\" Chipotle lacked \"a reasonable basis to issue such guidance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Yet that theory fails for separate reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   As evidence of Defendants' scienter, Plaintiffs point to Chipotle's Form 8-K, filed on December 4, 2015, which provided financial guidance for fiscal year 2016 and rescinded the Company's \"previously-announced 2016 outlook for comparable restaurant sales increases\" due to \"recent sales trends and additional uncertainty related to the E. coli incident[.]\" (SAC \u00b6 338 (emphasis omitted)). Chipotle also filed a Form 8-K on February 2, 2016, announcing that the Company had observed \"[c]omparable restaurant sales increase[s of] 0.2%.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 339).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   But these statements-issued\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the alleged misstatements and omissions-do not support the notion that, at the time, Defendants issued Chipotle's financial projections either knowing or recklessly disregarding that the Company would realize lower sales increases than expected.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Poseidon Concepts Sec.

The Court struggles to understand how an accurate prediction of a downward trend evidences scienter.

November 2015 Press Release Misstatement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The Court next addresses the alleged misstatement in a November 11, 2015 Chipotle press release, following the October 2015 multistate E. coli outbreak, which stated that \"[h]ealth officials have concluded that there is no ongoing risk\" from the E. coli outbreak, and that the outbreak then presented \"no ongoing threat.\" (SAC \u00b6 358 (alteration in original)). Although the SAC quotes only those snippets from the press release, the latter of which appears only as a subtitle, Defendants have provided the press release in its entirety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Entitled, \"Chipotle to Reopen Northwest Restaurants,\" the press release announced that Chipotle would \"reopen all 43 restaurants in the Seattle and Portland, Ore[gon] markets that the company voluntarily closed\" with a \"fresh supply of all new ingredients.\" (Pl. Br. Ex. 10). It also outlined steps that the Company had taken both to ensure food safety going forward and \"to help health officials investigate [the] incident.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the press release misstated the then-current fact that \"the CDC's investigation was nowhere near conclusion.\" (SAC \u00b6 364). Moreover, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants knew this at the time because on November 2, 2015, eight days before issuing the press release, Chipotle employees participated in a phone call with officials from the CDC and the Washington State Department of Health, during which a CDC official \"stated that the CDC did not have 'a lot of confidence that this [outbreak] is only OR and WA and CDC [is] working hard to figure this out.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original) (emphasis omitted)). Plaintiffs also allege that the CDC maintained online updates regarding the outbreak, of which Defendants were aware, throughout November, December, and into February 2016, all of which \"consistently maintained that [the CDC's] investigation was ongoing, meaning that the CDC believed there was an ongoing threat to the public[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 365-66 (emphasis omitted)). Finally, the SAC recites statements made after the November 10, 2015 press release by Chipotle, its representatives, and the CDC, to support the notion that Defendants must have known that the press release was misleading. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 371-85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Yet this claim fails for the same reason that it failed as alleged in the FAC: Plaintiffs do not allege adequately that Defendants made a material misstatement or omission with the requisite scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chipotle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20933108\">\n    2017 WL 933108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17. Plaintiffs' current iteration of this claim is predicated on isolated phrases shorn of their context. Nowhere in the press release does Chipotle say that the CDC investigation had concluded; instead, the Company notes that after undertaking a series of remedial measures \"to make certain that [its] food is as safe as it can be,\" and after taking \"additional steps to help health officials investigate this incident,\" it was reopening\n   43 restaurants in Washington and Oregon. Arguably, there is tension between, on one hand, Chipotle's statement that as of November 10, 2015, \"[h]ealth officials ha[d] concluded that there [was] no ongoing risk\" from the outbreak, and on the other hand, the CDC's statement during the November 2, 2015 phone call that it was \"working hard to figure ... out\" where the outbreak was contained to Oregon and Washington. But reading Chipotle's press release as a whole, these statements can be reconciled: The press release is focusing on the 43 heretofore-closed restaurants, and not on the CDC investigation as a whole. Given the findings to that point, which included the incubation period for E. coli, the absence of a definitive link to any ingredient, the sanitizing of the restaurants in question, and the restocking with \"all new ingredients,\" Chipotle was comfortable reopening the restaurants. There is no suggestion that health officials perceived any ongoing risk or threat arising from the E. coli outbreak at these 43 restaurants, even as the CDC sought to determine whether the outbreak was contained to Oregon and Washington. This statement from the CDC therefore does not establish that the alleged misstatement was false, and Plaintiffs have similarly failed to allege \"strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\"\n   <em>\n    ATSI Commc'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3512868\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/87/#p108\">\n    493 F.3d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Plaintiffs argue alternatively that because Defendants were previously involved in CDC investigations lasting \"at least three weeks or more,\" Chipotle must have known that the CDC's investigation of the October 2015 outbreak \"would not be concluding less than two weeks after the outbreak began.\" (Pl. Opp. 20-21). Again, however, this proffered circumstantial evidence fails to show that the statements made were in fact false. Nothing suggests that Chipotle was able to, much less that it had a duty to, predict the length of a CDC investigation from prior, unrelated investigations of which it was aware. And the language cited by Plaintiffs is equally amenable to another, more convincing inference-that Defendants were only speaking of the 43 restaurants they were reopening rather than the entirety of the CDC's investigation. The inference that Plaintiffs wish to draw from this allegation is thus not \"cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p321\">\n    551 U.S. at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p321\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs' allegations regarding statements made by Defendants and the CDC\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   November 10, 2015, do not establish that Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that any statements made on that date may have been false.

Even if these documents indicate that the investigation was ongoing as of November 10, 2015, the SAC does not allege that Defendants were aware of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims based on Chipotle's November 10, 2015 press release are therefore dismissed. Further, because all of Plaintiffs' claims inadequately plead either a material misstatement or omission, or facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter, the Court need not reach the issue of loss causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

(Pl. Opp. 30 n.19). But these attempts to discover further information without any indication that such efforts would cure the deficiencies in Plaintiffs' pleadings do not assure the Court that amendment would not be futile.

At its core, the SAC faults Defendants for failing to disclose duties they did not assume; for failing to be prescient; and for presenting accurate, but general, discussions of material risks rather than attempting the impossible task of outlining the myriad possible outcomes. The food-borne illness outbreaks were unfortunate, but whatever else they might reveal about Chipotle, they do not on this record reveal securities fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Given the foregoing, Defendants' motion to strike is GRANTED IN PART and Defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE.

As discussed more fully below, the Court grants Defendants' motion to strike insofar as the Court shall not consider the Declaration or any conclusory allegations that the SAC derives from it.

Salmonella is an enteric bacterium, which means that it lives in the intestinal tracts of humans and other animals. Salmonella bacteria are usually transmitted to humans by eating foods contaminated with foods that have been handled by infected food service workers who have practiced poor personal hygiene. Contaminated foods usually look and smell normal and are often of animal origin, such as beef, poultry, milk, or eggs, but all foods, including vegetables, may become contaminated. Many raw foods of animal origin are frequently contaminated, but thorough cooking kills Salmonella. Salmonella is spread to humans when they consume foods contaminated with small amounts of Salmonella....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n    E. coli is a cause of illness, typically contracted through consumption of contaminated and raw food or water, and is highly virulent. The incubation period for the disease (the period from ingestion of the bacteria to the start of symptoms) is typically five to ten days, although shorter and longer periods are not unusual. E. coli is spread to humans when they consume foods contaminated with small amounts of E. coli.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n    Sick food workers at fast food restaurants are highly likely to be conduits for spreading, among other food-borne illnesses, Norovirus. Norovirus, also known as the \"Norwalk virus,\" is a member of the virus family Caliciviridae, which consists of several distinct groups of viruses. Humans are the only host of Norovirus, which has several mechanisms that allow it to spread quickly and easily. Norovirus infects humans through person-to-person transmission or through contamination of food or water. IN addition, Norovirus is able to survive a wide range of temperatures and has evolved to avoid the immune system, which results in outbreaks. Norovirus illness usually develops within one or two days after ingestion.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    (SAC \u00b6 92 nn. 9-11).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    These outbreaks were the 2014 Salmonella outbreak, the February 2015 Salmonella outbreak, the March 2015 E. coli outbreak, the July 2015 multistate Salmonella outbreak, the July 2015 New York salmonella outbreak, the August 2015 Washington norovirus outbreak, and the July 2015 E. coli outbreak.
