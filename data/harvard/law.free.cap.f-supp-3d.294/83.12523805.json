Foley (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Foley\"), as the Administratrix of the Estate of John J. Foley, III (\"decedent\"), commenced this medical malpractice action\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against the United States of America (the \"Government\") and the Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to the Federal Torts Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202671\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (Dkt. # 1). Foley filed an Amended Complaint on June 7, 2016, against the Government, solely on behalf of herself. (Dkt. # 25). She alleges claims for negligence, medical malpractice, wrongful death, and vicarious liability and seeks damages for her expenses and pain and suffering caused by her husband's death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Now pending are three motions. The first is the Government's motion for summary judgment. (Dkt # 37). In response, Foley cross-moved to amend her Amended Complaint. (Dkt # 39). She also submitted an additional letter from her expert witness, which the Government has moved to strike. (Dkt # 49). All three motions are opposed. For the following reasons, the Government's motions for summary judgment and to strike are granted, and Foley's cross-motion to amend is denied. Thus, Foley's Amended Complaint is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Overview\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Decedent died on February 4, 2011, at the age of 64, while a patient at Frederick Ferris Thompson Hospital (\"FF Thompson\") in Canandaigua, New York. (Dkt. # 37-4 at 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The immediate cause of death was septic shock due to toxic megacolon and [Clostridium difficile] colitis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Another significant condition contributing to decedent's death, but not related to septic shock, was his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\"COPD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The thrust of Foley's allegations is that Megan\n   Walters, M.D. (\"Dr. Walters\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   a doctor employed at all relevant times by the Veterans Administration Medical Center (the \"VA\") in Canandaigua, New York, committed malpractice by failing to timely recognize and treat decedent's alleged symptoms of Clostridium difficile infection. (Dkt. ## 25 at \u00b6 32; 40 at 15). However, as will be demonstrated below, Foley's claimed malpractice is a bit of a moving target, on account of the changing, inconsistent, and speculative opinions of her so-called expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Clostridium Difficile\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Clostridium difficile (\"C. diff.\") is a disease causing bacterium found in human feces. STEDMANS MEDICAL DICTIONARY 182620, Westlaw (database updated November 2014). C. diff. infection is a common cause of colitis-inflammation of the colon-and diarrhea,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and can be caused by the use of antibiotics, advanced age, and hospitalization, (Dkt. # 40-3 at 5). \"The most common clinical presentation of [C. diff. infection] is diarrhea associated with a history of antibiotic use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Decedent's Treatment at the VA from December 2, 2010, to December 7, 2010\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Decedent was admitted to the VA from Highland Hospital, in nearby Rochester, New York, on December 2, 2010, for rehabilitation related to a recent hip fracture. (Dkt. # 37-4 at 25). None of decedent's medical records from Highland Hospital has been submitted. Upon admission to the VA, Dr. Walters indicated that decedent was \"well known to staff and this provider from prior rehab stays[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Walters also noted decedent's extensive medical history, which included, among several other things, COPD, ongoing tobacco use, and history of traumatic brain injury, leading to cognitive disorder not otherwise specified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At that time, decedent was \"[m]oving bowels about every other day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Decedent's Treatment at FF Thompson from December 7, 2010, to December 21, 2010\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 7, 2010, decedent was transferred to the emergency department at FF Thompson because he became confused with hallucinations and more overtly short of breath. (Dkt. # 37-4 at 33). Upon admission, he was started on antibiotics \"for suspicion of healthcare facility acquired pneumonia.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This treatment improved decedent's condition, and he was discharged on December 21, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Decedent's Treatment at the VA from December 21, 2010, to January 27, 2011\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Decedent returned to the VA on December 21, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40). On December 27, 2010, decedent reported that he had been in \"pain all weekend, and ha[d] 'withdrawal symptoms' of loose stools and shakiness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42). Dr. Walters made notes addressing treatment for decedent's pain and shakiness, but not for decedent's loose stools. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Walters saw decedent again on January 5, 2011. (Dkt. # 40-2 at 4). At that time, decedent's main concerns were \"exacerbation of chronic pain, shakiness, and [shortness of breath],\" and he also felt that\n   he was \"in withdrawal from pain med[ications] as he has had some loose stools.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Walters noted that he \"likely would not be experiencing withdrawal\" symptoms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This is the last medical note from the VA regarding decedent experiencing diarrhea. In fact, on January 15, 2011, Nurse Beverly Davis noted that decedent continued to complain of constipation. (Dkt. # 37-4 at 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The vast majority of decedent's remaining medical records from the VA relate to his respiratory issues, chronic pain, and lower extremity edema,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   all of which Dr. Walters and nursing staff continued to monitor and note in decedent's medical file. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. # 40-2 at 7-11). Dr. Walters treated decedent's respiratory issues as bronchitis with inhalers and antibiotics, and noted that despite his breathing issues, he continued to smoke cigarettes and wheel himself around the VA in his wheelchair \"without getting too [short of breath].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). On January 14, 2011, Dr. Walters made a note that it was \"[u]nclear at this time whether [decedent] will be able to be managed [at the VA],\" but it is not clear from a review of that note why she said that. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On January 10, 2011, she also noted that she should \"[c]onsider palliative care consult-[decedent] has twice now expressed to me (today and last week) that he is thinking of his own mortality after most recent hospitalization.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 27, 2011, Dr. Walters examined decedent for increased difficulty in breathing and increased confusion, and she decided to transfer decedent to FF Thompson's emergency department for \"eval[uation] of hypoxia and resp[iratory] distress, [and return of] pneumonia.\" (Dkt. # 40-2 at 40-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Decedent's Treatment at FF Thompson from January 27, 2011, to February 4, 2011\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Decedent's chief complaint on admission to FF Thompson was respiratory failure. (Dkt. # 37-4 at 59). Within the first two days of decedent's admission, at least two doctors examined him-Dr. David E. Baum and Dr. Henry Castro Maglente. Dr. Baum indicated that decedent had experienced \"COPD exacerbation requiring ventilatory assistance,\" and noted \"bacterial bronchitis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64). Dr. Maglente noted that decedent exhibited \"some faint wheezing,\" and had \"normoactive bowel sounds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60). Dr. Maglente's \"Assessment and Plan\" for decedent focused on treating decedent's respiratory issues, namely COPD and pneumonia, and decedent's chronic pain issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 1, 2011, a third doctor, Dr. Ravi Agarwala, noted improvement in decedent's breathing issues, but also that he had experienced \"3 watery [bowel movements on January 31, 2011],\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 68), which Dr. Agarwala attributed to \"nosocomial diarrhea secondary to C difficile,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 80).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Decedent experienced further loose watery bowel movements on February 1, February 2, and February 3, 2011, and began to lose his appetite due to abdominal cramps and abdominal pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72, 74, 76, 80, 82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On February 3, 2011, Dr. Thomas Wormer opined that \"there [was] certainly concern for toxic megacolon,\" which was likely \"all related to [decedent's] C. diff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   colitis,\" and recommended that decedent undergo a colonoscopic decompression. (Dkt. # 40-3 at 33). Dr. Raymond Thomas performed the colonoscopy on February 3, 2011. (Dkt. # 40-2 at 44). Dr. Thomas indicated that decedent had \"[s]evere C. diff. infection and probable toxic megacolon.... He also [was] in respiratory distress as a result of his C. diff infection and respiratory status.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Thomas opined that decedent had \"[s]evere pseudomembranous colitis with decompression of the dilated colon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Afterwards, decedent's condition continued to worsen and he developed \"overt septic shock with hypotension.\" (Dkt. # 37-4 at 91-92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The Government's Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires summary judgment if the moving party establishes \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

His first opinion is that Dr. Walters should have transferred decedent to FF Thompson on January 18, 2011-as opposed to January 27, 2011-because decedent's \"oxygen saturations went down to 81% and [decedent was] telling Dr. Walters he was short of breath.\" (Dkt. # 37-4 at 96, \u00b6 4). He bases that opinion on Nurse Beverly Davis's note that decedent's oxygen saturation levels were low, and that oxygen was given to decedent that day \"with little effect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94, \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While decedent's medical records demonstrate that his oxygen saturations dropped on January 18, 2011, Dr. Mallory has completely failed to explain the significance of that drop or why those specific oxygen saturation levels necessitated a transfer to FF Thompson. This is particularly troubling because it is not apparent that decedent's oxygen saturations remained at those levels for the remainder of his stay at the VA, and because staff at the VA continued to monitor and treat decedent for his respiratory issues. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. # 40-2 at 38) (nursing note from January 18, 2011, indicating that Nurse Beverly continued to encourage decedent to use oxygen, that the RN was aware of decedent's condition, and that staff would continue to monitor decedent and report). In addition, Dr. Mallory has failed to make any connection between decedent's oxygen saturation levels and the alleged lack of care by Dr. Walters. Without more, then, this opinion is entirely conclusory and merely \"the\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   of the expert.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nimely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969202\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/381/\">\n    414 F.3d at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Dr. Mallory's second opinion is that \"when [decedent] was admitted to [FF Thompson] he already had [C. diff.] infection.\" (Dkt. # 37-4 at 96, \u00b6 4). In his opinion, this is based on decedent's \"recurring episodes of loose stools\" at the VA after December 27, 2010, Plaintiff's testimony that a patient \"in the next room [to decedent at the VA] had been in isolation for [C. diff.] enteritis,\" and that by January 5, 2011, decedent \"had had approximately 9 days of diarrhea.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94, \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Amazingly, the record supports none of those \"facts.\" For this reason alone, Dr. Mallory's opinion should be rejected. First, nothing in the record-beyond Plaintiff's own statements-demonstrates that a patient in close proximity to decedent at the VA had diarrhea associated with C. diff. There is no evidence from the VA that this was so. Dr. Mallory appears to rely on hearsay from Plaintiff, who has not set forth an admissible evidentiary basis for that opinion, and, of course, Plaintiff is not qualified to give opinions about the maladies or illnesses of other patients. Plaintiff had an opportunity to find support for this speculative allegation during discovery, yet failed to do so. Without admissible medical testimony to support this allegation, it is an insufficient basis for Dr. Mallory's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, Dr. Mallory's statements regarding decedent's \"recurring episodes\" of loose stools and that decedent had nine days of diarrhea at the VA are wholly contradicted by the record. Decedent's VA medical records indicate that he experienced diarrhea on two days, December 27, 2010, and January 5, 2011, not every day during that period. In addition, Plaintiff testified at her deposition that decedent \"complained of having loose stools\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   times during his admission at the VA[.]\" (Dkt # 45-1 at 3) (emphasis supplied). That confirms what is contained in the\n   medical record. It is also in accord with Dr. Walters's deposition testimony, in which she states that decedent had \"an absence of any sustained report of diarrhea or loose stools.\" (Dkt. # 37-4 at 108). Furthermore, there is no note in the VA medical records that decedent had diarrhea at\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   point from January 5, 2011, through January 27, 2011, the date decedent left the VA, or that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   staff at the VA suspected that decedent might have had C. diff. infection. In fact, there are notes that decedent experienced constipation after January 5. (Dkt. # 37-4 at 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court also finds it significant that no medical staff at FF Thompson recorded any signs or symptoms of C. diff. infection until four days\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   decedent was admitted on January 27, 2011. Beyond the fact that decedent was admitted to FF Thompson for respiratory issues, at least two medical doctors-Drs. Baum and Maglente-examined decedent within his first two days there and neither made a note about decedent having diarrhea or C. diff. infection. In fact, the first note about decedent experiencing loose watery bowel movements appeared on January 31, 2011. (Dkt. # 37-4 at 70). Even decedent's discharge summary after his death, authored by Dr. Agarwala from FF Thompson, indicated that decedent \"was initially admitted to the intensive care unit ... his breathing improved ... [and he] was progressively weaning off his oxygen and was doing better from a respiratory standpoint when he\n   <em>\n    developed\n   </em>\n   diarrhea which tested positive for [C. diff.]. Diarrhea persisted for approximately 48 hours.\n   <em>\n    At that time\n   </em>\n   , patient\n   <em>\n    began complaining\n   </em>\n   of some crampy abdominal pain.\" (Dkt. 37-4 at 91) (emphasis supplied). This suggests that decedent developed his condition not at the VA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Therefore, Dr. Mallory's opinion that decedent \"already had\" C. diff. infection upon his admission to FF Thompson is based on a grossly inaccurate reading of the record and pure speculation, which renders his opinion on decedent's C. diff. unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Houser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265995\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/470/#p475\">\n    264 F.Supp.3d at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding expert report unreliable under Rule 702 because it was \"speculative, based upon an unsupported and inaccurate interpretation of the record evidence, and posit[ed] blanket conclusory statements of causation and liability\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, Dr. Mallory has not attempted to explain his methodology regarding how he arrived at these opinions. \"An expert opinion requires some explanation as to how the expert came to his conclusion and what methodologies or evidence substantiate that conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Riegel v.

First, it is clear that Plaintiff has failed to establish that Dr. Mallory did have experience diagnosing and treating C. diff. And, as noted above, Dr. Mallory's opinions are not based on an accurate reading of the medical records. In any event, the Expert Report is simply devoid of any explanation regarding how Dr. Mallory's professional experience led him to conclude that Dr. Walters should have transferred decedent to FF Thompson on January 18, 2011, rather than nine days later, and that decedent \"already had\" C. diff. upon his admission to FF Thomson. In addition, as mentioned, none of the medical staff at FF Thompson noted that condition upon decedent's admission. Nor\n   has Dr. Mallory explained why his professional experience is a sufficient basis for those opinions, or how he reliably applied his professional experience to the facts. Thus, his opinions are completely unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Dr. Mallory concludes that \"[b]ased on [his] review of [decedent's] records and the foregoing analysis ...

As discussed above, Dr. Mallory bases this conclusion on either conclusory opinions or an inaccurate reading of the medical records.

Yet that conclusion does not match up with Plaintiff's theory of causation or liability. Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Walters committed malpractice by failing to timely diagnose and treat C. diff. in decedent. (Dkt. # 25 at \u00b6 32). Plaintiff does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allege that either worsening pneumonia or hypoxia was the primary cause of decedent's death. In addition, Plaintiff nowhere attributes worsening pneumonia or hypoxia to Dr. Walters's alleged malpractice. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, Dr. Mallory does not explain how decedent's worsening pneumonia and hypoxia led to his death by septic shock due to toxic megacolon and C. diff. colitis. Thus, this Court cannot say that Dr. Mallory's opinion as to causation and liability has a tendency to make Dr. Walters's alleged failure to treat decedent's C. diff. infection more or less probable.

This is problematic in light of Dr. Walters's testimony that, beyond decedent's inconsistent and \"intermittent\" reporting of loose stools, he did not present with clinical symptoms associated with C. diff. infection. (Dkt. # 37-4 at 106-08). Similarly, Dr. Mallory does not explain the standard of care as to when a physician should transfer a patient to a hospital, as opposed to continuing to treat the patient at a VA medical facility, based on oxygen saturation levels. Therefore, Foley cannot establish that Dr. Walters deviated from any standard practice of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hegger v.

In short, Dr. Mallory does not link his conclusory opinion on causation and liability, i.e., that Dr. Walters's negligence was a proximate cause of decedent's worsening pneumonia and hypoxia, to decedent's injury, i.e., death by septic shock due to toxic megacolon and C. diff. colitis.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 I.b). In short, Foley has not demonstrated that Dr. Mallory is qualified as an expert to testify about oxygen saturations,\n   or offer opinion evidence about when certain oxygen saturation levels mandate a transfer to an emergency department. In addition, Dr. Mallory's opinion that Dr. Walters should have transferred decedent to FF Thompson on January 18, 2011, is entirely conclusory, and thus, unreliable. Dr. Mallory does not state that decedent's oxygen saturations remained as low as they were on January 18, 2011, and his opinion fails to take into account the fact that doctors at FF Thompson indicated that decedent's respiratory issues actually\n   <em>\n    improved\n   </em>\n   upon admission. (Dkt. # 37-4 at 91) (\"[Decedent] was initially admitted to the intensive care unit ... His breathing improved and he was transferred to the floor.... He was progressively weaning off his oxygen and was going better from a respiratory standpoint when he developed diarrhea\"). Finally, his opinion is not relevant, as he does not explain how low oxygen saturation levels had anything to do with decedent's death.

Foley submitted the Mallory Letter in her sur-reply to the Government's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Government makes several arguments in support of its motion to strike. First, it argues that the Mallory Letter is inadmissible and cannot be used to oppose summary judgment. (Dkt. # 49-1 at 7-9). The Government notes that the Mallory Letter is unsigned and unsworn, and, moreover, includes opinions that actually contradict Dr. Mallory's primary Expert Report. In this regard, the Government points out that in the Mallory Letter, Dr. Mallory \"revises his ultimate opinion\" to state that \"both worsening pulmonary infection, and worsening gastrointestinal infection, contributed to [decedent's] death. Dr. Walters did not recognize, or recognized and ignored the worsening signs and symptoms of both of these, leading to an unacceptable delay in care resulting in the death of [decedent].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6) (quoting Dkt. # 49-3 at 8, \u00b6 8). According to the Government, this contradicts the Expert Report's conclusion that Dr. Walters's alleged failure to treat decedent was only a proximate cause of decedent's worsening pneumonia and hypoxia. Second, the Government argues that the Mallory Letter violates the Federal Rules governing expert disclosures and should be stricken pursuant to Rule 37(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Foley explains in opposition that \"the statements provided by Dr. Mallory [in the Mallory Letter] were to further explain on what he had read in the [VA's] progress notes.

(Dkt. # 37-4 at 94-97). He concludes that Dr. Walters's negligence was a proximate cause of decedent's worsening pneumonia and hypoxia, without opining that those conditions caused decedent's death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Yet the Mallory Letter contains a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   conclusion on causation and liability:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   The breach of the standard of care by Dr. Walters was the primary reason [decedent] passed away. Both worsening pulmonary infection, and worsening gastrointestinal infection contributed to his death. Dr. Walters did not recognize, or recognized and ignored the worsening signs and symptoms of both of these, leading to an unacceptable delay in care resulting in the death of [decedent].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (Dkt. # 49-3 at 8, \u00b6 8). Moreover, the Mallory Letter contains a previously undisclosed standard of care. Specifically, Dr. Mallory opines that Dr. Walters \"violated the standard of care because she failed to obtain a stool specimen for testing and failed to start [decedent] on antibiotics on December 27, or soon after.\" (Dkt. # 49-3 at 7, \u00b6 2). According to Dr. Mallory, \"any physician that practices 'mainstream,' 'up to date' medicine would order a panel of 'diarrhea tests' which include detection of C. diff. toxin,\" knowing that decedent \"was currently taking or had recently completed antibiotics ... [and] started having diarrhea on December 27.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Mallory Letter also contains new facts in support of Dr. Mallory's previous\n   opinion that decedent \"already had\" C. diff. infection upon arrival to FF Thompson. Dr. Mallory claims that decedent had \"persistence of diarrhea from December 27\n   <em>\n    until he was admitted\n   </em>\n   to F.F. Thompson hospital on January 31.\" (Dkt. # 49-3 at 8, \u00b6 6(c)) (emphasis supplied). He also claims that decedent \"had diarrhea on the day he was admitted to [FF] Thompson hospital on January 27.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). Essentially, Dr. Mallory's new statement is that decedent had persistent diarrhea for a month at the VA. Yet curiously, he cites no medical evidence to support that, and based on this Court's review of decedent's medical records, there is absolutely no evidentiary basis for that statement. In addition, that statement is materially different from Dr. Mallory's prior statement that decedent had nine days of diarrhea, which is also not based on an accurate reading of the medical evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The fact that the Mallory Letter contains this new testimony means that the Expert Report did not contain \"a complete statement of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   [Dr. Mallory's] opinions ... and the basis and reasons for them.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED.

Therefore, the second factor favors preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Third, the Court cannot say that the Government would not be prejudiced by having to respond to the Mallory Letter. The Mallory Letter contains new testimony and was submitted after the Government fully briefed its motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fleming v.

Sept. 22, 2006) (\"[Defendant] would be prejudiced by the admission of the [expert] declarations, because it made its motion for summary judgment based on what it thought to be all of the evidence accumulated during discovery.\"). Moreover, the Government represents that the admission of the Mallory Letter into the record would prompt it to \"file yet another motion for summary judgment[.]\" (Dkt # 49-1 at 12-13 n.2). This factor, then, favors preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, although no trial date has been set, the Court finds that a continuation of discovery is not warranted because the contents of the Mallory Letter \"clearly should have been included\" in the Expert Report, and Foley has offered no explanation for this omission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lidle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204907201\">\n    2009 WL 4907201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7.
