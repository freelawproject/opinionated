INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This case is before the Court on Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 3) and the parties' responsive memoranda (Docs. 25, 26). Specifically, Plaintiffs ask the Court to enter an Order enjoining Defendants, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, from enforcing Ohio's newly created law, H.B. 214, which becomes effective on March 22, 2018. The Plaintiffs here are abortion providers, and the Defendants are the state officials responsible for implementing and/or enforcing the new law. The parties to this lawsuit are identified more fully in the endnote to this Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    i\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts Giving Rise to Plaintiffs' Claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 22, 2017, Ohio Governor John Kasich signed H.B. 214 into law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   H.B. 214 amends Section 3701.79 of the Ohio Revised Code and enacts Sections 2919.10 and 2919.101. (Doc. 3 at 7). Section 2919.10 (the \"Ban\") prohibits any person from purposely performing or inducing or attempting to perform or induce an abortion if the person has knowledge that the pregnant woman is seeking the abortion, in whole or in part, because of any of the following: (1) a test result indicating Down syndrome in an unborn child; (2) a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome in an unborn child; or (3) \"any other reason to believe\" that an unborn child has Down syndrome. Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2919.10(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Violation of the Ban constitutes a fourth-degree felony, punishable by up to 18 months in prison. Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2919.10(C) and 2929.14(A)(4). The Ban further requires the state medical board to revoke the license of a physician who violates it and makes that physician liable in a civil action for compensatory and exemplary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   H.B. 214 also requires a performing physician to attest in writing that he or she is not aware that fetal Down syndrome is a reason for the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy. Section 2919.101 states: \"In the abortion report required under section 3701.79 of the Revised Code, the attending physician shall indicate that the attending physician does not have knowledge that the pregnant woman was seeking the abortion, in whole or in part, because of any [indications of fetal Down syndrome ].\" Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2919.101(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, H.B. 214 also requires the Ohio Department of Health to adopt rules to \"assist in compliance with\" Section 2919.101 within 90 days of its effective date. Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2919.101(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 15, 2018, Plaintiffs commenced this lawsuit.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49). The Complaint requests,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a declaratory judgment that the laws amended and enacted by H.B. 214- Ohio Revised Code \u00a7\u00a7 2919.10, 2919.101, and 3701.79 -are facially unconstitutional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the time of filing the complaint, Plaintiffs also filed the motion for preliminary injunction. (Doc. 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion requests a preliminary injunction declaring H.B. 214 unconstitutional and enjoining all Defendants, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and any persons in active concert or participation with them, from enforcing or complying with H.B. 214. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). Plaintiffs requested a decision by March 15, 2018, to provide time for an orderly transition in scheduling patients if H.B. 214 were to take effect.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a) permits a party to seek injunctive relief when the party believes that it will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage. Nevertheless, an \"injunction is\n   <em>\n    an extraordinary remedy\n   </em>\n   which should be granted only if the movant carries his burden of proving that the circumstances clearly demand it.\"\n   <em>\n    Overstreet v.

This Court agrees with the Southern District of Indiana that \"the very notion that, pre-viability, a State can examine the basis for a woman's choice to make this private, personal and difficult decision, if she at some point earlier decided she wants a child as a general matter, is inconsistent with the notion of a right rooted in privacy concerns and a liberty right to make independent decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    PPINK\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266446\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/859/\">\n    265 F.Supp.3d at 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, the State argues that H.B. 214 is justified by three state interests that were not considered by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   : (1) Ohio's interest in preventing discrimination, (2) Ohio's interest in protecting the medical profession, and (3) Ohio's interest in protecting the Down syndrome community.

This argument fails for the reasons asserted in Section III(A)(3),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   : H.B. 214 does not affect any \"person,\" as that term is used in the Constitution, with Down syndrome, and the State's interest in\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   life-whether couched as anti-\"discrimination\" or otherwise-does not become compelling until viability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, the State argues that a preliminary injunction will harm the State because \"any time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.\" (Doc. 25 at 31). This argument is not well-taken.
