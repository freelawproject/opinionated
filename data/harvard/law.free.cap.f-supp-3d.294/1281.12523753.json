BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Garrison, a 37 year old male, was an employee of Collision Center Payroll, Inc., also known as Joe Hudson's Collision Center (\"Collision Center\"), as an automobile body technician. As an employee, Garrison was a participant in a welfare benefit plan funded, in part, by group insurance policies issued by Lincoln. Lincoln issued two pertinent insurance policies to the Collision Center, each with an effective date of May 1, 2014: a long-term disability (\"LTD\") policy, and a life insurance policy (collectively the \"Policies\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Administrative Record (\"AR\") 46, 688.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Disability Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Disability Policy provides insurance coverage if an insured employee becomes totally or partially disabled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 49-52. To receive a Total Disability Monthly Benefit under it, the Insured Employee must meet four qualifications:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BENEFIT.\n   </strong>\n   [Lincoln] will pay a Total Disability Monthly Benefit to an Insured Employee, after the completion of the Elimination Period, if he or she:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) is Totally Disabled;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) becomes Disabled while insured for this benefit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) is under the Regular Care of a Physician; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (4) at his or her own expense, submits proof of continued Total Disability and Physician's care to the Company upon request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   AR 69. In order to determine whether an insured employee has met the first qualification, Lincoln looks to the definition of \"Total Disability\" or \"Totally Disabled\" in the Disability Policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    TOTAL DISABILITY\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    TOTALLY DISABLED\n   </strong>\n   will be defined as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. During the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period, it means that due to an Injury or Sickness the Insured Employee is unable to perform each of the Main Duties of his or her Own Occupation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. After the Own Occupation Period, it means that due to an Injury or Sickness the Insured Employee is unable to perform each of the Main Duties of any occupation which his or her training, education, or experience will reasonably allow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The loss of a professional license, an occupational license or certification, or a driver's license for any reason does\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   , by itself, constitute Total Disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   AR 56 (emphasis in original). Lincoln looks to the Schedule of Benefits to determine the Elimination Period and Own Occupation Period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 55. Thus, for the duration of the Elimination Period plus Own Occupation Period, Lincoln assesses the Insured Employee's ability to perform the Main Duties of his Own Occupation; thereafter, the question becomes his ability to perform the Main Duties of any occupation for which he is qualified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Main Duties,\" are defined as \"job tasks\" that \"are normally required to perform\" the occupation and \"could not reasonably be modified or omitted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 54.

Informing Garrison's counsel that \"an Independent Physician review was completed by Dr. Todd Graham who is Board Certified in Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation,\" Lincoln reproduced substantial parts of Dr. Graham's opinion.

Garrison sought only one such review and concedes that his seeking only one review resulted in his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his long-term disability claim. He contends, however, that this is a case involving exceptional circumstances such that his failure should be excused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In his response, (doc. 24) Garrison lists three situations he avers should qualify as exceptional circumstances: (1) his attorney's confusion, (2) his filing suit before the administrative appeal deadline, and (3) Lincoln's failure to explain the basis for the failure-to-exhaust defense before that deadline had expired. The Court will address all three in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   First, the Court finds that the letter itself was not confusing. Garrison's attorney appealed both the LTD benefit claim and the EOD benefit claims in a consolidated letter and Lincoln in turn responded via a single letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 91, 911. The record indicates that Garrison's attorney understood that he was appealing two distinct claims. Lincoln's letter contained a separate, thorough review summary for each claim, and explicitly stated whether Garrison had exhausted all administrative appeals for each respective claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 87-98. Notably, the LTD Benefits section clearly stated Garrison had \"exhausted\n   [his] first level of appeal\" and \"may pursue a final administrative appeal.\" Conversely, the EOD benefits section informed Garrison's counsel that \"[y]ou and your client have exhausted all rights of appeal.\" AR 93, 98. When read in its entirety, the letter is clear and unambiguous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   While the Court is sympathetic towards Plaintiff regarding his attorney's confusion and subsequent mistake, it does not find that an experienced\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   attorney's misreading of or oversight in reviewing Lincoln's denial letter qualifies as an exceptional circumstance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff has cited no binding case law, and the Court has found none, suggesting that such an occurrence would qualify him for an exception to the exhaustion requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Second, Garrison insists that filing suit well within the 180 day deadline for filing an administrative appeal should qualify as an excuse for the exhaustion of remedies requirement and be deemed and exceptional circumstance. The Court disagrees. The Disability Policy clearly states, that \"\n   <strong>\n    before\n   </strong>\n   bringing a civil legal action under the federal law known as ERISA, an employee benefit plan participant\n   <strong>\n    must\n   </strong>\n   exhaust available administrative remedies.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 62 (emphasis added). Indeed, \"[t]he very premise of the exhaustion requirement...is that the right to seek federal court review matures only after [the exhaustion] requirement has been appropriately satisfied or otherwise excused.\"\n   <em>\n    Springer v. Wal-Mart Assocs.' Grp. Health Plan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539776\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/908/897/#p900\">\n    908 F.2d 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 900 (11th Cir. 1990). Allowing Garrison's filing suit to qualify as an excuse or a substitute for the exhaustion requirement would run contrary to its essence and intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Third, Lincoln's alleged failure to explain the basis for the failure-to-exhaust defense does not qualify as an exceptional circumstance. The record indicates that Plaintiff had until May 8th before the 180-day appeal period ran out. Lincoln's Answer (Doc. 8) was filed February 14, 2017-more than two months prior to the appeal deadline-and explicitly listed failure to exhaust internal administrative remedies as an affirmative defense, putting Garrison's attorney on notice. (Doc. 8.) The precise time of when Garrison requested an explanation or demand for more information from defense counsel regarding the failure-to-exhaust defense is disputed. Plaintiff takes issue with the fact that Defense counsel waited until the day the appeal period ran out to return his email. However, Defendant insists the request was not made until May 1, 2017 and a one week response time was not inappropriate. The email response, sent at 9:34 a.m. on May 8th, stated that \"[n]o second appeal on the LTD claim was filed, so plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.\" (Doc. 27 at 7.) The Court finds that\n   the explicit explanation contained in the denial letter, coupled with the affirmative defense listed in the Complaint, was sufficient notice to Plaintiff's counsel, and that these circumstances do not qualify as an exceptional circumstance excusing a failure to exhaust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In sum, under the law of this Circuit, it was incumbent upon Garrison to exhaust the administrative process for his LTD benefit claim before filing suit. Evidence in the record does not support a finding that his failure to do so may be excused. Accordingly, summary judgment\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   is due to be granted in favor of Lincoln as to Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

However, Dr. Savage acknowledged Garrison had not lost the ability to safely and independently perform ADLs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 339-40. Moreover, Lincoln's reviewing physicians opined that Dr. Savage's sworn testimony is incompatible with his clinical notes. While he testified that surgery was \"not practical,\" AR 850-51, his examination notes from at least three of Garrison's visits, including the one in February 2016, unequivocally list surgery as a treatment option, and state that Garrison elected treatment through a combination of home exercise, weight loss, and medication.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   AR 342.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The reviewing physicians also found Mr. Long's Vocational Assessment to be insufficient in proving Garrison incapable of working in his own occupation. Beginning with the caveat that, \"it is important to\n   understand that a person can have the physical capacity to work, yet still be unable to sustain competitive employment,\" Long's report summarized Dr. Savage's opinions as well as the FCE results.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 826-27. The assessment of Garrison's personal ability to engage in employment and concern that he would be an \"unreliable employee\" who could not meet the \"persistence, pace or work adequate attendance necessary\" for competitive employment is expressed in a single paragraph, which listed only one specific reason for Long's conclusion-\"the pain reported by Mr. Garrison.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Lincoln commissioned an independent medical review of Garrison's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The board-certified reviewing physicians were Dr. Rangaswamy and Dr. Graham. Rangaswamy concluded that, \"[b]ased on the medical findings, the claimant does not have impairments that would translate into functional limitations or medically appropriate restrictions from 03/08/16 and forward. There is no documentation of well-defined objective focal physical findings that are commensurate with specific functional limitations. Therefore, there is no causal relationship between the subjective complaints and any restrictions and/or limitations.\" (Leela Rangaswamy, MD, Report, AR 928.) She also determined that Garrison's reports of \"difficulties with activity of daily living (ADL)'s [sic] [were] self-reported and nonspecific. Therefore, they [were] not clinically significant.\" She found that Dr. Savage's \"physical examination [did] not identify well defined objective focal findings that [were] commensurate with the need for restrictions and or limitations.\" AR at 929.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Todd Graham, MD\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   -who is board certified in Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation-completed a review by assessing all medical records and evidence submitted by Garrison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 113, AR 90, AR 109-110. Observing that the x-rays and MRI revealed Garrison had \"relatively mild, age appropriate lumbar degenerative disc disease with small right side protrusion at L4-5, small central protrusion at L3-4, and mild canal stenosis at T11-12,\" he noted that \"[t]he clinical examinations d[id] not reveal any strength deficits or neurological deficits in the claimant's lower extremities/lumbar spine.\" AR 110. Looking at the medical records as a whole, Graham surmised it lacked \"sufficient evidence to assess any functional limits,\" and in his opinion, \"[t]he restrictions and/or limitations placed upon the claimant's physical/functional activities...[we]re not reasonable and consistent with the medical\n   findings.\" AR 111. Indeed, \"[a]part from [Garrison]'s perceptions, no medical evidence was noted that demonstrated anatomical or physiological abnormalities sufficiently severe to impair the claimant,\" other than some limitations on the amount of weight he could carry.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031676\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/822/#p832\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In particular, Dr. Graham opined that the only method by which Garrison's functionality was assessed-the FCE-was not \"valid and reliable\" because it \"did not include any validity instrument [and was] significantly impacted by the [Garrison's] self-limits and perceptions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031676\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/822/#p832\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Graham ultimately concluded that Garrison was \"able to work full time with [some] restrictions/limitations.\" AR 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In his Response, Plaintiff's principal argument is that Lincoln failed to properly consider his pain. However, the record indicates that both independent physicians considered all evidence submitted to them when reviewing Garrison's claim. Garrison asserts that Lincoln \"should have considered Plaintiff's non-exertional limitations including those related to pain,\" because \"[s]uch non-exertional limitations can be important aspects of vocational capacity.\" (Doc. 24 at 14.) Garrison cites\n   <em>\n    Rabuck v. Hartford Life and Accident Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8363271\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/522/844/#p876\">\n    522 F.Supp.2d 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876-77 (W.D. Mich. 2007) in support of that position-which, in addition to being non-binding, does not aid him. In\n   <em>\n    Rabuck\n   </em>\n   , the medical reviewer's \"utter failure\" to even consider claimant's memory loss, the primary claimed disability, rendered his \"opinion incredible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8363271\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/522/844/#p876\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8363271\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/522/844/#p876\">\n    at 876-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, both reviewers here considered Garrison's pain as connected to his degenerative disc disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Garrison complains about the fact that \"neither of [the reviewing] doctors even spoke to [him], nor examined him.\" (Doc. 24 at 16.) However, it is well settled that reliance on reviewing physicians' opinions is permissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blankenship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5647633\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/1350/#p1355\">\n    644 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1357 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

The only specific reason Garrison lists for discrediting Dr. Graham's report is that his \"opinions are in stark contrast to Dr. Savage's.\" (Doc. 24 at 17-18.) This is not a sufficient reason for discounting the opinion of a consulting physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Plaintiff also takes issue with the fact that Lincoln required objective evidence to prove his total disability because the policy of insurance does not explicitly require it. He cites\n   <em>\n    Creel v. Wachovia Corp.\n   </em>\n   , an unpublished Eleventh Circuit case, to support his position that Lincoln failed in its duty toward him and wrongly denied his benefits because they should not have required him to produce objective evidence.

Jan. 27, 2009) (\"[A]n administrator's decision to deny benefits would be unreasonable if it failed to identify what objective evidence the claimant could have or should have produced, even if the administrator submitted the file for peer review.\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. Though the insurance documents themselves do not require objective proof, it was reasonable for Lincoln to require it.\n   <em>\n    Wangenstein v. Equifax, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20Fed.%20Appx.%20905\">\n    191 Fed.Appx. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 913-14 (11th Cir. 2006) (when an administrator is endowed with discretion to determine what it regards as adequate proof even absent an explicit condition of objective evidence in the policy terms). In the denial letter, Lincoln clearly notified Garrison that he could submit \"any additional documentation to support the appeal, such as medical treatment records, laboratory results, x-rays or other testing results.\" AR 93. Defendant's denial was not unreasonable for having not identified objective evidence Garrison could have or should have produced. Indeed,\n   Lincoln clearly did so, and gave specific examples of what could be submitted to appeal his denial a second time, as required by the policy terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   From the record, it is clear Garrison dealt with back pain for a number of years. However the evidence Garrison provided Lincoln to prove his disability claim contained discrepancies. It was therefore reasonable for Lincoln to question those inconsistencies, and instead give more credence to the conflicting conclusions of Dr. Rangaswamy and Dr. Graham, its reviewing physicians. The record does not unequivocally show that Garrison's pain rendered him completely unable to perform the duties of his own occupation\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   under the terms of the policies in such a way that would render him totally disabled. The Court finds that Lincoln's determination was neither wrong nor unreasonable, but was\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   correct. It did not err in its decision to give more credence to its own experts than it did to Garrison's treating physicians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slomcenski v.

Because Long relied heavily upon the opinions of Savage, Rangaswamy's conclusion that Savage's opinions were unreasonable would have been relevant to Long's evaluation.

The burden for the LTD benefit claim required only a showing that Garrison could not perform his\n    <em>\n     own\n    </em>\n    occupation, while the EOD benefit burden was higher, requiring a showing that he was unable to perform\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    occupation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    AR 56, 98.
