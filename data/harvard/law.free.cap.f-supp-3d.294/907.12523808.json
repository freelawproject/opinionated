In his amended complaint, Plaintiff asserts five causes of action arising out of his arrest, investigation, and prosecution for allegedly annoying or molesting a child in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 647.6(a). On November 17, 2017, ADA Moore and the County of Santa Cruz (collectively, the \"County Defendants\") filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. ECF No. 43 (\"County Mot.\"). On the same day, Officer Anderson, Officer Vasquez, Officer Zamora, Officer Moreno (collectively, the \"City Officers\"), along with the City of Capitola (collectively, the \"City Defendants\") moved (1) to dismiss the amended complaint; and (2) for a more definite statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 45 (\"City Mot.\").

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is a resident of the County of Santa Cruz (the \"County\"). ECF No. 24 (\"FAC\") \u00b6 3. At all times relevant to the\n   instant case, Officers Anderson, Vasquez, Rannals, Zamora, and Moreno were police officers employed by the City of Capitola (the \"City\"), and ADA Moore was an Assistant District Attorney employed by the County.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that on August 9, 2015, Plaintiff was taking photographs in and around the beach of Capitola\" when he was \"approached in an extremely belligerent manner\" by Officers Vasquez and Zamora.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Plaintiff states that, despite not having a search warrant, Officers Vasquez and Zamora demanded Plaintiff to \"turn over his camera to them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Plaintiff further alleges that after Plaintiff \"reluctantly\" gave the officers his camera, the officers \"arrested [P]laintiff for allegedly taking photographs of a minor without her permission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Specifically, Officers Vasquez and Zamora handcuffed Plaintiff and transported Plaintiff to the County jail, where Plaintiff \"was booked, fingerprinted, forced to pose for mug shots and incarcerated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Plaintiff alleges that Officers Anderson, Vasquez, Rannals, Zamora, and Moreno \"were all involved in the false arrest and incarceration of [P]laintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff states that he \"later discovered that he had been arrested for a violation of [ California Penal Code \u00a7] 647.6(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Plaintiff states that \"[a]s it turns out, one of the subjects of [P]laintiff's photographs was a minor who was at the beach that day posing for photographs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, when the minor was approached by Officers Vasquez and Zamora, the minor \"told them that she was totally unaware of [P]laintiff or his taking photographs of her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, sometime \"[a]fter [P]laintiff's arrest, the alleged victim was shown a photo lineup of 6 individuals including [P]laintiff,\" but was \"unable to identify anyone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Plaintiff posted bail and was released, ADA Moore \"continued to prosecute [P]laintiff for some 9 months ... even though there was no evidence upon which to prosecute [P]laintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13. Plaintiff states that he \"is informed and believes and alleges thereon that\" the City Officers \"conspired with [ADA] Moore to present false incriminating evidence to the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   13. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that after the alleged victim failed to identify anyone from the photo lineup, Officers Anderson, Vasquez, Rannals, Zamora, and Moreno and ADA Moore \"presented a false and misleading probable cause statement to a judge requesting a search warrant for [P]laintiff's home.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Plaintiff further alleges that his computer and \"other supposed possible incriminating evidence\" was seized pursuant to the search warrant, but that \"no incriminating evidence whatsoever\" was found.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Then, after \"9 months of persecution,\" \"the charge against [P]laintiff was dismissed by a Superior Court Judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Plaintiff alleges that the judge ordered ADA Moore to \"return all of [P]laintiff's possessions that had been seized.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. However, Plaintiff states that ADA Moore \"refused to return [P]laintiff's camera and computer, and told [P]laintiff that if he was going to return the camera, he was going to destroy the photos, thereby eliminating the evidence [P]laintiff would require in order to hold the defendants[ ] responsible for their unlawful acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff says that \"Defendants have still not returned [P]laintiff's camera and other seized items.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Accordingly, the Court DENIES the City Defendants' motion for a more definite statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   However, the Court notes that Plaintiff's sparse allegations have already led the Court to dismiss two of the three causes of action that Plaintiff asserts against Officers Anderson and Moreno-specifically, Plaintiff's second and fifth causes of action. Further, the Court notes that had Officers Anderson and Moreno moved to dismiss Plaintiff's first cause of action, Plaintiff's sparse allegations regarding Officers Anderson and Moreno would have justified granting that motion. As a result, Plaintiff is now on notice that the factual allegations in the FAC regarding Officers Anderson\n   and Moreno, although not sufficiently lacking to justify a more definite statement, will result in dismissal of all of Plaintiff's claims against Officers Anderson and Moreno with prejudice if Plaintiff fails to allege additional relevant facts regarding their conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the County Defendants' motion to dismiss, GRANTS the City Defendants' motion to dismiss, and DENIES the City Defendants' motion for a more definite statement.
