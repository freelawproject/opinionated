[Docs. 15, 32].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government opposes the motions. Based upon the pleadings of the parties, the facts of this case and applicable law, Mr. Nash's motions are hereby granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the evening of September 17, 2016, Hobbs Police Department Officer Jayson Hoff stopped a 2000 silver Cadillac Escalade for throwing a lit cigarette out the window and having an unreadable license plate. According to his report, Officer Hoff approached the car and, while talking to the driver, Mr. Nash, he observed signs that he was intoxicated. The driver told him he had a previous DUI conviction and had served time in federal prison for possession of drugs. Officer Hoff's video recorder was not functioning, so he requested backup with working video for a field sobriety test. Two other officers arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Hoff ordered Mr. Nash out of the car and conducted a pat down search for weapons, holding Mr. Nash's hands behind his back as he did so. No weapons were detected, but the officer felt what he believed to be a baggie of drugs in Mr. Nash's pants pocket. He asked for permission\n   to reach into the pocket, but Mr. Nash refused. Officer Hoff stated that he was going to reach into the pocket anyway. Mr. Nash jerked away and tried to run, but was tackled by the three officers and arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officers searched Mr. Nash's person and removed two baggies from his pants pockets. One field tested positive for methamphetamine and the other for marijuana. When officers searched the car, which belonged to Mr. Nash's grandmother, they found a firearm under the front seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant was charged with possession with intent to distribute five grams and more of methamphetamine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; possession of a firearm and ammunition in furtherance of a federal drug trafficking crime, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; and felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to Fed. Crim. R. 12(b)(3)(C), Mr. Nash moves for suppression of any physical evidence or statements seized as a result of his September 17, 2016 detention, search and arrest; and any statements made by him after his detention and arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Nash asserts any evidence garnered during the traffic stop should be suppressed because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A. Officer Hobbs lacked reasonable suspicion to execute the traffic stop;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   B. Officer Hobbs lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct on Mr. Nash's part to prolong the traffic stop beyond its original purpose;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   C. The officer's pat down was illegal because he lacked a specific articulable suspicion of danger that would permit a pat down; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   D. Even if the officer had a specific articulable suspicion of danger which would permit a pat down, when the officer went from conducting a pat down looking for weapons to trying to seize evidence of a crime, police \"crossed the line,\" and any evidence seized from that point forward should be suppressed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court considers each of Mr. Nash's arguments in turn and finds that the government has failed to carry its burden of showing Officer Hoff had not completed his pat down before locating what he believed to be a baggie of dope in Mr. Nash's pocket. Therefore, Mr. Nash's Motion to Suppress must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Initial Traffic Stop Was Based on Reasonable Suspicion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The government bears the burden of proof to justify warrantless searches and seizures.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

[TR at 10]. After the stop, when the officer asked him where he had been coming from, Mr. Nash stated that he had been doing some roofing jobs and lawn care with a friend earlier, and had dropped him off at the Broadway Apartments \"[o]ver there where them apartments is out there.\" [Govt.

The officer asked, \"[W]eren't you just pulling outta this apartment complex?\" and Mr. Nash then stated that he had driven through the complex because he was \"seeing if this girl was home, but she wasn't there.

[Govt. Exs. 4, Ex. 4(a) at 2-3; TR at 13-14]. Officer Hoff testified that during the initial stop, Mr. Nash's eyes were bloodshot and watery, and his speech was very slow and lethargic, leading the officer to believe he was under the influence. [TR at 19-20]. He stated: \"My training and experience teaches that some of the very common indicators for someone driving under the influence are bloodshot, watery eyes, inconsistencies in stories, inability to articulate normally, clearly, slurred speech.\" [TR at 20]. The audio recording confirms that Mr. Nash's speech seemed to be slow and slurred. [Ex. 4].] The officer asked Mr. Nash how much he had to drink that evening, to which he replied, \"None, sir.\" [Govt. Exs. 4, 4(a) at 6; TR at 21]. Mr. Nash also denied being under the influence of drugs, and reiterated that he had been doing yards and had allergies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108176\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/266/#p274\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Officer Hoff replied, \"[W]ell, I'm not talking to you 'cause, uh, it sounds like you got allergies.

Uh, I ain't did nothing,\" and \"you pulled me over for no reason.\" [Ex. 4, Ex. 4(a) at 7]. The officer told him again that he had pulled him over because his license plate was corroded and he had thrown a cigarette out and that was littering.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108176\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/266/#p274\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Nash responded, stating, \"I'm sorry about that,\" and \"I didn't think that was bad, I mean, for, uh, a cigarette.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108176\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/266/#p274\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Officer Hoff also testified that Mr. Nash's level of nervousness concerned him. He stated that while people pulled over for a traffic violation might initially be nervous, over \"the prolonged portion of the conversation, nerves usually go right away,\" and based on his training and experience, \"We were just having a normal\n   conversation at that point\" and \"the nerves didn't make any sense to me.\" [TR at 22].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court finds that the inconsistencies between Mr. Nash's statements and Officer Hoff's previous observations of where he was coming from; his nervousness; and his observation that Mr. Nash had slurred speech, bloodshot and watery eyes, and that his breath smelled of alcohol, provided a particularized and objective basis for suspecting he was under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. Therefore, the Court concludes that the officer was justified in lengthening Mr. Nash's detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

[TR at 31].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Officer Hoff testified that the following facts made him believe Mr. Nash could be armed and dangerous:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Nash's Delay in Pulling Over\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After the officer turned on his lights to initiate the stop, Mr. Nash did not stop immediately, but instead turned westbound on Highland, continued slowing for about a half block, then turned southbound onto Travis and continued approximately another half a block, before turning onto Bell and coming to a stop near his residence. [TR at 11]. Subsequently, family members and neighbors began to gather nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Mr. Nash's delay in stopping concerned the officer because, based on his training and experience, he believed it could be an issue with intoxication or \"they could be positioning themselves in a way tactically to harm me or positioning themselves in the vehicle to escape or flee detainment at that time. They could be setting themselves up in a situation to hurt someone from the community or someone in that vehicle.\" [TR at 11-12]. Additionally, Officer Hoff was worried \"someone could possibly be arming themselves if they had [a] weapon in a specific place and they had to retain it and get it on their person [to] put themselves in a position to be able to use, buying that amount of time by now pulling [over] right away was a concern of mine as well.\" [TR at 12].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    The Officer's Belief that Mr. Nash was Under the Influence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As previously noted, Officer Hoff believed, based on Mr. Nash's appearance and speech and the inconsistency of his story, that Mr. Nash was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Nash's Disclosure of His Criminal History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   While they waited for backup, Mr. Nash told the officer he had a prior DUI conviction, and that he had been in federal prison for seven years for possession of cocaine and methamphetamine, and was currently on probation. [Govt. Exs. 4, 4(a) at 11-14, TR at 23-24]. Officer Hoff testified this disclosure concerned him because, based on his training and experience, \"seven years is an extremely long time for just possession of those two controlled substances. I was concerned there might be more to the story, and we may be dealing with distribution or trafficking\n   of those things, of those illegal narcotics.\" [TR at 24-25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The officer testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Now, my immediate concern would be if he has-if he has been convicted of that and he was still involved in that enterprise, one of the absolute guaranteed tools with that are weapons, dangerous weapons, deadly weapons.

Additionally, he testified he believed Mr. Nash might be armed because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   I believe[d] that if Mr. Nash, due to his own admission, was still actively involved in the drug game in any way for his own benefit, there's no doubt that 100 percent, guns are what protect their enterprise and that subject could very well be carrying a gun and it would be expected on my part as an officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [TR at 32]. Officer Hoff also testified that he was concerned Mr. Nash worried about taking a field sobriety test because he could end up in jail, and that, as a result, Mr. Nash might try to flee. [TR at 33]. He believed Mr. Nash \"ha[d] a high level of potential of being dangerous and willing to do anything to get away with [his] freedom.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, Officer Hoff testified he was also worried because, while Mr. Nash initially seemed very lethargic in his communication, he became progressively more irritated and aggressive, stating, \"You pulled me over for nothing;\" and calling his wife and telling her to \"come out here-the police are messing with me.\" [TR at 33-34]. The officer testified that this concerned him because \"[w]hen someone is under the influence especially their inhibitions or maybe their judgment can be off-[a]nd when someone is irritated, they could absolutely be a threat to me.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    The Field Sobriety Test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Officer Hoff testified that the standard field sobriety test consists of three parts: the horizontal gaze nystagmus, the walk-and-turn, and the one-legged stand. [TR at 27]. The horizontal gaze nystagmus is an eye test, during which the officer is watching an individual's eyes. [TR at 28]. In the walk-and turn, the individual takes a series of heel-to-toe steps: nine down, a directed turn, nine back, along an imaginary straight line while keeping the hands down by their side. [TR at 29]. During the test, the officer's eyes are trained primarily on the individual's feet.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the one-legged stand, the individual is directed to stand with their hands down by their sides and raise one foot approximately six inches off the ground, keeping it parallel to the ground, and count until the officer tells them to stop. [TR at 30]. During these tests, the officer's attention is diverted, and the individual's hands are down by their sides.

[TR at 96]. He testified that the bulges in\n   Mr. Nash's pockets were relevant because Officer Hoff would be \"focused on multiple different areas\" while conducting the field sobriety test and he-Officer Marinovich-would be \"watching the surroundings, not just Officer Hoff and the driver. I'm watching my back, the officer's back, the houses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Officer Marinovich had positioned his car to video the field sobriety test, and was standing near the vehicle so he could reach in and push the record button, but had not yet turned the video recorder on when Officer Hoff conducted the pat down. [TR at 96, 105]. He testified that the camera system is a small screen towards the passenger side of the vehicle, and that when Mr. Nash broke away from Officer Hoff, he did not have time to reach in and turn the screen on before joining in the pursuit of Mr. Nash. [TR at 105].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on Mr. Nash's delay in pulling over, the officer's belief that he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the disclosure of his criminal history, and the risks posed by the anticipated field sobriety test, the Court concludes that Officer Hoff had a reasonable suspicion that Mr. Nash was armed and dangerous, and that, therefore a pat down for weapons was appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

He was tackled, handcuffed, and arrested. [TR at 35-36 (Officer Hoff); TR at 97-98 (Officer Marinovich); TR at 111-113 (Officer Buescher) ]. Officer Buescher conducted a search of Mr. Nash incident to arrest. [TR at 113].

Moreover, as in\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   , Officer Hoff never testified that he found the baggie before he determined that Mr. Nash had no weapon on his person. At first blush, this might seem trivial, but pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   , the Court is required to determine whether Officer Hoff had completed the pat down for weapons before he felt what he believed to be drugs in one of Mr. Nash's pockets. Had the pat down been videotaped, it might have shed light on this issue. Based on the record before it, however, the Court cannot conclude that Officer Hoff had not completed the pat down before he discovered the baggie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, the Court questions whether the mere presence of a baggie in Mr. Hoff's pocket was enough to justify a conclusion that the baggie contained illegal drugs. As the Tenth Circuit has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   As an experienced police officer, [the officer] may be uniquely qualified to distinguish between contraband and non-contraband items based on texture.

Holmes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Fed.%20Appx.%20156\">\n    311 Fed.Appx. 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160 (10th Cir. 2009) (unpublished).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that the government has failed to carry its burden of showing that Officer Hoff had probable cause to attempt to reach in Mr. Nash's pocket. Because the illegal drugs in Mr. Nash's pockets and the weapon and ammunition in his car were obtained as a result of Officer Hoff's attempt to reach into Mr. Nash's pocket, they are fruits of the poisonous tree and must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Mr. Nash's Motion to Suppress [Docs. 15, 32] is hereby granted.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In his original motion, Mr. Nash alleged that, after the initial traffic stop, \"Mr. Tafoya was arrested when he was ordered from his car at gunpoint.\" [Doc. 15 at 4]. In his amended motion filed January 7, 2018, Mr. Nash corrected the reference to \"Mr. Tafoya,\" but still stated that he was \"arrested when he was ordered from the car at gunpoint.\" [Doc. 32 at 4]. During the hearing, however, Mr. Nash presented no evidence supporting his allegation that he was ordered from the car at gunpoint. Officer Jayson Hoff testified that he did not order Mr. Nash out of the car at gunpoint and, in fact, never drew his gun. [TR at 31]. Officer Drew Buescher testified none of the officers ever drew their guns. [TR at 114].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The field sobriety test was never performed, nor was Mr. Nash subjected to a breathalyzer or blood test to establish whether he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. [TR at 68]. Officer Hoff testified that this was because, pursuant to department policy, after Mr. Nash was arrested and taken to the Hobbs city jail, he had to be provided medical attention and interviewed by a supervisor.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 68-69. The officer testified that, based on his training and experience, DWI testing should be conducted within the relative time of the investigation of the traffic stop, and it is not feasible to conduct testing 45 minutes after encountering the suspect.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 73.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    In response to the Court's questioning, Officer Hoff testified that while Mr. Nash was not under arrest at the time of the pat down, the officer considered him to be detained. [TR at 83]. Officer Hoff stated that \"[d]etention only means that he is not free to leave the scene as I continued investigating a crime. Not that he is under arrest, placed in handcuffs, put in the back of cars. His freedom is only detained for the purpose of the investigation.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
