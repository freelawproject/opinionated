However, it is \" 'the exception rather than the rule ... [and] resort to its prophylaxis is deemed justified only in extraordinary circumstances.' To establish a foundation for equitable tolling in the federal habeas context, a petitioner must demonstrate (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing. We apply equitable tolling on a case-by-case basis, avoiding mechanical rules and favoring flexibility.\"\n      <em>\n       Holmes v.

Therefore, the one year statute of limitations for filing a petition for habeas review in this Court expired on April 26, 2012-he did not file his Petition in this Court until April 27, 2017. Dumas did not file his first motion for post-conviction relief in state court on March 24, 2014 and the motion for new trial, which Dumas asserts raised the claims which are the subject of his Petition, was not filed until December 4, 2014-well after the expiration of the statute of limitations. A newly filed motion for post-conviction relief cannot revive an expired statute of limitations, where, as in this case, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts did not create an impediment to a timely filing of the petition, the petitioner is not asserting a newly recognized constitutional right (the Supreme Court case on which Dumas relies,\n      <em>\n       Melendez-Diaz v.

As pointed out by the Respondent, the MAC concluded that Dumas's claims regarding Fenesan's testimony and the admission of the Criminalistics' Report were both raised and rejected in his direct appeal, while the claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel was found waived for failure to raise it in his first motion for new trial (the state courts addressed and denied the claim under a miscarriage of justice standard); and (2) Dumas has not established that he diligently pursued his claims, or that extraordinary circumstances which prevented him from making a timely filing, and therefore, he cannot invoke equitable tolling.\n     </attorneys>\n    </footnote>\n    <div type=\"majority\">\n     <p id=\"p-7\">\n      <em>\n       <strong>\n        Memorandum Of Decision\n       </strong>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      <em>\n       <strong>\n        Background\n       </strong>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      Ray Dumas (\"Dumas\" or \"Petitioner\") has filed a petition under\n      <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n       28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n      </extracted-citation>\n      for Writ of Habeas Corpus by a Person in State Custody (Docket No. 1)(\"Petition\") alleging three grounds for relief.

This denied the petitioner a fair trial, which he is entitled to under the United States Constitution.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      This Memorandum of Decision and Order addresses Respondent Colette Goguen's Motion To Dismiss Petition For Writ Of Habeas Corpus (Docket No. 14). For the reasons set forth below, this motion is\n      <em>\n       allowed\n      </em>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      Respondent has filed a motion to dismiss the Petition as time barred pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), 28 U.S.C. '2244(d)(1),\n      <em>\n       et seq.\n      </em>\n      , which requires a state prisoner to file his federal habeas petition within one year of the date on which his state conviction becomes final. Respondent asserts that Dumas's conviction became final in April 2011 when he failed to file an application for leave to obtain further appellate review (\"ALOFAR\") with the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (\"SJC\") after the Massachusetts Court of Appeals (\"MAC\") denied his direct appeal. Dumas did not file his Petition until April 2017. Dumas asserts that his appeal is timely because the Grounds For Relief raised his Petition were first presented to the state court in his post-conviction motions filed in 2014-the SJC denied his ALOFAR seeking review of the MAC's affirmance of the trial court's denial of those claims on March 6, 2017, and his Petition was filed within a year of that denial. Dumas also argues that if this Court determines that his Petition is time barred, extraordinary circumstances exist which warrant the application of equitable tolling.\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-17\">\n      On April 24, 1996, the statutes governing habeas corpus petitions for prisoners\n     in state and federal custody were amended by the AEDPA to impose a one year statute of limitations period on the filing of all non-capital habeas petitions in federal courts.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      28 U.S.C. '2244(d)(1);\n      <em>\n       see also\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Zuluaga v. United States\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287030\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/971/616/\">\n       971 F.Supp. 616\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (D.Mass. 1997). In general, for prisoners in state custody, the limitations period begins to run on \"the date which the judgment becomes final by conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for such review.\" 28 U.S.C. '2244(d)(1)(a). The Respondent's supporting memorandum sets out the factual and procedural background of this case in detail and includes a comprehensive discussion of the applicable legal standards. Based on the legal arguments set forth in the Respondent's memorandum, which I adopt, I find that Dumas's Petition is barred by the AEDPA's one year statute of limitations and therefore, must be dismissed.\n      <footnotemark>\n       3\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-18\">\n      <em>\n       <strong>\n        Conclusion\n       </strong>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-20\">\n      Respondent Colette Goguen's Motion To Dismiss Petition For Writ Of Habeas Corpus (Docket No. 14) is\n      <em>\n       <strong>\n        <em>\n         granted\n        </em>\n       </strong>\n      </em>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-22\">\n      The statute governing appeals of final orders in habeas corpus proceedings provides that an appeal is not permitted \"[u]nless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability.\"\n      <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n       28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (c)(1).
