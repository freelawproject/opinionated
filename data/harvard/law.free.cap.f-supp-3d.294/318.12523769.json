She names as defendants Penn Valley Medicine Unionville (Unionville), her primary physician's office, which refused to see her when she presented; Chester County Hospital (CCH), where she was later taken by ambulance; Dr. Eric Parvis, the emergency room physician; and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania (Trustees), who own Unionville and CCH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   CCH moves to dismiss the claim under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) for failure to screen an emergency medical condition, contending that it performed a timely initial screening. CCH also argues that McClure fails to allege any facts that she was treated differently than any other patient with similar symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   McClure claims that CCH failed to perform an appropriate medical screening that would have alerted to her emergency medical condition, a right parietal hemorrhage. She contends that when she was examined almost four hours after her arrival at CCH Emergency Department, the emergency room physician characterized her condition as a \"[n]eurological emergency.\" CCH argues that a mere delay in treatment does not amount to disparate treatment. CCH also argues that McClure's presenting symptoms of vision problems and vomiting did not constitute an emergency medical condition that would warrant immediate attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because a significant delay in screening may be the functional equivalent of a denial of screening, McClure states an EMTALA claim against CCH. Determining whether there was a delay in screening requires resolving factual disputes after an evidentiary record has been developed. Thus, we shall deny the motion to dismiss the EMTALA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Trustees and Unionville move to dismiss the claims of corporate negligence. They argue they cannot be held liable because corporate liability does not extend to a parent corporation of medical entities or to a family practice clinic. In response, McClure counters that dismissal at this stage is premature because whether corporate negligence applies to a particular entity is an \"individualized inquiry\" requiring an examination of the relationship between the entity and the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether Unionville or the Trustees owed McClure a duty of care directly cannot be determined in the absence of a factual record. Thus, we shall deny the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the morning of September 8, 2015, McClure awoke with a severe headache and vision problems. She scheduled an appointment for later that day with her primary care physician at Unionville. Because she arrived fifteen minutes late, Unionville personnel refused to see her and directed her to go to an urgent care facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   She went directly to a nearby CVS urgent care center. She presented to the nurse practitioner there with a headache, disorientation, and vomiting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   An ambulance was called and arrived around 12:13 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The EMTs transported McClure to CCH\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Emergency Department, arriving at approximately 12:50 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon her arrival at CCH, the EMT noted she \"was placed in triage room and was registered.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The registration form indicated that McClure presented with \"Vomiting, Vision Problems.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The forms state she was admitted at 1:00 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   McClure was not seen by any medical personnel until 4:42 p.m., when a registered nurse took her vitals, recording her blood pressure at 171/88 and \"that she had a headache and had vomited that morning.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sometime shortly after 4:55 p.m., she had a CT scan that revealed a \"[l]arge right parietal hemorrhage.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The attending ER physician, Dr. Eric Parvis, designated her hemorrhage as a \"[n]eurological emergency\" and ordered her transferred by helicopter to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained hospitalized until September 14, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a result of the hemorrhage, McClure lost vision in her left eye.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   She now suffers from difficulties with balance and coordination, and participates in both occupational and physical therapy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    EMTALA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When an individual presents for emergency treatment, EMTALA obligates a hospital to conduct an appropriate medical screening; and, if the hospital determines that the patient has an emergency medical condition, it must stabilize the condition. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395dd(a) - (c) ;\n   <em>\n    Torretti v.

It does not create a federal cause of action for medical malpractice. Liability does not rest on negligence or malpractice. Even if the hospital did not deviate from the standard of care, it can be liable if it failed to appropriately screen the patient. Conversely, that a hospital committed malpractice or medical negligence does not mean that it violated EMTALA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A failure to screen or a delay in screening may be actionable under EMTALA. An inappropriate or faulty screening is not. The latter may be properly brought as a malpractice action, but not as an EMTALA action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   McClure alleges that she had an emergency medical condition and the hospital did not provide an appropriate medical screening examination to determine whether an emergency medical condition existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the EMTALA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   screening requirement, the statute reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In the case of a hospital that has a hospital emergency department, if any individual (whether or not eligible for benefits under this subchapter) comes to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, the hospital must provide for an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (within the meaning of subsection (e)(1) of this section) exists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   EMTALA does not define what an \"appropriate medical screening examination\" is. It does, however, state that the purpose of the screening is to identify whether an emergency medical condition exists. An emergency medical condition is defined as a \"medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in (i) placing the health of the individual...in serious jeopardy, (ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part....\" 42 U.S.C. 1395dd(e) ; 42 C.F.R. 489.24(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To meet the screening requirements, a hospital must develop a screening procedure to identify emergent conditions, and it must apply that procedure uniformly to all patients with similar symptoms.\n   <em>\n    Byrne v.

Thus, to state an EMTALA failure-to-screen claim, the plaintiff must allege that: (1) the patient had an emergency medical condition; and (2) the hospital did not screen the patient in the same way it screens other patients presenting with similar symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Determining whether a hospital meets EMTALA's screening requirement is a fact-specific inquiry.

It contends that the \"hospital personnel submitted multiple 'stat' orders for testing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   This may be true. But, according to the complaint, these tests were not ordered or conducted until several hours after she had arrived at the ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether the testing and examination was timely is a factual determination that is inappropriate on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, there was no screening done from the time of McClure's arrival at the emergency room at 1:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   until her vitals were taken at 4:42 p.m. She alleges that she had an emergency condition, a right parietal hemorrhage, and the failure to timely treat her condition caused her injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   CCH argues that a mere delay in treatment, standing alone, fails to state a screening claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, CCH mischaracterizes the case law. The cases CCH relies on involved patients who were triaged and examined upon their arrival to the ER.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The patients in those cases argued that the hospital failed to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination because the treatment was faulty, not because the hospital failed to conduct any screening whatsoever or did so too late.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The question is not whether there was a screening.

With respect to that argument, McClure may show that the hospital followed its screening procedures, but that the procedures were not reasonably calculated to identify critical medical needs. Merely because a hospital uniformly applies its screening procedures does not necessarily make it appropriate or adequate.
