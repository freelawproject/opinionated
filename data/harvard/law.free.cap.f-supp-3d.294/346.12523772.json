For the reasons set forth below, this court recommends that plaintiff's Request for Review be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In July 2012, plaintiff filed applications for SSI and disability insurance benefits (\"DIB\") under Title II of the Act alleging disability beginning March 3, 1997. (R. 173-86.) The claims were denied initially and a request for a hearing was filed timely. (R. 109-20.) A hearing was held on March 12, 2014, before Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") Frederick Timm. (R. 35-67.) Plaintiff, who was represented by counsel, appeared and testified. Steven H. Gumerman, Ph.D., a vocational expert (\"VE\"), also appeared and testified. (R. 62-66.) In a decision dated June 10, 2014, the ALJ found that plaintiff was not disabled under the Act. (R. 16-34.) Plaintiff filed a request for review of the decision of the ALJ that was denied and the ALJ's decision became the final decision of the Commissioner. (R. 1-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In October 2014, plaintiff sought judicial review of the ALJ's decision pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), requesting review of the Commissioner's denial of plaintiff's claim for SSI only; plaintiff did not pursue the denial of his claim for DIB. Plaintiff alleged that the ALJ erred in finding plaintiff's major depressive disorder did not meet or equal the requirements of Listing 12.04C(1), 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 and that the ALJ erred by adopting the opinion of the VE which was based upon a faulty hypothetical. In a Report and Recommendation dated February 25, 2016, the undersigned recommended that plaintiff's request for review be granted and the case be remanded to the Commissioner for further review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1594-1615. In response to the issues raised by plaintiff in his request for review, the court first found that the ALJ did not properly analyze the evidence of record when he determined that plaintiff's depressive disorder did not meet the severity of Listing 12.04C(1) because the ALJ did not properly consider whether the evidence of hospitalizations constituted episodes of decompensation under the regulations. (R. 1602-09.) Furthermore, with respect to plaintiff's argument that the ALJ erred when he found that the record contained\n   no evidence of episodes of decompensation while plaintiff was \"clean and sober,\" the court noted that a \"clean and sober\" standard is not congruent with the Commissioner's regulations. (R. 1609-11.) Accordingly, the court found that to the extent the ALJ relied upon plaintiff's use of drugs and alcohol as a basis for denying his claim for benefits, the ALJ had an obligation to engage in the proper analysis under the Act and its regulations.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(J) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.935\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, with respect to plaintiff's claim that that the ALJ erred at step five of the sequential analysis by failing to incorporate all of plaintiff's credibly established limitations in the hypothetical questions posed to the VE, the court determined that the ALJ's failure to properly consider the evidence concerning plaintiff's mental impairment impacted the ALJ's determinations regarding plaintiff's RFC. (R. 1611-12.) As such, the court recommended that when the ALJ reevaluated the evidence of plaintiff's mental impairment, the ALJ should reassess plaintiff's RFC and his ability to perform work given the impairments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By Order dated March 11, 2016, the Report and Recommendation was approved and adopted and the matter was remanded for further evaluation. (R. 1615.) On October 9, 2015, the Appeals Council remanded the claim to an ALJ for \"further proceedings consistent with the order of the court.\" (R. 1616-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court notes that plaintiff filed subsequent applications for DIB and SSI on December 16, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1793-1816. Upon review of these applications in January 2015, plaintiff was awarded SSI benefits at the initial level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1622-29. Plaintiff was found to be disabled as of December 16, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pursuant to the Appeals Council remand order on the present applications for benefits, a second hearing was held before ALJ Timm on October 31, 2016. (R. 1534-63.) Plaintiff, represented by counsel, appeared and testified, as did VE Christine Slusarski. In a decision dated March 6, 2017, the ALJ found that plaintiff was not disabled under the Act. (R. 1508-33.) The ALJ made the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. The claimant met the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act through June 30, 2006.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2. A decision is deferred as to whether the claimant engaged in substantial gainful activity from March 3, 1997, the alleged onset date, through December 15, 2014, the day prior to the date that the claimant was found disabled in the subsequent favorable determination issued on January 22, 2015 ( 20 CFR, 404.1520(b), 404.1571\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , 416.920(b) and 416.971\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   3. From March 3, 1997, through December 15, 2014, the claimant had the following severe impairments: mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis of the left ankle status post fracture and open reduction internal fixation ; mild degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine status post fusion; dilated aortic root/hypertension ; obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); asthma ; and major depressive disorder (MDD); and polysubstance dependence in partial remission ( 20 CFR 404.1520(c) and 416.920(c) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   4. From March 3, 1997, through December 15, 2014, the claimant's impairments, including the substance use disorder, meet section 12.04 (Depressive, bipolar and related disorders) of 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 ( 20 CFR 404.1520(d) and 416.920(d) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   5. From March 3, 1997, through December 15, 2014, if the claimant stopped the substance use, the remaining\n   limitations would cause more than a minimal impact on the claimant's ability to perform basic work activities; therefore, the claimant would continue to have a severe impairment or combination of impairments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   6. From March 3, 1997, through December 15, 2014, if the claimant stopped the substance use, the claimant would not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals any of the impairments listed in 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 ( 20 CFR 404.1520(d) and 416.920(d) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   7. From March 3, 1997, through December 15, 2014, if the claimant stopped the substance use, the claimant would have the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b) except: cannot operate foot controls with one lower extremity; must never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; can perform the other postural maneuvers on occasion; and must avoid concentrated exposure to extreme cold, extreme heat, wetness, humidity, and environmental irritants. From a mental standpoint the claimant is limited to unskilled tasks that are goal-oriented rather than production-paced; no significant interaction with the general public; no more than occasional interaction with supervisors and co-workers; and requires a stable workplace, defined as involving few if any changes of setting, processes, and tools.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   8. The claimant has no past relevant work ( 20 CFR 404.1565 and 416.965 ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   9. The claimant was born on March 16, 1962 and was 34 years old, which is defined as a younger individual age 18-49, on the alleged disability onset date ( 20 CFR 404.1563 and 416.963 ). On March 15, 2012, the claimant's age category changed to an individual closely approaching advanced age ( 20 CFR 404.1563 and 416.963 ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   10. The claimant has at least a high school education and is able to communicate in English ( 20 CFR 404.1564 and 416.964 ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   11. Transferability of job skills is not an issue because the claimant does not have past relevant work ( 20 CFR 404.1568 and 416.968 ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   12. From March 3, 1997, through December 15, 2014, if the claimant stopped the substance use, considering the claimant's age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, there would be a significant number of jobs in the national economy that the claimant could perform ( 20 CFR 404.1560(c), 404.1566, 416.960(c), and 416.966 ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   13. With respect to the period from March 3, 1997, through December 15, 2014, the substance use disorder is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability because the claimant would not be disabled if he stopped the substance use ( 20 CFR 404.1520(g), 404.1535, 416.920(g) and 416.935 ). Because the substance use disorder is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability, the claimant has not been disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act at any time from March 3, 1997, the alleged onset date, through December 15, 2014, the day prior to the date that the claimant was found disabled in the\n   subsequent favorable determination issued on January 22, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (R. 1514-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff did not file a request for review with the Appeals Council,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 3, making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner. Plaintiff now seeks judicial review of the ALJ's decision pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Once again, plaintiff seeks review of the denial of his claim for SSI benefits only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 2. Accordingly, the court will not address the claim for DIB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   When remanding the present case for further review, the Appeals Council stated that it neither affirmed nor reopened the State agency award of benefits on plaintiff's subsequent application, and directed that the period for review before the ALJ was limited to the period prior to December 16, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1512, 1618. In his decision, the ALJ addressed plaintiff's subsequent, successful SSI claim as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   In that more than two years have passed since the State agency issued a favorable determination on January 22, 2015, finding the claimant disabled beginning December 16, 2014, based on the subsequent claim for Title XVI disability benefits filed on December 16, 2014, and there is no evidence of fraud or similar fault, the undersigned Administrative Law Judge will not reopen this favorable determination ( 20 CFR 416.1487 and 416.1488 ). The claimant is alleging disability since March 3, 1997. As a result, this decision is limited to the closed period from March 3, 1997, the alleged onset date, through December 15, 2014, the day prior to the date that the claimant was found disabled in the favorable determination issued on January 22, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (R. 1512.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(R. 1538.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At the time of the October 2016 administrative hearing, plaintiff had been living in an apartment in Wayne, Pennsylvania with a friend for the past three to four months. (R. 1547.) Prior to that time, plaintiff rented a room in a friend's home and also lived with his sister for a time. (R. 1548.) Plaintiff has two children; he had not seen them in person \"in a little bit\" but he paid child support. (R. 1551-52.) In the past, plaintiff helped his brother perform \"odd jobs,\" but plaintiff indicated that he does not have the necessary energy to perform work. (R. 1552.) Plaintiff does not have a driver's license. (R. 1553.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   With respect to his mental impairments, plaintiff explained that since the date of the first administrative hearing, his major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder have remained \"about the same.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff described sleep difficulties due to depression and sleep apnea. (R. 1539-40.) Plaintiff also indicated that he does not feel motivated and has experienced a \"loss of interest in things.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff confirmed that he continues to take a variety of psychotropic medication as prescribed by Laszlo Gyulai, M.D., the staff psychiatrist at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff confirmed that his medication regimen includes Trazanol, Aripiprazole, Uprocrean, and Nirtazapine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (R. 1539.) Plaintiff is also prescribed medication for pain. (R. 1543.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With respect to social interactions, plaintiff stated that his relationship with his older sister and mother had \"improved a little bit\" because they now \"understand [more] what [plaintiff is] going through.\" (R. 1540.) However, plaintiff explained such improvement pertained only to his relationship with his older sister and mother because plaintiff has \"no friends that [he goes] out with or talk[s] to.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff also explained that, due to anxiety, he has difficulty being in crowds or utilizing public transportation. (R. 1541.) In addition, plaintiff described problems with concentration and focus.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff represented that he continues to have symptoms of depression and anxiety even when he is drug free. (R. 1543.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff stated that he had not used substances \"for at least the last six months\" and that he \"had a beer or two.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff indicated that he received out-patient mental health services through the Veterans Administration, but had been unable to get to the VA in Philadelphia because he was living in Wayne and had difficulty arranging transportation to the Philadelphia VA facilities. (R. 1550-51.) Plaintiff moved to Wayne because the person with whom he was previously living was an alcoholic and the environment was not safe for plaintiff. (R. 1551.) The friend that plaintiff lived with at the time of the administrative hearing also was a veteran and plaintiff indicated that he felt \"a little bit more relaxed and comfortable around other veterans.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With respect to his physical abilities, plaintiff had spinal fusion surgery in 2000. (R. 1541-42.) He continues to have pain in his left leg due to a herniated disc that caused nerve damage. (R. 1542.) In 2006, plaintiff broke his ankle; to repair the break, surgeons inserted five screws and a plate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff stated that he remains unable to pivot or step backward due to continued ankle pain and weakness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff also described arthritis in his left ankle, hips, elbow, back and neck. (R. 1544.) Plaintiff was advised that he has nerve damage in his left arm; plaintiff explained that this causes a tingling sensation in his left arm to his thumb. (R. 1549.) Plaintiff sometimes utilizes a cane, such as when he climbs stairs, but was advised by his doctor that he should not \"depend on it all the time.\" (R. 1544-45.) Plaintiff also has asthma, for which he was hospitalized on two separate occasions in the year prior to the administrative hearing. (R. 1548-49.) In addition, plaintiff experienced recurrent syncope and was hospitalized to determine why he was \"passing out.\" (R. 1549.) Plaintiff has a c-pap device for obstructive sleep apnea, but acknowledged that he does not always use the device because it is ill-fitting. (R. 1545-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With respect to the vocational testimony, the ALJ first indicated that he would \"rely on Dr. Gumerman's testimony [from the first administrative hearing] that there was past work here as a Sheer Operator and a Handheld Crane Operator, and that these were heavy and medium, respectively, with no transferable skills to sedentary exertion.\" (R. 1555.) The ALJ then stated that he would pose hypothetical questions to VE Slusarski about other work that the hypothetical individual could perform.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ stated that he would \"recite the RFC I reached previously for you\" and \"I am going to ask about the impact of reduction in standing and walking mentioned by counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The RFC I reached previously was for light exertion, generally, no foot controls with one lower extremity, meaning the left lower extremity, not that, I don't think it matters, but-never to climb ladder, rope, scaffold.

Needing to\n   avoid concentrated exposure to extreme cold, extreme heat, wetness, humidity and environmental irritants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   And then in the mental domain, limited to unskilled tasks, to goal oriented, rather than production paced tasks, no significant interaction with the general public, no more than occasional interaction with supervisors and coworkers, and requiring stable work place, meaning few if any changes of setting, processes and tools.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (R. 1555-56.) Plaintiff's counsel then questioned the ALJ whether the use of the RFC and hypothetical questions fashioned at the first administrative hearing would be in contravention of the court's remand directive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1556-57. In response, the ALJ indicated that he would \"again consider all hypotheticals presented, both by myself in the previous hearing, by you on cross-examination to Dr. Gumerman. And now I'm going to present an additional hypothetical to Ms. Slusarski.\" (R. 1557.) The ALJ then asked the VE to consider what impact, if any, a \"reduction to standing and walking three to four hours of the eight-hour work day\" would have on the light occupations of sorter, packer and laundry worker. (R. 1558.) VE Slusarski opined that such reduction would not eliminate the identified occupations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711394\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/88/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Once again, plaintiff's attorney requested clarification from the ALJ whether the ALJ was presenting to the VE a new hypothetical question, or whether the ALJ was relying upon the same question from the prior hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1558-61. After discussing this court's remand recommendation and certain of the opinion evidence of record, the ALJ indicated that he would not pose any further questions to VE Slusarski. The ALJ stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   All right. So do you have any questions for Ms. Slusarski? I, essentially, am going to rely on Dr. Gumerman's testimony. Because on further review, I think it really did cover all of the relevant hypothetical limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (R. 1562.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Social Security Act was amended in 1996 to preclude an award of benefits if drug addiction or alcoholism (\"DAA\") would be \"a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(J). The Commissioner's regulations provide that if a claimant is found disabled and the record contains medical evidence of DAA, the ALJ must determine whether DAA is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.935\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The regulations further state that in determining whether DAA is a contributing factor material to an individual's disability, the \"key factor\" is \"whether we would still find [the claimant] disabled if [he] stopped using drugs or alcohol.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.935\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). To make this determination, the ALJ must evaluate which of the claimant's physical and mental limitations would remain if the claimant stopped using drugs or alcohol.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.935\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). The ALJ must then determine whether any or all of the claimant's remaining limitations would be disabling.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.935\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On remand, the ALJ in the case at bar evaluated plaintiff's claim, considering whether substance use is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability. In so doing, the ALJ found that the evidence of record establishes plaintiff had the following severe impairments from March 3, 1997 through December 15, 2014: mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis of the left ankle status post fracture and open reduction internal fixation ; mild degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine status post fusion; dilated aortic root/hypertension ; obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); asthma ; major depressive disorder (MDD); and polysubstance dependence in\n   partial remission, impairments which do not meet or medically equal one of the impairments listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. (R. 1515.) The ALJ further found that, from March 3, 1997, though December 15, 2014, if plaintiff stopped the substance use, the remaining limitations would cause more than minimal impact on plaintiff's ability to perform basic work activities; therefore, plaintiff would continue to have a severe impairment or combination of impairments. (R. 1518.) Ultimately, the ALJ concluded that plaintiff retained the residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to perform a limited range of light work and that there would be a significant number of jobs in the national economy that plaintiff could perform. (R. 1520, 1525.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff contends that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ's decision. Specifically, plaintiff argues that the ALJ improperly determined that substance use was a contributing factor material to the determination of disability, and that the ALJ erred in assessing plaintiff's RFC because the ALJ relied upon VE testimony that was based upon an incomplete hypothetical question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 9-21; Pl.'s Reply at 3-10. Both of these assertions relate to the ALJ's RFC determination and the mental health related determinations therein. Defendant maintains that substantial evidence supports the decision of the ALJ. (Def.'s Br. at 4-13.) The court will address plaintiff's second argument first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mental RFC/Hypothetical to the VE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Commissioner's regulations provide that if a claimant's impairments do not meet or equal a listed impairment, the RFC assessment is used at step four of the sequential evaluation process to determine if a claimant can do his past relevant work and at step five to determine if the claimant can adjust to other work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), 416.960, 416.962.

(Pl.'s Br. at 16-21; Pl.'s Reply at 3-6.) It is well-established that the ALJ must include in the hypothetical to the VE all of a claimant's limitations which are supported by the medical record.\n   <em>\n    Plummer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857832\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/422/#p427\">\n    186 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   431 ;\n   <em>\n    Chrupcala v.

Thus, the underlying argument is that the ALJ's ultimate finding rests on an RFC assessment that overstates plaintiff's abilities.

In so finding, the ALJ considered the paragraph B criteria of Listing 12.04 and determined that plaintiff had mild restrictions in activities of daily living, moderate limitations in social functioning, moderate limitations with regard to concentration, persistence and pace, and had experienced no episodes of decompensation of extended duration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 22-23.

For example, at the October 2016 hearing, plaintiff's counsel repeatedly asked the ALJ for clarification on the questions posed to the VE and whether the hypothetical questions and RFC assessment were in accordance with the court's directives on remand, particularly with respect to plaintiff's mental impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201882639\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, that ALJ stated: \"So do you have any questions for Ms. Slusarski?

However, the ALJ's statement that \"it really did cover all of the relevant hypothetical limitations\" sheds no light on the issue presently before the court-whether the mental limitations contained in the ALJ's RFC adequately address moderate limitations in \"understanding, remembering, or applying information\" or \"adapting or managing oneself.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Thus, the 2014 VE testimony is not substantial evidence on which the ALJ may base his RFC because the 2014 VE testimony does not incorporate all of the functional limitations that the ALJ himself found present even while plaintiff engages in substance use. In the 2014 decision and the 2017 decision, the ALJ expressly relied on the testimony of the VE from the 2014 hearing to identify representative unskilled jobs that plaintiff could perform within the limitations of his RFC. (R. 62-66, 1555-62). Because the ALJ failed to include all of plaintiff's credibly established limitations in the hypothetical used to support his step five determination, it was not supported by substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9233704\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/546/#p552\">\n    372 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   552 ;\n   <em>\n    Chrupcala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1758488\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/829/1269/#p1276\">\n    829 F.2d at 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court notes that certain of the factors cited by the ALJ in discounting the treating physician's opinions undermine his analysis. For example,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the ALJ reasoned that the opinions of Drs. Rivera and Gyulai \"are also inconsistent with the claimant's activities of daily living, including months of college (although unsuccessful), odd jobs in the community,\n   full-time work as a housekeeper in a vocational rehab program (although in a structured setting), and some care of a younger family member (Exhibit18F/40).\" It would seem that an unsuccessful attempt at completing college coursework is weak evidence to contradict treating psychiatrists' opinions that plaintiff's mental impairments render plaintiff unable to adjust to work activity. Moreover, the ALJ's assertion that plaintiff provided \"some care of a younger family member\" appears to be taken out of context. The medical record to which the ALJ cites in support of this conclusion consists of a cardiologist's treatment note dated December 17, 2013, when plaintiff sought assessment for recurrent syncope. (R. 1450.) The treatment note indicates that plaintiff experienced a syncopal episode \"[i]n September, [when] he was going to the kitchen to get his niece something. He denies any prodrome.
