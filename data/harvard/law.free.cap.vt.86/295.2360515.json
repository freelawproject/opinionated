S. 2934 in his deceased wife\u2019s real estate whereof they are seised in her right in fee-simple at the time of her death, can be sold under a license from the probate court for the payment of her debts and the expenses of administration. It is clear that it can be. It is given in lieu of curtesy, as shown by the statute creating the right \u2014 No. 44, sec. 15, Acts of 1896 \u2014 and curtesy was subject to be defeated by such a sale. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>54 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Vt. 36, and there is nothing in the statute to indicate that this interest stands any better in this respect than curtesy stood.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.
