Nothing more appears regarding the matter. It was within the discretion of the court to permit the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The suit is to recover damages for the failure to deliver a quantity of apples which the plaintiff claimed to have bought of the defendant, and which the defendant denied having sold him. The defendant delivered one load to the plaintiff and received the pay for it, but afterwards delivered to another buyer. The plaintiff testified that on seeing this he asked the defendant what he was doing, and said \u201cI bought your apples\u201d; and that the defendant said, \u201cYou paid me for what I drew and you can\u2019t hold the rest of them. You haven\u2019t paid me anything on these and you can\u2019t hold them.\u201d During an argument of plaintiff\u2019s counsel defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to his saying, with reference to this testimony, \u201cthat Carpenter came back with a defence of a cowardly and dishonorable man, or something of that sort\u201d; upon which plaintiff\u2019s counsel said, \u201cThose are not my exact words. \u2019 \u2019 The exception was allowed; but nothing was done at the time, or in preparing the bill of exceptions, to settle and authenticate the language used. We think the matter objected to is not presented with sufficient certainty to entitle the exception to consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
