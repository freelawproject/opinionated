Judgment discharging tbe trustee\u2019s executrix with costs. Tbe plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-7\">This is an action of book account in which R. A. Dixon was summoned as trustee. It was brought before a justice of the peace in February, 1903. Judgment was rendered against the principal defendant, also against the trustee. On appeal by the trustee the case was entered in the county court at the June term, 1903. Subsequent thereto, before the next term of that court, and before anything was there done in the case as to the principal defendant or as to the trustee, the trustee died and letters testamentary on his estate were granted to his widow, the said Cornelia A. Dixon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-8\">The executrix, being cited to appear at the June Term, 1904, filed disclosure in January, 1905, that she did not at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>time of service of said citation on her, nor had the estate, any goods, chattels, rights, or credits belonging to defendant. At the time of the hearing before the commissioner, appointed in this case, plaintiffs claimed, as matter of law, that the executrix should file a disclosure denying the liability of the trustee in his lifetime, before proceeding to the trial of the issue as to the liability of the trustee and of herself as executrix. The executrix declined to file further disclosure, on the ground that the disclosure already filed complied with the citation by which she was made a party; whereupon plaintiffs objected to proceeding further, claiming they were entitled to judgment against the executrix and against the estate as trustee, for her neglect and refusal to make disclosure as required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-3\">The executrix seasonably objected to further disclosure being taken or to any hearing being had, on the ground that the county court was without jurisdiction; that the trustee having died, and commissioners having been appointed to receive and examine claims against his estate, this claim could only be presented to them for consideration. The trustee died June 6, 1903, and commissioners were appointed on his estate on July 9, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-4\">The commissioner appointed to take the disclosure of the trustee reports that on October 7, 1897, R. A. Dixon duly executed a chattel mortgage to the principal defendant to secure the payment of a note for four hundred dollars, which mortgage was recorded as required by law. At that time the mortgagor-was indebted to the mortgagee as represented by the note. It does not appear, and no claim is made, that the mortgage note or debt was presented before the commissioners on the estate of the deceased trustee, for allowance; nor that the mortgagee\u2019s interest in the mortgaged property was attached in this suit under the provisions of section 1696 of the Public Statutes. The record \"shows that there is due on the note, after applying credits shown, the sum of $156.14, or $203.84, depending on the proper application of an item for $47.70, a question submitted to the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-5\"><em>W.

Because of P. S. 2829, 2830, after the appointment of commissioners on the decedent\u2019s estate, the probate court had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity and amount of all legal claims against that estate founded on contract. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>16 Yt. 228; <em>Boyden </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>38 Yt. 628, 633; <em>University of Yt. </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>43 Yt. 645; <em>Goff </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>60 Yt. 633.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-5\">There is no debt due either defendant or plaintiff for which the executrix is chargeable until a decree of the probate court has been made for payment of creditors, and the time thereby fixed for such payment has expired. <em>Husted </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Tr., </em>69 Yt. 149; <em>Bank of Orange Co. </em>v. <em>Kidder, </em>20 Yt. 519; <em>Probate Court </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>31 Yt. 373; <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Wilber, </em>L.

P. S. 1654; <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>45 Vt. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">After the case was thus in the county court, but before anything was there done as to the trustee, and before judgment against the principal defendant was affirmed, the trustee died, and soon thereafter \u2014 on July 9, 1903 \u2014 commissioners were appointed on his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">The executrix of the last will and \u25a0 testament of the deceased trustee being cited to appear in the case in accordance with the provisions of P. S. 1732, filed her disclosure in Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ary, 1905, alleging that she had not at the time of the service of the citation upon her, nor had the estate of the deceased trustee, any goods, chattels, rights, or credits belonging to the defendant. The disclosure was as broad as the command therefor contained in the citation by which she was made a party to the suit. This being so, it cannot in justice be said, as is urged by the plaintiff, that judgment should have been rendered against h.er because the period covered by the disclosure did not reach back to the time of the service of the writ upon the trustee. Moreover, a disclosure could be only evidence before the commissioner appointed in the case to hear the issue as to the liability of the trustee, and the scope of the hearing had and the facts reported sufficiently cover the whole period without reference to the disclosure. Hence the legal rights of the parties, so far as they depend here upon the facts, must be determined solely upon the report. <em>Lovejoy </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>35 Vt. 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">The jurisdiction of the probate court over matters touching the settlement of estates is exclusive and complete. Neither common law nor equity courts interfere therein, except in some instances, not here material, in.aid of the probate court. <em>Probate Court </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>49 Vt. 380. And all estates, without representation of insolvency, are now settled as insolvent estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">All claims of an absolute or legal nature against a person at his death, must be presented before the commissioners on his estate for allowance, within the time limited by statute. P. S. 2820, 2821. A person having a claim of such character, but not so presenting it, shall be barred from recovering the demand, or from pleading the same in set-off in any action. P. S. 2824; <em>Goff </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>60 Vt. 633, 15 Atl. 339; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>51 Vt. 538. The mortgage debt owing to the principal defendant from the trustee at the time of the service of the writ upon him was both legal and absolute, and consequently, by the failure to present it before the commissioners on the deceased trustee\u2019s estate, it became barred and not a claim on which any distributive share of the assets of the estate was due or could be ordered paid. It follows that the executrix has not in her hands any sum for which she or the estate is liable to the principal defendant, and the judgment in favor of the trustee must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The statute (P. S. 1732) under which the executrix was cited in, provides that if the person summoned as trustee in his own right dies before judgment in the original suit, his executor or administrator may appear voluntarily, or may be cited to appear, and the proceedings shall then be conducted as if the executor or administrator, in that capacity, had been originally summoned as trustee, with an exception not applicable here. Had the executrix, in that capacity, been originally summoned as trustee, she could have been chargeable in this action for only such sum as should by the probate court be ordered paid on the debt as proved before the commissioners on the estate. The owner of the claim could not in law be entitled to more than this from the assets of the estate, and an attaching creditor' by trustee process can stand no better.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Under this construction of the statute, it is necessary for the court in which the trustee suit is pending to continue the case from time to time as to the trustee, until the debt attached has been proved in the usual course of proceedings in the settlement of estates and an order has been made for the payment of claims and the distribution of assets among the creditors, to enable the executor or administrator to file his disclosure. There is a similar statute in New Hampshire, and the highest court of that state has given it the same construction. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Gale, </em>32 N. H. 141; <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>35 N. H. 281. See also <em>Guptill </em>v. <em>Ayer, </em>149 Mass. 49, 20 N.
