A natural consequence of the absence of a correct date of disablement was the relieving of the employer and the insurance carrier from any liability for medical treatment rendered to claimant. <em>(Matter of Muniak </em>v. <em>ACF Ind., </em>6 A D 2d 923, 7 A D 2d 258; <em>Matter of Harris </em>v. <em>Silver Cr.

The decision of the' Appellate Division, if affirmed, will impose a tremendous hardship and irreparable damage to thousands of injured claimants.

The referee and the board held in favor of claimant but the Appellate Division, reversed so much of the board\u2019s order as directed payment of medical expenses incurred prior to the date when loss of wages began.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Claimant contracted an occupational dermatitis while in this employer\u2019s service and received his first medical treatment therefor on February 23, 1959 but continued to work until October, 1959. The board (confirming its referee) fixed the date of disablement as February 23, 1959. The Appellate Division, citing its earlier cases of <em>Matter of Muniak </em>v. <em>ACF Ind. </em>(6 A D 2d 923) and <em>Matter of Harris </em>v. <em>Silver Cr. Precision Corp. </em>(13 A D 2d 859), said that under the statute (Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 2, subd. 7; \u00a7 13, subd.. [a]; \u00a7 37, subd. 1; \u00a7\u00a7 38, 39) the conclusion is unavoidable that no liability for medical expense accrues until there has been disablement from earning wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Appellant board argues that this ruling offends against justice and is against the public interest since it compels an occupational disease sufferer who wishes to keep on working to quit work (and collect more compensation) in order to get his medical bills paid. The Appellate Division seems to admit the injustice but says that the remedy lies with the Legislature, basing this conclusion on a reading of the statute which seems at variance with some of the court\u2019s own earlier holdings (see <em>Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>Cole </em>v. <em>Saranac Lake Gen. Hosp., </em>282 App. Div. 626; <em>Matter of Stephenson </em>v. <em>Suffolk Sanatorium, </em>276 App. Div. 1044, and <em>Matter of Reisinger </em>v. <em>Liebmann Breweries, </em>7 A D 2d 658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">As it seems to us, the board\u2019s determination and award was not only in accord with the reasonable meaning of the statute but was compelled by a controlling decision, <em>Matter of Slawinski </em>v. <em>Williams &amp; Co. </em>(298 N. Y. 546), and that we must reverse the Appellate Division. Slawinski\u2019s hearing became impaired because of employment conditions but he continued to work without lost time or decrease in earnings. The board and the Appellate Division held (and this court approved) that, although he was-not \u201c economically \u201d or \u201c financially \u201d disabled, he was disabled in the sense of the statute because he was physically impaired. In Slawinski\u2019s case the employer seems to have furnished the medical care, so liability therefor was not in dispute. But Slawinski demanded and Avas awarded some $1,700 as the \u201c schedule \u201d payments for his hearing loss although he lost no time or wages at all. In <em>Slawinski </em>the sole dissenter at the Appellate Division took, and the Appellate Division majority rejected, the same position taken by respondents here: that claimant although physically and occupationally impaired was not \u201c disabled \u201d because he lost no time or wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Our decision in <em>Matter of Slawinski (supra), </em>although without opinion, necessarily rejected the- statutory constructions approved by the Appellate Division in the present case, and meant as to an occupational disease claim that the employee\u2019s right to compensation and the employer\u2019s corresponding liability accrue no later than the date when the illness requires medical attention. The question in <em>Slawinski </em>was the very one now before us \u2014 that is, may the board in an occupational disease case fix a date of disablement as of the time of physical impairment or need of medical care and before any loss of wages? An affirmative answer should again be given. Quite recently in another connection we held <em>(Matter of Mastrodonato </em>v. <em>Pfaudler </em>Co., 307 N. Y. 592, 597, 598) that in a true \u201c accident \u201d situation physical or medical impairment \u2018 \u2018 reflected in medical care required \u201d is a \u201cdisability\u201d in itself regardless of financial impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the decision and award reinstated, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Judges Dye, Fuld, Fboessel, Van Voobhis, Burke and Fosteb concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Order reversed and the decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board reinstated, with costs to appellant against respondents employer and carrier in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
