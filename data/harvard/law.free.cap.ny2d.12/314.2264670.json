The record solidly supports the conclusion that the reclassification of petitioners-appellants as assistant park directors was a reasonable exercise of administrative discretion. The validity of the equivalencies established for the pre-plan title of supervisor of park operations was not challenged in these proceedings. The specifications and job descriptions drawn up for these equivalent titles were not challenged in these proceedings. The record contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>uncontradicted evidence that the reclassification here attacked followed a comparison of the duties performed by the incumbents prior to reclassification with those specified in the job descriptions of the equivalent titles, coupled with the uncontradicted statement that duties being performed which were incompatible with the new job descriptions were not considered. It is equally clear that, under the final table of equivalencies adopted by the Civil Service Commission, the equivalencies for the pre-plan position of supervisor of park operations usurped no previously existing civil service titles and filled no previously existing civil service vacancies. <em>(Matter of Carolan </em>v. <em>Schechter, </em>5 Misc 2d 753, 8 A D 2d 804, 7 N Y 2d 980; <em>Matter of Mandle </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>4 A D 2d 283, 5 N Y 2d 51.) II. The <em>Garolan </em>decision simply overthrew an intradepartmental program without civil service sanction. It was error for the court below to import that decision into these proceedings, especially in the light of the decision of this court in <em>Matter of Mandle </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(5 N Y 2d 51). The affirmance of the order in the <em>Garolan </em>case must be read with the views in mind which this court expressed in <em>Mandle, </em>where it held that old job descriptions for pre-plan positions in an unlimited grade are not controlling upon a reclassification of such positions. <em>(Matter of Williams </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>297 N. Y. 328.) III. If this decision stands, the reclassification of all formerly ungraded civil servants is imperiled. IV. If this decision stands, petitioners will have been denied the benefits of a city-wide reclassification effective for all others. <em>(Matter of Sippel </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>191 Misc. 558, 274 App. Div. 1027.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-4\"><em>Samuel Berman, </em>intervenor-respondent in person.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6g\">A promotion is an advancement to a higher position, an elevation of a preferment.

It was there held that certain supervisors of park operations in the Park Department of the City of New York<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had in effect obtained illegal promotions without competitive examination in violation of constitutional and statutory requirements (N. Y. Const., art. Y, \u00a7 6; Civil Service Law, \u00a7 61, subd. 2). We affirmed the order of the courts below requiring the Department of Personnel of the City of New York to discontinue assigning these employees to out-of-title duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The <em>Carolan </em>proceeding was commenced in 1955 and not decided by this court until 1960 (7 N Y 2d 980, <em>supra). </em>In the meantime, in 1956, as the result of a new \u201c Career and Salary Plan \u201d adopted in 1954 which reclassified civil service positions throughout the city, petitioner supervisors were \u201c slotted into \u201d the newly created title of \u201cAssistant Park Director \u201d, a title designed to cover more adequately the job specifications and duties of their former positions as supervisors. Because of our decision in the <em>Carolan </em>case in 1960, respondent city officials decided that the petitioners could not retain their new titles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>without passing a competitive examination and ordered that one be held. In these article 78 proceedings the courts below have decided that that determination was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">As is apparent from the <em>Carolan </em>case (5 Misc 2d 753, affd. 8 A D 2d 804, affd. 7 N Y 2d 980), the petitioners were performing impermissible out-of-title work prior to \u20181 reclassification \u201d under the career and salary plan. As supervisors of park operations, their duties, basically, were to direct and supervise the operation of a specific park facility, such as a swimming pool or a golf course, to supervise the employees under them and to perform related work. Three of the supervisors who are now the petitioners in the present <em>Niebling </em>case, however, were acting as park directors of an entire borough, another as an assistant director in the division of maintenance and operations and still another as an assistant to the director of maintenance and operations. The petitioners in the <em>Boche </em>case were designated as assistant borough directors performing \u201c administrative and inspectional duties.\u201d All of these positions carried with them higher salaries, greater responsibilities and more prestige than the position of supervisor. Although the position of supervisor is ungraded and without salary limitation, this court held that the combination of higher pay, increased responsibility and prestige compelled the conclusion that the petitioners had actually received promotions without having taken the competitive examinations required by Constitution and statute. <em>(Matter of Carolan </em>v. <em>Schechter, </em>7 N Y 2d 980, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The new career and salary plan, which was involved in <em>Matter of Mandle </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(5 N Y 2d 51), was adopted in 1954. The task of the Department of Personnel was to reclassify each civil service position under a \u201c standard title \u201d with an \u201c appropriate salary grade \u201d and then establish \u201c schedules of equivalent titles indicating in each case the former title of each position and the standard title and salary grade to which such position is classified and allocated\u201d without \u201cregard to out-of-title work performed by any incumbent thereof \u201d (N. Y. City Civ. Serv. Comm. Eules, rule XI). Position Classification Questionnaires \u2014 referred to as PCQs \u2014 were sent out to employees and on the job surveys were made to assist in reclassification. In cases such as the present, where positions had been \u201c ungraded \u201d and \u201c encom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>passed a wide variety of duties \u201d, there were often several new titles in place of the single pre-plan one. In this way, the preplan position of supervisor was divided into several categories: (1) supervisor of park operations, (2) senior supervisor of park operations and (3) the totally new title of assistant park director, to which the petitioners herein were assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The petitioners urge that, when they were \u201c slotted into \u201d their new titles, the Department of Personnel did not consider the out-of-title work which they were performing as supervisors and which we held in the <em>Garolcm </em>case involved an illegal promotion. Although there is some testimony to that effect in the record, a glance at the PCQs filled out by the petitioners and an examination of the testimony as a whole show that, in reclassifying the petitioners from the position of supervisor to the title of assistant park director, the Department of Personnel took into consideration the very duties which the court in the <em>Carolan </em>case had characterized and condemned as out-of-title work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Obviously, reclassification may not be employed as a device to sanction the performance of out-of-title duties and thereby avoid the requirement of a competitive examination for promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The present case is somewhat similar to that of <em>Matter of Williams </em>v. <em>Morton </em>(297 N. Y. 328), in which an examining physician, in Grade 4 of Civil Service, was designated as acting chief medical examiner of the New York City Board of Education at an increased salary without examination because of the war emergency. After the war, the board restored the doctor to his original Grade 4 status but, abolishing the position of chief medical examiner, placed him in charge of the medical staff at the same salary as he had been receiving as acting chief medical examiner. The court ruled that this action constituted an illegal promotion because of the failure to require a competitive examination, pointing out that \u201c Such an advance in income and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>in professional responsibility and prestige is certainly a \u2018 promotion \u2019 in every fair sense of that word \u201d (297 N. Y., at p. 334). And so, it is evident, is that of each of the petitioners in. the cases before us, both before and after this change of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The petitioners for their part attempt to equate their situation with that of the Grade 4 attorneys in <em>Matter of Mandle </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(5 N Y 2d 51, <em>supra). </em>In the <em>Mandle </em>case, however, these attorneys had, prior to reclassification, been validly performing functions of varying importance and receiving different salaries for their work. By their very nature, the duties to which they were assigned involved different degrees of competence, specialization and supervisory capabilities <em>within the grade. </em>But a reclassification of positions on the basis of out-of-title work was certainly not sanctioned. On the contrary, as the Appellate Division observed in the <em>Mandle </em>case (4 A D 2d 283, 286), <em>\u201c </em>If <em>\u2018 </em>out-of-title \u2019 work was invalidly imposed upon or assumed by the incumbents prior to the reclassification, it may not be validated by a reclassification which is based thereon. This means that one may not deliberately manipulate a reclassification simply by first imposing or by assuming new duties and responsibilities, and then thereby avoid the necessity for filling vacancies by promotion by reclassifying the added duties and responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In the present case, unlike <em>Mandle, </em>the higher pay and heavier responsibilities of the petitioners did not grow out of the nature of their work as prescribed by the job specifications for supervisor of park operations. That position did not contemplate the performance of the out-of-title duties which the petitioners had acquired \u2014 those of park director, assistant director of maintenance and operations and the others. Nevertheless, the Department of Personnel, in its reclassification, continued to permit the petitioners to perform the duties of those positions, although it recognized that they were higher and more responsible than those of a supervisor. In other words, the department simply gave the petitioners the new title of assistant park director, arbitrarily equating it with that of supervisor, atid thereby enabled the petitioners to continue obtaining the benefits of higher salary and higher position without taking a competitive examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The orders appealed from should he affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Die, Van Voorhis, Burke, Foster and Scheppi concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Orders affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">.

The PCQ of each of the petitioners contains a detailed description of their respective duties, not as supervisors, but as park directors, assistant borough directors, assistant director of maintenance and operations, and the like, with the weighty responsibilities and the important character of their work spelled out in full detail. And the assistant director of classification and compensation of the Department of Personnel specifically testified that she consulted and evaluated these PCQs in determining the reclassification to be accorded the petitioners herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
