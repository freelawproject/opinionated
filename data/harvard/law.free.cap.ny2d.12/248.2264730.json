The failure of counsel to adequately object to the admission of evidence illegally seized is not a waiver of such constitutional privilege. II. The determination and order of the intermediate appellate court was just and proper.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b291-7\">Chief Judge Desmond.</author>\n<p id=\"A8q\">The order should be affirmed. However, some of the statements in the opinion of the intermediate court (former Appellate Part of Special Sessions) prompt us to elaborate somewhat on the jurisdictional and procedural questions there discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The Appellate Part correctly held (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Loria, </em>10 N Y 2d 368) that the exclusionary doctrine of <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(367 U. S. 643) applies to criminal causes tried before the <em>Mapp </em>ruling. The court next stated that <em>\u201c </em>the absence of exception to the admissibility of the offending evidence in the trial court is not a bar to a review\u201d and that failure to voice such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>exception is not a waiver of the law point. Taken at its fullest, the second of those statements is contrary to <em>People </em>v. <em>Coffey </em>(11 N Y 2d 142); <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill </em>(11 N Y 2d 148), and <em>People </em>v. <em>Friola </em>(11 N Y 2d 157) which hold that in the Court of Appeals the illegal evidence point is unavailable when it has not been brought to the attention of the trial court. However, an intermediate appellate court may, regardless of objections or exceptions, reverse in the interests of justice or because the trial court judgment was against the weight of evidence. In arriving at its conclusion as to \u201c interests of justice \u201d or weight of evidence, the intermediate court is not precluded from taking into consideration the circumstance that illegal evidence was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Since the reversal here was soundly based on grounds within the intermediate appellate court\u2019s competence, we affirm.,</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Judges Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis, Burke, Foster and Scileppi concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
