The Justice of the Peace Court of the Town of Aurora had no jurisdiction to try a violation of section 1825 of the Penal Law, and its judgment was, therefore, a nullity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kischel, </em>276 N. Y. 116; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>3 N Y 2d 148; <em>People ex rel. Dold </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>284 App. Div. 127.) II. Appellant\u2019s acquittal of the underlying offenses of assault in the third degree and disorderly conduct require a reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction of resisting arrest. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dreares, </em>15 A D 2d 204, 11 N Y 2d 906; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cherry, </em>307 N.

Ertell, Jr., </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY8\">I. Defendant-appellant cannot be heard on this appeal as to the lack of jurisdiction of the Police Justice Court to hear a violation of section 1825 of the Penal Law, since this argument was not raised in defendant-appellant\u2019s original affidavit of errors. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Omans, </em>306 N. Y. 375; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>351 U. S. 12; <em>People </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>7 N Y 2d 264; <em>People </em>v. <em>Zambounis, </em>251 N. Y. 94.) II. Defendant-appellant was properly convicted of resisting arrest. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>10 N Y 2d 99; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cherry, </em>307 N. Y. 308; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guidici, </em>100 N. Y. 503; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosino, </em>168 App. Div. 920.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b471-8\">Poster, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmD\">The primary issue on this appeal is whether lack of jurisdiction in a Court of Special Sessions can now be raised on appeal to this court from a judgment of conviction, where such an allegation was not specifically raised in appellant\u2019s affidavit of errors or argued to the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Appellant was charged with: (1) the misdemeanor of assault in the third degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 244, subd. 1); (2) the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>of disorderly conduct (Penal Law, \u00a7 722, subd. 2); and (3) the misdemeanor of resisting arrest (Penal Law, \u00a7 1825). Trial was had in the Justice\u2019s Court of the Town of Aurora; the jury brought in a verdict of not guilty to the first two above-mentioned charges, but guilty of the charge of resisting arrest. To perfect her appeal, appellant submitted an affidavit of errors alleging grounds for reversal (Code Grim. Pro., \u00a7 751), none of which specifically raise the question of jurisdiction of the Justice\u2019s Court, other than perhaps: \u201cThe information was insufficient as'a matter of law.\u201d On her appeal to the Erie County Court, the judgment of conviction was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Raised specifically for the first time is the contention that judgment must now be reversed because the Justice\u2019s Court of the Town of Aurora did not have jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate a violation of section 1825 of the Penal Law. This court, as a Court of Special Sessions in the counties other than those within the City of New York, has jurisdiction to hear and determine charges only as specified in section 56 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see N. Y. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 17; Town Law, \u00a7 31). There are many subdivisions to this section, of which all but the following 2 list specific offenses (resisting arrest is not included) triable in Courts of Special Sessions:</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u201c 37. Such other jurisdiction as is now provided by special statute or municipal ordinance authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\u201c 38. When a complaint is made to or a warrant is issued by a committing magistrate for any misdemeanor not included in the foregoing subdivisions of this section, if the accused shall elect to be tried by a court of special sessions, as provided by section two hundred and eleven. But this subdivision shall not apply to any misdemeanor which is, or may be punishable by a fine exceeding fifty dollars, or by imprisonment exceeding six months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">As the People now concede, the Justice\u2019s Court of the Town of Aurora does not have jurisdiction by any special statute or ordinance to try a violation of section 1825 of the Penal Law. A violation of said section, the misdemeanor of resisting arrest, is punishable by a fine of not more than $500 or not more than one year\u2019s imprisonment, or by both (Penal Law, \u00a7 1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">It seems clear that the Justice\u2019s Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the misdemeanor upon which appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>convicted <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kischel, </em>276 N. Y. 116). Such a defect requires a reversal of the conviction, for it is certain that a defect in jurisdiction can never be waived (see, e,g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>3 N Y 2d 148, 152).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The People, however, contend that, since an appeal from a Court of Special Sessions may only be taken by filing an affidavit of errors pursuant to section 751 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the appeal <em>must </em>be limited to those errors specifically raised in such an affidavit (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>7 N Y 2d 264, 266; <em>People </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>4 N Y 2d 70, 73; <em>People </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>152 N. Y. 136, 141-142). It is argued that, since appellant did not assign the \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>jurisdictional error \u2019 \u2019, the trial court was not required to make a return on that issue (Code Grim. Pro., \u00a7 756), and the return, which constitutes the record before the County Court and this court (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 763), does not provide us with a basis for reversal (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>307 N. Y. 570, 574).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">This latter view is erroneous. Want of jurisdiction is a basic defect, not a trial error; it may be raised at any time and can never be waived. The record before us, therefore, contains a fundamental defect in the proceedings which could never be waived or cured, and such a defect in the record is disclosed \u201c upon its face \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradner, </em>107 N. Y. 1, 4; <em>People </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>7 N Y 2d 264, 267, supra; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Kischel, </em>276 N. Y. 116, <em>supra). </em>Since this defect would undoubtedly be grounds for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, it most assuredly can be remedied on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">With reversal based upon the above-mentioned ground, we need not reach any other question.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The judgment of conviction should be reversed and the information dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis, Burke and Scileppi concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Judgment reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
