Its competitor, defendant Cintas Corp., is a nationwide business that rents similar products to commercial customers. White Plains alleges that it had five-year exclusive service contracts with customers and that, knowing of these arrangements, Cintas nonetheless induced dozens of White Plains\u2019 customers to breach their contracts and enter into rental agreements with Cintas. White Plains by letter demanded that Cintas desist solicitation and discontinue servicing White Plains\u2019 contract customers, enclosing a list of customers allegedly solicited improperly. Cintas denied knowledge of any contracts and continued its solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">White Plains sued Cintas in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for tortious interference with existing customer contracts. After discovery, Cintas sought summary judgment, arguing that it had no knowledge of contracts with White Plains and had not induced any breach. While noting \u201ca small element of doubt\u201d in New York law (and itself suggesting a need for certification to this Court), the District Court granted summary judgment and dismissed the complaint, ruling orally that Cintas\u2019 legitimate interest as a competitor to solicit business and make a profit alone triggered the defense of economic justification. Given Cintas\u2019 economic interest, the court concluded, to survive summary judgment White Plains had to show that Cintas acted with malice or illegality, and failed to do so. The court later denied White Plains\u2019 motion for reconsideration, finding that defendant did not need an ownership interest in the breaching party\u2019s business in order to assert the economic interest defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">On White Plains\u2019 appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reviewed New York\u2019s law on tortious interference with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>contract, noting that procuring \u201cthe breach of a contract in the exercise of equal or superior right is acting with just cause or excuse and is justification for what would otherwise be an actionable wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court observed, however, that there was an important open state law question regarding the economic interest defense. While satisfied that the defense applies when the tortfeasor has a preexisting legal or financial relationship with the breaching party \u2014 not present in the case before us\u2014 the Second Circuit sought clarification as to the broader reach of the defense and therefore certified the following potentially dispositive question to us: \u201cDoes a generalized economic interest in soliciting business for profit constitute a defense to a claim of tortious interference with an existing contract for an alleged tortfeasor with no previous economic relationship with the breaching party?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We answer that question in the negative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">It is a familiar proposition that one \u201cwho intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a contract (except a contract to marry) between another and a third person by inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to perform the contract, is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary loss resulting to the other from the failure of the third person to perform the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Though long a part of our law, this commonly asserted tort continues to generate a spate of decisions, with sometimes varying views. At bottom, as a matter of policy, courts are called upon to strike a balance between two valued interests: protection of enforceable contracts, which lends stability and predictability to parties\u2019 dealings, and promotion of free and robust competition in the marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">While New York law recognizes the tort of interference with both <em>prospective </em>and <em>existing </em>contracts, \u201cgreater protection is accorded an interest in an existing contract (as to which respect for individual contract rights outweighs the public benefit to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>derived from unfettered competition) than to the less substantive, more speculative interest in a prospective relationship (as to which liability will be imposed only on proof of more culpable conduct on the part of the interferer).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In a contract interference case \u2014 as here \u2014 the plaintiff must show the existence of its valid contract with a third party, defendant\u2019s knowledge of that contract, defendant\u2019s intentional and improper procuring of a breach, and damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response to such a claim, a defendant may raise the economic interest defense \u2014 that it acted to protect its own legal or financial stake in the breaching party\u2019s business. The defense has been applied, for example, where defendants were significant stockholders in the breaching party\u2019s business;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where defendant and the breaching party had a parent-subsidiary relationship;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> where defendant was the breaching party\u2019s creditor;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and where the defendant had a managerial contract with the breaching party at the time defendant induced the breach of contract with plaintiff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">A defendant who is simply plaintiffs competitor and knowingly solicits its contract customers is not economically justified in procuring the breach of contract.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In other words, mere status as plaintiffs competitor is not a legal or financial stake in the breaching party\u2019s business that permits defendant\u2019s inducement of a breach of contract. We do not subscribe to the District Court\u2019s view that \u201cthe only answer . . . is to go out and do it also to the other guy.\u201d Rather, the answer is succinctly articulated in the New York Pattern Jury Instructions: \u201cWhen the defendant is simply a competitor of the plaintiff seeking prospective customers and plaintiff has a customer under contract for a definite period, defendant\u2019s interest is not equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>to that of plaintiff and would not justify defendant\u2019s inducing the customer to breach the existing contract.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To conclude otherwise \u2014 to answer the certified question in the affirmative\u2014 would blur the distinction between tortious interference with existing, enforceable contracts and tortious interference with prospective contractual relations, where, as a matter of policy, the balance of interests is different.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Finally, we note that protecting existing contractual relationships does not negate a competitor\u2019s right to solicit business, where liability is limited to <em>improper </em>inducement of a third party to breach its contract. Sending regular advertising and soliciting business in the. normal course does not constitute inducement of breach of contract.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A competitor\u2019s ultimate liability will depend on a showing that the inducement exceeded \u201ca minimum level of ethical behavior in the marketplace.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Accordingly, the certified question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Judges Cipabick, Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Following certification of a question by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the question by this Court pursuant to section 500.27 of the Rules of Practice of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.27), and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">. <em>White Plains Coat &amp; Apron Co., Inc. v Cintas Corp., </em>460 F3d 281, 283 (2d Cir 2006), quoting <em>Foster v Churchill, </em>87 NY2d 744, 750 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\">. <em>Id. </em>at 289.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\">.
