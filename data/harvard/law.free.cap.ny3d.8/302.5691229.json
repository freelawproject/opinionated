The benefit available under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c is a significant one. <em>(Matter of City of Watertown v State of N.Y. Pub. Empl.

III. The statute is silent as to whether a hearing must be provided if benefits are to be terminated, who should make municipal decisions, and who should hear a challenge to a decision. <em>(Matter of Uniform Firefighters of Cohoes, Local 2562, IAFF, AFL-CIO v City of Cohoes, </em>94 NY2d 686; <em>Matter of Crawford v Sheriff\u2019s Dept., Putnam County, </em>152 AD2d 382; <em>Matter of Stewart v County of Albany, </em>300 AD2d 984; <em>Matter of House v New York State Off. of Mental Health, </em>262 AD2d 929; <em>Matter of Prue v Hunt, </em>78 NY2d 364.) IV. The designation of an individual to hear an appeal of a municipal General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c determination assures an important due process element. <em>(People ex rel.

A police officer has no property interest in the continued receipt of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits after he has been determined to be fit for duty. <em>(Matter of Schenectady County Sheriff\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v McEvoy, </em>124 AD2d 911; <em>Matter of DePoalo v County of Schenectady, </em>85 NY2d 527; <em>Matter of Poughkeepsie Professional Firefighters\u2019 Assn., Local 596, IAFF, AFL-CIO-CLC v New York State Pub.

Empl. Relations Bd., </em>196 AD2d 171, 85 NY2d 480.) II. The hearing afforded to John Park satisfied due process requirements because it provided him notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue. <em>(Matter of Hodella v Chief of Police of Town of Greenburgh, </em>73 AD2d 967, 49 NY2d 708; <em>Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>Laudico v Netzel, </em>254 AD2d 811; <em>Matter of De John v Town of Frankfort, </em>209 AD2d 938; <em>Matter of Curley v Dilworth, </em>96 AD2d 903; <em>Schroeder v City of New York, </em>371 US 208; <em>Matter of Hurwitz v Perales, </em>81 NY2d 182; <em>Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v Loudermill, </em>470 US 532; <em>Mathews v Eldridge, </em>424 US 319; <em>Matter of Uniform Firefighters of Cohoes, Local 2562, IAFF, AFL-CIO v City of Cohoes, </em>94 NY2d 686; <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v Roth, </em>408 US 564.) III. The recoupment of erroneous overpayments of government funds is a common practice confirmed by many courts and is not prohibited by the Constitution. <em>(Matter of Schwartfigure v Hartnett, </em>83 NY2d 296; <em>Matter of Leirer v Caputo, </em>81 NY2d 455; <em>Matter of Daleview Nursing Home v Axelrod, </em>62 NY2d 30; <em>Matter of Mayflower Nursing Home v Office of Health Sys.

IV. The clear and unambiguous language of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c provides that the statutory benefits will end when the disability ceases and/or the officer refuses light duty, and does not prohibit recoupment by the municipality. <em>(Matter of Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Served on Museum of Modern Art, </em>93 NY2d 729; <em>People v McFadden, </em>205 AD2d 560; <em>People v Floyd J., </em>61 NY2d 895; <em>Matter of Schenectady Police Benevolent Assn. v New York State Pub.

Troetti, </em>White Plains, for respondent in the second above-entitled proceeding.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlF\">I. There is nothing in the language of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c which authorized respondents to retroactively divest Sergeant Park of the statutorily mandated benefits he had received. <em>(Matter of Hodella v Chief of Police of Town of Greenburgh, </em>73 AD2d 967; <em>Goglia v Sardino, </em>119 Misc 2d 907, 101 AD2d 1013, 64 NY2d 1084; <em>Matter of Prue v Hunt, 78 </em>NY2d 364; <em>Matter of Uniform Firefighters of Cohoes, Local </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>2562, IAFF, AFL-CIO v City of Cohoes, </em>94 NY2d 686; <em>Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v Loudermill, </em>470 US 532; <em>Matter of Crawford v Sheriff\u2019s Dept., Putnam County, </em>152 AD2d 382, 76 NY2d 704; <em>Matter of Laudico v Netzel, </em>254 AD2d 811; <em>Matter of Dacey v County of Dutchess, </em>121 AD2d 536; <em>Matter of DePoalo v County of Schenectady, </em>85 NY2d 527; <em>Matter of Schenectady Police Benevolent Assn. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>196 AD2d 171.) II. Because there was no right to retroactively divest a police officer of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits, the salary received by Sergeant Park was not an erroneous payment of public funds which respondents were entitled to recoup. <em>(County of Westchester v Sheehan, </em>292 AD2d 486; <em>Matter of Farber v City of Utica, </em>1 AD3d 942; <em>Califano v Yamasaki, </em>442 US 682; <em>Matter of Schwartfigure v Hartnett, </em>83 NY2d 296; <em>Matter of Daleview Nursing Home v Axelrod, </em>62 NY2d 30; <em>Matter of Leirer v Caputo, </em>81 NY2d 455; <em>King v Town of Wallkill, </em>302 F Supp 2d 279.) III. Respondents\u2019 appeal should be dismissed because this Court is without jurisdiction to entertain respondents\u2019 claimed right to appeal, on constitutional grounds, pursuant to CPLR 5601 (b) (1). <em>(Matter of Shannon B., </em>70 NY2d 458; <em>Matter of Barbara C., </em>64 NY2d 866; <em>Lichtman v Grossbard, </em>73 NY2d 792; <em>Melahn v Hearn, </em>60 NY2d 944; <em>Matter of Eagle v Paterson, </em>57 NY2d 831; <em>Barber v Dembrowski, </em>54 NY2d 648; <em>Matter of Schulz v State of New York, </em>81 NY2d 336; <em>Matter of Skenesborough Stone v Village of Whitehall, </em>95 NY2d 902; <em>Bingham v New York City Tr.

Giliberto, </em>Albany, for New York State Conference of Mayors and Municipal Officials, amicus curiae in the second above-entitled proceeding.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzG\">I. The benefit available under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c is a significant one. <em>(Matter of City of Watertown v State of N.Y. Pub. Empl.

II. A recipient of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits who challenges a municipal decision under the statute must be afforded an opportunity to be heard. <em>(Board of Regents of State Colleges v Roth, </em>408 US 564; <em>Town of Castle Rock v Gonzales, </em>545 US 748; <em>Matter of Uniform Firefighters of Cohoes, Local 2562, IAFF, AFL-CIO v City of Cohoes, </em>94 NY2d 686.) III. While a municipality should be allowed to terminate General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c payments when an administrative decision is reached, the issue in this litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>should be resolved on the principle of equity. <em>(Matter of Jefferson v Bronx Psychiatric Ctr., </em>55 NY2d 69; <em>Matter of Milan v Trico Prods.

A retroactive right of recoupment of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits paid would violate the established principle that section 207-c benefits constitute a property interest giving rise to procedural due process protections under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution before they can be terminated. <em>(Matter of Uniform Firefighters of Cohoes, Local 2562, IAFF, AFL-CIO v City of Cohoes, </em>94 NY2d 686; <em>Matter of DePoalo v County of Schenectady, </em>85 NY2d 527; <em>Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v Loudermill, </em>470 US 532; <em>Matter of Prue v Hunt, </em>78 NY2d 364; <em>Goglia v Sardino, </em>119 Misc 2d 907; <em>Mathews v Eldridge, </em>424 US 319; <em>Gilbert v Homar, </em>520 US 924; <em>Matter of Schenectady Police Benevolent Assn. v New York State Pub.

The court below incorrectly concluded that the due process hearing provided to Sergeant Park which was carried out in accordance with the procedures of section 75 of the Civil Service Law was sufficient. <em>(Matter of Hodella v Chief of Police of Town of Greenburgh, </em>73 AD2d 967, 49 NY2d 708; <em>Matter of Curley v Dilworth, </em>96 AD2d 903; <em>Matter of Shields v Guido, </em>97 AD2d 849; <em>Matter of Hamilton v City of Schenectady, </em>210 AD2d 843; <em>Matter of Meehan v County of Tompkins, </em>219 AD2d 774.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b386-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b386-6\">Pigott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Petitioner, John Park, a police officer employed by the Town of Greenburgh, underwent surgery in June 2002 as the result of an injury he sustained while in the line of duty. He was certified disabled from his duties pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c (1), which states that a police officer injured in the line of duty must be paid by his municipal employer \u201cthe full amount of his regular salary or wages until his disability arising therefrom has ceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">In March 2003, the Town\u2019s medical examiner concluded that Park could return to work in a sedentary capacity. Park\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>supervisor, Greenburgh Chief of Police John A. Kapica, directed him to return to light duty starting April 21, 2003. Park objected to the medical examiner\u2019s determination, submitted a report from his treating physician indicating that he had a \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d and requested a hearing on the issue of his ability to return to work. The Town Board appointed a hearing officer and a hearing was scheduled to determine the extent of Park\u2019s disability. However, before the hearing could be held, Park commenced a CPLR article 78 proceeding (Proceeding No. 1) objecting to the Town\u2019s appointment of a hearing officer and seeking a stay of the hearing on the ground that, pursuant to section 7 of the Westchester County Police Act (WCPA) (L 1936, ch 104, as amended by L 1941, ch 812, \u00a7 1), any hearing had to be conducted before the Town Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Supreme Court denied Park\u2019s application to stay the hearing; nevertheless, Park refused to participate in the hearing, which proceeded on the date scheduled with Park in absentia. The Hearing Officer concluded that Park was fit to return to light duty, that his refusal to do so was without justification, and that the Town could recoup any section 207-c benefits paid to Park from April 21, 2003 until such time as he returned to work. Kapica directed Park to begin his light-duty assignment on August 4, 2003, but rather than return to work, Park retired on August 26, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">On October 20, 2003, Supreme Court dismissed the petition, holding that the Town\u2019s appointment of the Hearing Officer was proper. The Appellate Division affirmed, adding that \u201c[t]he procedures for terminating disability payments under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c must be read in conjunction with Civil Service Law \u00a7 75\u201d (25 AD3d 801, 801 [2006]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Following the dismissal of the petition in Proceeding No. 1, Park commenced a second article 78 proceeding (Proceeding No. 2) seeking, among other things, the annulment of the Hearing Officer\u2019s determination that the Town could recoup section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>207-c benefits paid to him. Supreme Court granted the petition, ruling that the Town had no authority to recoup payments made to Park prior to the Hearing Officer\u2019s finding that he was fit for light duty. The Appellate Division again affirmed, holding that the Town could not recoup section 207-c benefits paid to Park \u201cbefore August 4, 2003, the date after the conclusion of the due process hearing when [Park] had been directed to return to work\u201d (25 AD3d 802, 803 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We now affirm the order of the Appellate Division in Proceeding No. 1, albeit on a different ground, and also affirm the order of the Appellate Division in Proceeding No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c, municipalities meeting certain population criteria are directed to pay continued salary or wages to officers who sustain a disability in the course of their employment. The continued receipt of section 207-c disability payments is not absolute, however. A municipality is entitled to its own medical examination of its employee (see General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c [1]); and if, in that physician\u2019s opinion the officer can perform \u201cspecified types of light police duty,\u201d payment of the full amount of salary or wages may be discontinued should the officer refuse to return to work if a light-duty assignment \u201cis available and offered to him\u201d (General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The right of a disabled officer to receive section 207-c disability payments constitutes \u201ca property interest giving rise to procedural due process protection, under the Fourteenth Amendment, before those payments are terminated,\u201d and a due process hearing is triggered when an officer on section 207-c status submits evidence from his treating physician supporting the officer\u2019s claim of \u201ccontinued total disability\u201d <em>(Matter of Uniform Firefighters of Cohoes, Local 2562, IAFF, AFL-CIO v City of Cohoes, </em>94 NY2d 686, 691, 692 [2000] [pursuant to the analogous provision General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a, firefighters who contest a light-duty determination are entitled to a due process hearing]).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Proceeding No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">At issue on the appeal in Proceeding No. 1 is Park\u2019s claim that the Town improperly followed Civil Service Law \u00a7 75 by delegating Park\u2019s section 207-c hearing to a hearing officer instead of following section 7 of the WCPA. Civil Service Law \u00a7 75 and section 7 of the WCPA, however, apply to disciplinary actions. Because Park was not subject to discipline or to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>threat of termination for contesting the medical examiner\u2019s light-duty determination, neither of those sections applies. Therefore, the Appellate Division erred in stating that Civil Service Law \u00a7 75 should be \u201cread in conjunction with\u201d General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c, a holding that implies that all due process hearings pursuant to section 207-c must comply with Civil Service Law \u00a7 75. Such is not the case. We are concerned here solely with whether Park was afforded due process in contesting the medical examiner\u2019s determination, which bears no relation to a disciplinary proceeding. Nonetheless, we affirm the order of the Appellate Division because the procedure employed by the Town concerning Park\u2019s challenge to the medical examiner\u2019s light-duty determination comported with procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We have previously stated that section 207-c provides no definitive procedure that must be followed, and that such procedures may be the subject of collective bargaining <em>(see Matter of City of Watertown v State of N.Y. Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>95 NY2d 73, 80-81 [2000]). The parties here have not collectively bargained a procedure to be followed when an officer contests a light-duty determination. Therefore, the Town was free to fashion a hearing remedy so long as its procedure afforded Park due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Here, Park\u2019s interest in the continued receipt of disability benefits was adequately protected by the Town\u2019s due process procedure. Although he chose not to participate in the hearing, he was nevertheless given the opportunity to contest the medical examiner\u2019s light-duty determination by presenting his own witnesses and cross-examining the Town\u2019s witnesses. Moreover, the Town did not terminate his disability benefits at any time prior to his hearing. Therefore, while we affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s order in Proceeding No. 1, we do so on the ground that the procedure followed by the Town sufficiently met the dictates of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Proceeding No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The appeal in Proceeding No. 2 brings up for review the issue whether the Town is entitled to recoup section 207-c payments made to Park between April 21, 2003, the date he was initially directed to begin his light-duty assignment, and August 4, 2003, the date he was directed to begin his light-duty assignment after the Hearing Officer affirmed the medical examiner\u2019s findings. We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>There is no provision in section 207-c allowing the recoupment of disability payments made to an officer who is later found to be able to work <em>(see e.g., Matter of DePoalo v County of Schenectady, </em>85 NY2d 527, 532 [1995]; <em>see also Matter of Uniform Firefighters of Cohoes, </em>94 NY2d at 693). A municipality may discontinue disability payments once its medical examiner finds that the officer can perform a light-duty assignment <em>and </em>the officer \u201crefuse[s] to perform\u201d that duty (General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c [3]). Should an officer refuse to return to work and fail to provide medical proof that he is unable to do so, the medical examiner\u2019s opinion is dispositive and disability payments may be discontinued without a hearing <em>(id.). </em>However, a municipality is not permitted to <em>recoup </em>section 207-c payments where, as here, the officer avails himself of due process protections by challenging the medical examiner\u2019s determination because such a challenge cannot be equated with a refusal to return to duty. We rest our conclusion solely on our reading of the applicable statutes, and do not suggest that there would be any constitutional bar to a recoupment of benefits in a situation like this one, had the Legislature so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Accordingly, the orders of the Appellate Division in Proceeding Nos. 1 and 2 should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read and Smith concur; Judge Jones taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In each case: Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\">.
