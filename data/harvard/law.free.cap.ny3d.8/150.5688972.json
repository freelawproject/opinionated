For the reasons that follow, we conclude that section 72 (1) was followed here, and is constitutional, both on its face and as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">A.D. (mother) married ED. (father) in 1992; their son C.D. was born in November 1993. In June 1997, A.D. was diagnosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>with cancer of the breast and spine. A.D.\u2019s mother E.S. (grandmother), who lived in East Hampton, Long Island, was asked to move into the marital home in Huntington to care for her terminally ill daughter and the child. Grandmother cleaned the house, shopped, cooked household meals and looked after the child when A.D.\u2019s illness prevented her from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">After A.D.\u2019s death in March 1998, father invited grandmother to stay on to help out with the then-four-year-old child\u2019s care and household duties. Grandmother agreed, and father, grandmother and the child lived together amicably in the Huntington home for the ensuing 3V2 years. During that time, grandmother comforted, supported and cared for the motherless child. She got him ready for school, put him to bed, read with him, helped him with his homework, cooked his meals, laundered his clothes and drove him to school and to doctor\u2019s appointments and various activities, including gym class, karate class, bowling, soccer, Little League baseball and swimming class. She arranged and transported him to away-from-home or supervised at-home play dates; she took him to the public library and introduced him to the game of chess. From 1998 through 2001, the child and father spent entire summers at grandmother\u2019s home in East Hampton, where the child\u2019s maternal first cousins and other family members were frequently present as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">By the fall of 2001, the relationship between grandmother and father had begun to sour. The reasons for this are disputed, but father and grandmother apparently differed over such matters as how to handle the child\u2019s sometime unwillingness to eat the food prepared for him at mealtime, and how strictly to enforce his bedtime, his tooth brushing regimen, homework routines and the like. In general, grandmother seems to have been more indulgent than father, who consequently came to view her as sabotaging his parental authority and competing with him for control over the household and, more importantly, the child. On February 24, 2002 father demanded that grandmother move out of the Huntington home immediately. Grandmother claims to have been completely surprised by this turn of events. She strenuously objected to leaving without at least saying goodbye to the child, who was away on a play date at the time, but she ultimately bowed to father\u2019s wishes and left with most of her belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">For the next seven or eight weeks, father forbade any contact between grandmother and the child. From April through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>December 2002, father allowed sporadic visits, which were limited in length and tightly supervised, and occasional telephone calls. According to grandmother, an incident in December 2002, when she experienced a four-hour wait for a scheduled visit with the child, was the \u201clast straw.\u201d She decided to seek judicial intervention, a decision that she characterizes as having been arrived at most reluctantly. Accordingly, in January 2003, grandmother, who was 78 years old at the time, commenced this proceeding pursuant to Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 and Family Court Act \u00a7 651 for an order granting reasonable visitation with the child, who was then nine years old. Father opposed grandmother\u2019s request, and cross-moved for an order prohibiting grandmother from any contact whatsoever with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Supreme Court appointed a law guardian for the child and conducted a lengthy, multi-day hearing. Among the numerous witnesses who testified were grandmother, father, his mother and stepmother, and two of the child\u2019s former babysitters. Supreme Court also held an in camera interview with the child in the presence of the law guardian, and considered the law guardian\u2019s report and recommendation. On December 1, 2004, Supreme Court granted judgment to grandmother, and ordered visitation according to a detailed schedule. Supreme Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\u201c[although mindful of [father]\u2019s right to rear [the child] as he sees fit, and of his stated concern that [grandmother] undermines his parental authority, the Court finds that he has failed to present any credible evidence warranting either the termination of the relationship between [grandmother] and [the child] or the imposition of restrictions on the right of visitation. Instead, the evidence in the record establishes the existence of a very close, loving relationship between [grandmother] and [the child], and that [the child]\u2019s best interest is served by granting [grandmother] regular, unfettered visitation\u201d (6 Misc 3d 1030[A], 2004 NY Slip Op 51846[U], *15).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Upon father\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed Supreme Court\u2019s judgment, but modified certain terms of the visitation schedule in deference to father\u2019s wishes, relying on <em>Troxel. </em>In response to father\u2019s constitutional challenge, the Appellate Division observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\u201c[c]ontrary to the father\u2019s contention, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>has determined that New York State\u2019s grandparent visitation statute, Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72, is not facially invalid under [Troxel] even though it does not specifically require that parental decisions are to be given \u2018special weight.\u2019 Our visitation statute, narrowly drafted to only afford a grandparent standing to sue for visitation when a child\u2019s parent has died or where \u2018conditions exist which equity would see fit to intervene\u2019 (Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72) and additionally requiring that after standing has been conferred, that the grandparent establish why visitation is in the child\u2019s best interest, necessarily gives the parent\u2019s decision presumptive weight\u201d (27 AD3d 757, 758-759 [2d Dept 2006] [citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The Appellate Division further rejected father\u2019s argument that Supreme Court abused its discretion in awarding visitation to grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Section 72 (1) of the Domestic Relations Law states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">\u201c[w]here either or both of the parents of a minor child, residing within this state, is or are deceased, or where circumstances show that conditions exist which equity would see fit to intervene, a grandparent or the grandparents of such child may apply to [supreme or family court] and . . . the court, by order, after due notice to the parent or any other person or party having the care, custody, and control of such child, to be given in such manner as the court shall prescribe, may make such directions as the best interest of the child may require, for visitation rights for such grandparent or grandparents in respect to such child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Section 72 (1) derogates from the common-law rule that \u201cgrandparents [have] no standing to assert rights of visitation against a custodial parent\u201d <em>(Matter of Emanuel S. v Joseph E., </em>78 NY2d 178, 180 [1991]). The statute \u201crests on the humanitarian concern that [v]isits with a grandparent are often a precious part of a child\u2019s experience and there are benefits which devolve upon the grandchild . . . which he cannot derive from any other relationship\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 181 [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Section 72 (1) \u201cdoes not create an absolute or automatic right of visitation. Instead, the statute provides a procedural mechanism for grandparents to acquire standing to seek visitation with a minor grandchild\u201d <em>(Matter of Wilson v McGlinchey, </em>2 NY3d 375, 380 [2004] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). When grandparents seek visitation under section 72 (1), the court must undertake a two-part inquiry. \u201cFirst, [the court] must find standing based on death or equitable circumstances\u201d; and \u201c[i]f [the court] concludes that the grandparents have established the right to be heard, then it must determine if visitation is in the best interest of the grandchild\u201d <em>(Matter of Emanuel S., 78 </em>NY2d at 181).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">But the courts should not lightly intrude on the family relationship against a fit parent\u2019s wishes. The presumption that a fit parent\u2019s decisions are in the child\u2019s best interests is a strong one. And while, as we made clear in <em>Wilson, </em>the problems created by parent-grandparent antagonism cannot be ignored, an acrimonious relationship is generally not sufficient cause to deny visitation. \u201cIt is almost too obvious to state that, in cases where grandparents must use legal procedures to obtain visitation rights, some degree of animosity exists between them and the party having custody of the child or children. Were it otherwise, visitation could be achieved by agreement\u201d <em>(Lo Presti v Lo Presti, </em>40 NY2d 522, 526 [1976]).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\"> Here, grandmother has automatic standing under section 72 (1) on account of A.D.\u2019s death. Further, record evidence supports the determination of the courts below that visitation between grandmother and the child is in the child\u2019s best interest. The father in this case is a competent parent, and Supreme Court was therefore properly \u201cmindful\u201d in the first instance of his right to rear the child as he saw fit. Supreme Court determined, however, that grandmother established \u201can extraordinarily close relationship [with the child] during the nearly five-year period that she lived with him and [father]\u201d (6 Misc 3d 1030[A], 2004 NY Slip Op 51846[U], *14). Further, grandmother \u201cclearly appreciate[d] and respect[ed] the separate roles that she and [father] play[ed] in [the child\u2019s] life, and wishe[d] to improve her relationship with [father] for the sake of [the child],\u201d and there was \u201cno credible evidence in the record substantiating [father\u2019s] claim that [grandmother] [sought] to usurp his role as [the child\u2019s] parent\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Supreme Court also found that father\u2019s complaints about grandmother\u2019s caregiving skills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>were \u201ccontrived\u201d and his claims of ill will exaggerated and \u201ctailored to raise the specter of family dysfunction\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Supreme Court agreed with the law guardian\u2019s \u201cdetermination that the relationship with [grandmother] [was] central to [the child\u2019s] well[-]being,\u201d and noted that the child, who is gifted, had \u201carticulated a deep love for and attachment to\u201d grandmother <em>(id.). </em>The Appellate Division affirmed the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, and we may not revisit them <em>(see </em>Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals \u00a7 13:10, at 489 [rev 3d ed] [\u201c(F)indings of fact made by the <em>nisi prius </em>court which have been expressly affirmed by the Appellate Division and have the requisite evidentiary support are . . . conclusive and binding on the Court\u201d]). In light of these factual findings, there is no reason to disturb the best-interest determination in this case. There was no abuse of discretion; the courts below correctly applied section 72 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Father contends that Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 72 (1) is facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Troxel. </em>\u201cA party mounting a facial constitutional challenge bears the substantial burden of demonstrating that in any degree and in every conceivable application, the law suffers wholesale constitutional impairment\u201d <em>(Matter of Moran Towing Corp. v Urbach, </em>99 NY2d 443, 448 [2003] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). Moreover, the challenger \u201cmust surmount the presumption of constitutionality accorded to legislative enactments by proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 448 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The Washington statute at issue in <em>Troxel </em>permitted \u201c \u2018[a]ny person\u2019 to petition [the trial court] for visitation rights \u2018at any time,\u2019 and authorize[d] that court to grant such visitation rights whenever \u2018visitation may serve the best interest of the child\u2019 \u201d <em>(Troxel, </em>530 US at 60, quoting Wash Rev Code \u00a7 26.10.160 [3]). In <em>Troxel, </em>paternal grandparents petitioned for visitation with their grandchildren pursuant to this statute. The mother did not oppose all visitation, but sought to limit it. The trial court awarded visitation to the grandparents, \u201csettling] on a middle ground\u201d between what the grandparents requested and the mother offered <em>(Troxel </em>at 71). The intermediate appeals court reversed on statutory grounds and dismissed the petition. The Washington Supreme Court then affirmed on a different ground \u2014 that the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>was facially invalid under the Federal Constitution because it unconstitutionally infringed on the fundamental right of parents to rear their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The Supreme Court affirmed the petition\u2019s dismissal, while declining to hold the Washington statute unconstitutional on its face. Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s plurality opinion held, however, that \u201cthe application of [the statute] to [the mother] and her family violated [the mother\u2019s] due process right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her daughters\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 75). The plurality considered it critical that there were no allegations or findings of the mother\u2019s unfitness as a parent because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201cso long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children <em>{i.e., </em>is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent\u2019s children\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 68-69).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">As a result,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\u201cthe decision whether ... an intergenerational relationship would be beneficial in any specific case is for the parent to make in the first instance. And, if a fit parent\u2019s decision of the kind at issue here becomes subject to judicial review, the court must accord at least <em>some special weight </em>to the parent\u2019s own determination\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 70 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The problem in <em>Troxel </em>was therefore not that the trial court intervened, but that it failed to employ \u201cthe traditional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child\u201d when it did <em>{id. </em>at 69). On the contrary, the trial court effectively applied a presumption in favor of grandparent visitation, placing on the parent \u201cthe burden of <em>disproving </em>that visitation would be in the best interest\u201d of her children <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Reasoning from <em>Troxel, </em>we conclude that section 72 (1) is facially constitutional. As Justice Altman aptly put it, section 72 (D</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">\u201ccan be, and has been, interpreted to accord deference to a parent\u2019s decision, although the statute itself does not specifically require such deference. Further, [section 72 (1)] is drafted much more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>narrowly than the Washington statute [considered in Troxel]. If the United States Supreme Court did not declare the \u2018breathtakingly broad\u2019 Washington statute to be facially invalid, then certainly the more narrowly drafted New York statute is not unconstitutional on its face. In fact, the Court indicated that it would be hesitant to hold specific nonparental visitation statutes unconstitutional per se because \u2018much state-court adjudication in this context occurs on a case-by-case basis.\u2019 <em>Troxel </em>does not prohibit judicial intervention when a fit parent refuses visitation, but only requires that a court accord \u2018some special weight to the parent\u2019s own determination\u2019 when applying a nonparental visitation statute\u201d <em>(Matter of Hertz v Hertz, </em>291 AD2d 91, 94 [2d Dept 2002] [citations omitted]; <em>see also Matter of Morgan v Grzesik, </em>287 AD2d 150 [4th Dept 2001]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Courts in other states have likewise read their grandparent visitation statutes to encompass the constitutional protections necessary to safeguard parental rights <em>(see Hiller v Fausey, </em>588 Pa 342, 361-363, 904 A2d 875, 887-888 [2006]; <em>In re Estate of S.T.T., </em>144 P3d 1083, 1093 [Utah 2006]; <em>Blixt v Blixt, </em>437 Mass 649, 657-658, 774 NE2d 1052, 1060 [2002]). Indeed, the plurality\u2019s decision in <em>Troxel </em>seemed to suggest that the Washington Supreme Court might have similarly chosen to interpret its statute more narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Finally, father also argues that section 72 (1) was unconstitutionally applied in this case. We disagree. Unlike <em>Troxel, </em>the trial court here did not presuppose that grandparent visitation was warranted as the jumping-off point for fact-finding and best-interest analysis. Instead, the court, emphasizing that it was \u201cmindful\u201d of father\u2019s parental prerogatives, employed the strong presumption that the parent\u2019s wishes represent the child\u2019s best interests, as our statute requires <em>(see Troxel, </em>530 US at 69). While this presumption creates a high hurdle, the grandmother in this case surmounted it: from the time the child was almost four until he was seven, grandmother was his surrogate, live-in mother. The court then properly went on to consider all of the many circumstances bearing upon whether it was in the child\u2019s best interest for his relationship with grandmother to continue \u2014 e.g., the reasonableness of father\u2019s objections to grandmother\u2019s access to the child, her caregiving skills and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>attitude toward father, the law guardian\u2019s assessment, the child\u2019s wishes \u2014 before making a judgment granting visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith and Pigott concur; Judge Jones taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Order, insofar as appealed from, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
