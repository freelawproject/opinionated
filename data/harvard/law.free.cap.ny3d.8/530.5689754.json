Based on defendant\u2019s factual allegations, it was error to deny the hearing. We therefore reverse the order of the Appellate Division and remit the matter to Supreme Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>On May 30, 2003 at 12:10 p.m., in the vicinity of 132nd Street and 7th Avenue in Manhattan, Johnny Speller (decedent) was stabbed to death. Defendant was arrested for the crime later that day and subsequently indicted for second-degree murder <em>(see </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1]). After indictment, the People served defendant with a Voluntary Disclosure Form (VDF), which stated, in part, that a \u201c[w]itness picked out [defendant\u2019s] photo\u201d on May 30, 2003 at 12:45 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Defendant moved to suppress all evidence proffered against him. In his supporting affirmation, defendant claimed that he was seized and arrested without a warrant sometime after 12:30 p.m. and transported to the 32nd precinct where he was interrogated for approximately six hours and property was removed from his person. Defendant denied that he acted as either principal or accomplice in the stabbing and stated that he had no knowledge of what, if any, information the police relied upon to seize, interrogate and place him in lineups. Based upon the information available to him, defendant averred that the only information known to the police at the time of his arrest was that (1) a stabbing had occurred on May 30, 2003 in the area of 132nd Street and 7th Avenue and (2) his photograph had been picked out by an unknown witness whose source of information \u2014 whether the alleged witness actually observed the crime, or only relied on hearsay \u2014 was uncertain. It is undisputed that defendant sought the informant\u2019s name and that the People refused to provide the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Further, defendant alleged that it was unclear whether he was identified as (1) having engaged in any criminal activity, (2) a person who frequented the area, (3) a person associated with the victim or (4) a person seen in the area at the time of the incident. Defendant argued that \u201c[n]one of the People\u2019s written or oral communications have set forth facts constituting probable cause justifying his seizure\u201d and that he was \u201ctherefore unable to proffer factual allegations as to the lack of probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In opposition, the People argued that defendant did not establish a factual dispute that required a hearing. They argued that defendant failed to \u201cdispute the facts set forth in the complaint,\u201d VDF and/or the indictment and that, in fact, those sources specified that at least one witness identified defendant \u201cand that he also made admissions to having committed the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Supreme Court denied the Mapp/Dunaway<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing, stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">\u201cI\u2019m denying a Mapp/Dunaway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">\u201cThe VD.F. makes clear that the defendant was identified in a photo array prior to the arrest and that subject will be the issue of a Wade Hearing, in any event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">\u201cAnd the other matters which are referred to as unknown in the defense motion could have been discovered through a proper demand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">\u201cSo I\u2019m granting a Huntley and a Wade Hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC6\">Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed, holding that, given the information available to defendant, his conclusory assertions were insufficient to create a factual issue requiring a hearing (30 AD3d 1131 [2006]). A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Pursuant to CPL 710.60 (1), a suppression motion must contain sworn allegations of fact stating the ground or grounds for the motion. \u201cHearings are not automatic or generally available for the asking by boilerplate allegations\u201d <em>(People v Mendoza, </em>82 NY2d 415, 422 [1993]). The sufficiency of the factual allegations should be (1) evaluated by the face of the pleadings, (2) assessed in conjunction with the context of the motion and (3) evaluated by defendant\u2019s access to information <em>(id. </em>at 426). Applying the <em>Mendoza </em>factors, we conclude that defendant\u2019s motion for a <em>Mapp/Dunaway </em>hearing should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">In determining the sufficiency of a defendant\u2019s factual allegations, a court must read defendant\u2019s suppression motion in the context of the case. Further, \u201c[w]hether a defendant has raised factual issues requiring a hearing can only be determined with reference to the People\u2019s contentions\u201d <em>(Mendoza, </em>82 NY2d at 427). Here, defendant alleged that he was arrested at sometime after 12:30 p.m. in a building where he resides and away from where the crime took place. The People disputed this allegation and stated in their disclosure forms that defendant was not arrested until 7:30 p.m., after he had been identified by their witness and had made statements to the police. The time of arrest is, thus, in dispute because if defendant was arrested before his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>arrival at the police station, the only basis for probable cause was the witness identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Moreover, a court must consider \u201cthe degree to which the pleadings may reasonably be expected to be precise in view of the information available to defendant\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 429). In <em>People v Hightower </em>(85 NY2d 988 [1995]), defendant was charged with the sale of drugs. In his motion papers, defendant denied he sold drugs or assisted others in selling or possessing drugs. We held that those \u201callegations were sufficient when considered in the context of the case and in light of the minimal information available to the defendant at the time of the motion limited, as he was, by the bare allegations in the complaint\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 990). We observed that, based upon the meager information available to him, \u201cdefendant could do little but deny participation in the sale\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Here, defendant also lacked critical information only the People could provide \u2014 i.e., the factual predicate for his arrest. Because defendant lacked this information, he was not in a position to allege facts disputing the basis for his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The People could not both refuse to disclose the informant\u2019s identity, or at least some facts showing a basis for the informant\u2019s knowledge the police relied upon to establish probable cause for the arrest, and insist that defendant\u2019s averments in his pleadings were insufficient to obtain a <em>Mapp/Dunaway </em>hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Without more information, defendant could do little more than dispute the circumstances surrounding his arrest. Like the defendant in <em>Hightower, </em>defendant\u2019s lack of access to information precluded more specific factual allegations and created factual disputes, the resolution of which required a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Based on the foregoing, we hold that Supreme Court erred in summarily denying the <em>Mapp/Dunaway </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Accordingly, the Appellate Division order should be reversed, the plea vacated, and the case remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-12\">. <em>See generally, Dunaway v New York, </em>442 US 200 (1979); <em>Mapp v Ohio, </em>367 US 643 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-11\">. To establish probable cause for defendant\u2019s arrest, the People must establish the reliability of the witness and that person\u2019s basis of knowledge <em>(see Spinelli v United States, </em>393 US 410 [1969]; <em>Aguilar v Texas, </em>378 US 108 [1964]). As the People did not provide <em>any </em>information regarding the witness, they did not meet the requirements of the <em>Aguilar/Spinelli </em>test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
