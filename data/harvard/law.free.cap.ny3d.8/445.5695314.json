Gentles confronted him and the two scuffled, defendant trying to escape and Gentles trying to hold on to him. Defendant bit Gentles on the left ring finger and fled, but Gentles followed him in a car, eventually cornered him, and turned him over to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">The bite caused Gentles\u2019s fingernail to crack and his finger to bleed. After defendant was captured, Gentles went to the hospital, where he received a tetanus shot and a bandage. Gentles gave the following testimony about what the bite felt like:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u201cQ . . . And as a result of being bitten on your nail by the defendant, what happened, did you feel any pain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">\u201cA Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">\u201cQ All right. How much pain? A little pain, a lot of pain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cA In between.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">\u201cQ Okay. So, moderate pain you felt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">\u201cA Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">A jury convicted defendant on several charges, including second degree burglary (Penal Law \u00a7 140.25) and second degree assault (Penal Law \u00a7 120.05 [6]). It is an element of both these crimes that defendant caused \u201cphysical injury\u201d to Gentles, and defendant challenges his conviction on the ground that proof of physical injury was lacking. \u201cPhysical injury,\u201d as used in the Penal Law, means \u201cimpairment of physical condition or substantial pain\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 [9]). We decide that the record supports a finding of substantial pain, and do not consider whether impairment of physical condition was also established.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Of course \u201csubstantial pain\u201d cannot be defined precisely, but it can be said that it is more than slight or trivial pain. Pain need not, however, be severe or intense to be substantial. Beyond these generalizations, there are several factual aspects of a case that can be examined to decide whether enough pain was shown to support a finding of substantiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">Perhaps most important is the injury defendant inflicted, viewed objectively. Here, defendant broke Gentles\u2019s fingernail and caused him to bleed \u2014 an experience that would normally be expected to bring with it more than a little pain. Also important is the victim\u2019s subjective description of what he felt; sometimes an objective account of the injury, unaccompanied by testimony about the degree of pain the victim experienced, will be enough <em>(People v Rojas, </em>61 NY2d 726 [1984]), but sometimes it will not <em>(Matter of Philip </em>A., 49 NY2d 198 [1980]). Here, Gentles\u2019s testimony confirms that the pain was not trivial: he said it was in between \u201c[a] little\u201d and \u201ca lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">It is also relevant that Gentles sought medical treatment for the wound defendant inflicted \u2014 an indication that his pain was significant. And finally, the legislative history of the Penal Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>shows that the motive of the offender may be relevant: the revisors\u2019 notes to the sections defining assault say that \u201cpetty slaps, shoves, kicks and the like delivered out of hostility, meanness and similar motives\u201d constitute only harassment and not assault, because they do not inflict physical injury <em>(see </em>Staff Notes of Temp St Commn on Rev of Penal Law and Crim Code, 1964 Proposed NY Penal Law art 125, at 330, quoted in <em>Matter of Philip </em>A., 49 NY2d at 200). Motive is relevant because an offender more interested in displaying hostility than in inflicting pain will often not inflict much of it. Here, defendant\u2019s motive was to make Gentles let go of him: the whole point of the bite was to inflict as much pain as he could. Indeed, it seems unlikely that anything less than substantial pain would have caused Gentles, evidently a tenacious man, to release his hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
