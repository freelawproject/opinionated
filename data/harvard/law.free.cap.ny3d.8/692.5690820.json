This appeal centers on the phrase \u201cdriving while intoxicated\u201d in Vehicle and Traffic Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\u00a7 1192 (3). Based on the language, history and scheme of the statute, we conclude that the Legislature here intended to use \u201cintoxication\u201d to refer to a disordered state of mind caused by alcohol, not by drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">On the evening of January 13, 2004, defendant Vincent Litto, 19 years old, was driving south in Brooklyn on a four-lane road, with three passengers in his car. Traveling at 50 miles an hour on a road on which cars moved at an average speed of 30 miles an hour, defendant picked up a can of \u201cDust-Off\u201d from the dashboard and sprayed it into his mouth. About 45 seconds later, he veered into oncoming traffic and crashed into a vehicle driven by Andrea Sett. One of the passengers in Sett\u2019s car, 17-year-old Kristian Roggio, was killed. Sett, another passenger, defendant and two of his passengers were injured, some seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Dust-Off contains a hydrocarbon, difluoroethane, which assists as a propellant and gives a person who \u201chuffs\u201d it a \u201chigh.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to William Closson, a forensic expert who testified before the grand jury, inhalation of this hydrocarbon initially acts as a stimulant. Within seconds, however, the person\u2019s central nervous system becomes depressed, making it difficult to perceive and react to the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The People submitted 14 counts to the grand jury \u2014 one count each of manslaughter in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 125.15 [1]), vehicular manslaughter in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 125.12), criminally negligent homicide (Penal Law \u00a7 125.10), reckless endangerment in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 120.20), reckless driving (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1212), operating a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 [3]), four counts of assault in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 120.05 [4]) and four counts of assault in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 120.00 [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">On count six, driving while intoxicated, the prosecutor charged the grand jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">\u201cIf you find by the credible and legally sufficient ev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>idence that on or about January 13, 2004, in the County of Kings, City and state of New York, the defendant, Vincent Litto, did operate a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition, you may find one count of Operating a Motor Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The prosecutor instructed the grand jury that in order to charge defendant with vehicular manslaughter in the second degree, count two, it would have to find legally sufficient evidence that defendant committed the crime of criminally negligent homicide and caused the death of Kristian Roggio by operation of a vehicle in violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 (3). The grand jury indicted defendant on all 14 counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Upon defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal of the indictment and inspection of the grand jury minutes, Supreme Court found the evidence before the grand jury legally sufficient on all except counts two and six. The court determined that ingestion of hydrocarbon does not fall within Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 (3), driving while intoxicated, and therefore could not serve as a basis for the count of vehicular manslaughter. The evidence, however, was sufficient to sustain the grand jury\u2019s conclusion that the victim\u2019s death was a direct result of defendant\u2019s reckless conduct. The Appellate Division, with one Justice dissenting, affirmed. The court reasoned that, among other amendments in the Vehicle and Traffic Law, the Legislature\u2019s 1966 enactment of a separate provision prohibiting driving while ability impaired by drugs implied that the provision prohibiting driving while intoxicated did not proscribe such conduct. We agree with the determinations of Supreme Court and the Appellate Division and now affirm. Defendant stands accused of the 12 remaining criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The question posed in this case is whether a driver can be prosecuted under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 (3) for \u201cdriving while intoxicated\u201d while under the influence of a drug or other unlisted substance. The People argue that subdivision 3 includes the voluntary use of any substance or agent that can render a person \u201cintoxicated.\u201d Defendant asserts that \u201cintoxication\u201d under this statute applies only to alcohol. The legislative history of the statute and its scheme reveal that the Legislature\u2019s intent has been to treat a driver\u2019s use of alcohol differently from a driver\u2019s use of drugs, and that the prohibition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>driving while intoxicated under subdivision 3 of section 1192 is part of the strategy to prevent the \u201cdrinking driver\u201d from using the roadways.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Section 1192 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law is entitled: \u201cOperating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\u201d The law provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">\u201c1. Driving while ability impaired. No person shall operate a motor vehicle while the person\u2019s ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\u201c2. Driving while intoxicated; per se. No person shall operate a motor vehicle while such person has .08 of one per centum or more by weight of alcohol in the person\u2019s blood as shown by chemical analysis of such person\u2019s blood, breath, urine or saliva, made pursuant to the provisions of section eleven hundred ninety-four of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201c2-a. Aggravated driving while intoxicated; per se.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">No person shall operate a motor vehicle while such person has .18 of one per centum or more by weight of alcohol in such person\u2019s blood as shown by chemical analysis of such person\u2019s blood, breath, urine or saliva made pursuant to the provisions of section eleven hundred ninety-four of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">\u201c3. Driving while intoxicated. No person shall operate a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-10\">\u201c4. Driving while ability impaired by drugs. No person shall operate a motor vehicle while the person\u2019s ability to operate such a motor vehicle is impaired by the use of a drug as defined in this chapt\u00e9r.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-11\">\u201c4-a. Driving while ability impaired by the combined influence of drugs or of alcohol and any drug or drugs. No person shall operate a motor vehicle while the person\u2019s ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the combined influence of drugs or of alcohol and any drug or drugs. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-12\">\u201c9. Conviction of a different charge. A driver may be convicted of a violation of subdivision one, two or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>three of this section, notwithstanding that the charge laid before the court alleged a violation of subdivision two or three of this section . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 114-a, in the same chapter \u2014 chapter 71 of the Consolidated Laws \u2014 as section 1192, provides: \u201cThe term \u2018drug\u2019 when used in this chapter, means and includes any substance listed in section thirty-three hundred six of the public health law.\u201d Public Health Law \u00a7 3306 is an extensive schedule of controlled substances. Neither difluoroethane nor the more general hydrocarbon is on the list and, therefore, defendant in this case could not have been charged under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 (4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 (1) is a traffic infraction; violations of subdivisions 2 through 4-a are misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The Court\u2019s primary goal is to interpret a statute by determining, and implementing, the Legislature\u2019s intent. Analysis begins with the language of the statute itself. Next, in construing a statute, the courts frequently \u201cfollow the course of legislation on the subject, the lineage of the act being thought to illuminate the intent of the legislature\u201d (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 124, at 255; <em>see Matter of Tompkins County Support Collection Unit v Chamberlin, </em>99 NY2d 328, 335 [2003]; <em>Riley v County of Broome, </em>95 NY2d 455, 463 [2000]). The Court additionally looks to the purposes underlying the legislative scheme <em>(see Sheehy v Big Flats Community Day, </em>73 NY2d 629, 634 [1989]). That method is particularly apt in this case in which the Legislature itself, over the course of the century, has repeatedly refined the statute as society has evolved, science has progressed and new problems have emerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The Language of the Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The plain meaning of the language of a statute must be interpreted \u201cin the light of conditions existing at the time of its passage and construed as the courts would have construed it soon after its passage\u201d <em>(People v Koch, </em>250 App Div 623, 624 [2d Dept 1937]; <em>see People v Broadway R.R. Co. of Brooklyn, </em>126 NY 29, 37 [1891]).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">When enacted in 1910, section 290 (3) of the Highway Law (precursor to section 1192) stated: \u201cWhoever operates a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>vehicle while in an intoxicated condition shall be guilty of a misdemeanor\u201d (L 1910, ch 374, \u00a7 1, at 684, amending Highway Law of 1909 tit 11 [L 1909, ch 30, 3 Birdseye, Gumming and Gilbert\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, at 3622 (2d ed)]). The law did not \u2014 as it does not today \u2014 define \u201cintoxication.\u201d In <em>People v Weaver </em>(188 App Div 395, 399 [3d Dept 1919]), the court interpreted this statute by using \u201cthe ordinary speech of people.\u201d After citing to various dictionary definitions, the court adopted a rule that under Highway Law \u00a7 290 (3), one is \u201cintoxicated when he has imbibed enough liquor to render him incapable of giving that attention and care to the operation of his automobile that a man of prudence and reasonable intelligence would give\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 400). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary in 1910 defined \u201cintoxication\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-4\">\u201cThe state of being poisoned; the condition produced by the administration or introduction into the human system of a poison. But in its popular use this term is restricted to <em>alcoholic </em>intoxication, that is, drunkenness or inebriety, or the mental and physical condition induced by drinking excessive quantities of alcoholic liquors, and this is its meaning as used in statutes, indictments, etc.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 652 [2d ed 1910].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In 1914, Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary (at 943, 1680 [3d rev ed 1914]) defined \u201cintoxication\u201d simply as \u201cdrunkenness,\u201d which, in turn, was defined as: \u201c[t]he condition of a man whose mind is affected by the immediate use of intoxicating drinks.\u201d The definition in Webster\u2019s International Dictionary was: \u201cthe state of being intoxicated or drunk; inebriation; ebriety; drunkenness\u201d (Webster\u2019s International Dictionary 782 [1908]). Webster\u2019s also notes the medical definition of \u201ca poisoning, as by a spirituous or a narcotic substance\u201d <em>(id.). </em>While this latter definition refers to a narcotic as an intoxicant, and some other dictionaries mention drugs,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the common, ordinary usage of the word \u201cintoxication\u201d appears to have been a condition caused by alcohol <em>(see People v Grinberg, </em>4 Misc 3d 670, 674 [Crim Ct, Kings County 2004], quoting <em>Ring v Ring, </em>112 Ga 854, 857, 38 SE 330, 331 [1901], in which the Supreme Court of Georgia at the start of the twentieth century analyzed the term \u201cintoxication\u201d as defined in several dictionaries and encyclopedias and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>concluded that \u201clexicographers treat \u2018intoxication\u2019 and \u2018drunkenness\u2019 as synonymous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The Course of the Legislation</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In 1929, the statute prohibiting intoxication while driving became part of the Vehicle and Traffic Law as section 70 (5) (L 1929, ch 54; <em>see </em>King and Tipperman, <em>The Offense of Driving While Intoxicated: The Development of Statutory and Case Law in New York, </em>3 Hofstra L Rev 541, 545 [1975]). Convictions were based on a defendant\u2019s conduct and demeanor at the time of arrest <em>(see People v Cruz, </em>48 NY2d 419, 424 [1979]).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">It was not until 1941, after years of extensive study and debate, that a major amendment permitted the admission at trial of tests for blood alcohol content (L 1941, ch 726; King at 546). Except for adding motorcycles, the prohibition against driving while intoxicated used the exact language as in 1910, and included a statement that evidence of the amount of alcohol in the blood from a test taken within two hours of arrest was admissible to prove intoxication. The test could be by medical or chemical analysis of the driver\u2019s breath, blood, urine or saliva.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Use of the term \u201cintoxicated\u201d along with the specific amounts of alcohol in the blood is evidence that the Legislature intended \u2014 and likely assumed that the Legislature in 1910 intended \u2014 that \u201cintoxication\u201d means that a mind is altered by an amount of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The legislative history of the 1941 amendment supports that interpretation. Dutton S. Peterson, the sponsor, wrote to the Governor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-9\">\u201cSince this bill has been approved by the highest medical authority, The American Medical Association, bar associations, police organizations, civic organizations, and automobile clubs, and because of the need for a further curb on the drinking driver, I urge that you sign this bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">\u201cI have made an extensive study of this matter.\u201d (Letter from Assembly Sponsor, Apr. 19, 1941, Bill Jacket, L 1941, ch 726, at 39.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>A \u201csummary of evidence\u201d is enclosed with that letter. Peterson notes that \u201cdifferent drinkers are differently affected by the same amount of alcoholic beverages,\u201d and, thus, \u201cthe only fair test of intoxication is to determine the degree of alochol [szc] concentration in the blood by scientific tests\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 41). The percentages were arrived at through \u201ccareful study\u201d and \u201cthousands of medical tests\u201d which were \u201cnot disputed by any reputable medical authority\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 40, 41). Exhaustive studies were made by the National Safety Council <em>(id. </em>at 42). The American Medical Association noted the disability by prescribed drugs but used the term \u201cintoxication\u201d for the amount of alcohol in the blood (AMA, Report of the Committee to Study Problems of Motor Vehicle Accidents, May 1939, Bill Jacket, L 1941, ch 726, at 47-49). The Senate sponsor also sought the admission of scientific tests to prove intoxication to \u201ccut[ ] down the number of injuries and deaths caused by the drunken drivers\u201d (Letter from Senate Sponsor, Apr. 24, 1941, Bill Jacket, L 1941, ch 726, at 69).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Some voiced concern over the medical reliability of the tests and of the amounts of alcohol that would show intoxication. For example, one group noted that it had disapproved a previous 1938 bill because the medical profession was not \u201cunanimous in its opinion as to the results obtainable from urine and blood tests,\u201d which, \u201caccording to some, are not determinative on the question of whether or not any <em>particular </em>person is intoxicated\u201d (Mem of Comm on Crim Cts Law and Pro of Assn of Bar of City of NY, Bill Jacket, L 1941, ch 726, at 4-5; <em>see </em>Rep of NY County Lawyers\u2019 Assn. Comm on State Legislation, Bill Jacket, at 7; Letter from Commr of Taxation and Fin, Bill Jacket, at 25 [\u201cwhile tests of the amount of alcohol in the blood may furnish valuable evidence as to intoxication, there ought to be supporting evidence to warrant a conviction\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">This extensive documentation demonstrates that the legislative goal of strengthening the ability to prosecute for driving in an intoxicated condition was to address the drinking driver, not the driver who uses drugs. Only after studying exhaustive scientific and statistical tests confirming the validity of the percentages for blood alcohol content did the Legislature pass a law that would find intoxicated drivers liable for criminal penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In 1959, section 70 (5) became section 1192 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, and an implied consent law was added as section 1194 (L 1959, ch 775; King at 561-562 [if a driver refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>submit to breath, blood, urine or saliva sample, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles was required to revoke the driver\u2019s license]).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">A 1960 amendment added a new offense to section 1192\u2014 driving \u201cwhile ability to operate is impaired by the consumption of alcohol\u201d (L 1960, ch 184). The new subdivision 1 was enacted so that an impaired driver \u2014 one whose blood alcohol content was .10% or more, and less than .15% \u2014 could receive a traffic infraction and not be criminally liable. The language prohibiting driving while intoxicated was kept intact, became subdivision 2 and remained a misdemeanor. Underlying the amendment were vast medical and scientific data \u2014 including laboratory and field investigations \u2014 to confirm that the amount of alcohol content would be an accurate showing of impairment (Sponsor\u2019s Mem and Appendix, Bill Jacket, L 1960, ch 184, at 1-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Opposed to the amendment, the New York State Automobile Association found fault with the difficulty of enforcement for such low amounts of alcohol in the blood and wondered why \u201clittle mention is made of the impairment produced by fatigue, tension, the taking of medicines or even indisposition caused by indigestion\u201d (Letter from NY State Auto Assn, Bill Jacket, at 12). The Governor\u2019s memorandum, however, indicated that the amendment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">\u201cprovides a realistic approach towards reducing the tragic toll of death and injury caused by the drinking driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\u201cExisting law has proved inadequate in this regard in that it is directed towards only the most serious offender, the driver with a blood-alcohol level of at least 0.15%. In requiring that the drinking driver be classified as a criminal, present law has not proved adequate to remove the drinking driver from our highways\u201d (Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1960, ch 184, 1960 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The Legislature was focusing on \u201cdrinking drivers,\u201d the more serious ones designated \u201cintoxicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">In 1966, the Legislature enacted what is now section 1192 (4), making it a misdemeanor to operate a motor vehicle while a driver\u2019s ability is impaired by the use of a drug, and defining those drugs in section 114-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law (L 1966, ch 963, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4). (Those drugs are now specified in section 3306 of the Public Health Law.) The sponsor of the bill, Norman E Lent, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u201cSection 1192 (2) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law as presently written pertains to the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. If a person is convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor and his license may be revoked. More serious penalties result for second or more offenders within a ten year period. The bill would impose equal sanctions on persons convicted of driving while his ability to do so is impaired by the use of a drug, as that term is defined in the bill. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-4\">\u201cNew York is one of the few remaining major states without a law against operating a motor vehicle while one\u2019s ability is impaired by the use of drugs and narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">\u201cPassage of such a law should also curb the present practice employed by defendants in drunk driving prosecutions of claiming they were not drunk, but \u2018merely\u2019 under the influence of a drug or narcotic prescribed by their physician. It is just as dangerous to operate a motor vehicle while one\u2019s ability to drive is impaired by a drug or narcotic, as it is to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol\u201d (Letter from Senate Sponsor, June 7, 1966, Bill Jacket, L 1966, ch 963, at 14-15).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Other letters demonstrate that the subdivision prohibiting \u201cintoxication\u201d did not cover the use of drugs. The Attorney General wrote that the bill would amend the statute so that \u201cexisting provisions of law relating to driving while ability is impaired by alcohol or drunken driving will be extended to apply to driving while ability is impaired by the use of a drug\u201d (Letter from Attorney General, June 7, 1966, Bill Jacket, L 1966, ch 963, at 17). The Department of Motor Vehicles similarly recommended passage because, until this enactment, the Commissioner was unable to \u201ctake effective action\u201d by revoking a driver\u2019s license from a driver impaired by the use of drugs, \u201cand the police agencies were unable to convict a person who drove while so impaired\u201d (Letter from Commr of Motor Vehs, Apr. 1, 1966, Bill Jacket, at 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The Department of Health recommended disapproval, for while \u201c[t]he law has established standards for determining degrees of intoxication which can be accurately determined by chemical tests,\u201d research was necessary before standards could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>be devised for ascertaining impairment by the use of drugs (Letter from Counsel for Dept of Health, Apr. 11, 1966, Bill Jacket, at 23). The Department of Mental Hygiene concurred that \u201c[a]s contrasted with the standard of intoxication, for which presumptions are created, based on medical research, that certain proportions of alcohol in the blood have certain legal consequences, there is no comparable standard set up for various quantities of the defined drugs\u201d (Letter from Counsel for Dept of Mental Hygiene, June 6, 1966, Bill Jacket, at 27).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Two other groups also voiced concern in holding a person criminally liable for taking a drug when the driver had no intent to become impaired (Letter from State Adm\u2019r of Jud Conf, Apr. 12, 1966, Bill Jacket, at 21-22; Mem of Supt of NY State Police, Mar. 31, 1966, Bill Jacket, at 30). Nothing in this Bill Jacket suggests that the provision on \u201cintoxication\u201d included a violation for use of drugs while driving. The legislative history is conclusive that the Legislature in 1966, like previous Legislatures, intended that \u201cintoxication\u201d refer to inebriation by alcohol. It appears that the Legislature did not want to penalize a driver who inadvertently took prescription drugs without knowing their side effects. In addition, the Legislature sought to limit criminalization by defining the drugs prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">In 1970, a new provision, now titled \u201cDriving while intoxicated; per se,\u201d made it a misdemeanor to drive with a blood alcohol content of .15% or more (L 1970, ch 275, \u00a7 3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Governor\u2019s Program Bill stated that the \u201cpresent provisions relating to driving while intoxicated\u201d would be substantially reenacted, but the blood alcohol content for prima facie evidence would be changed (Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1970, ch 275, at 1-2). The amendment would also \u201csubstantially reenact the present provisions governing driving while ability is impaired by the use of drugs\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Further, a new section 1196 (now section 1192 [9]) would be added \u201cto permit a conviction ... of a violation of either subdivision 1 (driving while impaired), 2 (.15 or higher) or 3 (driving while intoxicated) of section 1192 where the original charge alleged a violation of either subdivision 2 or 3 of such section\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The concept of making it unlawful per se to drive with a specific blood alcohol content was patterned after programs in England and Scandinavia. The Automobile Association reversed its opposition because of new research studies, including by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (Mem in Support of NY State Auto Assn, Feb. 27, 1970, Bill Jacket, at 21). In his memorandum, the Governor wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">\u201cPresent law provides that the presence of this level of alcohol is merely prima facie evidence of intoxication and makes the determination of intoxication one of subjective judgment. As a consequence, existing provisions have not been sufficiently effective in getting drunk drivers off the road and in deterring others from driving while under the influence of alcohol\u201d (Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1970, ch 275, Bill Jacket, at 24).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The word \u201cintoxication\u201d here is consistently synonymous with being under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Most recently, in 2006, the Legislature amended section 1192 by adding subdivision 2-a, \u201cAggravated driving while intoxicated; per se\u201d \u2014 which is violated when a person drives with a blood alcohol content of .18% \u2014 and subdivision 4-a, \u201cDriving while ability impaired by the combined influence of drugs or of alcohol and any drug or drugs\u201d (L 2006, ch 732, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2). Several related statutes were also revised. Penal Law \u00a7 125.12, vehicular manslaughter in the second degree, was amended to include subdivision 4-a, and underscores that the Legislators intended that \u201cintoxication\u201d should be by use of alcohol, not drugs. That section now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">\u201cA person is guilty of vehicular manslaughter in the second degree when he or she causes the death of another person, and either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-10\">\u201c(1) operates a motor vehicle in violation of subdivision two, three, four or four-a of section eleven hundred ninety-two of the vehicle and traffic law . . . , and as a result of such intoxication or impairment by the use of a drug, or by the combined influence of drugs or of alcohol and any drug or drugs, operates such a motor vehicle . . . in a manner that causes the death of such other person . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">\u201cIntoxication\u201d covers all the provisions including alcohol, while \u201cimpairment by the use of a drug\u201d refers to subdivision 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>and \u201cthe combined influence\u201d refers to subdivision 4-a of section 1192. The 2006 legislation \u201creflects a thorough overview of the broad scope of alcohol and drug related statutes in New York\u201d (Senate Introducer Mem in Support of L 2006, ch 732, 2006 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2183). One argument supporting subdivision 2-a was that \u201c[t]he more intoxicated a driver is, the greater the risk of an accident. This bill appropriately addresses the seriousness of DWI and establishes graduated penalties for more intoxicated drivers . . . .\u201d (Budget Rep on Bills, Bill Jacket, L 2006, ch 732, at 9.) Stiff penalties for \u201cdriving while intoxicated\u201d were to deter \u201chard core drinking drivers\u201d (Letter from Suffolk County Exec, Sept. 7, 2006, Bill Jacket, at 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The Scheme Underlying the Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The legislative history not only manifests legislative intent to employ the term \u201cintoxicated\u201d to refer to persons inebriated by alcohol and to prevent them from driving, but also reveals a scheme by which the statute would reach that goal. This Court must determine \u201cthe consistency\u201d of the Legislature\u2019s reaching its goal \u201cwith the purposes underlying the legislative <em>scheme\u201d (Sheehy, </em>73 NY2d at 634, quoting <em>Bums Jackson Miller Summit &amp; Spitzer v Lindner, </em>59 NY2d 314, 325 [1983]). \u201cFor, the Legislature has both the right and the authority to select the methods to be used in effectuating its goals, as well as to choose the goals themselves\u201d <em>(id.). Sheehy </em>and <em>Burns Jackson </em>addressed private rights of action. The same reasoning applies here \u2014 the implementation of an action \u201cshould not be judicially sanctioned if it is incompatible with the enforcement mechanism chosen by the Legislature or with some other aspect of the over-all statutory scheme\u201d <em>(Sheehy, </em>73 NY2d at 635).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In two respects, the People\u2019s construction of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 (3) is out of step with the statutory scheme. First, the scheme of section 1192 provides for different levels or kinds of proof to establish violations of the statute. Thus, a prosecutor must show impairment by alcohol to prove a violation of subdivision 1 \u2014 resulting in a traffic infraction. Subdivision 1 is a lesser-included offense of subdivisions 2 and 3. Subdivisions 2 and 2-a require a showing of a specific amount of blood alcohol content to result in a per se criminal violation, whereas subdivision 3 \u2014 \u201cin an intoxicated condition\u201d \u2014 allows for a circumstantial showing of inability to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Confirming this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>scheme, subdivision 9 explicitly permits a conviction under subdivision 1, 2 or 3 even when the charge alleges a violation of either subdivision 2 or 3. If subdivision 3 were now read, as the People urge, to allow for any drug to be included as part of the definition of \u201cintoxication,\u201d then one who has committed a misdemeanor under subdivision 3 could not, in contravention of the legislative plan, be found to have committed the lesser-included offense of driving while impaired by alcohol under subdivision 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Second, while the legislative history from 1910 is unavailable, the history thereafter shows that the Legislature has consistently presumed that the initial statute was created to prevent drunk driving. Although, as the People argue, the goal of the Legislature may be advanced by including use of drugs in the definition of \u201cintoxication,\u201d the Legislature has repeatedly and definitively concentrated on precise mechanisms to prevent deathly accidents related to alcohol and drugs <em>(see Mark G. v Sabol, </em>93 NY2d 710, 722 [1999]). Including driving while under the influence of limitless \u201cdrugs\u201d as a violation of driving while intoxicated has not been part of that mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In 1960, the Legislature added section 1192 (1) to assure that not all drivers who were under the influence of alcohol would be criminally liable. This Court determined that this subdivision and subdivision 3 were not unconstitutionally vague <em>(see Cruz, </em>48 NY2d 419). The Court concluded that, as to subdivision 1, evident from the statutory language and scheme, the issue was \u201cwhether, by voluntarily consuming alcohol, this particular defendant has actually impaired, to any extent, the physical and mental abilities which he is expected to possess in order to operate a vehicle as a reasonable and prudent driver\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 427). \u201cIntoxication,\u201d the Court stated, \u201cis not an unfamiliar concept\u201d and is \u201cintelligible to the average person.\u201d The standard to determine intoxication is \u201cwhether the individual\u2019s consumption of alcohol has rendered him <em>incapable </em>of employing the physical or mental abilities needed to, for instance, form a specific intent\u201d <em>(id.). </em>These terms, the Court continued, have an accepted meaning \u201clong recognized in law and life\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 428). The Court thus upheld the Legislature\u2019s scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The addition in 1966 of subdivision 4 demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s desire to add the use of drugs to that of alcohol for further prevention of deaths on the highway. Were drugs included in the definition for \u201cintoxication\u201d under subdivision 3, the Legislature would have had no reason to add another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>misdemeanor. Rather, the Legislature, after careful study and debate, concluded that a driver could be convicted for impairment by drugs \u2014 and then only by explicitly enumerated drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Moreover, the addition in 1970 of section 1196 (now section 1192 [9]) reaffirms that the term \u201cintoxication\u201d refers to the use of alcohol. In <em>People v Farmer </em>(36 NY2d 386, 390 [1975]), the Court held that, pursuant to section 1196, the defendant charged under subdivision 3 had notice that he could be convicted under subdivision 2. Although subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 \u201cproscribe separable offenses based upon the degree of impairment caused by alcohol ingestion,\u201d the provisions \u201cclosely overlap\u201d and are \u201cspecies of the generic offense of \u2018Operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol\u2019 \u201d (id.; <em>see also People v Bayer, </em>132 AD2d 920 [4th Dept 1987]; <em>Grinberg, </em>4 Misc 3d at 677). Again, the Court upheld the legislative scheme and interpreted the legislative intent to be that driving while intoxicated under subdivision 3 addresses those who drink and drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Only last year, focusing its attention on strengthening the statute, the Legislature added one provision to prohibit driving while using alcohol \u2014 aggravated driving while intoxicated, subdivision 2-a \u2014 and another provision to prohibit driving while using a combination of \u201cdrugs or of alcohol and any drug or drugs\u201d \u2014 subdivision 4-a. The Legislature unambiguously employed the term \u201cintoxicated\u201d for the level of alcohol, and the terms \u201calcohol\u201d and \u201cdrugs\u201d for the combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">If defendant did what the prosecution charges, then his conduct was reprehensible \u2014 his voluntary inhalation of hydrocarbon while driving resulted in the death of a young woman and serious injuries to others. Perhaps gaps exist in the law and the prosecution should not have to rely on the 12 other counts charged. However, a determination by this Court that intoxication in Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1192 (3) includes the use of any substance would improperly override the legislative policy judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Judges Cipakick, Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-10\">.
