We conclude that it is and that her claim must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Kolnacki commenced this suit seeking to recover for personal injuries sustained on July 8, 2000 as the result of a slip and fall at Artpark \u2014 a park in Western New York with outdoor theater facilities. Her claim indicates that she fractured her left patella and suffered dental damage, as well as other bruises and lacerations. The original claim was served on or about July 27, 2000, but was neither filed nor verified. Moreover, the claim did not state a specific dollar amount of damages. The State answered raising several affirmative defenses including, as relevant here, that \u201c[t]he contents of the . . . Claim served herein do not comply with the provisions of Section 11 of the Court of Claims Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Subsequently, Kolnacki served and filed a properly verified claim that, like the previous claim, did not contain a total amount of requested damages. Instead, the claim indicated that \u201c[t]he full extent of claimant\u2019s injuries [is] not yet known,\u201d and that she had \u201cincurred injuries, damages, medical and hospital expenses which are to date undetermined and will incur loss of earnings and impairment of health.\u201d The verified bill of particulars likewise did not state the total sum claimed. The State orally moved to dismiss the claim, at the commencement of trial, for failure to comply with the requirements of section 11 (b) of the Court of Claims Act by omitting the amount of damages sought. The court denied the motion without prejudice to the State serving and filing a formal written motion in compliance with CPLR 2214.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">After a trial on the issue of liability, the court found the State partially at fault. Thereafter, the State filed a written motion to dismiss the claim on the same basis as its previous oral motion \u2014 claimant\u2019s failure to state the amount of damages. The court granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, found that the failure to satisfy the requirements of section 11 (b) was a jurisdictional defect and rejected Kolnacki\u2019s argument that substantial compliance with the statute was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">A majority of the Appellate Division reversed and reinstated the claim, finding that the extent of Kolnacki\u2019s damages was difficult to determine and that she alleged sufficient information for the State to ascertain its potential liability. Two Justices dissented and voted to affirm, asserting that the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ments of section 11 (b) should be strictly construed and that the failure to state the total sum claimed was a jurisdictional defect. The Appellate Division granted the State\u2019s motion for leave to appeal to this Court and certified the following question: \u201cWas the order of this Court, entered April 28, 2006, properly made\u201d? We reverse and answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Under section 8 of the Court of Claims Act, the State has waived its sovereign immunity from liability \u201cprovided the claimant complies with the limitations of this article [\u00a7\u00a7 8-12].\u201d The Act contains several conditions that must be met in order to assert a claim against the State. Specifically, \u201c[t]he claim shall state the time when and place where such claim arose, the nature of same, and the items of damage or injuries claimed to have been sustained and the <em>total sum </em>claimed\u201d (Court of Claims Act \u00a7 11 [b] [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u201c \u2018[B]ecause suits against the State are allowed only by the State\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity and in derogation of the common law, statutory requirements conditioning suit must be strictly construed\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lichtenstein v State of New York, </em>93 NY2d 911, 913 [1999], quoting <em>Dreger v New York State Thruway Auth., </em>81 NY2d 721, 724 [1992]). Section 11 plainly requires that the claim state the total sum claimant is seeking. Notwithstanding Kolnacki\u2019s argument that \u201cthe total sum claimed\u201d does not necessarily have to be a dollar figure, it is clear that her claim \u2014 entirely lacking any amount of monetary damages\u2014 failed to satisfy the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Recently, in <em>Lepkowski v State of New York </em>(1 NY3d 201, 207 [2003]), the claims of civil service employees seeking overtime pay were dismissed for failure to comply with the pleading requirements of section 11 (b). The employees\u2019 claims did not adequately allege when or where they arose, the items of damage claimed or \u201cthe total sum claimed\u201d <em>(see Lepkowski, </em>1 NY3d at 207-208). The Court observed that the State is not responsible for uncovering information that the claimant is required to allege under section 11 (b) <em>(see Lepkowski, </em>1 NY3d at 208).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Kolnacki argues that <em>Lepkowski </em>is distinguishable because in the present case there is only one deficiency in the claim\u2014 failure to allege the total sum claimed \u2014 and because this is an action for personal injuries, which may be harder to quantify. These distinctions lack merit. <em>Lepkowski </em>made clear that all of the requirements in section 11 (b) are \u201csubstantive conditions upon the State\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity\u201d (1 NY3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>207). The failure to satisfy any of the conditions is a jurisdictional defect. And while it may he true that damages in personal injury cases are harder to quantify at the outset, we fail to see why this prevents a claimant from providing any estimate whatsoever. A claim may always be amended at a later time, if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Moreover, this is not a new principle. We have consistently held that nothing less than strict compliance with the jurisdictional requirements of the Court of Claims Act is necessary <em>(see Long v State of New York, </em>7 NY3d 269, 276 [2006] [dismissing claimant\u2019s action for failure to comply with verification requirements of Court of Claims Act \u00a7 8-b (4)]; <em>Alston v State of New York, </em>97 NY2d 159, 164 [2001] [dismissing claim for failure to file within the time limitation of Court of Claims Act \u00a7 10 (4)]; <em>Lichtenstein, </em>93 NY2d at 913 [dismissing claim for failure to comply with Court of Claims Act \u00a7 10 (2) and (3)]; <em>Dreger, </em>81 NY2d at 724 [dismissing claims for failure to satisfy the filing and service requirements of Court of Claims Act \u00a7 11]). It is clear that the total amount of damages must be specified. Although the result may be harsh, it is for the Legislature, not this Court, to set the terms of the State\u2019s waiver of immunity.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In support of her argument, Kolnacki cites several Appellate Division decisions <em>(see Morris v State of New York, </em>27 AD3d 282 [1st Dept 2006]; <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v State of New York, 121 </em>AD2d 694 [2d Dept 1986]; <em>Barski v State of New York, </em>43 AD2d 767 [3d Dept 1973]). These cases address the situation presented when a claimant seeks to have a notice of intention to file a claim treated as a claim. Given this distinction, they are not pertinent to the issue presented here. The remaining contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss should be granted, the claim should be dismissed and the certified question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Graffeo, Read and Smith concur; Judges Pigott and Jones taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\"> In other statutes, the Legislature has specifically prohibited a claimant from stating a specific amount of damages <em>(see e.g. </em>CPLR 3017 [c] [in a personal injury or wrongful death action, the \u201ccomplaint shall contain a prayer for general relief but shall not state the amount of damages to which the pleader deems him(or her)self entitled\u201d]; General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e [2] [a notice of claim \u201cagainst a municipal corporation other than a city with a population of one million or more persons shall not state the amount of damages to which the claimant deems him(or her)self entitled, provided, however, that the municipal corporation . . . may at any time request a supplemental claim setting forth the total damages\u201d]). That the Legislature amended these statutes to prevent a claimant from pleading a particular sum of damages (L 1980, ch 686, \u00a7 1, amending General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e [2]; L 1976, ch 955, \u00a7 10, amending CPLR 3017) without similarly amending the Court of Claims Act lends support to our conclusion <em>(see generally People v Moquin, </em>77 NY2d 449, 455-456 [1991]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
