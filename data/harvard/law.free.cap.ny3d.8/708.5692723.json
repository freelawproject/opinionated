The lower court erred in treating BP Air Conditioning Corp. as an additional insured under the One Beacon Insurance Group policy. <em>(Continental Cas.

Regardless of whether the court was correct in deeming BP Air Conditioning Corp. an additional insured under the One Beacon Insurance Group policy, the court erred in finding that <em>Pecker Iron Works of N.Y. v Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co. </em>(99 NY2d 391 [2003]) mandates One Beacon to provide primary coverage without consideration of the respective policies\u2019 language. <em>(Jefferson Ins. Co. of N.Y. v Travelers Indem.

Pitman </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuC\">I. The duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, thus, one Beacon Insurance Group\u2019s defense duty to BP Air Conditioning Corp. was triggered by the allegations in Joseph Cosentino\u2019s amended complaint. <em>(Town of Massena v Healthcare Underwriters Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 NY2d 435; <em>Incorporated Vil. of Cedarhurst v Hanover Ins. Co., </em>89 NY2d 293; <em>Ruder &amp; Finn v Seaboard Sur. Co., 52 </em>NY2d 663; <em>Technicon Elecs.

One Beacon Insurance Group\u2019s argument, that its duty to defend is contingent on a liability finding, negates a primary insurer\u2019s duty to defend, ignores that relatively few cases are tried, and would engender protracted litigation. <em>(Seaboard Sur. Co. v Gillette Co., </em>64 NY2d 304; <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. v Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>4 NY3d 451; <em>Album Realty Corp. v American Home Assur.

The lower court correctly held that One Beacon Insurance Group\u2019s policy is primary to any policy covering BP Air Conditioning Corp. as a named insured. <em>(Pecker Iron Works of N.Y. v Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co., </em>99 NY2d 391; <em>United States Liab. Ins. Co. v Mountain Val. Indem.

One Beacon Insurance Group must defend BP Air Conditioning Corp. because it provided coverage for Alfa Piping Corp.\u2019s contractually assumed liabilities. <em>(Travelers Indent. Co. v LLJV Dev. Corp., </em>227 AD2d 151; <em>Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v Interboro Asphalt Surface Co., </em>303 AD2d 532; <em>Antonitti v City of Glen Cove, </em>266 AD2d 487; <em>New York City Tr.

Co., </em>7 AD3d 942; <em>Hailey v New York State Elec. &amp; Gas Corp., </em>214 AD2d 986.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b789-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b789-6\">CIPARICK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">We are asked to decide within the context of a comprehensive general liability (CGL) insurance policy whether liability must be determined before an additional named insured is entitled to a defense in an underlying personal injury action. We conclude that additional insured coverage is not contingent upon a liability finding and that the obligation of an insurer to provide a defense to an additional named insured under the policy exists to the same extent as it does to a named insured. We are unable to answer a second question regarding priority of coverage since the relevant parties and policies at issue are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">In 2000, Henegan Construction Company, Inc., a general contractor on a multi-floor renovation project at the World Trade Center, subcontracted the HVAC work to BP Air Conditioning Corp. BP subsequently subcontracted the HVAC-related steam fitting work to Alfa Piping Corp. The purchase order memorializing the subcontract between BP and Alfa contained the following indemnification/hold-harmless clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-9\">\u201cTo the fullest extent permitted by law, Subcontractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Owner, General Contractor and BP Air Conditioning and their agent and employees from and against all claims, damages, losses, and expenses, including, but not limited to attorneys fees, arising out of or resulting from the performance of the Work, provided that any such claims, damages, losses or expenses are (1) attributable to bodily injury[,] sickness, disease or death or to injury or to destruction of tangible property including the loss of use resulting therefrom and (2) caused in whole or in part by any negligent act or omission of the Subcontractor, any sub-subcontractor, anyone directly or indirectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>employed, by any of them or anyone for whose acts any of them be liable, regardless of whether or not it is caused in part by a party indemnified hereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Furthermore, the purchase order required Alfa to obtain \u201cComprehensive General Liability [insurance . . . naming [BP] . . . additional insured.\u201d The CGL policy issued by defendant, One Beacon Insurance Group,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Alfa included an additional insured endorsement, which provided in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">\u201cWho is An Insured (Section II) is amended to include as an insured any person or organization for whom you are performing operations when you and such person or organization have agreed in writing in a contract or agreement that such person or organization be added as an additional insured on your policy. Such person or organization is an additional insured only with respect to liability arising out of your ongoing operations performed for that insured. A person\u2019s or organization\u2019s status as an insured under this endorsement ends when your operations for that insured are completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">In December 2000, Joseph Cosentino, an employee of Karo Sheet Metal, Inc., another subcontractor hired by BP was allegedly injured when he slipped and fell on an oil slick that had originated from a machine used to cut and thread pipe at the work site. Cosentino commenced an action against Henegan,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who then brought a third-party action against BP and Alfa, who were subsequently added as direct defendants in the Cosentino action.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">BP as an additional named insured on Alfa\u2019s policy, tendered its defense in the Cosentino action to One Beacon, which declined to defend BP although it defended Alfa, its insured in the underlying action. BP then commenced a fourth-party action against One Beacon, seeking a declaration of its rights as an additional insured under Alfa\u2019s policy, and against Karo, asserting various contractual and common-law claims. One Beacon subsequently moved to sever BP\u2019s fourth-party declaratory judgment action against it from the Cosentino action. The motion court granted One Beacon\u2019s motion, which left Karo as the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>fourth-party defendant in the underlying action and BP and One Beacon as the remaining parties to this declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Thereafter, BP moved for partial summary judgment, seeking an order requiring One Beacon to defend it in the underlying action and for reimbursement of its past defense costs. One Beacon opposed summary judgment contending that it was not obligated to defend BP until it was determined that Cosentino\u2019s alleged injury arose out of Alfa\u2019s activities, and that One Beacon\u2019s responsibility, if any, for the costs of BP\u2019s defense could not be determined without considering other relevant policies at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Supreme Court granted BP\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, to the extent that One Beacon is obligated to defend BP in the Cosentino action. However, the court declined to declare that One Beacon was primarily responsible for BP\u2019s defense costs. The court opined that since no copies of other relevant insurance policies were submitted, it was \u201cunable to ascertain whether . . . some other carrier[ ] should be treated as a co-insurer or an excess carrier to [One Beacon, and that its] ultimate contribution for defense and indemnification[,] if any, cannot be determined from the present submissions\u201d (2004 NY Slip Op 30129[U], *7). The Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting, modified Supreme Court\u2019s order, holding that One Beacon must provide BP a defense in the Cosentino action and that this coverage is primary and BP\u2019s coverage under its own policy is excess (33 AD3d 116 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Relying on the Appellate Division\u2019s holding in <em>AIU Ins. Co. v American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>(292 AD2d 277 [1st Dept 2002]), the dissenting Justices stated that because \u201cthe [additional insured] endorsement creates a condition precedent to the triggering of additional insured coverage ... it must be shown that the [cause of] Cosentino [\u2019s] . . . slip and fall emanated . . . from Alfa\u2019s work\u201d (33 AD3d at 133). The dissent further stated that because liability in the underlying Cosentino action must be determined before One Beacon is obligated to defend BE] the court need not reach the issue of the priority of coverage. The Appellate Division granted leave to appeal to this Court and certified the following question: \u201cWas the order of this Court, which modified the order of the Supreme Court, properly made?\u201d We answer the certified question in the negative, modify the order of the Appellate Division and reinstate the order of Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Addressing first whether BP is entitled to be defended by One Beacon, it is well settled that an insurer\u2019s \u201cduty to defend [its insured] is \u2018exceedingly broad\u2019 and an insurer will be called upon to provide a defense whenever the allegations of the complaint \u2018suggest ... a reasonable possibility of coverage\u2019 \u201d <em>(Automobile Ins. Co. of Hartford v Cook, </em>7 NY3d 131, 137 [2006] [citation omitted]). \u201cThe duty to defend [an] insured[ ] ... is derived from the allegations of the complaint and the terms of the policy. If [a] complaint contains any facts or allegations which bring the claim even potentially within the protection purchased, the insurer is obligated to defend\u201d <em>(Technicon Elecs. Corp. v American Home Assur. Co., 74 </em>NY2d 66, 73 [1989]).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">A duty to defend is triggered by the allegations contained in the underlying complaint. The inquiry is whether the allegations fall within the risk of loss undertaken by the insured \u201c[and, it is immaterial] that the complaint against the insured asserts additional claims which fall outside the policy\u2019s general coverage or within its exclusory provisions\u201d <em>(Town of Massena v Healthcare Underwriters Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 NY2d 435, 444 [2002] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). \u201cThe merits of the complaint are irrelevant and, [a]n insured\u2019s right to be accorded legal representation is a contractual right and consideration upon which [a person\u2019s] premium is in part predicated, and this right exists even if debatable theories are alleged in the pleading against the insured\u201d <em>(id. </em>[internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). An \u201cinsured\u2019s right to representation and the insurer\u2019s correlative duty to defend suits, however groundless, false or fraudulent, are in a sense \u2018litigation insurance\u2019 expressly provided by the insurance contract\u201d <em>(Servidone Constr. Corp. v Security Ins. Co. of Hartford, </em>64 NY2d 419, 423-424 [1985]). Furthermore, \u201can insurer may be required to defend under the contract even though it may not be required to pay once the litigation has run its course\u201d <em>(Automobile Ins. Co., </em>7 NY3d at 137).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">It is undisputed that Alfa agreed in the purchase order to name BP as an \u201cadditional insured\u201d in Alfa\u2019s CGL policy and that Alfa also agreed to indemnify and pay BP\u2019s attorneys fees for any personal injury tort claim arising from Alfa\u2019s work. One Beacon urges us to adopt a different standard that requires a determination of liability before an additional named insured is entitled to a defense. Quite to the contrary, we have held that an \u201c[a]dditional insured is a recognized term in insurance contracts, . . . [and that] the well-understood meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>term is an entity enjoying the same protection as the named insured\u201d <em>(Pecker Iron Works of N.Y. v Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co., </em>99 NY2d 391, 393 [2003] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). As such, the dissenting Justices\u2019 and One Beacon\u2019s reliance on the Appellate Division\u2019s decision in <em>AIU Ins. Co., </em>which held that liability must be determined before an additional insured is entitled to a defense, is misplaced. Thus, the standard for determining whether an additional named insured is entitled to a defense is the same standard that is used to determine if a named insured is entitled to a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">One Beacon argues that the portion of the additional insured endorsement that states that BP \u201cis an additional insured only with respect to liability arising out of [Alfa\u2019s] ongoing operations performed for that insured,\u201d requires a determination of liability for Cosentino\u2019s injuries before BP is entitled to a defense. However, when considering this policy language in light of an insurer\u2019s broad obligation to defend an insured, it does not affect the standard under which a duty to defend is determined. When the duty to defend is at issue, a liability alleged to arise out of Alfa\u2019s ongoing operations is one \u201carising out of\u2019 such operations within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Here, Cosentino, in his amended complaint, alleged, among other things, that Alfa, BP\u2019s subcontractor, was engaged in construction work at the work site where he was injured, that Alfa breached its duty to keep the work site safe and that Alfa\u2019s breach caused his injuries. These allegations form a \u201cfactual [and] legal basis on which [One Beacon] might eventually be held to be obligated to indemnify [BP] under any provision of the insurance policy\u201d and certainly bring this claim within the ambit of the protection purchased <em>{Servidone Constr. Corp. </em>at 424). Since there is a possibility that Cosentino\u2019s injuries \u201car[ose] out of [Alfa\u2019s] ongoing operations performed for [BP],\u201d One Beacon\u2019s obligation to provide BP with a defense is triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Moreover, nothing in the policy or the purchase order requires the application of a different standard for determining under what circumstances BP is entitled to a defense. To the contrary, the purchase order\u2019s indemnification/hold-harmless clause indicates that BP sought broad protection against any liability that may be attributable to Alfa\u2019s activities as insured by One Beacon. The language of the purchase order and the policy evinces BP\u2019s reasonable expectation to the defense that it now seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>We have previously held that \u201cthe reasonable expectation and purpose of the ordinary business [person] when making an ordinary business contract\u201d will be considered in construing a contract <em>(Album Realty Corp. v American Home Assur. Co., </em>80 NY2d 1008, 1010 [1992]). BP\u2019s reasonable expectation, when it forwarded the purchase order to Alfa that required Alfa to name BP as an additional insured, was that it wanted protection from lawsuits arising out of Alfa\u2019s work \u2014 litigation insurance. Denying BP a defense in the underlying matter would rewrite the policy without regard to BP\u2019s reasonable expectations as expressed in the purchase order, and provide a windfall for One Beacon. Therefore, the lower courts correctly determined that One Beacon is obligated to provide BP a defense in the underlying Cosentino action, regardless of the merits of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Turning to the issue of the priority of coverage, we conclude that the Appellate Division erred in finding that One Beacon\u2019s coverage is primary and BP\u2019s coverage under its own policy is excess. In order to determine the priority of coverage among different policies, a court must review and consider all of the relevant policies at issue <em>(see State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v LiMauro, </em>65 NY2d 369 [1985]). Here, Supreme Court correctly concluded that because none of the other insurance carriers are parties to this declaratory judgment action and no other relevant policies have been submitted, the priority of coverage cannot be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by reinstating the order of Supreme Court and, as so modified, the order should be affirmed, and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-9\">.
