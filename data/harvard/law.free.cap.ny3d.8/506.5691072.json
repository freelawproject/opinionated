Muriel Siebert &amp; Co., Inc.\u2019s proposed change in the law to permit disqualification of counsel based on a mere \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d or \u201crisk\u201d of disclosure is unworkably vague and subjective and would unduly deter attorneys from conducting ex parte employee interviews. <em>(Develop Don\u2019t Destroy Brooklyn v Empire State Dev.

Limiting the no-contact rule in New York to present employees appropriately balances the need to protect the integrity of the attorney-client relationship from adversarial interference with the need to preserve informal discovery procedures. <em>(Niesig v Team I, </em>76 NY2d 363.) II. <em>Niesig v Team I </em>(76 NY2d 363 [1990]) properly balances protecting the attorney-client privilege and preserving access to vital information by permitting a lawyer to interview certain employees of adversary corporations and former employees. III. This Court\u2019s holding in <em>Niesig v Team I </em>(76 NY2d 363 [1990]) should not be modified because other provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility protect against the invasion of the attorney-client privilege in interviews with former employees. IV The lower court\u2019s use of an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d standard undercuts recent New York case law and runs counter to the emerging national trend of eliminating the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d standard from professional responsibility codes. <em>(Matter of Stephanie X., </em>6 AD3d 778; <em>People v Herr, </em>86 NY2d 638; <em>International Elecs.

Although the parties were initially successful in that endeavor, their relationship became strained when Siebert asserted that Intuit had failed to promote the Internet brokerage service to its customers. In September 2003, Siebert commenced an action against Intuit for, among other things, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty in failing to promote Siebert\u2019s business interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Nicholas Dermigny, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for Siebert, was both an important participant in the events at issue in the Intuit lawsuit and a member of Siebert\u2019s \u201clitigation team\u201d after the lawsuit began. He participated in the negotiations of the Siebert-Intuit agreement and discussions with Intuit relating to its implementation. He also assisted in drafting the complaint and responses to interrogatories, was privy to discussions concerning Siebert\u2019s litigation strategy, and engaged in privileged and confidential communications with Siebert\u2019s counsel. In May 2005, Dermigny took a leave of absence to negotiate the terms of his impending separation and eventual termination from Siebert. Counsel for Siebert sought to continue representation of Dermigny at his scheduled deposition, but Dermigny refused. Siebert\u2019s counsel informed an attorney for Intuit that Siebert could not produce Dermigny for the deposition because it no longer had control over him. Therefore, Intuit subpoenaed Dermigny for a deposition rescheduled for September 26, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Dermigny was terminated by Siebert on September 6, 2005. Upon learning of Dermigny\u2019s termination, Intuit\u2019s attorneys contacted him without Siebert\u2019s knowledge and arranged for an interview. Before commencing the interview, Intuit\u2019s attorneys advised Dermigny that he should not disclose any privileged or confidential information, including any conversations with Siebert\u2019s counsel, or offer any information concerning Siebert\u2019s legal strategy. Dermigny was further cautioned that if, during the interview, he was asked a question that could potentially lead to the disclosure of such information, he should so advise Intuit\u2019s attorneys and decline to answer the question. Intuit\u2019s attorneys then questioned Dermigny about the underlying facts of the case, but did not elicit any privileged information nor inquire about Siebert\u2019s litigation strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Days later, Siebert\u2019s counsel, upon learning of the interview, moved to disqualify Intuit\u2019s attorneys from the case, enjoin them from using any information provided by Dermigny, and stay Dermigny\u2019s deposition. Supreme Court granted Siebert\u2019s motion, disqualified Intuit\u2019s attorneys from the case, ordered the destruction of all notes from their interview with Dermigny, enjoined them from communicating the information they learned during the interview to others, and struck the notice of deposition for Dermigny until such time as Intuit obtained new representation. Supreme Court specifically noted that it was not basing its disqualification determination on DR 7-104 (a) (1) of the Code of Professional Responsibility (22 NYCRR 1200.35 [a] [1]),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> acknowledging that the rule did not apply because Dermigny was not a Siebert employee at the time of the interview. Rather, Supreme Court held that the disqualification of Intuit\u2019s attorneys was warranted, regardless of whether they actually received privileged information, because there was an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d based upon the possibility that privileged information had been disclosed during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The Appellate Division reversed, holding that disqualification was not justified because Intuit\u2019s attorneys had advised Dermig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ny not to disclose privileged information and, based on the record, no such information had been disclosed (32 AD3d 284, 286 [1st Dept 2006]). In so holding, the Appellate Division noted that this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Niesig v Team I </em>(76 NY2d 363 [1990]) \u201cmakes it clear that ex parte interviews of an adversary\u2019s former employee are neither unethical nor legally prohibited\u201d (32 AD3d at 285). Pursuant to CPLR 5713, the Appellate Division granted Siebert\u2019s application for leave to appeal to this Court and certified the following question: \u201cWas the order of this Court, which reversed the order of Supreme Court, properly made?\u201d We now affirm and answer the certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In <em>Niesig, </em>we held that DR 7-104 (a) (1) applies only to certain current employees of a party <em>(see Niesig, </em>76 NY2d at 369). We made clear that ex parte communications with nonmanagerial employees are permitted, but adversary counsel are prohibited from directly communicating with employees who have the power to bind the corporation in litigation, are charged with carrying out the advice of the corporation\u2019s attorney, or are considered organizational members possessing a stake in the representation <em>(see id. </em>at 374, citing Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics \u00a7 11.6, at 613 [Practitioner\u2019s ed 1986]). By so holding, we struck a balance between protecting represented parties from making imprudent disclosures, and allowing opposing counsel the opportunity to unearth relevant facts through informal discovery devices, like ex parte interviews, that have the potential to streamline discovery and foster the prompt resolution of claims <em>(see Niesig, </em>76 NY2d at 370, 372).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The policy reasons articulated in <em>Niesig </em>concerning the importance of informal discovery underlie our holding here that, so long as measures are taken to steer clear of privileged or confidential information, adversary counsel may conduct ex parte interviews of an opposing party\u2019s former employee. Indeed, there is no disciplinary rule prohibiting such conduct. At the time of the interview, Dermigny no longer had the authority to bind Siebert in the litigation, was no longer charged with carrying out the advice of Siebert\u2019s counsel, and did not have a stake in the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">We conclude that disqualification of Intuit\u2019s attorneys is not warranted merely because Dermigny was at one time privy to Siebert\u2019s privileged and confidential information. That does not mean, however, that the right to conduct ex parte interviews is a license for adversary counsel to elicit privileged or confidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>information from an opponent\u2019s former employee. Counsel must still conform to all applicable ethical standards when conducting such interviews <em>(see e.g. </em>Code of Professional Responsibility DR 1-102 [a] [5] [22 NYCRR 1200.3 (a) (5)]; <em>Niesig, 76 </em>NY2d at 376; <em>see also Merrill v City of New York, </em>2005 WL 2923520, *1, 2005 US Dist LEXIS 26693, *3-4 [SD NY, Nov. 4, 2005] [adversary counsel prohibited from asking former employee about privileged communications]; <em>Wright v Stern, </em>2003 WL 23095571, *1, 2003 US Dist LEXIS 23335, *3 [SD NY, Dec. 30, 2003] [adversary counsel must refrain from seeking to elicit attorney-client communications from an opponent\u2019s former employee]; ABA Comm on Ethics and Prof Responsibility Formal Op 91-359 [1991] [adversary counsel may interview former employees of an opponent but must disclose their role in the matter and whom they represent, and must not induce former employees to disclose privileged communications]).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In this case, Intuit\u2019s attorneys properly advised Dermigny of their representation and interest in the litigation, and directed Dermigny to avoid disclosing privileged or confidential information. They also directed Dermigny not to answer any questions that would lead to the disclosure of such information. Dermigny stated that he understood the admonitions and, on this record, no such information was disclosed. Thus, there is no basis for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\"> DR 7-104 (a) (1) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">\u201c(a) During the course of the representation of a client a lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">\u201c(1) Communicate or cause another to communicate on the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented by a lawyer in that matter unless the lawyer has the prior consent of the lawyer representing such other party or is authorized by law to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
