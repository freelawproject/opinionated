II. Reversal of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision would undermine the purpose of the Section 8 voucher program.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b838-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b838-6\">Pigott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">We hold that a landlord\u2019s determination to accept federal \u201cSection 8\u201d rent subsidy payments is a \u201cterm and condition\u201d of a lease executed with a rent-stabilized tenant, within the meaning of Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) \u00a7 2522.5 (g) (1), so that a renewal lease must continue with that term and condition. Moreover, 42 USC \u00a7 1437f (d) (1) (B) (ii) does not preempt a rent-stabilized tenant\u2019s right to a renewal lease that includes the landlord\u2019s acceptance of a Section 8 subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Respondent Sonia Rosario has lived in a rent-stabilized apartment in New York City, owned by appellant Diagonal Realty, LLC, for over 30 years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For most of that time, she has received Section 8 benefits from the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA). The Section 8 system (Tenant Based Assistance: Housing Choice Voucher Program) is a federal program that provides housing assistance to eligible low-income families by giving subsidies to landlords who rent apartments to them <em>{see </em>42 USC \u00a7 1437f). Once NYCHA has issued a Section 8 voucher to an eligible family, and the family has found a landlord willing to accept it, the landlord and NYCHA must sign a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contract <em>{see </em>24 CFR 982.451). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>HAP contract specifies the terms of the landlord\u2019s participation in the Section 8 program. Section 8 tenants make rental payments based on their ability to pay, and NYCHA issues subsidy payments to the landlords to cover the balance of the agreed rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">In February 2003, Diagonal informed NYCHA that it no longer wished to participate in the Section 8 program with respect to Rosario, and refused NYCHA\u2019s subsidy payments for her apartment. It then commenced a proceeding in the Civil Court of the City of New York to evict Rosario for nonpayment of rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Rosario and several other similarly situated plaintiffs commenced these actions against their respective landlords in Supreme Court, seeking a declaration that defendant landlords may not opt out of the Section 8 program. Supreme Court consolidated the actions and granted summary judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, declaring that defendants \u201care obligated to continue accepting [plaintiffs\u2019] section 8 rent subsidies and are not permitted to opt out of the federal section 8 rent subsidy program\u201d (9 Misc 3d 681, 704 [2005]).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The Appellate Division affirmed, and then granted Diagonal\u2019s motion for leave to appeal to this Court. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">New York State\u2019s Rent Stabilization Code requires that landlords provide renewal leases requested by rent-stabilized tenants (9 NYCRR 2522.5 [b] [1]), and that every renewal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-8\">\u201cshall be on <em>the same terms and conditions as the expired lease, </em>except where the owner can demonstrate that the change is necessary in order to comply with a specific requirement of law or regulation applicable to the building or to leases for housing accommodations subject to the RSL, or with the approval of the DHCR\u201d (9 NYCRR 2522.5 [g] [1] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Diagonal does not claim that any of the exceptions apply, and the first question before us therefore is whether a landlord\u2019s prior acceptance of a Section 8 subsidy is a term of a lease that must be continued on a renewal lease. We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">Landlords who accept Section 8 payments are required to include, in the leases that they sign with Section 8 beneficiaries, a \u201ctenancy addendum\u201d prescribed by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) <em>{see </em>24 CFR 982.305 [a] [3]; 982.308 [b] [2]) or, if the landlord uses its own lease form, a \u201cword-for-word\u201d addition of the addendum\u2019s text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>(24 CFR 982.308 [f] [2]). The tenancy addendum must specify, among other things, that \u201c[t]he owner is leasing the contract unit to the tenant for occupancy by the tenant\u2019s family with assistance for a tenancy under the Section 8 housing choice voucher program\u201d and that \u201c[t]he tenant is not responsible for paying the portion of rent to [the] owner covered by the . . . housing assistance payment.\u201d By requiring such a tenancy addendum, the code makes acceptance of Section 8 subsidies a term of every lease that a landlord signs with a Section 8 tenant. Consequently, the obligation to accept Section 8 subsidy payments must continue in a renewal lease, as required by Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) \u00a7 2522.5 (g) (1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Diagonal suggests that this section of the Rent Stabilization Code is inapplicable because, when Rosario first signed a lease, she was not a Section 8 beneficiaiy. But 9 NYCRR 2522.5 (g) (1) makes no mention of a tenant\u2019s initial lease. It requires that a renewal lease \u201cbe on the same terms and conditions as the expired lease\u201d \u2014 not necessarily the original lease. \u201cExpired lease\u201d means the lease that will have just expired when the renewal lease is to become effective.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Diagonal further argues that the Rent Stabilization Code protections are preempted by federal law, citing 42 USC \u00a7 1437f. Section 1437f restricts the ability of landlords receiving Section 8 subsidies to evict tenants. It provides that \u201cduring the term of the lease, the owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease, for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or for other good cause\u201d (42 USC \u00a7. 1437f [d] [1] [B] [ii]). The phrase \u201cduring the term of the lease\u201d was added on October 21, 1998 (effective permanently) (Pub L 105-276, 112 US Stat 2461, 2607).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Before that date, landlords participating in the Section 8 program could not evict a tenant without establishing good cause, even if the tenant was at the end of a lease term; this was commonly referred to as the \u201cendless lease rule.\u201d Diagonal contends that the 1998 amendment allows landlords receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Section 8 subsidies to terminate a tenancy without cause when the lease term is over, and that it preempts New York law requiring landlords to renew \u2014 with the same terms and conditions\u2014 rent-stabilized tenants\u2019 leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">In deciding whether state law is preempted by federal law, the Court\u2019s \u201csole task is to ascertain the intent of Congress\u201d <em>(California Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v Guerra, </em>479 US 272, 280 [1987]; <em>see also Guice v Charles Schwab &amp; Co., </em>89 NY2d 31, 39 [1996]).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">\u201cCongressional preemptive intent may be discerned in three ways: (1) expressly in the language of the Federal statute; (2) implicitly, when the Federal legislation is so comprehensive in scope that it is inferable that Congress intended to fully occupy the \u2018field\u2019 of its subject matter; or (3) implicitly, when State law actually \u2018conflicts\u2019 with Federal law\u201d <em>(Drattel v Toyota Motor Corp., </em>92 NY2d 35, 42 [1998]; <em>see also Guice, </em>89 NY2d at 39; <em>Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N. A. v Nelson, </em>517 US 25, 31 [1996]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Diagonal\u2019s preemption theory is belied by the legislative history, which shows that no preemption was intended. Indeed, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs could not have made the point more clearly when it reported that it did \u201cnot anticipate that the repeal of [the \u2018endless lease\u2019 rule] will adversely affect assisted households because <em>protections will be continued under State, tribal, and local tenant laws </em>as well as Federal protections under the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act\u201d (S Rep 195, 104th Cong, 1st Sess, at 32; S Rep 21, 105th Cong, 1st Sess, at 36 [identical language in both Senate Reports] [emphasis added]). The intent of Congress was to \u201cstreamline and simplify the [Section 8] program by reducing the involvement of the Federal government\u201d and housing agencies (S Rep 195 at 31-32; S Rep 21 at 36). In other words, the legislative intent was to remove <em>federal </em>obstacles to landlords\u2019 participation in the Section 8 program.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">HUD, moreover, introduced regulatory language clarifying that \u201c[n]othing in part 982 [the federal regulations governing the Section 8 program] is intended to pre-empt operation of State and local laws that prohibit discrimination against a Section 8 voucher-holder because of status as a Section 8 voucher-holder\u201d (24 CFR 982.53 [d]). This language was added in direct response to the 1998 amendments <em>(see </em>64 Fed Reg 26632, 26641 [1999]). Thus, no intent to preempt state law is expressed in 42 USC \u00a7 1437f; in fact, the contrary is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>Turning to the question of implied preemption, it is clear that federal law does not so occupy the field of housing law that there is no room for state regulation. To the contrary, the states \u201chave broad power to regulate housing conditions in general and the landlord-tenant relationship in particular\u201d <em>(Loretto v Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 US 419, 440 [1982]). In this area, federal and state law depend on each other; neither excludes the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Finally, there is no conflict between federal and state law such as would suggest implied preemption. First, it is not impossible to comply with both federal and state law in this area; a law-abiding landlord receiving Section 8 subsidies will follow both 42 USC \u00a7 1437f (tenants in general will not be evicted without good cause during their leases) and Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) \u00a7 2522.5 (g) (1) (rent-stabilized tenants\u2019 leases will be renewed with the same terms and conditions). Second, Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) \u00a7 2522.5 (g) (1) is no obstacle to accomplishing and executing the purpose of 42 USC \u00a7 1437f. The state regulation applies only to landlords of rent-stabilized property. The effectiveness of 42 USC \u00a7 1437f \u2014 as amended in 1998 \u2014 in encouraging <em>free-market </em>landlords to participate in the Section 8 program is unaffected by the state regulation. We conclude that it was not the intent of Congress, when it ended the so-called endless lease rule, to remove state and local law protections afforded to Section 8 recipients.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be affirmed, with costs.

That section contains an antidiscrimination provision prohibiting landlords that receive J-51 abatements from discriminating against tenants who receive, or are eligible to receive, Section 8 assistance (see Administrative Code \u00a7 11-243 [k]).
