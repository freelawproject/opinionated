One month later, he moved to discharge assigned counsel alleging a conflict of interest and \u201cdif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ference in strategy.\u201d In a written decision and order, dated March 10, 2004, County Court denied that motion because defendant had not articulated the conflict, and defendant\u2019s allegations about the attorney\u2019s strategy were conclusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">On April 13, 2004, defendant once again appeared with his assigned counsel for a pretrial hearing and advised the court that he wanted to proceed pro se because assigned counsel had \u201cdone nothing\u201d for him and had failed to make certain motions. County Court denied that application as well because it was \u201cnot convinced\u201d that defendant would be able to represent himself. In response to that ruling, defendant expressed his distrust of assigned counsel, stating \u201c[y]ou can\u2019t allow a man who is going to sell me out to represent me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Two days later, defendant once again moved in writing for reassignment of counsel or, in the alternative, the opportunity to proceed pro se, citing assigned counsel\u2019s \u201cincompetence\u201d and purported retaliatory conduct against defendant for requesting new counsel. On April 28, 2004, the prosecutor informed the court that assigned counsel did indeed have a conflict and County Court appointed another attorney to represent defendant. However, this time defendant objected to the appointment asserting that the new attorney had represented an individual who had previously testified against defendant in an unrelated matter. County Court therefore assigned a third attorney to represent defendant. Defendant did not object to that appointment nor did he reassert his desire to proceed pro se. Rather, defendant simply asked if his third assigned counsel would be present at the next calendar call.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and acquitted of the remaining counts. Defendant was adjudicated a second felony offender and sentenced to indeterminate terms of imprisonment of 9 to 18 years on each count, with both sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Defendant appealed his conviction, asserting that County Court deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to represent himself. The Appellate Division held that County Court improperly denied defendant\u2019s timely and unequivocal request to proceed pro se, but nevertheless affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction because defendant, by proceeding to trial with his third assigned counsel and not expressing a further desire to proceed pro se, abandoned his request to represent himself. We now af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>firm defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that defendant\u2019s request to represent himself was not clear and unequivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We have long recognized that a defendant \u201cmay insist on foregoing the benefits associated with the right to counsel and proceeding on a <em>pro se </em>basis,\u201d but have also cautioned that waiver of the \u201cfundamental right to counsel requires that a trial court must be satisfied that a defendant\u2019s waiver is unequivocal, voluntary and intelligent\u201d <em>(People v Smith, </em>92 NY2d 516, 520 [1998]). \u201cRegardless of his lack of expertise and the rashness of his choice,\u201d a defendant may \u201cchoose to waive counsel if he [does] so knowingly and voluntarily\u201d <em>(People v Vivenzio, </em>62 NY2d 775, 776 [1984], citing <em>Faretta v California, </em>422 US 806 [1975]).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">A defendant\u2019s request to represent himself \u201cmust be invoked clearly and unequivocally\u201d <em>(People v LaValle, </em>3 NY3d 88, 106 [2004], citing <em>Faretta, </em>422 US 806 [1975]). In order to ensure that convicted defendants do not \u201cpervert the system by subsequently claiming a denial of their <em>pro se </em>right, the <em>pro se </em>request must be clearly and unconditionally presented to the trial court\u201d <em>(People v McIntyre, </em>36 NY2d 10, 17 [1974]).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">While defendant\u2019s conditioning of his request for new counsel with a request for self-representation did not necessarily render the latter request equivocal, here defendant raised the argument for self-representation as a way of obtaining the dismissal of his first assigned counsel. Moreover, defendant\u2019s initial requests to proceed pro se were made in the alternative; he sought to represent himself only because County Court refused to replace the first assigned counsel who had displeased him. After County Court appointed a second attorney, defendant did not ask to proceed pro se, but merely objected to the appointment because of a perceived conflict of interest. Thus, defendant\u2019s objections to his first two assigned counsel were made not because defendant wanted to proceed pro se, but because he was dissatisfied with them. When County Court announced the appointment of a third attorney, defendant simply asked if his third assigned counsel would be present at the next calendar call. Even if it could be argued that defendant did not equivocate at the outset of the proceedings, any error was cured when the court assigned defendant\u2019s third counsel. Defendant voiced no dissatisfaction with that appointment, and remained silent thereafter. Upon the appointment of his third assigned counsel, \u201c[t]he issue of self-representation was closed,\u201d with defendant seemingly satisfied with that appointment <em>(LaValle, </em>3 NY3d at 107).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining argument and find that it has not been preserved for review. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b167-5\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"At2\">(concurring). I am unable to join the majority opinion, because I see no equivocation in defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se. It is true that his request was made in the alternative; he wanted to act as his own lawyer only if his request for a new lawyer was denied, as it was. But a request made in the alternative can still be unequivocal. Indeed, many if not most defendants who choose to represent themselves probably do so because they are displeased with the counsel the court appointed, and would be happy to proceed with a lawyer if they could get one who satisfied them. That does not mean that they cannot exercise their right under <em>Faretta v California </em>(422 US 806 [1975]) to be pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Thus I conclude that the trial court erred when it refused defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se. I would vote to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction, but for the fact that, after his request was denied, a conflict of interest led to the replacement of his lawyer by a new one \u2014 the result he had preferred all along. This fortuitous event effectively cured the trial court\u2019s error in denying defendant\u2019s <em>Faretta </em>request. If, having obtained the remedy he originally preferred, defendant still wanted to represent himself, he should have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur with Judge Pigott; Judge Smith concurs in result in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
