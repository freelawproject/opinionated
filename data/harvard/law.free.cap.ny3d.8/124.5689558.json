The People claimed, and the jury found, that defendant had physically attacked his girlfriend, Debbie Dixon, at a time when two orders of protection directing him to stay away from Dixon were in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">The People\u2019s only witness at trial was Officer Steven May-field. Mayfield testified that, in response to a 911 call, he ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>rived, at the door of an apartment and was met there by Dixon, who was visibly shaken, had blood on her face and clothing, was bleeding profusely from one hand, and walked with a noticeable limp. Mayfield testified: \u201cI asked her what happened, and she stated her boyfriend threw her through a glass door.\u201d Mayfield entered the apartment, found defendant there, and observed a glass door with several panes broken out of it and glass on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Because Dixon was unavailable at trial, the trial court allowed her statement, as recounted by Mayfield, into evidence as an \u201cexcited utterance.\u201d Defendant appealed from his conviction, contending that the statement was admitted in violation of his Confrontation Clause rights. The Appellate Division affirmed, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of every defendant in a criminal case \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d Article I, section 6 of the New York Constitution also gives a right of confrontation, in virtually identical language. Our interpretation of the federal Confrontation Clause is controlled by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Crawford v Washington </em>(541 US 36 [2004]) and <em>Davis v Washington </em>(547 US \u2014, 126 S Ct 2266 [2006]). Defendant here relies on both the federal and state Confrontation Clauses, but does not suggest that the two be interpreted differently, and we therefore accept the holdings of <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>as the basis for our decision under both constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">It is clear from <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>that the admission of a statement made out of court does not violate a defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights unless the out-of-court statement is \u201ctestimonial\u201d <em>(see Davis, </em>547 US at \u2014, 126 S Ct at 2273). The Confrontation Clause, the Court said in <em>Crawford, </em>\u201capplies to \u2018witnesses\u2019 against the accused \u2014 in other words, those who \u2018bear testimony\u2019 \u201d (541 US at 51 [citation omitted]). In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that a \u201cformal statement to government officers\u201d would qualify as testimonial, while a \u201ccasual remark to an acquaintance\u201d would not, but did not adopt a definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d <em>(id.). Crawford </em>involved a witness\u2019s \u201crecorded statement,\u201d given at a police station after <em>Miranda </em>warnings, \u201cin response to structured police questioning\u201d; the Court found that statement would qualify as testimonial \u201cunder any conceivable definition\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 53 n 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>Davis </em>and its companion case, <em>Hammon v Indiana, </em>presented closer questions, and required the Court to define \u201ctestimonial\u201d with more precision. <em>Davis </em>involved statements made during a 911 call by a victim of domestic violence who, in response to questions from the 911 operator, described an assault upon her as it was happening. <em>Hammon </em>involved a statement by the defendant\u2019s wife taken after officers had come to the couple\u2019s home; finding the situation calm when they arrived, the officers took the wife into a separate room, kept her husband away from her, and got a detailed account of what her husband had done. The Supreme Court held that the statements in <em>Davis </em>were not testimonial, but that those in <em>Hammon </em>were. The Court explained its holdings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">\u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d (547 US at \u2014, 126 S Ct at 2273-2274.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The facts of this case are between those in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon-. </em>Dixon was neither describing a present event as it occurred, nor responding to detailed questioning in a calm, secure setting. But under the test the Supreme Court stated in <em>Davis, </em>Dixon\u2019s statement was clearly not testimonial. It was \u201cmade in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation [was] to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d (547 US at \u2014, 126 S Ct at 2273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">When Mayfield, responding to a 911 call, arrived at Dixon\u2019s door and was met by an emotionally upset woman smeared with blood, his first concern could only be for her safety. His immediate task was to find out what had caused the injuries so that he could decide what, if any, action was necessary to prevent further harm. Asking Dixon \u201cwhat happened\u201d was a normal and appropriate way to begin that task, and the officer promptly entered the apartment, as an officer dealing with an emergency would be expected to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Defendant emphasizes that Mayfield\u2019s question to Dixon was in the past tense: He said \u201cwhat happened?\u201d not \u201cwhat\u2019s hap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>pening?\u201d From this, and from the fact that no attacker was in sight at the moment, defendant would have us infer, in the words of <em>Davis, </em>that \u201cthere [was] no . . . ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation [was] to establish or prove past events . . . We do not find the inference a likely one. The officer\u2019s purpose in questioning Dixon is shown more persuasively by the facts that came to his attention \u2014 a 911 call, a distressed and injured woman \u2014 and by the action he took after Dixon answered his question \u2014 entering the apartment, without lingering to find out more detail \u2014 than by his choice of tense. Any responsible officer in Mayfield\u2019s situation would seek to assure Dixon\u2019s safety first, and investigate the crime second. Because Dixon\u2019s statement was made when the officer could reasonably have assumed, and apparently did assume, that he had an emergency to deal with, her statement was not testimonial under <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
