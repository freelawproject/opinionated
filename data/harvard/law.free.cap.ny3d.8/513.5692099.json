The issue before us is whether the grievances are arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">In December 2003, County officials determined that it was necessary to lay off employees for reasons of economy. The County, however, perceived a conflict between section 14.05 of the CBA and Civil Service Law \u00a7 80 concerning reductions in force of competitive class civil service positions. Section 14.05 of the CBA provides, in part, that \u201c[a]ll layoffs shall be pursuant\u201d to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">\u201c(a) For layoff purposes, an employee\u2019s <em>seniority shall determine the order to be followed. </em>In a department, the employee with the least seniority shall be the first to be laid off until the total number of employees required to decrease forces shall be reached. When all displacement possibilities are exhausted within the department, the employee shall have <em>the right to displace in other </em>departments\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Civil Service Law \u00a7 80 (1), entitled \u201cSuspension or demotion,\u201d in turn, dictates how a public employer must reduce competitive class civil service positions. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-12\"><em>\u201cWhere, because of economy, consolidation or abolition of functions, curtailment of activities or otherwise, positions in the competitive class are abolished </em>or reduced in rank or salary grade, <em>suspension or demotion, </em>as the case may be, <em>among incumbents holding the same or similar positions shall be made </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number><em>in the inverse order of original appointment </em>on a permanent basis in the classified service in the service of the governmental jurisdiction in which such abolition or reduction of positions occurs\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Further, section 80 (4) provides, in part that: \u201cUpon the abolition or reduction of positions in the service of a civil division, suspension or demotion shall be made from among employees holding the same or similar positions <em>in the entire department or agency within which such abolition or reduction of positions oc</em>curs\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Accordingly, the County solicited advice from the Department of Civil Service concerning its view of the conflict between the statute and the CBA \u2014 specifically, that the CBA required that layoffs be made solely on the basis of seniority, irrespective of position or title, whereas section 80 mandates that layoffs be made by seniority within a position. In response, the Department advised the County that a collective bargaining agreement \u201cmay not alter the layoff units prescribed by section 80 (4).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">After sharing the Department\u2019s opinion with CSEA, the County proceeded to lay off approximately 30 employees, which CSEA grieved. CSEA alleged, among other things, that the County violated section 14.05 of the CBA by refusing to (1) lay off \u201cthe employees with the least seniority within a department until the total number of employees required to decrease forces in that Department was reached\u201d and (2) allow \u201cemployees to displace employees in other departments after they exhausted displacement rights in their own departments.\u201d The County objected to the arbitrability of these issues. After an unfavorable determination at a Step Three grievance hearing, CSEA served upon the County a notice of intent to arbitrate. The County then commenced this CPLR article 75 proceeding seeking a permanent stay of arbitration as to all issues. CSEA opposed the petition and cross-moved to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The County asserted \u2014 and presses here \u2014 two issues that it deems repugnant to public policy as embodied in Civil Service Law \u00a7 80. It argues that CBA \u00a7 14.05 violates public policy because, whereas section 80 (1) allows for layoffs by seniority within a job title or position, the CBA mandates that layoffs occur only by seniority. According to the County, the CBA inescapably forces it \u201cto lay off every other less senior employee in the layoff unit (and eliminate essential positions) before it could ever eliminate the non-essential position.\u201d The County also as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>serts that another clause of the same CBA provision violates Civil Service Law \u00a7 80 (4) by permitting interdepartmental displacements, or \u201cbumping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Supreme Court granted, in part, the County\u2019s petition to stay arbitration and denied, in part, CSEA\u2019s cross motion. The court agreed with the County that a conflict existed between Civil Service Law \u00a7 80 (4) and CBA \u00a7 14.05. Relying on <em>Matter of City of Plattsburgh (Local 788 &amp; N.Y. Council 66, Am. Fedn. of State, County &amp; Mun. Empls., </em>AFL-CIO) (108 AD2d 1045 [3d Dept 1985]), the court held that such a conflict was for a court, not an arbitrator, to resolve. Accordingly, it granted the County\u2019s petition, in part, and stayed arbitration to the extent that CSEA\u2019s demands concerned claims or rights on behalf of employees who were in \u201cthe Competitive Classification under the Civil Service Law.\u201d The court, however, concluded that because section 80 (4) did not apply to noncompetitive or labor class employees, arbitration was permissible as to them and granted CSEA\u2019s cross motion to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">On an appeal to the Appellate Division from so much of the order as stayed arbitration, that court unanimously reversed and granted CSEA\u2019s cross motion to compel arbitration in its entirety (26 AD3d 843 [2006]). Acknowledging the conflict between the parties\u2019 contract and the Civil Service Law, the court nonetheless held that such a conflict was \u201cmerely theoretical\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 844). The court concluded that the entire dispute was arbitrable because the statute did not contain \u201c \u2018clear exclusionary language\u2019 \u201d that precluded arbitration <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>Matter of Alden Cent. School Dist. v Watson, </em>56 AD2d 713, 714 [4th Dept 1977]). We disagree and now modify the Appellate Division\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\"> The Taylor Law empowers and, in fact, requires a public employer to bargain with employee organizations and to enter written agreements governing the terms and conditions of employment <em>(see </em>Civil Service Law \u00a7 204 [1], [2]; <em>see also Matter of Professional, Clerical, Tech. Empls. Assn. [Buffalo Bd. of Educ.], </em>90 NY2d 364, 372 [1997]). An employer has wide latitude to negotiate such terms and can agree to submit disputes to arbitration subject, however, to \u201cthe absence of \u2018plain and clear\u2019 prohibitions in statute or controlling decision[al] law, or restrictive public policy\u201d <em>(Matter of Board of Educ. of Yonkers City School Dist. v Yonkers Fedn. of Teachers, </em>40 NY2d 268, 273 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>[1976] [citations omitted]). Thus, although the Taylor Law reflects this State\u2019s \u201cstrong\u201d policy favoring arbitration, this principle is not without limits <em>(Matter of Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. of City of N.Y., Inc. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>6 NY3d 563, 575 [2006]; <em>see Matter of New York City Dept. of Sanitation v MacDonald, </em>87 NY2d 650, 656 [1996]; <em>Matter of Union Free School Dist. No. 2 of Town of Cheektowaga v Nyquist, </em>38 NY2d 137, 143 [1975]).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The threshold determination of whether a dispute is arbitrable is well settled. Proceeding with a two-part test, we first ask whether the parties may arbitrate the dispute by inquiring if \u201cthere is any statutory, constitutional or public policy prohibition against arbitration of the grievance\u201d <em>(Matter of City of Johnstown [Johnstown Police Benevolent Assn.], </em>99 NY2d 273, 278 [2002]). If no prohibition exists, we then ask whether the parties in fact agreed to arbitrate the particular dispute by examining their collective bargaining agreement. If there is a prohibition, our inquiry ends and an arbitrator cannot act <em>(see Matter of United Fedn. of Teachers, Local 2, AFT, AFL-CIO v Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of N.Y., </em>1 NY3d 72, 80 [2003]; <em>Matter of Blackburne [Governor\u2019s Off. of Empl. Relations], </em>87 NY2d 660, 665 [1996]).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">A dispute is, thus, nonarbitrable, if a court can conclude \u201c \u2018without engaging in any extended factfinding or legal analysis\u2019 \u201d that a law \u201c \u2018prohibits], in an absolute sense, [the] particular matters [to be] decided\u2019 \u201d by arbitration <em>(Matter of New York City Tr. Auth. v Transport Workers Union of Am., Local 100, AFL-CIO, </em>99 NY2d 1, 8-9 [2002], quoting <em>Matter of Sprinzen [Nomberg], </em>46 NY2d 623, 631 [1979]; <em>see Matter of United Fedn. of Teachers, </em>1 NY3d at 80). Put differently, a court must stay arbitration where it can conclude, upon examining the parties\u2019 contract and the implicated statute on their face, \u201cthat the granting of <em>any </em>relief would violate public policy\u201d <em>(Matter of City of New York v Uniformed Fire Officers Assn., Local 854, IAFF, AFL-CIO, </em>95 NY2d 273, 284 [2000]; see <em>Matter of Blackburne, </em>87 NY2d at 665; <em>Matter of Committee of Interns &amp; Residents [Dinkins], </em>86 NY2d 478, 484 [1995]; <em>Matter of Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of N.Y. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>75 NY2d 660, 668 [1990]; <em>Matter of Sprinzen [Nomberg], </em>46 NY2d at 631; <em>cf. Matter of Port Washington Union Free School Dist. v Port Washington Teachers Assn., </em>45 NY2d 411, 418 [1978]).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Addressing CSEA\u2019s first grievance regarding layoffs, the County asserts that section 14.05 of the CBA impermissibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>modifies an essential public policy embodied in Civil Service Law \u00a7 80. The County argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\">\u201c[s]ection 80 <em>first </em>requires municipalities to decide which titles are essential and <em>then </em>protects the senior employees in such titles. The CBA provision, however, represents an impermissible intrusion on this statutory scheme, by protecting specific persons, rather than necessary positions, regardless of the municipality\u2019s operational needs or the community\u2019s service needs\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 16).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In <em>Honeoye Falls-Lima Cent. School Dist. v Honeoye Falls-Lima Educ. Assn. </em>(49 NY2d 732 [1980]), we addressed a similar conflict. In that case, at issue was a job security provision in the parties\u2019 contract that required layoffs of those employees with the least seniority in the school district. Education Law \u00a7 2510 (2), however, directed that \u201cthe services of the teacher having the least seniority in the system <em>within the tenure of the position abolished </em>shall be discontinued\u201d (emphasis added). We concluded that the statutory imperative of section 2510 (2) was \u201cto maintain teaching proficiency which would otherwise be denigrated if, for example, the abolition\" of three vocational training positions required the dismissal of three teachers of romance languages, or vice versa, simply because they happened to have been the last three persons employed\u201d <em>(Honeoye Falls-Lima, </em>49 NY2d at 733). The school board, we held, could not surrender through collective bargaining \u201ca responsibility vested in the board\u201d \u2014 namely, the maintenance of adequate classroom standards <em>(id. </em>at 734).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Our holding in <em>Matter of Civil Serv. Empls. Assn., Westchester Ch., Local 860 v Town of Harrison </em>(48 NY2d 66 [1979]) is also instructive. In that case, the town \u2014 for reasons of economy and efficiency \u2014 abolished an engineering position and terminated the employee who occupied that position. Simultaneously, the town consolidated the duties left vacant by the abolition within a similar, remaining position. The union sought arbitration under a CBA provision that required it to be notified when a new job title or opening was created, and to offer that position to a senior qualified employee. We held, however, that Civil Service Law \u00a7 22 expressly dictated a procedure for creating new positions. Under section 22, the ultimate decision whether to create a new position rested with the town, subject to approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>and certification by the municipal civil service commission and was, thus, \u201c \u2018beyond the power of the parties to alter or modify . . . by collective bargaining, agreement to arbitrate or otherwise\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 74, quoting <em>Nyquist, </em>38 NY2d at 144).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">At oral argument here, CSEA conceded \u2014 as it must \u2014 that under the CBA, the County would retain no power to decide which positions to eliminate. Contrary to CSEA\u2019s contention, however, the County could not cede the statutory imperative to render such decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">As in <em>Honeoye Falls-Lima, </em>\u201cinescapably implicit\u201d from a plain reading of section 80 (1) is that a public employer has a nondelegable discretion to determine \u2014 for reasons of economy, among others \u2014 what its staffing and budgetary needs are in order to effectively deliver uninterrupted services to the public <em>(Matter of Cohoes City School Dist. v Cohoes Teachers Assn., </em>40 NY2d 774, 778 [1976]; <em>see Board of Educ., Great Neck Union Free School Dist. v Areman, </em>41 NY2d 527, 532-533 [1977]). We reiterate the obvious: in the absence of bad faith, fraud or collusion, the discretion identified here \u201cis an undisputed management prerogative\u201d for the public\u2019s benefit, and cannot be altered or modified by agreement or otherwise <em>(Matter of Saur v Director of Creedmoor Psychiatric Ctr., </em>41 NY2d 1023, 1024 [1977]; <em>see Matter of Piekielniak v Axelrod, </em>92 AD2d 968, 969 [3d Dept 1983], <em>lv denied </em>59 NY2d 603 [1983]). Once such an informed decision is made, section 80 (1) obligates the employer to respect the seniority rights of its employees. Succinctly put, under the CBA, seniority controls the abolition of positions; under the statute, seniority controls <em>only after </em>the employer decides which positions will be affected. This conflict is plainly irreconcilable.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Turning to CSEA\u2019s grievance regarding displacement rights, the County argues that under Civil Service Law \u00a7 80 (4), employees can only displace less senior employees within the affected department, and that section 80 (4) does not permit interdepartmental bumping. The nonarbitrability of this issue, however, is less clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Civil Service Law \u00a7 80 (4) provides that \u201c[u]pon the abolition or reduction of positions . . . , suspension or demotion shall be made from among employees holding the same or similar positions in the entire department or agency within which such abolition or reduction of positions occurs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">No explicit language in section 80 (4) can be read to prohibit, in an absolute sense, a public employer from agreeing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>permit employees to \u201cbump\u201d less senior employees in another department or division within the same layoff unit. Nor can we find any implicit public policy reason that precludes such an agreement (see <em>Matter of Saur, </em>41 NY2d at 1024). To be sure, CSEA\u2019s claim to interdepartmental displacement rights may be viable only to the extent that the second department or agency comes within the same layoff unit as the originating department or agency (see Civil Service Law \u00a7 80 [6]). In such a case, it is true that an arbitral award that would permit interdepartmental bumping into a <em>different </em>layoff unit would run afoul of the Civil Service Law. However, such an award is not inevitable. Thus, it is sufficient that an arbitrator, fashioning an award under the CBA, could comply with the statute (see <em>Matter of Commitee of Interns &amp; Residents, </em>86 NY2d at 484; <em>New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>75 NY2d at 668; <em>Matter of Port Washington Union Free School Dist., </em>45 NY2d at 417).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"> In sum, because public policy precludes arbitration of CSEA\u2019s primary grievance as to the layoff of certain employees, the County\u2019s petition to stay arbitration is granted, in part. However, because no clear public policy precludes arbitration of CSEA\u2019s secondary grievance concerning displacement rights, CSEA\u2019s cross motion to compel arbitration is granted to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, in accordance with this Opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read and Smith concur; Judge Pigott taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
