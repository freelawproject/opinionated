The trial court and Appellate Division erred in adopting a replacement cost approach to value; the law and public policy mandate a \u201cbright-line\u201d rule utilizing the reproduction cost method in valuing utility property for tax assessment purposes. Accordingly, the matter should be remanded for a new hearing based solely on the reproduction cost method. <em>(Matter of Allied Corp. v Town of Camillus, </em>80 NY2d 351; <em>Matter of Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v State Bd. of Equalization &amp; </em>Assessment, 65 NY2d 472; <em>Matter of Long Is.

The Appellate Division erred in ignoring clear and consistent precedent as to the relevant test in determining whether a deduction for functional obsolescence for excess construction was warranted \u2014 technological inefficiencies and/or design changes are not enough. <em>(Matter of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v City of Dunkirk Assessor, </em>221 AD2d 912; <em>Barber &amp; Bennett v State of New York, </em>34 AD2d 303; <em>Matter of City of New York [Ruppert Brewery Urban Renewal Project], </em>67 Misc 2d 863; <em>Universal Empire Indus, v State of New York, </em>149 Misc 2d 773; <em>Congregation of Sons of Israel v State of New York, </em>54 AD2d 794.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>Podell, Schwartz, Schechter &amp; Banfield, LLP, </em>New York City <em>(Gary Schuller </em>and <em>William E.

Both experts agreed that a properly prepared RCNLD appraisal considers all forms of depreciation including functional obsolescence due to excess construction costs. The City\u2019s directive to David Moody not to consider this form of obsolescence based on its misreading of <em>Matter of Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v State Bd. of Equalization &amp; Assessment </em>(65 NY2d 472 [1985]) destroyed the credibility of his appraisal. On this record, the lower courts\u2019 factual determination to include this component of depreciation when valuing the property was not erroneous and should be affirmed. <em>(Matter of Allied Corp. v Town of Camillus, </em>80 NY2d 351; <em>Matter of County of Suffolk [C.

II. Specialty property is valued using the Reproduction-Cost-New-Less-Depreciation Method because New York State law requires assessments of real property to be based upon the property\u2019s current use and condition. <em>(Matter of Kalski v Fitzgerald, </em>25 AD2d 573; <em>Matter of Addis Co. v Srogi, </em>79 AD2d 856, 53 NY2d 603; <em>Matter of Estate of Goldman v Commissioner of Fin., </em>203 AD2d 20, 83 NY2d 759; <em>Matter of BCA-White Plains Lanes v Glaser, </em>91 AD2d 633; <em>Matter of Adirondack Mtn.

Functional obsolescence, when caused by competing with a less expensive, more efficient technology, is determined by capitalizing the excess costs of operating the existing facility. <em>(Universal Empire Indus. v State of New York, </em>149 Misc 2d 773; <em>Barber &amp; Bennett v State of New York, </em>34 AD2d 303; <em>Norman\u2019s Kill Farm Dairy Co. v State of New York, </em>53 Misc 2d 578; <em>Matter of Long Is.

On the particular record before us, we agree with the trial court and Appellate Division that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Petitioner Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison) brought this tax certiorari proceeding pursuant to RPTL article 7 challenging the City of New York\u2019s assessments on its Arthur Kill electric generating station for the tax years 1994/1995 through 1998/1999. The generating station is comprised of two steam generating units (installed in 1959 and 1969) and one gas turbine (installed in 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">At a bench trial, the parties agreed that, as an electrical generating facility, the subject property is considered a \u201cspecialty\u201d and should therefore be appraised using the Reproduction-Cost-New-Less-Depreciation (RCNLD) method of valuation. This method seeks to determine the value of a property by estimating the cost to construct a replica using the same materials and techniques as the subject facility (reproduction cost), less depreciation. The parties differed, however, as to whether functional obsolescence due to excess construction costs could be subtracted from the reproduction cost as a component of depreciation. Functional obsolescence due to excess construction costs is the difference between the property\u2019s reproduction cost and the cost of replacing the existing property with a facility of similar productive capacity using modern materials and technology (replacement cost).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Con Edison\u2019s expert included the value of functional obsolescence due to excess construction costs, lowering the appraisal for tax assessment purposes. Although the City\u2019s expert did not include this factor in his appraisal, which was significantly higher, he conceded on cross-examination that in conducting a reproduction cost valuation, appraisers typically consider functional obsolescence due to excess construction costs. Indeed, the only reason he did not do so in this instance was counsel\u2019s instruction that under New York law it would be improper. In his view, an appraisal that allowed for functional obsolescence due to excess construction costs would still be considered a proper reproduction cost appraisal under industry standards, even if it yielded a result consistent with replacement cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Supreme Court adopted Con Edison\u2019s calculation and a divided Appellate Division affirmed. The City appeals as of right based on the two-Justice dissent. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The valuation of assessed property is, of course, essentially a question of fact, the courts\u2019 principal task being to discern the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>most accurate estimation of value for the specific property before it. Thus, where, as here, \u201cthe determinations of value made at nisi prius have been affirmed at the Appellate Division, those valuations must be upheld unless there has been an error of law in the use of an erroneous theory of valuation or unless the record does not contain evidence to support them\u201d <em>(Matter of B. Altman &amp; Co. v City of White Plains, </em>57 NY2d 904, 905-906 [1982]).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The City argues that the trial court and Appellate Division erred as a matter of law by accepting Con Edison\u2019s use of functional obsolescence due to excess construction costs in calculating depreciation. According to the City, no such measure should be included under the RCNLD method because, in doing so, the appraiser effectively substitutes the established reproduction cost method \u2014 which looks to the value of the current property on the taxable status day \u2014 with a replacement cost method focused on the value of a hypothetical future facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">While recognizing that the RCNLD method should be utilized for valuing speciality property, we have not previously considered whether functional obsolescence due to excess construction costs can be included under that method <em>(see e.g. Matter of Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v State Bd. of Equalization &amp; Assessment, </em>65 NY2d 472, 485 [1985]; <em>Matter of Allied Corp. v Town of Camillus, </em>80 NY2d 351, 356-360 [1992]). In the context of this case, however, we conclude that the City\u2019s arguments are misplaced. We cannot hold that the theory of valuation adopted by the courts below was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The City\u2019s expert witness agreed that functional obsolescence due to excess construction costs is in fact a proper element of depreciation under the reproduction cost methodology, even in cases where it yields a valuation consistent with replacement cost. Moreover, Con Edison\u2019s appraisal methodology finds support in the relevant appraisal literature <em>(see </em>Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate ch 14 [\u201cThe Cost Approach\u201d], ch 16 [\u201cDepreciation Estimates\u201d] [12th ed 2001]). Indeed, we have previously noted that one problem often identified with RCNLD valuation is \u201cits tendency to ascribe too little weight to such factors as . . . functional obsolescence\u201d <em>(Town of Camillus, </em>80 NY2d at 357). Thus, allowing for increased consideration of functional obsolescence may, in the appropriate case, further the purpose of valuation proceedings \u2014 to arrive at a fair and realistic appraisal of the value of the property at issue <em>(see Matter of Saratoga Harness Racing v Williams, </em>91 NY2d 639, 643 [1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>That being said, we do not adopt a rule that functional obsolescence due to excess construction costs is an appropriate consideration in every tax assessment matter where RCNLD is the applicable method. To the contrary, valuation remains largely a question of fact, and the courts have considerable discretion in reviewing the relevant evidence as to the specific property before them. Here, we find no legal error in that review.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
