Our task is to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>whether the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders erred when it concluded that petitioner\u2019s conviction in a foreign jurisdiction required him to register under New York\u2019s Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA). We conclude that petitioner\u2019s federal conviction warranted registration under SORA.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Federal agents executed a search warrant at petitioner\u2019s home on February 6, 2002, seizing his computer. Examination of the computer revealed that petitioner had knowingly purchased a subscription to an Internet site that was tailored to appeal to individuals with a sexual interest in children. Petitioner acknowledged to federal authorities that, over a period of four or five months, he downloaded and viewed numerous images depicting children ages 7 to 17 years engaged in sexual acts. In November 2004, petitioner pleaded guilty in United States District Court for the Western District of New York to a possession of child pornography offense (18 USC \u00a7 2252A [a] [5] [B]) and was sentenced to five years probation with 24 days of electronic monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">At the state level, the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders, proceeding in accordance with Correction Law \u00a7 168-k, concluded that petitioner was required to register under SORA. The Board found that petitioner had been convicted of a sex offense as defined in Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d), which addresses when a person convicted in a foreign jurisdiction (such as federal court) must register in New York. After the Board rejected his request for reconsideration, petitioner commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the registration determination. Although petitioner acknowledged that SORA had been amended in 2002 to explicitly cover certain federal convictions (including his child pornography offense) in Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d), he argued that the 2002 amendments did not apply to him. Petitioner claimed that he fell within a \u201cloophole\u201d created in the legislation\u2019s complex effective date provision because he committed his offense before the effective date of the new amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In response, the Board contended that, independent of the 2002 amendments, petitioner was required to register because his federal offense contained the same \u201cessential elements\u201d as the New York crime of possession of a sexual performance by a child, a registrable offense. The Board further asserted that the 2002 amendments specifically listing petitioner\u2019s federal offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>embraced petitioner because he was convicted in 2004 \u2014 two years after the legislation was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Supreme Court denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding, concluding that registration was required under SORA\u2019s \u201cessential elements\u201d provision, which predated the 2002 amendments (see Correction Law \u00a7 168-a [2] [d] [i]). That provision mandates registration for a person convicted in a foreign jurisdiction of a crime containing the \u201cessential elements\u201d of a New York offense that is subject to registration. The court noted that the federal child pornography offense and New York\u2019s most closely analogous offense (possession of a sexual performance by a child) were not identical because the federal offense criminalizes possession of pornographic images of children under age 18 while the New York offense covers pornographic images of children under 16 years of age. But finding it undisputed that petitioner possessed pornographic images of children under age 16, the court held that petitioner engaged in conduct addressed by the New York offense, thereby meeting the \u201cessential elements\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The Appellate Division agreed that petitioner was required to register under SORA but rejected Supreme Court\u2019s rationale. The Court analogized the SORA \u201cessential elements\u201d analysis to the comparison undertaken when a court assesses whether a defendant\u2019s criminal sentence should be enhanced as a result of a prior foreign conviction, and reasoned that the \u201cessential elements\u201d standard is not met unless the elements of the federal offense are virtually identical to the elements of the registrable state offense to which it is compared. Given the distinctions between the victim age provisions in the federal and New York offenses, the Court determined that standard was not met. However, noting that the 2002 amendments had been intended to clarify that individuals convicted of the federal offenses in question were required to register under SORA, the Court concluded that the 2002 amendments applied to petitioner and he must register under Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d) (iii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court granted petitioner leave to appeal and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Since the inception of SORA in 19.95, a person convicted of a felony in another jurisdiction, including conviction of a federal crime, has been subject to registration in New York if the foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>offense \u201cincludes all of the essential elements\u201d of one of the New York offenses listed in SORA <em>(see </em>L 1995, ch 192, \u00a7 2). In 1999, the Legislature added another basis for registration arising from a foreign conviction \u2014 an offender must register in New York if that person committed a felony subject to registration in the foreign jurisdiction <em>(see </em>L 1999, ch 453, \u00a7 1). SORA was again amended in 2002 to clarify that particular federal offenses are subject to New York\u2019s registration requirement and the amendments removed the requirement that the foreign offense be a felony (subject to a potential death sentence or prison sentence of more than one year) <em>(see </em>L 2002, ch 11, \u00a7 1). In addition, the foreign conviction provision was reorganized into three subsections. As a result of this legislative expansion, the definition of a registrable \u201csex offense\u201d now includes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-5\">\u201ca conviction of (i) an offense in any other jurisdiction which includes all of the essential elements of any such crime provided for in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subdivision or (ii) a felony in any other jurisdiction for which the offender is required to register as a sex offender in the jurisdiction in which the conviction occurred or, (iii) any of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 2251, 18 U.S.C. 2251A, 18 U.S.C. 2252, 18 U.S.C. 2252A, or 18 U.S.C. 2260, provided that the elements of such crime of conviction are substantially the same as those which are a part of such offense as of the date on which this subparagraph takes effect\u201d (Correction Law \u00a7 168-a [2] [d]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">In <em>People v Kennedy </em>(7 NY3d 87 [2006]), we addressed whether a member of the United States Navy who was convicted by general court-martial of \u201cindecent assault\u201d under the Uniform Code of Military Justice was required to register under Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d) (ii). We concluded that registration was not warranted under subsection (ii) because the People failed to establish that the foreign jurisdiction where the defendant was convicted \u2014 the Navy \u2014 maintains a sex offender registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Here, the Board relies on two different subsections of the statute \u2014 subsections (i) and (iii). Subsection (i) directs that a person convicted of an offense in a foreign jurisdiction is required to register in New York when the foreign offense contains \u201call of the essential elements\u201d of a New York offense that is subject to registration. Although the essential elements provision has been part of SORA since its enactment in 1995, this is our first occasion to interpret it.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The Board argues that petitioner\u2019s federal possession of child pornography offense is comparable to the New York offense of possessing a sexual performance by a child (Penal Law \u00a7 263.16), a class E felony subject to registration under Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (a) (i). Petitioner\u2019s federal felony offense, codified at 18 USC \u00a7 2252A (a) (5) (B), makes it unlawful for any person to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-5\">\u201cknowingly possess [ ] any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, or any other material that contains an image of child pornography that has been mailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, or that was produced using materials that have been mailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The term \u201cchild pornography\u201d includes any \u201ccomputer or computer-generated image or picture\u201d involving \u201cthe use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\u201d (18 USC \u00a7 2256 [8] [A]) and the term \u201c \u2018minor\u2019 means any person under the age of eighteen years\u201d (18 USC \u00a7 2256 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Under Penal Law \u00a7 263.16, \u201c[a] person is guilty of possessing a sexual performance by a child when, knowing the character and content thereof, he knowingly has in his possession or control any performance which includes sexual conduct by a child less than sixteen years of age.\u201d The term \u201cperformance\u201d includes any motion picture or photograph (Penal Law \u00a7 263.00 [4]). Petitioner does not dispute that, like the federal crime, the New York offense criminalizes possession of computer images of children engaged in sexually explicit activity \u2014 the conduct underlying his federal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">In asserting that the New York crime is not sufficiently similar to the federal offense to meet SORA\u2019s \u201cessential elements\u201d inquiry, petitioner focuses on the maximum victim age designations in the two offenses. While the federal offense criminalizes possession of pornography involving children under the age of 18, the New York provision deals only with possession of pornography involving children under the age of 16. Noting that Penal Law \u00a7 70.04 (1) (b) (i), the second violent felony offender statute, contains the phrase \u201cessential elements,\u201d petitioner suggests that this Court should import the same approach used to determine whether a prior foreign offense is a predicate for purposes of enhanced sentencing in criminal cases. In that context, our Court has applied a strict equivalency stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>dard that examines the elements of the foreign conviction to determine whether the crime corresponds to a New York felony, usually without reference to the facts giving rise to that conviction <em>(see People v Muniz, </em>74 NY2d 464 [1989]; <em>People v Gonzalez, </em>61 NY2d 586 [1984]). Under this standard, technical distinctions between the New York and foreign penal statutes can preclude use of a prior felony as a predicate for enhanced sentencing, even though the actual criminal conduct leading to the foreign conviction would have fallen within the ambit of the New York offense <em>(see e.g. Muniz, </em>74 NY2d 464 [1989]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">We are unpersuaded that the Legislature intended that the SORA \u201cessential elements\u201d inquiry involve the same strict equivalency approach used in the criminal enhanced sentencing context. The enhanced sentencing standard was developed by this Court more than 50 years ago in cases interpreting the second felony offender provision currently codified at Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 (1) (b) (i) \u2014 a provision that long predated the second violent felony offender statute (Penal Law \u00a7 70.04 [1] [b] [i]) and which has never included the \u201cessential elements\u201d language found in SORA <em>(see e.g. People v Olah, </em>300 NY 96 [1949] [interpreting former Penal Law \u00a7 1941, a predecessor of Penal Law \u00a7 70.06]). In the enhanced sentencing cases, we have not used the phrase \u201cessential elements,\u201d much less characterized the relevant inquiry as an \u201cessential elements\u201d test <em>(see e.g. Muniz, </em>74 NY2d 464 [1989]; <em>Gonzalez, </em>61 NY2d 586 [1984]). Obviously, the strict equivalency requirement does not turn on the presence of \u201cessential elements\u201d language. As such, the Legislature\u2019s decision to use that phrase in Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d) does not suggest an intent to incorporate the strict enhanced sentencing test in SORA proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">In addition, the fact that the Legislature used the same phrase when it enacted SORA\u2019s \u201cessential elements\u201d provision in 1995 as it used in Penal Law \u00a7 70.04 (1) (b) (i) in 1978 (L 1978, ch 481, \u00a7 4) would not, without more, compel that the language be interpreted identically <em>(see People v Hernandez, </em>98 NY2d 175 [2002]). Certainly, words or phrases used in the same legislation or statutory scheme are commonly ascribed the same meaning. Here, however, the language on which petitioner relies appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>in distinct legislation enacted in separate statutory schemes that fulfill different functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">As part of the penal system, enhanced sentencing statutes serve to extend the term of incarceration attending a criminal conviction. In contrast, SORA is not a penal statute and the registration requirement is not a criminal sentence <em>(Doe v Pataki, </em>120 F3d 1263 [2d Cir 1997], <em>cert denied </em>522 US 1122 [1998]). Rather than imposing punishment for a past crime, SORA is a remedial statute intended to prevent future crime; its aim is to \u201cprotect! ] communities by notifying them of the presence of individuals who may present a danger and enhancing law enforcement authorities\u2019 ability to fight sex crimes\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1276). While application of a strict equivalency standard is understandable in the enhanced sentencing context where the length of a defendant\u2019s incarceration is to be determined, it may not be the optimal vehicle to effectuate SORA\u2019s remedial purposes. The legislative history of SORA does not disclose any intent by lawmakers to import the test from the Penal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">We are similarly unpersuaded that language in Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d) (iii) compels a strict interpretation of the \u201cessential elements\u201d standard. Subsection (iii) \u2014 added in 2002 \u2014 enumerates specific federal offenses, including petitioner\u2019s child pornography offense, as registrable offenses, \u201cprovided that the elements of such crime of conviction are substantially the same as those which are a part of such offense\u201d as of the effective date of the legislation. Petitioner suggests that, by using the \u201csubstantially the same\u201d language in subsection (iii), the Legislature was signaling that the \u201cessential elements\u201d language already included in subsection (i) must be strictly interpreted. But this linguistic distinction is explained by the fact that the \u201csubstantially the same\u201d language relates to an entirely different inquiry than the \u201cessential elements\u201d test. Under subsection (i) the Board must compare the foreign offense to the analogous New York offense while subsection (iii) requires the Board to review the federal offense to make certain that it is \u201csubstantially the same\u201d in content as it was at the time it was listed in SORA in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">By including this proviso in subsection (iii), the Legislature accounted for the possibility that Congress might amend the enumerated federal statutes in the future and materially redefine those crimes, or renumber the provisions in title 18 of the United States Code so that the statutes listed in subsection (iii) no longer involve sex offenses, rendering the identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>federal offenses inappropriate predicates for SORA registration. If that occurs (and to date it has not), the Board can rely on the \u201csubstantially the same\u201d language in subsection (iii) to relieve a person convicted of one of the specified, but redefined, federal offenses of the duty to register. But the proviso simply does not direct how the Board should interpret or apply the \u201cessential elements\u201d standard in subsection (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Considering its context, we conclude that the \u201cessential elements\u201d provision in SORA requires registration whenever an individual is convicted of criminal conduct in a foreign jurisdiction that, if committed in New York, would have amounted to a registrable New York offense. This necessarily requires that the Board compare the elements of the foreign offense with the analogous New York offense to identify points of overlap. When the Board finds that the two offenses cover the same conduct, the analysis need proceed no further for it will be evident that the foreign conviction is the equivalent of the registrable New York offense for SORA purposes. In circumstances where the offenses overlap but the foreign offense also criminalizes conduct not covered under the New York offense, the Board must review the conduct underlying the foreign conviction to determine if that conduct is, in fact, within the scope of the New York offense. If it is, the foreign conviction is a registrable offense under SORA\u2019s essential elements test.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In this case, comparison of the elements reveals that there is significant overlap between the conduct criminalized in the analogous New York offense and the activity covered by the federal child pornography offense. However, because the federal offense covers some activity \u2014 possession of child pornography involving children aged 16 and 17 \u2014 not encompassed in the New York offense, review of the conduct underlying petitioner\u2019s federal conviction is necessary. Here, it is undisputed that petitioner possessed pornographic images of children under age 16 and therefore engaged in conduct that was criminal under both the federal and comparable New York offenses. As such, the Board did not err in determining that, by virtue of his federal child pornography conviction, petitioner was required to register under the \u201cessential elements\u201d provision in Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">This result is consistent with statements in the legislative history of the 2002 SORA amendments relating to the inclusion of the specified federal offenses. The Governor\u2019s Program Bill Memorandum and the Senate and Assembly sponsors\u2019 memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>randa indicate that the intent in listing the federal child pornography offense was to \u201cclarify\u201d that the offense was subject to registration, which was necessary because some federal offenders had contested the equivalency of the federal and New York offenses <em>(see </em>Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem # 102, 2002 NY Legis Ann, at 6, 8; Senate Mem in Support, 2002 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1646; Aubry Mem in Support of 2002 NY Assembly Bill A10367).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By characterizing the new legislation as a \u201cclarification,\u201d rather than as a change in the law, the Legislature and the Governor indicated that the child pornography offense was already subject to registration under the existing \u201cessential elements\u201d provision. Hence, in their view, the victim age distinctions between the federal and state offenses did not preclude registration under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Because the Board did not err in requiring petitioner to register under Correction Law \u00a7 168-a (2) (d) (i), we need not address petitioner\u2019s claim that, notwithstanding his 2004 conviction of a listed federal offense, he can avoid registration under subsection (iii) because of the effective date provision in the 2002 legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-8\">. In dicta, the Appellate Division observed that registration might also be required under the terms of petitioner\u2019s federal probation. Because this was not a ground on which the Board relied in its determination, we have no occasion to address it in this article 78 proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\">. Our Court has never assessed whether petitioner\u2019s federal child pornography offense would be an appropriate predicate for enhanced sentencing under the strict equivalency standard but, for the purpose of this appeal, we assume that it would not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b832-9\">. This was apparently a reference to litigation prior to the 2002 amendments in which courts had reached contradictory conclusions on the equivalency issue (see <em>Matter of Millan, </em>189 Misc 2d 419 [Sup Ct 2001], <em>revd </em>295 AD2d 267 [1st Dept 2002]; <em>Matter of Nadel, </em>188 Misc 2d 427 [Sup Ct 2001]; <em>Matter of Mandel, </em>184 Misc 2d 897 [County Ct 2000], <em>affd </em>293 AD2d 750 [2d Dept 2002], <em>appeal dismissed </em>98 NY2d 727 [2002]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
