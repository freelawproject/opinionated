Because a schedule award is payment for a permanent partial disability, and does not reflect compensation for a particular period of lost wages, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board may direct that the award be made in a single payment. <em>(Matter of Lynch v Board of Educ. of City of N.

Payment of a Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 schedule award in a single payment is consistent with the other provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law and with public policy. <em>(Matter of Hoffman v Chatham Elec.

We conclude that the statute\u2019s directive that payments be made \u201cperiodically\u201d precludes a policy of lump-sum payment of schedule loss of use awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In November 2002, claimant Marie LaCroix, a Delta baggage handler employed by Syracuse Executive Air Service, slipped and fell on an iced-over ramp while attempting to load a last-minute bag. As a result, she fractured her left wrist and tore her left rotator cuff, and later filed a claim for compensation with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board. In a February 2003 determination, the Board found the injury to be work related, and claimant\u2019s average weekly wage to be $415.83. While her claim was pending, she was awarded permanent partial disability payments for 72 weeks and three days, and temporary total disability payments for 24 weeks at $277.22 per week, amounting to $26,724.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">On October 1, 2004, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board held a hearing on Ms. LaCroix\u2019s claim for a schedule award for permanent partial disability. The parties stipulated to a 75% loss of use of claimant\u2019s left arm. Claimant\u2019s lawyer requested that \u201cthe entire schedule be paid, less, of course, prior payments, all at once rather than spreading it all out in the future as the old decisions used to do.\u201d In an October 8, 2004 decision, the Board determined that Ms. LaCroix\u2019s 75% schedule loss of use entitled her to 234 weeks of benefits at $277.22, or $64,869.48, less payments already made, and directed the employer\u2019s insurance carrier \u201cto pay schedule loss of use award in a lump sum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Upon review, a panel of the Board affirmed the lump-sum payment. It found that, although Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 25 (1) (b) specified biweekly payments, it also provided that \u201cthe board may determine that any payments may be made monthly or at any other period, as it may deem advisable.\u201d Quoting <em>Matter of Miller v North Syracuse Cent. School Dist. </em>(1 AD3d 691, 692 [3d Dept 2003]), the panel explained that \u201c[w]hen an award is based on a finding of permanent disability, the benefit is intended to recompense a claimant for the loss of all of his or her earning capacity on a permanent basis \u2014 i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>without respect to any particular time frame\u201d (Mem of Board Panel Decision of Dec. 28, 2004 [citation omitted]). The panel acknowledged that the assignment of a number of weeks to a specific injury was used to calculate the amount of the compensation award, but pointed out that this number did not otherwise correspond to payment for loss of use, as \u201ceven if no time is lost, [the schedule loss of use] is payable in full.\u201d Thus, it held that \u201cthe Board may direct payments of a schedule loss of use presently, in full, without regard to a set period of calendar weeks,\u201d and that a lump-sum award did not require compliance with the commutation procedures of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 25 (5) (b) as \u201cthere are no allocated future payments that could be subject to a commutation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed. It determined that the contentions of claimant\u2019s employer were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cbased upon two erroneous assumptions \u2014 namely, that a schedule award is allocable to a particular period of disability and, hence, constitutes compensation in lieu of wages, which must, in turn, be paid periodically, and, further, that the foregoing statutory provisions expressly require a schedule award to be paid out over a particular period of time\u201d (25 AD3d 967, 968 [2006]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Dismissing the employer\u2019s arguments as to the Board\u2019s past practice, the Appellate Division concluded that \u201cregardless of whether the Board previously may have treated a schedule award as one to be paid out over time, we are satisfied that the case law, as it subsequently has evolved, coupled with the general powers granted to the Board\u201d supported its decision to make such payments payable in one lump sum <em>(id. </em>at 969). We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Where the interpretation of a statute or its application involves \u201cknowledge and understanding of underlying operational practices or entails an evaluation of factual data and inferences to be drawn therefrom,\u201d we regularly defer to the agency responsible for its administration, unless that determination is irrational or unreasonable <em>(Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 451, 459 [1980]). The issue before us here, however, is primarily one of statutory interpretation for the courts. Indeed, the Board itself notes that its shift in policy rested on the Third Department\u2019s opinion in <em>Miller, </em>signaling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u201clittle basis to rely on any special competence or expertise of the administrative agency\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 459).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Contrary to the Appellate Division, we conclude that the Board\u2019s interpretation contravenes the plain language of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Enacted in 1913 as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, the statute provides compensation for four different types of injury: permanent total disability, temporary total disability, permanent partial disability and temporary partial disability (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 [1], [2], [3], [5]). In the case of permanent total disability, an employee is awarded payment of a percentage of wages during the continuance of the disability; the same is true for temporary total disability and temporary partial disability <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 [1], [2], [5]). Permanent partial disability, however, is called a schedule loss of use award because the statute assigns \u2014 as by a \u201cschedule\u201d \u2014 a fixed number of lost weeks\u2019 compensation according to the bodily member injured <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">While the general purpose of permanent and temporary disability awards pursuant to section 15 (1), (2) and (5) is to \u201ccompensat[e] for disability to work made on the basis of average weekly wages,\u201d a schedule loss of use award is to \u201ccompensate for loss of earning power\u201d <em>(Matter of Marhoffer v Marhoffer, </em>220 NY 543, 546, 547 [1917]). Nevertheless, all compensation awards are intended to provide a \u201climited and certain, not full but uncertain\u201d remedy regardless of the fault of the employer <em>(see id. </em>at 547), and to \u201ccontinue the wage income as nearly uniform as the provisions of the law would permit\u201d after the employee\u2019s injury <em>(Matter of Lauritzen v Terry &amp; Tench Co., </em>193 App Div 809, 810 [3d Dept 1920]).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Section 25 directs the method of payment of such compensation. Prior to 1921, section 25 provided that compensation be paid \u201cperiodically, in accordance with the method of payment of the wages of the employee at the time of his injury or death\u201d <em>(see </em>L 1913, ch 816). In 1921, the Legislature amended this section to require that it be paid \u201cperiodically and <em>promptly in like manner as wages\u201d </em>and on accrual that it be paid \u201cdirectly to the person entitled thereto without waiting for an award\u201d <em>(see </em>L 1921, ch 540, \u00a7 1 [emphasis added]). The additional language was intended to expedite the award process. Whereas injured workers previously were not entitled to <em>any </em>payment of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>award prior to a hearing, regardless of the employee\u2019s undisputed right to compensation, following the amendment most injured workers were receiving compensation within three weeks of injury <em>(see </em>Rep to Legislature of Joint Comm on Labor and Indus, Bill Jacket, L 1922, ch 615, at 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Section 25 (1) (b) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\u201c[t]he first payment of compensation shall become due on the fourteenth day of disability on which date or within four days thereafter all compensation then due shall be paid, and the compensation payable bi-weekly thereafter; but the board may determine that any payments may be made monthly or at <em>any other </em>period, as it may deem advisable\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Section 25 (5) (b) further permits the Board, \u201cwhenever it shall so deem advisable,\u201d to \u201ccommute such periodical payments to one or more lump sum payments to the injured employee . . . provided the same shall be in the interests of justice\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 25 [5] [b]). The purpose of this section was not to \u201cdestroy the general scheme of the statute establishing periodical payments . . . , [r]ather it was ... to provide for particular and exceptional instances\u201d where such a deviation would be desirable (annotation to Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 25, Cons Laws of NY Ann of 1918). Periodic payments commuted pursuant to this section must, however, be reduced to present value <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 25 [5] [b]; \u00a7 27 [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Reading these provisions harmoniously, we conclude that section 25 provides for payment of compensation at the time the injured worker would normally receive his or her wages and continued biweekly payments, unless the Board determines that payments should be made at different intervals, but it does not contemplate a policy of payment as one lump sum. \u201cPeriod\u201d plainly means a <em>division </em>or <em>portion </em>of time. \u201cPeriodic payment\u201d means \u201c[o]ne of a series of payments made over time instead of a one-time payment for the full amount\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1165 [8th ed 2004]). Section 25 explicitly requires periodic payment of compensation, even if such compensation is payable at a period other than biweekly or as wages customarily accrue <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 25 [1] [a], [b]), and we cannot read \u201cat any other period\u201d in Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 25 (1) (b) to include a one-time payment. Although other provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law grant the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>considerable discretion in determining \u201cthe time for the payment of compensation\u201d <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 142 [1]), section 142 is limited by section 25 (1), which explicitly requires periodic payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">As the statute limits commutation of such periodic payments to individual situations in which the Board determines that the interests of justice so require \u2014 and then only upon an actuarial reduction \u2014 the Board was without authority to direct the full-value lump-sum payment ordered here. Neither the general purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law in ensuring uniform continuation of an injured worker\u2019s income flow, nor the specific purpose of the Legislature in amending section 25 to prevent delay in commencement of payments, establishes an intent to permit payment of schedule loss of use awards to fall outside of the statute\u2019s direct prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Other provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, while ancillary to the issue presented here, support our reading of the statute. Section 15 (3) (u), for example, provides that two or more schedule loss of use awards for permanent partial disabilities \u201cshall run consecutively\u201d; section 15 (3) (v) states that an employee may be eligible for additional compensation for impairment of wage earning capacity \u201cafter the termination\u201d of a permanent partial disability schedule award for a 50% or more loss of an arm, leg, hand or foot. Subdivision (4) provides for discontinuation of a schedule loss of use award upon the death of a claimant with no heirs (with the exception of reasonable funeral expenses) if claimant dies from causes unrelated to the compensable injury (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 [4] [d]). The plain language of these provisions contemplates payment of an award over a period of time. Although literal application is possible, these provisions would be substantially compromised in meaning and effect \u2014 payments to run consecutively would simply be made back to back, options available after termination of an award would immediately accrue, and cancellation of benefits upon death would have even more limited application \u2014 were we to read section 25 as the Board did.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Nor are we compelled to interpret section 25 differently based on a sequence of cases that delineate the conceptual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>distinction between schedule loss of use and other compensation awards. In fact, we do not agree with claimant that the case law is at odds with our statutory analysis. In <em>Matter of Lynch v Board of Educ. of City of N Y. </em>(1 AD2d 362 [1956], <em>affd </em>3 NY2d 871 [1957]), the court considered whether section 25 permitted an employer to be reimbursed by its carrier for the full amount of weekly wages paid following injuries that caused claimant\u2019s total disability. It found that the statute permitted reimbursement from the nonschedule award for up to the statutorily prescribed weekly compensation rate, but no more. In distinguishing <em>Matter of Ott v Green-Wood Cemetery </em>(262 NY 532 [1933]), in which we held that a schedule loss of use award would permit such full reimbursement, the <em>Lynch </em>court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">\u201c[i]n the case of a schedule award, the weekly rate and the number of weeks specified in the schedule are simply the measure by which the total amount of the award is to be determined. The payment is not analogous to the payment of weekly compensation for temporary disability. Liability for the schedule award comes into existence on the date of the accident. The payment of the schedule award is not allocable to any particular period of disability\u201d <em>(Matter of Lynch, </em>1 AD2d at 365).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Whereas the nonschedule award was limited to the specified weekly rate, the schedule award, untethered to a period of weekly compensation, was not so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">We considered a similar question in <em>Matter of Landgrebe v County of Westchester </em>(57 NY2d 1 [1982]). Asked to determine whether an employer who had paid full wages to an employee during a period of temporary disability was entitled to full reimbursement out of a later schedule award for a different (though consequential) injury, we held that the employer was entitled only to the amount of the maximum weekly total disability rate. As the award of weekly compensation for the previous nonschedule injury was not comparable to the schedule loss of use award for the subsequent injury, and each injury constituted a \u201cdistinct physical occurrence and impairment\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 11), reimbursement for the former could not be made from the latter. We explained that \u2014 as opposed to a section 15 award for any other type of disability \u2014 a schedule award was \u201cindependent of the time an employee actually loses from work\u201d even though computation of such award required multiplication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the applicable weekly rate by <em>\u201ca </em>statutorily prescribed number of weeks\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">More recently, in <em>Miller, </em>the court considered whether a schedule loss of use award overlapped with a temporary total disability award to violate the statutory maximum. Relying in part on <em>Lynch </em>and <em>Landgrebe, </em>the Appellate Division determined that no violation had occurred, as the losses each award was intended to reimburse were distinct \u2014 one to compensate for earning capacity, the other for temporary loss of wages during a specific period of time \u2014 and the schedule loss of use was not allocable to any particular time frame <em>(Miller, </em>1 AD3d at 693).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The Board bases its decision on <em>Miller. </em>Assuming that <em>Miller </em>is correct, we do not agree that <em>Miller </em>or its predecessors dictate that result.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The conceptual framework for a schedule award as unallocable to a particular period of lost wages is separate and distinct from the award\u2019s method of payment. Neither <em>Lynch, </em>nor <em>Landgrebe, </em>nor <em>Miller </em>addresses the method of payment of a schedule loss of use award, much less overrides a statutory payment mechanism that has been in place for close to a century.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">We recognize that arguments have long been made on both sides of the issue. Some have said that lump-sum payments fail to account for recipients who spend their awards up front and then turn to state resources for support, putting the community \u201cright back where it would have been if there had been no compensation system at all\u201d <em>(see </em>4 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 80.05 [5], at 80-28 [2006]). Others have reasoned that, as a schedule loss equates to a fixed award calculable upon injury, the state should not delay full payment over a period of years, effectively preventing a claimant from choosing how to invest these funds <em>(see </em>Gellhorn and Lauer, <em>Administration of the New York Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law [Part II], </em>37 NYU L Rev 204, 229 [1962]). One thing is clear: any departure from the method of periodic payment of schedule loss of use awards specified in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law must come from the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the case remitted to the Appellate Division, with directions to remand to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Judges Cipabick, Gbaffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">. These provisions apply equally to commutation of a periodic payment to a lump sum pursuant to section 25 (5).

(Roberts) </em>(66 NY2d 516 [1985]), in which we noted that an agency must provide an explanation for its departure from agency precedent adequate for a reviewing court to ascertain whether it has done so for valid reasons.
