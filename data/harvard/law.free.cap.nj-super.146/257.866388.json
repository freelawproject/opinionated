A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A0i\">The trial judge entered a judgment providing that (1) the temporary restraints be dissolved; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Ordinances 855, 856 and 857 \u201care not subject matters of referendum,\u201d and (3) as a matter of law, the City of Elizabeth, through its governing body, is entitled to lay off and demote members and officers of the fire and police departments for reasons of economy without that action being subject to referendum or subject to any other law. The judgment also dismissed the complaint and order to show cause with prejudice. We affirm the judgment essentially for the reasons set forth in the trial judge\u2019s opinion, except as hereafter set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The judge properly refused to exercise jurisdiction to determine the factual issue of whether economy was the reason for the ordinances and the resulting reorganization of the police and fire departments, demotions and layoffs. It correctly held that that issue required exhaustion of administrative remedies involving the expertise of the appropriate administrative body. See <em>Patrolman\u2019s Benevolent Ass\u2019n v. Montclair, </em>70 <em>N. J. </em>130 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We agree with the trial judge that the 1974 amendments to the Public Employment Relations Act (PERA), <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-1 et seq., are inapplicable to the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The city is a civil service municipality. Whether the layoffs and the decrease in the number of members and officers of the fire and police departments or their grades and ranks were actually \u201cnecessary for reasons of economy\u201d <em>(N.J. S. A. </em>40A:14-25; 40A:14-143) is an issue that should be decided by the Civil Service Commission. It involves a plain statutory managerial and nonnegotiable authority of the municipality, not subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Employment Relations 'Commission (PERC), even under the 1974 amendments to PERA. See <em>Union Cty. Regional High School Bd. of Ed. v. Union Cty. Regional High School Teachers Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>145 <em>N. J. Super. </em>435 (App. Div., 1976); <em>North Bergen Township Bd. of Ed. v. North Bergen Fed. Teachers, </em>141 <em>N. J. Super. </em>97 (App. Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>1976); <em>Clifton Teachers v. Clifton Bd. of Ed., </em>136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>336 (App. Div. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The determination of this issue \u2014 whether the municipality has in fact exercised its managerial authority in good faith for reasons of economy \u2014 involves an established function of the Civil Service Commission. That agency\u2019s determinations and orders with respect thereto are enforceable against the municipality. See <em>Prosecutor's Detectives, etc., Ass\u2019n v. Hudson Cty. Bd. of Freeholders, </em>130 <em>N. J. Super. </em>30, 42-43, 48 (App. Div. 1974), certif. den., 66 <em>N. J. </em>330 (1974); <em>N. J. S. A. </em>11:1-1; 11:19-2; 11:19-3; 11:22-10.1. Compare <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40A:14-19 to 22; 40A:14-147 to 150. See also <em>Cunningham v. Civil Service Dep\u2019t., </em>69 <em>N. J. </em>13, 18 (1976); <em>Civil Service Dep\u2019t. v. Newark, </em>131 <em>N. J. Super. </em>275, 277-278 (App. Div. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"> If the action of the municipality were in fact necessary for reasons of economy, such a nonnegotiable issue is not one within the cognizance of PERC merely because it is claimed that it may constitute an unfair practice under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-5.4(a) or that PERC may have jurisdiction to determine the scope of collective negotiations under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-5.4(d). Nor, in view of our determination, may any contention be made that the matter is one for which a grievance procedure has been \u201cestablished by agreement between the public employer and the representative organization\u201d for the resolution of any dispute covered by the agreement, under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-5.3. In any event, no one disputes the conclusion of the trial judge that \u201ccertain contracts of employment now in existence between plaintiffs and defendant * * * provide a clause entitled \u2018Management Responsibility\u2019 which specifically reserve to the City * * * the right to hire, fire and demote.\u201d Additionally, we do not consider the ambiguous amendment to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:13A-8.1, eliminating the prior statutory language that no provision of the act shall \u201cannul or modify any pension statute or statutes of this State,\u201d as a basis for divesting the Civil Service Commission of its traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>and statutory authority over issues of this nature affecting the rights of civil service employees, including policemen and firemen, or for impairing the express legislative power of the municipality to take the measures here involved for reasons of economy, subject to appellate review by that commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We note that some of the members of the Elizabeth Police Superior Officers Association and the Elizabeth Eire Officers Association have filed appeals from their demotions with the Civil Service Commission claiming, among other things, that they were not required for reasons of economy and were not made in good faith. Other members of these associations and members of the other associations affected have not filed such appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Since primary jurisdiction of the dispute as to the alleged economy reasons for the municipal action is with the Civil Service Commission and we are unable on the present record to determine the affected plaintiffs who would have standing to appeal to the Commission with respect thereto, we remand the matter to the trial judge with directions to enter an order, after notice of hearing to all parties, transferring that matter to the Civil Service Commission for appropriate proceedings. The appeals now pending before the Civil Service Commission, together with those transferred by the trial judge, may be consolidated by the Commission. Thereafter a prompt, full hearing with respect to the challenged municipal action may be had before the Commission, followed by a determination of the merits by that agency<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Patrolman\u2019s Benevolent Ass\u2019n v. Montclair, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>supra, </em>70 <em>N. J. </em>at 136; <em>Essex Coun. #1 N. J. Civ. Serv. Ass\u2019n v. Gibson, </em>118 <em>N. J. Super. </em>583 (App. Div. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The judgment as herein modified is affirmed. The stay of the judgment granted by the trial judge is vacated. We do not retain jurisdiction. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The instant case differs from <em>Patrolman\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v. Montclair, supra, and Prosecutor\u2019s Detectives, etc. Ass\u2019n. v. Hudson Cty. Bd. of Freeholders, supra. </em>Both involved clearly negotiable issues relating to the terms and conditions of employment. <em>Montclair </em>was also concerned with a charge of an unfair labor practice as to such issues. See also, <em>Red Bank Bd. of Ed. v. Warrington, </em>138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>564 (App. Div. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\">We have been advised that there is now pending before PERO an unfair labor practice charge filed by the Elizabeth Eire Officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Association on February 5, 1976, alleging that the city failed to negotiate in good faith when it entered into a contract with that association and that the demotions of eight of its members had the effect of interfering with and dominating the employee organization. Additionally, the Elizabeth Police Superior Officers Association, on February 27, 1975, filed an unfair practice charge with PERO, claiming that the city had failed to negotiate in good faith; and at some date, not known to us, the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association filed a charge with PERO involving the city\u2019s claimed refusal to negotiate in good faith. In view of our determination, we do not consider these PERO proceedings to be pertinent to the issues before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
