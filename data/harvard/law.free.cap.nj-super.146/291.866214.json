The award was made on May 1, 1973. In its determination the arbitrators awarded $100,000 for the value of plaintiff\u2019s franchise. Defendant\u2019s objection to this portion of the award was upheld by the trial judge on plaintiff\u2019s application for confirmation of the award, but we reversed in an unreported opinion. Certification was denied by the Supreme Court. 68 <em>N. J. </em>146 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">On May 16, 1975 defendant paid the $100,000 plus interest of $1,643.84, calculated at 6% from the date of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision in February 1975. Plaintiff then moved to compel the payment of interest from the date of the arbitrator\u2019s award. This was denied by the trial judge \u201cin view of the substantial controversy\u201d over the allowance for franchise value in which defendant asserted \u201ca meritorious position,\u201d although that position was rejected on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We conclude that the trial judge erred in denying interest on the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The contract provided for payment by defendant after the exercise of its option to acquire plaintiff\u2019s water company. The amount payable was to be determined by formula in which the arbitrators played their role. When that amount was determined defendant was obligated to pay a sum certain for the withholding of which interest will be awarded from the date that sum became due. <em>Mahoney v. Minsky, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>208, 212 (1963) (a liquidated obligation normally carries conventional interest); <em>Bachman Chocolate Mfg. Co. v. Lehigh Warehouse and Transp. Co., 1 N J. </em>239, 244 (1949) (interest is allowed \u201cwhere the damages are readily ascertainable\u201d by computation using a fixed standard); <em>Harsen v. West Milford Tp. Bd. of Ed., </em>132 <em>N. J. Super. </em>365, 385 (Law Div. 1975) (an arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tion award for a certain sum of money normally carries interest from the time it is due and payable). Interest is payable even if the principal obligation is disputed in good faith. <em>Small v. Schuncke, </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>407, 415-416 (1964), holding that a judgment in favor of the debtor which was later reversed did not toll the running of interest on a liquidated claim from the time it was due. See <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>474 (1974), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">At least in the case of a liquidated sum, prejudgment interest has been regarded by our courts as compensatory \u2014 to indemnify the plaintiff for the loss of what the monies due him would <em>presumably </em>have earned if payment had not been refused. <em>* </em>* * The basic consideration is that the defendant has had the use, and the plaintiff has not, of the amount in question; and the interest factor simply covers the value of the sum awarded for the prejudgment period during which the defendant had the benefit of monies to which the plaintiff is found to have been earlier entitled. See <em>Small v. Schuncke, 42 N. J. </em>407, 416 (1964) ; <em>Busik, supra, </em>63 <em>N. J. </em>at 359, 360. This consideration has controlled, and interest has been imposed even where, as here, the defendant had in good faith contested the validity of the claim. [65 <em>N. J. </em>at 506]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The contract between the parties gave defendant six months from the arbitrators\u2019 determination of fair market value in which to pay the amount of the award. Thus, the full amount became due on November 1, 1973. $100,000 having been withheld from that date until May 16, 1975, when it was paid, interest is allowed at 6% from November 1, 1973 to March 31, 1975 ($8500) and at 8% from April 1, 1975 to May 16, 1975 ($1000). See <em>R. </em>4:42-11 (a). Defendant is entitled to a credit of $1643.84 for interest paid from the date of the prior decision of the Appellate Division. This leaves a balance of $7856.16 payable to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
