Initially, this Court denied plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal. <em>Darling v Inter City Tracking, </em>unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered January 9, 1995 (Docket No. 178752). However, the Supreme Court, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, remanded the case to this Court \u201cfor consideration as on leave granted, limited to the issue whether the employer was entitled to coordinate full pension benefits.\u201d <em>Darling v Inter City Trucking, </em>450 Mich 875 (1995). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Before working for defendant Inter City Trucking, plaintiff worked as a truckdriver for one or more other employers. Plaintiff worked for Inter City Trucking as a truckdriver for seventeen to twenty years. In addition to Inter City Trucking, plaintiff\u2019s prior employers also paid into plaintiff\u2019s pension fund with the Central States Pension Fund, a Teamsters pension fund. Plaintiff now receives a weekly pension benefit of $90.90 from this fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Because plaintiff injured his back during the course of his career, he received weekly payments of $360.59 in worker\u2019s compensation benefits from October 1986 to November 1988. In November 1988, defendants began \u201ccoordinating\u201d plaintiff\u2019s pension benefits with plaintiff\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation benefits. This reduced plaintiff\u2019s weekly worker\u2019s compensation benefit rate to $269.69.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Plaintiff filed a petition with the Bureau of Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation challenging the amount of benefits he received. The magistrate concluded that, because plaintiff\u2019s pension was \u201cmaintained\u201d' by Inter City Trucking, the pension benefits could be coordinated. However, the magistrate also decided that only a pro-rata portion of the pension benefits could be coordinated, based upon the extent that Inter City Trucking paid into the pension fund in comparison with all payments made on plaintiff\u2019s behalf by all employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Plaintiff appealed the magistrate\u2019s decision to the wcac, and defendants cross appealed. The wcac agreed that plaintiff\u2019s pension payments could be coordinated. However, the wcac held that the magistrate erred in prorating the coordination of pension payments. Instead, the WCAC found that the plain language of MCL 418.354(l)(d); MSA 17.237(354)(l)(d) required full coordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Plaintiff argues that the wcac erred in fully coordinating plaintiff\u2019s pension benefits. We disagree. This Court\u2019s review of worker\u2019s compensation cases is limited to questions of law. <em>Matney v Southfield Bowl, </em>218 Mich App 475, 484; 554 NW2d 356 (1996). Findings of fact made or adopted by the wcac are conclusive on appeal, absent fraud, if there is any competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>evidence in the record to support them, but a decision of the wcac is subject to reversal if the wcac operated within the wrong legal framework or its decision was based on erroneous legal reasoning. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Coordination of worker\u2019s compensation benefits with pension or retirement payments is governed by MCL 418.354; MSA 17.237(354), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">(1) . . . Except as otherwise provided in this section, the employer\u2019s obligation to pay or cause to be paid weekly benefits . . . shall be reduced by these amounts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">(d) The after-tax amount of the pension or retirement payments received or being received pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the same employer from whom benefits under section 351, 361, or 835 are received, if the employee did not contribute directly to the pension or retirement plan or program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">This section was added in 1981 to address the perceived problem of a retired worker receiving, \u201credundantly,\u201d both worker\u2019s compensation payments and other payments also funded by the employer. <em>Corbett v Plymouth Twp, </em>453 Mich 522, 531; 556 NW2d 478 (1996). The requirements of \u00a7 354(l)(d) have been found to apply in this case. See <em>Dezwaan v Holland Motor Express, </em>189 Mich App 575, 578-579; 473 NW2d 788 (1991). The only question here is whether the statute provides for full or pro-rata coordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Drouillard v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>449 Mich 293, 302; 536 NW2d 530 (1995). In interpreting a statute, effect must be given, if possible, to every word, sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>and section. <em>Id., </em>p 303. To that end, the entire act must be read to be an harmonious and consistent enactment as a whole. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Here, the statute is clear and unambiguous. The statute states that the employer\u2019s obligation \u201cshall be reduced\u201d by the \u201cafter-tax amount of the pension . . . payments received\u201d by the employee from a pension plan \u201cmaintained by the same employer\u201d who pays the worker\u2019s compensation benefits. MCL 418.354(l)(d); MSA 17.237(354)(l)(d). In contrast to subsections c, e, and f of \u00a7 354(1), subsection d does not mention offsetting a \u201cproportional amount\u201d of benefits received. See MCL 418.354(1); MSA 17.237(354)(1). If the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the plain meaning of the statute reflects the legislative intent and judicial construction is not permitted. <em>Tryc v Michigan Veterans\u2019 Facility, </em>451 Mich 129, 136; 545 NW2d 642 (1996). In any case, full coordination is consistent with the legislative purpose of preventing a retired worker from receiving \u201credundant\u201d payments. <em>Corbett, supra, </em>p 531. Accordingly, the WCAC did not err in holding that the plain language of MCL 418.354(l)(d); MSA 17.237(354)(l)(d) requires full coordination of plaintiff\u2019s pension payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
