WILLARD JOSEPH</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b174-13\">(April <em>16, </em>1957)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b175-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\n<em>Gads by, P. J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A9Q\">This is an action of tort to recover for property damage allegedly due to the negligent operation of a motor vehicle owned and operated by the defendant who struck the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile while it was at a standstill on Broadway at the intersection of Ferry Street, Everett, Massachusetts, on October 29, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The court found for the plaintiff assessing damages in the sum of $1.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The plaintiff filed four requests for rulings of law of which the Court allowed requests numbered 1, 2 and 3 and disallowed ruling on request numbered 4 in view of the finding. Request number 4 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">4. From the extent and nature of the damage sustained can be deduced the approximate speed, and the force of the impact of the striking car to the rear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The Court found the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">\"On all the testimony, defendant was negligent since on his statement his foot slipped off the brake peddle as car was stopped on a slight slope and car rolled ahead slowly three or four feet into rear of plaintiff\u2019s car. I am not satisfied that any appreciable damage resulted to plaintiff\u2019s car assuming the defendant\u2019s story is correct. I am not satisfied that plaintiff\u2019s story is true that his car was pushed fifteen feet by the impact\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">The plaintiff claimed to be aggrieved by the Court\u2019s assessment of damages and by the denial of ruling number 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">There was no error in the denial of request number 4. This request insofar as it may be regarded as a request for ruling of law became immaterial in view of the finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">The plaintiff also contends that the Court erred in assessing damages in the sum of $1.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">As was said in <em>Cerrato v. Miller, 264 </em>Mass. 533, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>535, \u201cThe finding for the plaintiff established that the accident which the property damage sought to be recovered was due solely to the negligence of the defendant; but it did not establish that the witnesses who testified that damage resulted in excess of $i were trustworthy, or that they stated accurately the damage caused by the accident. The verdict for $i is a finding that no greater amount was shown to be due by trustworthy testimony, and may well be a proper verdict, although all the witnesses testified to facts which, if believed, would prove larger damages.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AI0\">Joseph Bosco, for the Plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A_a\">Richard D. Hewes, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">As was said in <em>Murnane v. </em>MacDonald, 294 Mass. 372, 373, \"The verdict for the plaintiff in each case for damages in the amount of $1 was not as matter of law inconsistent with the finding for the plaintiff which such verdict imports. The nature of the accident did not as matter of law require a finding that the damages caused thereby were greater than the damages found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The trial judge was justified in finding that the plaintiff had failed to establish by credible evidence that the damage caused to the plaintiff\u2019s automobile exceeded $1.00 in amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The report contains what is evidently a typographical error, in that, it states the plaintiff reports the case to the Appellate Division. Obviously, a party cannot report a case. The report is the report of the judge. What is meant is that the Court reported the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">There being no prejudicial error, the report is ordered dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
