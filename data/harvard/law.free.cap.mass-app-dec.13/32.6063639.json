Defendant\u2019s answer was general denial, payment, illegality and other defenses not now material.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao3\">Defendant paid only $44.30 before defaulting on remaining payments, whereupon plaintiff repossessed the automobile and sold it for $520. Plaintiff incurred costs of $15 to repossess the automobile and $14.60 for repairs. On cancellation of the insurance, there was a rebate of $70.91.</p>\n<p id=\"Ask\">The conditional sales contract annexed to the report contain the following figures:</p>\n<p id=\"Ax8\">Cash selling price $895</p>\n<p id=\"Arf\">Cash down payment 22$</p>\n<p id=\"pA4L\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"23\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAG4AAAAXAQAAAADCDUdfAAAATklEQVR4nGP8z4AE/jIxoICB4rIgc76eYPj/v/n///+5QRe1lBgYeBj+/2NQgMkK8DD8/98A4zkyxDD+Z3gr4sTM8XctAwcDw1/GAfIgAJQ/F5MiAXRAAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"110\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Afx\">Unpaid balance of cash price O K</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">Total finance charges \\D K</p>\n<p id=\"pAiQ\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"31\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAHIAAAAfAQAAAAATzKRUAAAAV0lEQVR4nGP8z4AMDjIxoIKRxM9gYGBgeODAYP/uat6qJQ0MzP/fH2B4gJBnZmA/wMTAxNAAE2hQYGD4tv79haliU+9u////PwP7AUbk8Lx0T5BxkIUvAPVhG7Vs1IqEAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"113\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4W\">Net balance due $1046</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The plaintiff and the defendant filed the requests for rulings which, with the court\u2019s action, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S REQUESTS FOR RULINGS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">1. On all of the evidence, the plaintiff is entitled to recover for the reasons that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">a. The introduction and admission in evidence of the note declared upon made out a prima facie case for the plaintiff. <em>Allowed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">b. The evidence is insufficient to warrant a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case has been rebutted. <em>Denied. There was sufficient evidence to warrant the rebuttal of plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case in part.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">c. The burden of proof of payment is on the defendants. <em>Allowed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">d. The defendants are entitled to a credit against the note of only such payments as were made, plus the proceeds derived from the sale of the automobile, after deducting the reasonable expense of repossession and sale. <em>Denied. Defendants entitled also to credit of illegal interest and charges as set forth in Chapter </em>140, <em>Section </em>90, <em>as note was attached to Conditional Bill of Sale and made part thereof. The illegal charge of interest and attorney fees were apparent on the face of the instrument.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">2. The evidence is insufficient to warrant a finding that the plaintiff is not a holder in due course of the note declared upon. <em>Allowed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-12\">3. The fact that there was a conditional sales contract attached to the note, does not effect its negotiability. <em>Allowed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-13\">4. The fact that there was a conditional sales contract attached to the note, will not, in and of itself, as a matter of law, preclude the plaintiff from being a holder in due course. <em>Allowed,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-14\">5. If the court should find that the plaintiff was a holder in due course of the note declared upon, then it matters not that the plaintiff paid the payee to the instrument a sum less than the face amount thereof. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>would be entitled to recover the face amount of the note, after crediting the defendants with all payments made and the proceeds derived from the sale of the automobile that was repossessed, after deducting from such proceeds, the reasonable expense of repossession and sale. <em>Denied. Defendants entitled also to credits as per findings request No. </em>1 (d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\"><em>6. </em>In determining the credit to be given to the defendants from the proceeds derived from the sale, following its repossession, the court, as a matter of law, in the instant case, cannot challenge the amount claimed by the plaintiff to have been received by it in the sale of the car; it can only challenge the question of the reasonableness of the charge made by the plaintiff for the expense it incurred in the repossession and sale of the automobile. <em>A Mowed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">7. Should the court find that the charge made for the expense incurred in the repossession and sale of the automobile wTas unreasonable, then such finding cannot, in and of itself, as a matter of law, invalidate the conditional sales contract. <em>Allowed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">8. Should the court find that the charge made for the expense incurred in the repossession and sale of the automobile was unreasonable, then such finding cannot, in and of itself, as a matter of law, invalidate the note declared upon. <em>Allowed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">9. The mere fact that the plaintiff paid only six hundred seventy dollars ($670) for the note, cannot, in and of itself, as a matter of law, effect the plaintiff\u2019s rights as a holder in due course. <em>Allowed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">10.If the plaintiff is a holder in due course of the note declared upon, then the mere fact that the plaintiff paid only six hundred seventy dollars ($670) therefor, will not preclude the plaintiff from recovering the balance due on the note after crediting the defendants with all payments made and the proceeds derived from the sale of the automobile, after deducting the reasonable expense of repossession and sale. <em>Denied. Defendants entitled also to credits as per findings in request No. 1 </em>(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>DEFENDANT\u2019S REQUESTS FOR RULINGS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">1. The loan by the plaintiff to the defendants of $670.00 is governed by Mass. Gen. Laws, Chapter 140, Sec. 90. <em>A \u00a1lowed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">2. The maximum legal rate of interest permissible on the loan from the plaintiff to the defendants is 18% on the balance of the principal amount up to the time of the verdict or finding. <em>Allowed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">3. If the attorney\u2019s fee called for in a loan of less than $1000.00 renders the charges for the loan greater than the 18% rate of interest permitted by law, the attorney\u2019s fee cannot be recovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">4. The finance charges of $376.00 on the $670.00 loan from the plaintiff to the defendant, are above the legal rate of interest permitted by law. <em>Allowed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The court also made the following findings and rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">\"FINDINGS OF FACT AND DAMAGES\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acv\">\"The court finds the following facts and allows the following damages:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-11\">Total due without finance on date of contract 3/9/5j .$670.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8q\">6 months maximum interest on total balance due at 18% under Chap. 140, Sec. 90.

Attorney fees are disallowed as it would bring the total charges over the 18% allowed by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">The plaintiff claims to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s, denial of its requests for rulings No. 1 (b), No. x (d), No. 3 and No. 10 and being further aggrieved by the court\u2019s granting of the defendants\u2019 requests for rulings No. 1, No. 3 and No. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">The sole question at issue is whether the transaction before us comes within G. L. c. 140, \u00a790. Plaintiff contends that it is not a loan subject to the usury laws and therefore that plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum of $443.81. Defendant contends that the transaction is a loan within the meaning of c. 140, \u00a790.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">The pertinent sections of Chapter 140 are \u00a7\u00a790, 93 and 96. \u00a790, so far as material, provide in essence that one who makes a loan under $1000 may not recover interest at a rate exceeding 18% per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">\u00a793 provides that \u00a790 and four subsequent sections, not here material, shall not apply to loans of $300 or less made by a person who holds a license under Section 96 and subsequent sections, not here material.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-14\">\u00a796 provides that no person shall make loans of $300 or less on which interest and expenses exceed 12% per annum without a license from the commissioner of banks. The section goes on to say: \"The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>buying or endorsing of notes or the furnishing of guarantee or security for compensation shall be considered to be engaging in the business of making small loans within said sections, but the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall not apply in the case of any transaction which involves any note or other instrument evidencing the indebtedness of a buyer to the seller of goods, services or insurance for a part or all of the purchase price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Prior to 1941, \u00a796 did not contain the provision excluding from its scope \"any transaction which involves any note or other instrument evidencing the indebtedness of a buyer to the seller of goods, services or insurance for a part or all of the purchase price.\u201d Prior to the amendment, the court in <em>Modern Finance Co. v. Holz, </em>307 Mass. 281 held that \u00a796 applied not only to small loans as such, but to time sales financing, in view of the words: \"The buying or <em>endorsing </em>of notes or the furnishing of guarantee or security for compensation shall be considered to be engaged in the business of making small loans within said sections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Plaintiff endeavors to carry over into \u00a790 the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a796, prior to the amendment. There is no justification for doing that without also carrying over the latter part of the sentence, exempting automobile financing. If that were done, then clearly the transaction before us would be exempted from \u00a790.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u00a790, however, by itself contains no such language as does \u00a796, namely, \"The buying or endorsing of notes, etc.\u201d \u00a796 specifically limits the above language to small loans within \u00a7\u00a796 to 113, which is not the amount involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">It cannot fairly be said that time sales financing is the same thing as a loan particularly the kind of loan which the legislature was attempting to control. The additional language in \u00a796 proves that. If there is any doubt as to the meaning of the statute in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>respect, it should be construed in favor of the person whose legal rights are being thereby restricted, namely plaintiff. \u00a790, however, does not on its face have any ambiguity. If \u00a796 had to be amplified to include time sales financing, as it did, \u00a790 would also have to be amplified for the same purpose.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AXVs\">Shair and Gorfinkle, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AD-\">Solomon Romanow, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">If the transaction before us does not come within \u00a79\u00b0&gt; and we think it does not for the reasons stated, the trial court was in error in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Judgment is to be vacated and judgment entered in favor of plaintiff for $423.79.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
