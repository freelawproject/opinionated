The defendant pleaded <em>non cepit, </em>property in himself, and property in a stranger, following the forms of those pleas in 2 <em>Har. Ent., </em>'247, 300. The plaintiff, in his replication, joined issue upon the first plea, and traversed the two last by averring property in himself, and upon these traverses issues were joined, following in his replication, traverse, and joining of issue, the forms on page 247 of the <em>same book.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\">1st Exception. The plaintiff proved, by <em>Wm. H. Dunkitison, </em>a competent witness, that the negro in dispute was the child of a negro woman, the property of plaintiff\u2019s testator, raised him and held him in his possession until January 1832, when, with other negroes, he was sent by said testator to work on a farm commenced to be worked by testator\u2019s daughter, <em>Mrs. Campbell. </em>That so far as witness knew, said testator exercised acts of ownership over said negro till his death, in 1845. That <em>Mrs. C., </em>for several years prior to her commencing farming, had lived with the testator on the farm where the negro in dispute lived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-9\">The defendant then proved, by <em>M. C. Jones, </em>that in a conversation held with testator, sometime prior to <em>Mrs. C's </em>commencing farming, and while she was living with testator, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>while said negro was upon the farm, and in possession of the testator, he, the testator, told witness that he had given said negro to <em>Mrs. </em>C., his daughter, in place of a negro belonging to his daughter, which he had sold and <em>used the money for. </em>That at the time of this conversation, the testator had called on the witness for the purpose of renting a farm, which the witness had the control of, for <em>Mrs. C., </em>and which was rented to <em>Mrs. C., </em>and shortly after this conversation, said negro went with <em>Mrs. G. </em>on the farm which she had thus rented, and continued in her possession during her widowhood, and since her intermarriage with <em>Thomas II. </em>Miles, have been in his possession to the present time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">The plaintiff then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they find, from the evidence, that the negro in controversy was in the possession of the testator at the time when he made said declaration to said Jones, and had always remained in his possession previous to said conversation, and remained in the testator\u2019s possession after said conversation until <em>Mrs. C. </em>commenced farming, then the legal title to said negro passed to <em>Mrs. C. </em>under the gift mentioned in said conversation. The court (Magruder, C. J.,) refused to give said instruction, because (he whole testimony offered to the jury, in regard to the alleged transfer of said negro by testator to <em>Mrs G., </em>is to be taken in connection with that of <em>Mr. Jones, </em>and weighed by the jury, and the testimony in the cause does not authorise the court to instruct the jury, that there was no valid transfer of said negro to <em>Mrs. G., </em>by the said testator. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">2nd Exception. The plaintiff then offered to prove, by <em>Col. Coombs, </em>that <em>Mi's. C., </em>prior to her going on her farm, called on witness to go her security on a bond, and stated to him that her father, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, would stock the farm for her, with one-third of every thing on his plantation, except negroes, and that he would loan her one-third of his negroes for her life, and at his death, would give her one-half of his negroes, and in that conversation she named no particular negro. The plaintiff' then proved, by <em>W. II. Dunkinson, </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>Matthias, </em>the boy in controversy, was one of the negroes sent by the plaintiff\u2019s testator to <em>Mrs. C\u2019s </em>farm, for the purpose of working said farm. The defendant objected to the admissibility of the testimony of <em>Col. Coombs, </em>and the court sustained the objection, and refused to permit the testimony to go to the jury, being of opinion that the same was too light and inconclusive, and had no tendency to establish the facts for which it is offered, no allusion having been made to the negro in controversy, and no circumstance disclosed in the case from which the jury could legitimately infer that <em>Mrs. C. </em>admitted that the negro in controversy was one of the negroes <em>of </em>which she spoke, and which were to be loaned to her by her father during life; and especially to contradict the declaration of the plaintiff\u2019s testator, as made to <em>M. C. Jones, </em>as stated in the first exception. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">3rd Exception. The plaintiff then produced <em>Mrs. Miles, </em>formerly <em>Mrs- C., </em>mentioned in the preceding exception as <em>Mrs. C-, </em>and proposed to prove by her, that the negro in question belonged to the plaintiff\u2019s testator at the time of his death; and insisted, ,that it appeared from the pleadings in the cause, that he had made a will, and that unless the defendant showed that the proposed witness derived some interest in said negro under said will, she was a competent witness. But on an objection made to her competency by the defendant, the court excluded her. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-6\">4th Exception. The plaintiff, then, to restore the competency of <em>Mrs. Miles, </em>exhibited an instrument under seal, executed by her and her husband during the trial, whereby they released their right in said negro to the plaintiff. But the court, on an objection, decided that this instrument did not render <em>Mrs. Miles </em>a competent witness. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-7\">5th Exception. The plaintiff then offered said release, and in connection therewith, a copy of the last will of his testator , <em>Elwiley Smith, </em>whereby he gives to his daughter, <em>Caroline E. Miles, </em>for her sole and separate use, exclusive of any control of her husband, <em>Thomas H. Miles, </em>the following negro slaves, now in possession of <em>Thomas II. Miles, </em>to wit: <em>Billy, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>Edivard, </em>(fee., &amp;c., <em>Matthias, </em>(fee., (fee., for and during the term of her natural life, and after her death to her husband for his life, and thereafter to her children. The plaintiff relied on these papers as removing the objection taken to the competency of <em>Mrs. Miles. </em>But the court decided that she was not competent. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-5\">6th Exception. The plaintiff then offered another release executed by <em>Mrs. Miles </em>alone, whereby she relinquishes all her right to the negro, to the plaintiff. But the court held, this did not remove the objection to her competency. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-6\">7th Exception. The plaintiff then offered to prove, by <em>James L. Foxwell, </em>that in the fall of 1831, the plaintiff\u2019s testator sent several negroes on the farm then occupied by witness, and which <em>Mrs. G. </em>occupied the ensuing year, for the purpose of seeding wheat for <em>Mrs. C., </em>and said negroes, after they had finished seeding wheat, were carried back to the farm of the plaintiff\u2019s testator, and that <em>Matthias </em>was one of those negroes; and that in a conversation between the testator and <em>Mrs. G., </em>the former stated to the latter that he had loaned her negroes to work her farm with, and that <em>Matthias </em>was one of the negroes used by <em>Mrs. G. </em>in 1832, and afterwards, in working her farm. Tlie defendant objected to the admissibility of this evidence, and the court sustained the objection. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-7\">8th Exception. The plaintiff then exhibited a bill of sale executed during the trial by <em>Mr. </em>and <em>Mrs. Miles, </em>whereby they conveyed and assigned to the plaintiff all their interest in negro <em>Matthias, </em>and also the copy of the last will of the plaintiff\u2019s testator, before mentioned. But the court still held, that <em>Mrs. Miles </em>was not a competent witness. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-8\">9th Exception. The plaintiff then offered to read as evidence to the jury, the said last will. But the court held, this Was not admissible. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-9\">The cause being then aigued before them, the jury rendered a verdict, which was thus entered bv the clerk: <em>(e </em>The said jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>upon their oaths do say, as to the first issue within joined, that the said <em>Thomas W. Morgan </em>did not take nor detain the said negro, as,\u201d &amp;c. \u201c And the said jury do further say, as to the second issue within also joined, that the property of the negro within mentioned, at the within time,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cwas in the said <em>Thomas W. Morgan, </em>as,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cAnd (he said jury do further say, as to the third issue also within joined, that the property of the negijo within mentioned, at the within time,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c was in a stranger, as the said <em>Thomas W. Morgan </em>within, by pleading, hath alleged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-6\">The plaintiff then moved in arrest of judgment: 1st. Because there are no sufficient plea filed in the cause. 2nd. Because the jury did not ascertain upon which of the issues they found their verdict. 3rd. B\u00e9c\u00e1'us\u00f3Vhe jury have found, by their verdict, facts incompatible' and inconsistent with each other. 4th. Because the verdict'is void for uncertainty and ambiguity. \u25a0 5th. Because the jury found no facts'on which the judgment can be given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-8\">This motion was overruled, and judgment rendered for defendant. The plaintiff appealed to this court:</summary>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b146-9\">The cause was argued before Dorsey, C. J., Chambers, Martin and Prick, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-10\">By Pratt and Causin, for the appellant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-11\">By Thos. S. Alexander, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b146-12\">Spence, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-e\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">We think the county court were correct in refusing the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer, for the reasons assigned by them. The court erred, in the second exception, by excluding the evidence of <em>Colonel Coombs </em>from the jury. Notwithstanding his evidence might not have been competent when isolated and unexplained, yet, when followed up by <em>Dunkinson\u2019s </em>evidence,' which was done before objection was made,' it was admissible. This court, in the case of <em>Smith\u2019s Exc\u2019r' vs. Garner, (7 Gill, 1,) </em>at December term, 184S, decided that <em>Mrs. Miles\u2019 </em>declarations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>made under similar circumstances, were competent testimony to go to the jury. The court correctly excluded <em>Mrs. Miles </em>as a witness in the third exception. She was a distributee of her father\u2019s estate, who was plaintiff\u2019s testator, and as such distributee, in the absence of a will, would be interested, the will not having been offered in evidence. For the same reason the court properly excluded <em>Mrs. Miles </em>as a witness under the 4th exception. She was a distributee, and by the release of her interest in the negro <em>Matthias, </em>did not release her entire interest in the estate of her father, and she remained, therefore, interested in the augmentation of his estate. There is no error in the ruling of the court in the 5th exception. The plaintiff, in this exception, with a view fiyifeteng jffijjtqpipetency of <em>Mrs. Miles </em>as a witness, offere^lnjglvmrace nmS will of <em>Elwiley Smith, </em>in connection wi\u00e9fi -^re release, <em>offififtoinas H. Miles </em>and <em>Caroline E. Miles, </em>loV wilftpffered in evidence in this case, the test\u00a3\u00aea#\u00a7a.ve to hWJJwiJiter, <em>Caroline E. Miles, </em>the negro <em>Malthas, </em>in^jffitroversy in this case,) \u201cfor her sole and septn^gjjsp^mMlusive of any control of her husband, <em>Thomas H. Miles, </em>for and during the term of the natural life of her, the said <em>Caroline E. Miles.\u201d </em>We forbear to enter upon the examination of the question of a <em>feme covert\u2019s jus disponendi </em>of her estate, which she holds to her sole and separate use, where the instrument under which she holds, confers no such power in terms. Whether she is to bo considered, in courts of equity, as a <em>feme sole, </em>with power to dispose, or possessing only such powers os the instrument which confers her title bestows, is a question which, according to our view, in this case it is unnecessary to decide. This was a trial at law, and the question is, whether, at law, the wife alone, or the husband and wife conjointly, can divest .the wife\u2019s interest in property to which she is entitled to her sole and separate use? We think they cannot; and the release and will did not, render <em>Mrs. Miles </em>a competent witness. The judgment of the court, was correct in the sixth exception, for the reasons assigned on the fifth. The court erred in the seventh exception, by excluding from the jury the evidence of <em>Foxwell. </em>The acts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>declarations deposed to by him, were <em>competent </em>and admissible evidence as a part of the <em>res gesta </em>of the transaction. The court properly excluded the evidence in the eighth exception, for the reasons stated in our opinion on the fifth exception. The court erred in withholding from the jury the will offered in evidence by the plaintiff, in the ninth exception. The possession and right of property were involved in the issue, the declarations and acts of the plaintiff\u2019s testator had been given in evidence to the jury by both parties, and the will was admissible as a declaration, and claim of possession, and property to th.e negro in dispute, made by the testator in his lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The court committed no error in overruling the plaintiff\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment. The pleadings appear to be in conformity with the forms used and practised under in <em>Maryland, </em>from an early period in the history of the practice in this State. <em>Vide 2 Har. Ent., </em>247. In this case the defendant pleaded three pleas. The first, <em>non cepit. </em>The second, property in the, defendant; and the third, property in a stranger. The plaintiff, in his replication, joined issue on the first plea, and traversed the defendant\u2019s second and third pleas by affirming property in himself; upon which traverses issues were joined. <em>Vide </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>469, <em>Cullum vs. Bevans. </em>The jury found their verdict for the defendant. The form in which it is set out in the record, is a clerical misprison, which, under the act of 1809, ch. 153, is amendable by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The judgment of the county court is affirmed in the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth exceptions, and reversed in the second, seventh and ninth exceptions, and <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
