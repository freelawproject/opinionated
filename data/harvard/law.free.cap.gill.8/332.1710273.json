The defendant, then, for the purpose of showing iitle out of the lessor of the plaintiff, offered the record of a judgment obtained against him, and of the proceedings thereunder, with a view to show a sale, by the sheriff, of the tract of land in controversy. These proceedings show that a judgment in ejectment was recovered against said <em>Reynolds, </em>in <em>Allegany </em>county court, at October term, 1834, by <em>William Lamar\u2019s </em>lessee, upon which <em>afi. </em>jfa.jfor costs, was issued. To this writ <em>John M. Carleton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the sheriff, made return, that in obedience thereto, he had seized and taken in execution the following property of said <em>Reynolds, to </em>wit: \u201c'Lots Nos. 21 and 22, in <em>West Union., </em>and all the improvements thereon, also a tract of land called \u00a3 <em>West Route,\u2019 </em>containing two hundred and eleven and three-quarter acres.\u201d \"Which property was appraised, by the appraisers, at $155.50. <em>A </em>writ of <em>vendi exponas </em>was then issued, to which the said sheriff made return, that after giving the usual notice of sale, by advertisements, &amp;c., which are particularly described, he sold, on the 26th of November, 1842, the \u00a3\u00a3 above described property to <em>M. C. Sprigg,\u201d </em>the highest bidder. In all these advertisements, writs and returns, the land is described as \u00a3\u00a3a tract of land called \u00a3 <em>West Route,\u2019 </em>containing two hundred and eleven and three-quarter acres.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">The defendant then offered the sheriff\u2019s deed for said land, executed by him to <em>Michael C. Sprigg, </em>the purchaser under Whom the defendant claimed. This deed was not inserted in the record. In connection with this evidence of title, the defendant offered the act of 1845, ch. 244, entitled, \u201cAn act to make valid a sheriff\u2019s sale made by <em>John M. Carleton, </em>late sheriff of <em>Allegany </em>county, and the deed of the said sheriff for the property sold to <em>M. C. Sprigg, </em>late of said county, deceased,\u201d as follows, passed 5th of March, 1846:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-7\"><em>\u201cBe it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, </em>That the sale made on the 26th day of November, 1842, by <em>John M. Carleton, </em>laic sheriff of <em>Allegany </em>county, to <em>M. C. Sprigg, </em>late of said county, deceased, of lots numbered twenty-one and twenty-two, lying and being in <em>West Union, </em>in said county, and also of a tract of land called <em>\u2018 Western Route,\u2019 </em>containing two hundred and eleven and seven-eighths acres, sold by the name of \u2022 <em>West Route,\u2019 </em>be and the same is hereby confirmed and made valid, any informality or defects in the <em>fieri facias </em>and <em>venditioni exponas, </em>under which the said lots and tracts of land were sold by the said <em>John M. Carleton, </em>or the sale of the said tract by the name of \u00a3 <em>West Route,\u2019 </em>to the contrary, notwithstanding; <em>provided </em>that nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to affect the rights of third parties to said pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>perly; <em>and provided also, </em>that said sale has been made, in other respects, conformable to law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-5\">The plaintiff objected to the evidence so offered by the defendant, and prayed the court to instruct the jury, that the title papers so offered, do not show that there was any valid seizure of, or levy upon the tract of land in controversy by the sheriff; and that, the sale made by him to the said <em>Sprigg, </em>consequently conveyed no title, but was inoperative and void; and that the act of Assembly offered in evidence, did not cure any defect in the defendant\u2019s title, arising from the want of a proper seizure of, and levy upon said land; which instruction the court, (Martin, O. J.,) granted, and the verdict and judgment being for the plaintiff, the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b342-6\">The cause was argued before Dorset, 0. J., Spence, Magruder, and Prick, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-7\">By McKaig, for the appellant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-8\">By McLean, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b342-9\">Magruder, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ak8\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">It appears, by the record, that this action was brought to recover a tract of land situate in <em>Allegany </em>county, called \u201c <em>Western Route.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">In proof of his title, the appellee offered in evidence a patent for that tract of land granted to himself. Thereupon, the defendant, to prove title out of (he plaintiff, offered in evidence\"a judgment against the plaintiff, a <em>fi. fa. </em>issued upon that judgment, the sheriff\u2019s return, with a schedule and appraisement, showing that he had, in obedience to the writ, seized and taken, together with other land, a tract of land called <em>\u201c West Route,\u201d </em>and that the same was sold to <em>M. C. Sprigg. </em>It is then stated,, in the bill of exceptions, that the sheriff\u2019s deed was offered in evidence, though it is not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">It is supposed that the mistake which is supposed to vitiate this sale, consists in naming the tract of land <em>\u201c West Route,\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>when its patent name is \u201c <em>Western Route.\u201d </em>Is such a variance a fatal objection to the title of the purchaser?</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We think not. A mistake in spelling the name of a tract of land, does not vitiate an instrument of writing, if the word mispelt resembles, in sound or sense, the right name. We are told, that if, in writing \u201c understood,\u201d the letter <em>\u201c s\u201d </em>is omitted, that does not vitiate the writing, because the meaning cannot be mistaken. In 1770, <em>Redding\u2019s lessee vs. McCubbin, </em>1 <em>H. &amp; </em>McH., 368, it was decided, in the provincial court, <em>\u201c </em>that unless the variance between the description of the land in the declaration and the title paper, be material, it will not hinder the plaintiff\u2019s recovery.\u201d And so, in <em>Carroll\u2019s lessee vs. Norwood, </em>4 <em>H. &amp; McH,, </em>287, it was decided, by the Court of Appeals, \u201cthat between <em>'enlargement\u2019 </em>and <em>1 the enlargement,\u2019 </em>there was not such a difference that the plaintiff could not sue by the one name, and recover upon proof of title to a tract of land called, in the patent, by the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">It is sometimes said, that it was so decided in those cases, because there were plots in them, and the plaintiffs located their lands by their patent names. This cannot be. If the plaintiff can, in his declaration claim one tract, and locate what is to be considered a different tract,, and then obtain a verdict, because of a proof of title to the latter, how is the j udgment to be rendered upon such a verdict? The judgment for the plaintiff, in all actions of ejectment, is, \u201cthat the said lessee, as aforesaid, x-ecover against the <em>said-his term aforesaid, </em>yet to come and unexpired, in and unto all that tract of land called\u2014.\u2014,\u201d &amp;c. Now if the land located, and that claimed in the declaration, be different tracts, what term has the plaintiff in the former, or when did the defendant admit lease, entry and ouster to that tract?</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">It can scarcely be maintained, that there is, between \u201c <em>Western Route\u201d </em>and \u201c <em>West Route,\u201d &amp; </em>more material variance that between \u201cenlargement\u201d and <em>\u201cthe enlargement.\u201d </em>Is the variance here a substantial variance? Can a route be a western, but not a west route? Is not the sense precisely the same, although there be some difference in the spelling? If, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>for mistakes like this, sheriff\u2019s sales are to be set aside, a purchaser would not he safe in buying at such a sale, unless he had an opportunity of reading the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The facts disclosed in this case, leave but little doubt that the land claimed in this suit, is the very land which the sheriff undertook to sell. No tract patented by the name of \u201c <em>West Route,\u201d </em>is shown ever to have been owned by the plaintiff, or to have existence. The conclusion seems to be warranted, that the tract which, when taken up, was called by the name of <em>\u201c Western Route,\u201d </em>was, in a later time, sometimes called west, and sometimes western route. If so, a conveyance by the name which it had acquired by reputation, would have passed the title to the patented tract, and any description in the deed by the owner, which is sufficient to pass the title, ought to be a sufficient description thereof in a sheriff\u2019s return and conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">It might have been left to the jury to say whether the land seized and sold by the sheriff, was not the same land for which the plaintiff produced a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">This being the opinion of a majority of the court, it is unnecessary for them to say anything of the act of Assembly of 1845, ch. 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Dorsey, O. J., agreed with <em>the </em>court as to its judgment, but not for the reasons assigned in this opinion. He considered the act of 1845, ch. 244, constitutional.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
