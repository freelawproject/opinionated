Code, \u00a7 496); possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>marijuana for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> possession of codeine (\u00a7 11350, subd. (a)); possession of psilocybin (\u00a7 11377); and two counts of possession of methamphetamine for sale (\u00a7 11378). He was sentenced to four years and four months in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">On appeal, Black contends that; (1) a search warrant affidavit did not establish probable cause; (2) failure to disclose an informant\u2019s identity deprived him of a fair trial; (3) the search of a Winnebago mobilehome was illegal; and (4) insufficient evidence supports one of his convictions for possession of methamphetamine for sale. We reject each contention and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\"><footnotemark>*</footnotemark>1. Probable Cause to Issue Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">III. Mobilehome Search</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In the early morning hours of November 10, 1982, Officer James Jacobson of the Concord Police Department was on routine patrol when he noticed a slow-moving Winnebago mobilehome twice cross the center divider line. He recognized the driver as John Black. When he turned to follow the vehicle, Black began to drive faster than the speed limit, made an unsignaled turn, stopped the vehicle, and turned out its lights. The vehicle was also missing the front license plate.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Jacobson left his patrol car, went up to the front of the Winnebago, and shined his flashlight inside. The Winnebago appeared to be empty, but a curtain was drawn in the back. Believing Black was driving under the influence, Jacobson twice ordered him to step out of the vehicle without receiving a response. Officer Theodore M. Spy row, who joined Jacobson, knocked on the rear window of the Winnebago and called for Black, who stepped out. Black appeared to be intoxicated and Jacobson administered a field sobriety test.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The officers noticed a strong smell of marijuana coming from the driver\u2019s area of the mobilehome. Jacobson found marijuana in the driver\u2019s area. Subsequent searches of the Winnebago turned up more marijuana and a white powdery substance, among other items. The Winnebago was locked up and Black was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Later that day, Officer Al Cruz of the Concord Police Department Narcotics Bureau spoke with Black. After hearing and waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Black signed a consent to search the vehicle for more drugs. Black testified that Cruz told him that if the night search of the vehicle was improper, any evidence found as a result of another search would be inadmissible. Cruz denied this, testifying that he told Black he thought he had probable cause to obtain a search warrant and could impound the vehicle, but that Black could expedite the search by consenting to it. When Cruz searched the Winnebago, he found bindles containing methamphetamine,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> plastic bags, coin envelopes, a funnel coated with a white powdery residue, a ledger, and other narcotics paraphernalia. Black\u2019s motion to suppress (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5) was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Black contends that evidence obtained from the Winnebago must be suppressed because each search was illegal. He contends that police may not search a mobilehome without first obtaining a search warrant, because a mobilehome is not a \u201cvehicle\u201d within the meaning of the vehicle exception to the search warrant requirement. The Winnebago searches led to a charge that Black possessed methamphetamine for sale (\u00a7 11378) in November 1982, <em>after </em>the June 1982 effective date of Proposition 8. As such, federal constitutional standards, rather than independent state constitutional grounds, apply when determining whether a search is proper. <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 890 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at pp. 258-264; see Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The United States Supreme Court recently faced the question of \u201cwhether law enforcement agents violated the Fourth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] when they conducted a warrantless search, based on probable cause, of a fully \u2018mobile motor\u2019 home located in a public place.\u201d <em>(California </em>v. <em>Carney </em>(1985) 471 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 [85 L.Ed.2d 406, 410-411, 105 S.Ct. 2066].) Finding that the mobility of the motorhome placed the warrantless search within the scope of the vehicle exception to the search warrant requirement, the United States Supreme Court offered this explanation of the rationale of the vehicle exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201cWhen a vehicle is being used on the highways or ... is readily capable of such use and is found stationary in a place not regularly used for residential purposes\u2014temporary or otherwise\u2014the two justifications for the vehicle exception come into play. [Fn. omitted.] First, the vehicle is obviously readily mobile by the turn of a switch key, if not actually moving. Second, there is a reduced expectation of privacy stemming from its use as a licensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>motor vehicle subject to a range of police regulation inapplicable to a fixed dwelling. At least in these circumstances, the overriding societal interests in effective law enforcement justify an immediate search before the vehicle and its occupants become unavailable. . . . [f] [The] application of the vehicle exception has never turned on the other uses to which a vehicle might be put. The exception has historically turned on the ready mobility of the vehicle, and on the presence of the vehicle in a setting that objectively indicates that the vehicle is being used for transportation.\u201d (471 U.S. at p. \u2014 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 414-415].) For the same reasons cited in <em>Carney, </em>we find the evening Winnebago searches were within the scope of the vehicle exception to the search warrant requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Acting with probable cause, officers may conduct a warrantless vehicle search that is as thorough as that which a magistrate could authorize in a warrant. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 798, 823 [72 L.Ed.2d 572, 592, 593, 102 S.Ct. 2157]; see <em>California </em>v. <em>Carney, supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. \u2014 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 413].) Black\u2019s obvious intoxication and \u201cfair-to-poor\u201d response to the field sobriety test, combined with the smell of marijuana emanating from the Winnebago constituted probable cause to believe that contraband might be contained within the vehicle. (See <em>Wimberly </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 557, 571-573 [128 Cal.Rptr. 641, 547 P.2d 417].) Under the vehicle exception to the search warrant requirement, this probable cause justified the search of the entire vehicle and all of its contents, including containers, that might conceal contraband. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Ross, supra, </em>456 U.S. at p. 825 [72 L.Ed.2d at p. 594]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chavers </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 462, 466-467 [189 Cal.Rptr. 169, 658 P.2d 96].)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Black\u2019s written consent justifies the search of the Winnebago the following morning. Black contended that Officer Cruz improperly obtained this consent; Cruz denied this. This factual dispute was resolved against Black when the trial court denied his suppression motion. We see no evidence to persuade us that the consent was involuntary.  Assuming arguendo that Cruz did induce Black to consent to another search by telling him that if the evening search was improper, then any evidence found as a result of the subsequent search would be inadmissible, we would still find no error. The evening search <em>was </em>proper and did not taint Black\u2019s consent to search the Winnebago again the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\"><footnotemark>*</footnotemark>IV.
