Defendant Patrick W. Henning (hereinafter referred to as defendant or the Commissioner) is the state Labor Commissioner and chief of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement in the Department of Industrial Relations. (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 56-57, 79.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement is responsible for enforcing orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission and for administering minimum labor standards concerning wages, hours, and working conditions. (\u00a7\u00a7 61, 1171 et seq.) The Commissioner is vested with the power to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and records. (\u00a7\u00a7 74, 92.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 93, the statute at issue here, reads: \u201cObedience to subpoenas issued by the Labor Commissioner, or his deputies or agents shall be enforced by the courts. It is a misdemeanor to ignore willfully such a subpoena if it calls for an appearance at a distance from the place of service of 100 miles, or less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Plaintiff commenced this class action by filing a verified complaint for declaratory injunctive relief on behalf of its members and \u201call owners and operators of restaurants in California who are similarly situated.\u201d The gist of the complaint was that an actual controversy had arisen as to the constitutionality of the Commissioner\u2019s administrative practice of serving employers with subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum and threatening criminal prosecution pursuant to section 93 for employer noncompliance. The Commissioner asserted that he was empowered to act without judicial review of the validity of his subpoenas. Plaintiff argued that section 93 is unconstitutional, on its face and as applied, because \u201cit denies the protections against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 13 of the California Constitution\u201d which \u201crequire that administrative subpoenas be subject to judicial review before a person refusing to comply may incur jeopardy of criminal prosecution or conviction.\u201d Plaintiff prayed for a judicial declaration that section 93 was unconstitutional, and an injunction restraining the Commissioner from threatening its use without first obtaining judicial review of subpoenas. In his answer to the complaint, the Commissioner admitted the existence of the controversy as alleged by plaintiff, and all other factual allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">The Commissioner and plaintiff each noticed a motion for summary judgment or judgment on the pleadings. The trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion and entered judgment in favor of the Commissioner by declaring that section 93 was constitutionally valid and fully enforceable on its face and as applied by the commissioner and further declared that section 93 did not deny Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Plaintiff thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Before proceeding to the merits of plaintiff\u2019s appeal, we first address the threshold question of whether the constitutional issue is properly before us. Obedient to the principle that courts should refrain from reaching constitutional issues unless absolutely unavoidable (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 50 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 663, 667 [128 Cal.Rptr. 888, 547 P.2d 1000]; <em>Palermo </em>v. <em>Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 66 [195 P.2d 1]; <em>Fullerton Union High School Dist. </em>v. <em>Riles </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 369, 384 [188 Cal.Rptr. 897]), we note that plaintiff\u2019s action for declaratory and injunctive relief is an acceptable means of challenging a statute\u2019s constitutionality. <em>(Conover </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 842, 850 [114 Cal.Rptr. 642, 523 P.2d 682]; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 674, 678 [text &amp; fn. 2] [3 Cal.Rptr. 158, 349 P.2d 974, 82 A.L.R.2d 385]; <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>Kearney </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1014 [149 Cal.Rptr. 867]; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>City of Redondo Beach </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 251, 255 [122 Cal.Rptr. 189].) The trial court obviously treated the matter as justiciable. (Cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1061; <em>California Water &amp; Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 16, 23-24 [61 Cal.Rptr. 618].) The Commissioner\u2019s admissions of the factual allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, particularly the allegations regarding the existence and nature of the dispute, eliminate all questions as to the propriety of declaratory relief. As observed in <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>\u201cWith the pleadings so framed, the only issue before the trial court was the constitutionality of the [statute]. \u201d (53 Cal.2d 674 .at p. 678.) The only question being one of law, the dispute was appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>for resolution by summary judgment. <em>(Blackwell </em>v. <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 372, 376 [203 Cal.Rptr. 706]; <em>Schoderbek v. Carlson </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 1027, 1032 [199 Cal.Rptr. 874].) We therefore conclude that the issue of the constitutionality of section 93 is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Plaintiff contends that because \u201cthere exists no procedure under the Labor Code for testing the validity of a subpoena issued by the Labor Commissioner prior to incurring jeopardy of misdemeanor,\u201d a constitutionally required safeguard, \u201c[s]ection 93 is therefore unconstitutional and unenforceable to the extent that it purports to make refusal to comply with a subpoena issued by the Labor Commissioner punishable as a misdemean- or.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument that section 93 is unconstitutional <em>on its face </em>requires plaintiff to surmount formidable obstacles before the trial court\u2019s judgment may be overturned. The brand of unconstitutionality is not lightly applied.  \u201c \u2018All presumptions and intendments favor the validity of a statute and mere doubt does not afford sufficient reason for a judicial declaration of invalidity. Statutes must be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Dennis M. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 444, 453 [75 Cal.Rptr. 1, 450 P.2d 296]; accord <em>In re Ricky H. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 513, 519 [86 Cal.Rptr. 76, 468 P.2d 204]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Poggi </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 581, 589 [165 Cal.Rptr. 758].)  The difficulty is compounded when a statute is attacked as being unconstitutional on its face. In pressing such a claim, plaintiff \u201ccannot prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular application of the statute\u201d; instead, plaintiff \u201cmust demonstrate that the act\u2019s provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.\u201d <em>(Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 168, 180-181 [172 Cal.Rptr. 487, 624 P.2d 1215] [italics deleted]; see <em>County of Nevada </em>v. <em>MacMillen </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 662, 674 [114 Cal.Rptr. 345, 522 P.2d 1345]; 1 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (Sands 4th ed. 1972) \u00a7 2.06, p. 22.) With full appreciation of these principles we turn to the merits of plaintiff\u2019s contention that section 93 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The Commissioner\u2019s suggestion that subpoenas do not come within the purview of the Fourth Amendment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may be dismissed out of hand. The use of subpoenas and subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>as an investigatory tool is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>accepted and established part of the administrative process. (See generally <em>Okla. Press Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Walling </em>(1946) 327 U.S. 186 [90 L.Ed. 614, 66 S.Ct. 494, 166 A.L.R. 531]; LaFave, Search and Seizure (1978) \u00a7 4.13; Benton, <em>Administrative Subpoena Enforcement </em>(1963) 41 Tex.L.Rev. 874.) Nevertheless, their intrusive nature is obvious. In recognition of this reality, subpoenas have been treated as constructive searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment ever since that provision was first judicially construed. (See <em>See </em>v. <em>City of Seattle </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 541, 545 [18 L.Ed.2d 943, 947, 87 S.Ct. 1737]; <em>Okla. Press Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Walling, supra, </em>327 U.S. 186 at pp. 202-207 [90 L.Ed. 614 at pp. 625-629]; <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Henkel </em>(1906) 201 U.S. 43, 76-77 [50 L.Ed. 652, 666, 26 S.Ct. 370]; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1886) 116 U.S. 616, 622-635 [29 L.Ed. 746, 748-752, 6 S.Ct. 524].) More than 20 years ago our Supreme Court treated this principle as established beyond dispute. Within the context of a challenge to an administrative subpoena, the court stated: \u201cOf course, department heads cannot compel the production of evidence in disregard of the . . . constitutional provisions prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>(Brovelli </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 524, 529 [15 Cal.Rptr. 630, 364 P.2d 462].) The same is true today. (See <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Molino </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 46, 51-52 [162 Cal.Rptr. 786]; <em>Board of Medical Quality Assurance </em>v. <em>Gherardini </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 669, 674-675 [156 Cal.Rptr. 55].)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">Judicial deference to administrative discretion and expertise is considerable. The general policy of noninterference is evidenced by the manner in which courts evaluate claims that an administrative subpoena infringes upon interests protected by the Fourth Amendment. Such direct attacks are seldom successful. The Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the subpoena (1) relates to an inquiry which the administrative agency is authorized to make; (2) seeks information reasonably relevant to that inquiry; and (3) is not too indefinite. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morton Salt Co. </em>(1950) 338 U.S. 632, 652-653 [94 L.Ed. 401, 415-416, 70 S.Ct. 357]; <em>Brovelli </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d 524 at p. 529; <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Molino, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.3d 46 at pp. 51-52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The Fourth Amendment also requires that there exist a mechanism by which validation, modification, or nullification of the subpoena can be judicially resolved, without penalty, before compliance with the subpoena can be exacted. As observed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>See </em>v. <em>City of Seattle, supra, </em>387 U.S. 541 at pages 544-545 [18 L.Ed.2d 943 at pages 946-947]. \u201cIt is now settled that, when an administrative agency subpoenas corporate books or records, the Fourth Amendment requires that the subpoena be sufficiently limited in scope, relevant in purpose, and specific in directive so that compliance will not be unreasonably burdensome. The agency has the right to conduct all reasonable inspections of such documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>which are contemplated by statute, but it must delimit the confines of a search by designating the needed documents in a formal subpoena. In addition, while the demand to inspect may be issued by the agency in the form of an administrative subpoena, it may not be made and enforced by the inspector in the field, and the subpoenaed party may obtain judicial review of the reasonableness of the demand <em>prior to suffering penalties for refusing to comply. </em>[H] It is these rather minimal limitations on administrative action which we think are <em>constitutionally required </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added, fn. deleted; see <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Lone Steer, Inc. </em>(1984) 464 U.S. 408, 415 [78 L.Ed.2d 567, 572-573, 104 S.Ct. 769, 773].) One respected commentator has stated that an opportunity to challenge a subpoena before requiring compliance \u201cis particularly important because it permits the subpoenaed party to obtain a judicial examination of the basis for the seizure and reduces the chances of mistake. ... A subpoena process which, in effect, does not contain this safeguard violates the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (LaFave, Search and Seizure, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 4.13, p. 209 [text &amp; fn. 106]; <em>id. </em>(supp. 1985) p. 90; see also LaFave, <em>Administrative Searches and the Fourth Amendment, </em>1967 Sup.Ct.Rev. 1, 28-31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The necessity and wisdom of this safeguard are patent. The availability of a judicial forum for determining the validity of an administrative subpoena can, without detracting from the agency\u2019s power to function, protect \u201cthe interests of men to be free from officious intermeddling, whether because irrelevant to any lawful purpose or because unauthorized by law, concerning matters which on proper occasion and within lawfully conferred authority of broad limits are subject to public examination in the public interest. Officious examination can be expensive, so much so that it eats up men\u2019s substance. It can be time consuming, clogging the processes of business. It can become persecution when carried beyond reason.\u201d <em>{Okla. Press Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Walling, supra, </em>327 U.S. 186 at p. 213 [90 L.Ed. 614 at p. 632].)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">No such protection restrains the Commissioner. Consider the position of one of plaintiff\u2019s members when served with a subpoena issued by the Commissioner. How is he to determine whether the administrative agency is proceeding \u201cunauthorized by law\u201d or is seeking production of materials \u201cirrelevant to any lawful purpose\u201d? If he believes that the subpoena is overbroad, or seeks irrelevant materials, or is otherwise defective, his options are limited. Indeed, he is put to a Hobson\u2019s choice: he must either surrender the material with any questions as to the subpoena\u2019s validity still unresolved, or he must refuse to comply with the subpoena. The alternatives are stark\u2014relinquishment of a constitutional protection or face criminal prosecution. Moreover, he is confronted with the likelihood that the subpoena will be \u201cenforced by the inspector in the field.\u201d <em>{See </em>v. <em>City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number><em>Seattle, supra, </em>387 U.S. 541 at pp. 544-545 [18 L.Ed.2d 943 at p. 947].) This cannot be.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">If the Commissioner\u2019s subpoena is overly broad, or seeks production of materials whose pertinency is not yet demonstrated, it is not constitutionally permissible to place under penalty of criminal conviction the subpoenaed party who has refused in good faith to comply unless and until the subpoena\u2019s validity has been first judicially established. (See <em>Reisman </em>v. <em>Caplin </em>(1964) 375 U.S. 440, 446-448 [11 L.Ed.2d 459, 464-465, 84 S.Ct. 508] [text &amp; fn. 8]; <em>Deutch </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 456, 467-469 [6 L.Ed.2d 963, 971-972, 81 S.Ct. 1587]; <em>Scull </em>v. <em>Commonwealth of Virginia </em>(1959) 359 U.S. 344, 353 [3 L.Ed.2d 865, 870-871, 79 S.Ct. 838]; <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 178, 208-209 [1 L.Ed.2d 1273, 1295-1296, 77 S.Ct. 1173]; Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action (1965) p. 116.) Section 93 is unconstitutional because it provides for strict criminal liability in the event a subpoenaed party refuses to surrender his rights against unreasonable searches and seizures without a prior judicial validation of the subpoena as required by the Fourth Amendment. <em>(See </em>v. <em>City of Seattle, supra, </em>387 U.S. 541 at pp. 544-545 [18 L.Ed.2d 943 at p. 947]; <em>People </em>v. <em>James H. Northrup, Inc. </em>(1980) 106 Misc.2d 440 [432 N.Y.S.2d 45, 46]; cf. <em>Fielder </em>v. <em>Berkeley Properties Co. </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 30, 38 [99 Cal.Rptr. 791]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fahy </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 808, 816-817 [92 Cal.Rptr. 451]; <em>People </em>v. <em>West Coast Shows, Inc. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 462, 470 [89 Cal.Rptr. 290].) \u201cThe statute thus creates an invitation to random and standardless inquiry .... So applied, the statute presents an obvious case of governmental intrusion which is <em>per se </em>unreasonable.\u201d <em>(State </em>v. <em>Huddleston </em>(Del.Super. 1980) 412 A.2d 1148, 1157 [8 A.L.R.4th 113].)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The defects from which section 93 suffers are not hypothetical. As identified by plaintiff they are clear and present in every instance in which the Commissioner issues an administrative subpoena. We therefore conclude that section 93 is unconstitutional on its face and as applied. (See <em>Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d 168 at pp. 180-181; <em>In re Dennis M., supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 444 at p. 453.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Anderson, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b887-10\">POCH\u00c9, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIj\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">The majority pronounces Labor Code section 93 dead, the cause of death being facial unconstitutionality. My diagnosis is that the statute is alive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>well but suffers from being misunderstood, particularly by my majority colleagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The essence of plaintiff\u2019s assault\u2014that a party served with a subpoena by the Labor Commissioner is not guaranteed an opportunity for securing some form of judicial review of the subpoena\u2019s validity prior to a criminal prosecution for noncompliance\u2014poses grave constitutional questions which may not be dismissed out of hand. However since the contention is that Labor Code section 93 is unconstitutional <em>on its face </em>the challenger \u201cmust demonstrate that the act\u2019s provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.\u201d <em>(Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 168, 180-181 [172 Cal.Rptr. 487, 624 P.2d 1215].) The corollary of this burden is that if this court can conceive of a situation in which section 93 could be applied without entailing an inevitable collision with and transgression of constitutional provisions, the statute will prevail over plaintiff\u2019s challenge. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 1246, 1256-1257 [212 Cal.Rptr. 216].) Put a little differently, \u201c\u2018[statutes must be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively and unmistakably appears.\u2019 \u201d <em>{In re Dennis M. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 444, 453 [75 Cal.Rptr. 1, 450 P.2d 296].)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In its full, two sentence, unedited reality, Labor Code section 93 reads: \u201cObedience to subpoenas issued by the Labor Commissioner, or his deputies or agents shall be enforced by the courts. It is a misdemeanor to ignore willfully such a subpoena if it calls for an appearance at a distance from the place of service of 100 miles, or less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">The majority\u2019s analysis is two part: (1) a subpoenaed party is entitled to judicial review of the validity of the subpoena prior to risking criminal liability; and (2) the Labor Code does not provide such an opportunity and is therefore unconstitutional. In light of the case law so well described in the majority opinion there can be no doubt of the correctness of the first part of that reasoning. However, the second part is to the same degree wrong because it ignores the existence of statutes providing what the majority correctly finds to be constitutionally compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Among the ignored statutes are two sections of the Government Code. When a department head such as the Labor Commissioner issues a subpoena and it is ignored he may petition the superior court pursuant to Government Code section 11187 \u201cfor an order compelling the person to attend and testify or produce the papers required by the subpoena before the officer named in the subpoena.\u201d Next, the provisions of section 11188 of the Government Code operate including the following: \u201cUpon the filing of the petition the court shall enter an order directing the person to appear before the court at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>a specified time and place and then and there show cause why he had not attended or testified or produced the papers as required. A copy of the order shall be served upon him. If it appears to the court that the subpoena was regularly issued by the head of the department, the court shall enter an order that the person appear before the officer named in the subpoena at the time and place fixed in the order and testify or produce the required papers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">By force of Labor Code section 52<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> these provisions of the Government Code which furnish a means of challenging, modifying or vindicating an administrative subpoena \u201cgovern and apply to the conduct\u201d of the Labor Commissioner \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise prescribed\u201d in the Labor Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The Labor Commissioner concedes that these sections \u201cgovern and apply to the conduct\u201d of his department but he seeks to limit their applicability to situations where he has decided to proceed <em>civilly </em>against the recalcitrant subpoenaed person. This suggestion of split level applicability flies in the face of the plain wording of Labor Code section 52. To swallow this interpretation\u2014which apparently the majority does\u2014we are required to find the Legislature\u2019s intent to be schizophrenic: that in enacting Labor Code sections 52 and 93 and Government Code sections 11187 and 11188 the Legislature meant to insure that procedural due process would be guaranteed to a subpoenaed person who is eventually the subject of civil contempt proceedings but to deny the same due process to a subpoenaed person against whom criminal charges are brought for failing to comply with an identical subpoena. This interpretation of legislative intent\u2014that a subpoenaed party be denied his or her right to due process\u2014I refuse to buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Because Labor Code section 93 is in part a penal statute, we are required to construe it in a manner which resolves doubts in favor of a potential defendant. (See <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131, 145-146 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 814, 828 [176 Cal.Rptr. 521, 633 P.2d 186].) Such a construction would be that the criminal provision of section 93 may not be invoked until after the Labor Commissioner has obtained an order of enforcement (pursuant to Gov.
