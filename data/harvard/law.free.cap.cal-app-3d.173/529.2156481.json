Pursuant to that policy, each of the four applicants/recipients herein was deemed to have an available real or community property interest resource valued at over $1,000, the current resource limitation, and was therefore denied AFDC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>benefits notwithstanding claimed actual unavailability of those resources. All four applicants/recipients timely appeal from a judgment of the superior court denying their request for a preliminary injunction. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (f).) Pending appeal, they have also petitioned for mandamus relief. For sake of simplicity, they are referred to herein as appellants, and respondents/real parties in interest as respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Mireya Dulce Galster separated from her husband in June 1982, leaving the family residence and taking with her her six children. Finding herself without income, funds from her husband or any other means to meet the needs of herself and the children, she applied in Humboldt County for AFDC benefits but was denied them because her community property interest in the family home that she no longer occupied was nonexempt and exceeded $1,000 in value.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She promptly challenged denial of her application by requesting, on August 16, 1982, a hearing by the Department of Social Services (DSS) (see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 10950 et seq.), and a hearing was scheduled for September 23. Meanwhile, she obtained legal counsel, who made a written request for the basis of the denial and received in response copies of three documents from DSS or county welfare departments outlining a policy of assuming the availability of community property interests absent a legal barrier such as a court-ordered restraint on their disposition pending dissolution proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Counsel subsequently con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>firmed, by a telephone conversation with DSS legal counsel, that the action taken on Mrs. Galster\u2019s application was consistent with current state policy which was then under review and which had not yet been promulgated as a formal written regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The record does not reveal that DSS took formal action on Mrs. Galster\u2019s request for hearing. However, appellate counsel represents that Mrs. Galster filed for dissolution of her marriage in late September 1982 and obtained a court order restricting disposition of the community property, thereby rendering her interest in that property unavailable by respondents\u2019 criteria. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The remaining appellants share a common background. Each of their families received AFDC benefits until, in May and July of 1982, those benefits were terminated following county-level determinations that each possessed excess, nonexempt real property resources. Each requested and obtained a hearing to review those terminations, but all three proceedings resulted in proposed decisions recommending denial of their claims. Respondent Marion J. Woods, as director of DSS,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> adopted the proposed decisions on June 16 and 24, and on September 7, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Appellant Jo Anna Kronsperger-Smith was found ineligible because she owned an unimproved lot in Lake County assessed by the county assessor\u2019s office at $1,819. The lot is inaccessible from paved roads, lies in mountainous terrain and, due to its small size\u2014about 5,400 square feet\u2014was subject to county restrictions forbidding the installment of a septic tank or well. She, along with her husband and two young children, had lived on the lot, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>apparently in an eight-by-ten foot metal shed without running water or electricity, from June 1980 to March 1982, when she was informed by a representative of a child protective services agency that her living environment was inappropriate for the children. Shortly thereafter, the family moved off the lot to Mendocino County, and appellant had her AFDC grant transferred to that county. She was notified on June 3d that AFDC benefits would be discontinued due to her interest in the Lake County lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">After her benefits were denied, she sought a hearing, maintaining that the lot was uninhabitable and, moreover, unsalable despite unsuccessful attempts since April 1981 to sell it at market price. A letter from a realtor with whom she had listed the property for sale stated that the land was unusable and that one would be fortunate to get $1,000 for it. Letters from a second realtor, whose office was not taking listings in that area \u201cbecause they are almost impossible to sell,\u201d stated that there was no present market for the property and that it would be hard to sell for over $1,000. The hearing officer\u2019s proposed decision recognized the claim of unsalability but nevertheless sustained the county\u2019s action since Mrs. Kronsperger-Smith\u2019s property was assessed at more than $1,000 and was free of offsetting encumbrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Appellant Rohana Williams had been receiving AFDC benefits in Santa Cruz County as the sole caretaker parent for two children when, in April 1982, she received notification that her benefits would be terminated due to her ownership of an unimproved parcel of land in Siskiyou County having a market value of $7,100 as shown on a 1978-1979 tax statement. At her hearing challenging the benefits termination, Ms. Williams evidently presented evidence that she had tried unsuccessfully to sell the property at prices as low as $6,500. However, the hearing officer concluded that, even assuming that that lower value were fair and that there were encumbrances totaling as much as $1,000, the property exceeded the maximum eligibility limitation, and the county therefore properly discontinued benefits. The hearing officer did find, however, that Ms. Williams \u201chad made continuous good faith efforts to sell the property, both by listing that property with realtors, attempting to sell it herself through advertisements in the newspaper, and attempting to sell the property by posting signs and other indicia that the property was for sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Appellant Robyn Burros was receiving AFDC benefits in Santa Cruz County for a household consisting of herself, her husband and their two sons. She received notice of discontinuance of benefits effective April 30, 1982, based on her ownership of land in Oregon, where the family had previously lived until January 1979, when they had moved due to a lack of work prospects in that area. The hearing officer in her case found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>property \u201cconsists of approximately four and one-half acres of isolated property. There is a cabin on the property, which has been repeatedly vandalized. The claimant had made repeated good faith efforts to sell the property on an intermittent basis\u201d beginning in 1975, at prices of $18,000, $25,000 and, most recently, at between $15,000 and $17,000 since 1981. The hearing officer concluded that, based on a property value of $15,000 less $2,000 in encumbrances, the net market value exceeded $1,000, and Mrs. Burros was \u201cineligible for AFDC benefits, despite her good faith efforts to sell that property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">On September 20, 1982, appellant Galster initiated the instant proceedings by filing, both as an AFDC applicant and as a taxpayer (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 526a), a complaint and petition in Humboldt County Superior Court, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and a writ of mandate. The court denied a requested temporary restraining order on September 28, finding the issue essentially moot as to Galster because she had in the meantime become eligible once again for benefits due to having obtained an order restraining the transfer of her community property pending dissolution proceedings, but the court nevertheless scheduled a hearing on the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Amendments to the pleadings were filed on October 4, adding Williams, Burros and Kronsperger-Smith as parties (plaintiffs and petitioners), adding allegations as to them and seeking administrative mandamus review (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) of their final DSS-adopted determinations. The matter of the preliminary injunction was heard and submitted on November 18 and the court filed its ruling denying the injunction on December 10, 1982. Implicit in that ruling was also a denial of mandamus relief. Notice of appeal was filed on January 18, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">On January 24, 1983, appellants petitioned for extraordinary relief in this court, seeking mandamus and a temporary stay of the trial court\u2019s judgment. Division Three (Poch\u00e9, J., dis.) summarily denied the petition on February 7, and appellants thereafter petitioned for a hearing in the Supreme Court. By an order filed April 6, that court granted their petition, transferred the matter to itself, \u201cstayed\u201d respondents\u2019 denial of AFDC benefits to \u201cany applicant\u201d pending final disposition, and retransferred the matter to this court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We consider the writ petition along with the appeal since each poses the identical issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">It is helpful at the outset to borrow the following ground-laying excerpts from Justice Reynoso\u2019s recent opinion for the California Supreme Court in <em>Vaessen </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 749, at pages 754 to 756 [200 Cal.Rptr. 893, 677 P.2d 1183]: \u201cAFDC was established by the Social Security Act of 1935. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 et seq.) It is jointly funded by the federal government and the states and is administered by the states in a scheme of \u2018cooperative federalism.\u2019 [Citation.] While state participation is elective, federal funding is conditioned on program compliance with the Social Security Act (Act) and applicable federal regulations. (See 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.10 et seq.) California participates under the terms of Welfare and Institutions Code section 11200 et seq. [f] One of four categorical assistance programs established by the Act, AFDC provides financial assistance to families in which a dependent child is in need of financial support because of the absence, disability or unemployment of a parent. (See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 606(a), 607, 608; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11250, 11251.) [f] . . . [f] In determining a family\u2019s need for financial assistance, the federal statute requires the states to consider income and resources other than AFDC payments which are available to the needy child or relative claiming aid. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(7).)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The last cited provision of the Social Security Act mandates in part that an administering or supervising state agency such as the DSS \u201cshall determine ineligible for aid any family the combined value of whose resources (reduced by any obligations or debts with respect to such resources) exceeds $1,000 or such lower amount as the State may determine, . . .\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(7)(B).) California has opted for the full authorized exemption of $1,000. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11155 and 11257.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Section 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D) of the Code of Federal Regulations currently implements the federal act in this language: \u201cIncome . . . and resources <em>available for current use </em>shall be considered. . . . Income and resources are considered <em>available </em>both when <em>actually available </em>and when the applicant or recipient has <em>a legal interest in a liquidated sum and has the legal ability </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>to make such sum available for support and maintenance. . . </em>,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Italics added.) The controversy in this case centers on disagreement over the meaning of the italicized language. Adopting a narrow interpretation, respondents contend that a legal interest in property must be deemed available for support and maintenance once it is shown to be legally available, despite any practical obstacles to its \u201ccurrent\u201d or \u201cactual\u201d availability. Appellants contend that \u201ccurrent\u201d or \u201cactual\u201d availability remains an overriding requirement in federal and state policy which precludes respondents\u2019 interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Appellants do not challenge any state or federal statute or regulation; they simply seek to invalidate, as inconsistent with those expressions of policy, respondents\u2019 recently begun practice of looking solely to \u201clegal\u201d availability when determining eligibility. Also not challenged is the question of valuation; that is, appellants do not deny that their property interests were correctly valued at over $1,000 and do not contend that the evidence of practical inaccessibility or unsalability which they presented should have been recognized as countering those valuations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, appellants emphasize that they are not seeking to tie the term \u201cavailable\u201d with the term \u201cliquidated sum\u201d under the federal regulation and state statute. They therefore implicitly concede that a nonliquid asset (see definition of \u201cliquid assets\u201d in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(F)(4)) such as unsold realty, stocks, bonds, etc., may be deemed available.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, appellants vigorously deny claiming \u201cthat they should be allowed to hold their resources indefinitely or until they can sell them at a profit, at market value, or even at below market value\u201d; they state, rather, that they are willing to comply with \u201cany reasonable regulation\u201d which would require them to take action to render their resources available [whether] by sale, by institution of divorce [dissolution of marriage] proceedings, or by any other available actions.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>essence of their contention is that AFDC applicants and recipients must be given some opportunity to show that their excess real property resources are, despite the absence of formal legal barriers, not actually available to meet their current support and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">As will be seen, we will agree with appellants that respondents\u2019 policy was invalid as inconsistent with federal and state law policy manifest at the time of the proceedings here under review. Our conclusion, which we have had occasion to reconsider by granting rehearing subsequent to the filing of our original opinion herein, now finds independent support in the recent Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, <em>Schrader </em>v. <em>Idaho Dept, of Health and Welfare </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 768 F.2d 1107, which was filed in the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The income and resources language under the federal act and regulations has often been interpreted by the courts, albeit usually in disputes as to the proper inclusion or exclusion of items from the category of \u201cnet income\u201d rather than \u201cresources.\u201d  As noted above, the AFDC program is designed primarily to provide assistance to families in which a dependent child is in need of support. To this end, the states have broad discretion in allocating AFDC funds and are free to set their own standards of need. <em>(Shea </em>v. <em>Vialpando </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 251, 253 [40 L.Ed.2d 120, 125, 94 S.Ct. 1746]; <em>King </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 309, 318 [20 L.Ed.2d 1118, 1126, 88 S.Ct. 2128]; <em>Vaessen </em>v. <em>Woods, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 749, 755.) However, \u201c [t]he courts have uniformly and repeatedly protected recipients from false assumptions that money the states believe should be available to meet living expenses is <em>in fact actually available </em>for such use. [Citations.]\u201d (Italics added, <em>Vaessen </em>v. <em>Woods, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 757; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 954, 958-959 [184 Cal.Rptr. 471].)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Because state compliance with the mandates of federal law is a condition of receiving federal grants, California, as an AFDC participant, \u201cmust therefore administer its program in compliance with the federal eligibility standards established by the [Social Security] Act, as interpreted and implemented by regulations promulgated by [the Department of Health &amp; Human Services] HHS. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Darces </em>v. <em>Woods, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 871, 880.)  While a court will not superimpose its own policy judgment on that of a state administrative agency which acts in a quasi-legislative capacity, \u201cthe latitude which an administrator has in implementing a state and federal statutory scheme is not unlimited. It is well settled that a state welfare administrator may not operate welfare programs which alter, impair, or impede their statutory schemes [citations], and it is this court\u2019s obligation to strike down regulations effectuating such welfare op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>erations. [Citation.] Thus, to the extent that [a] regulation is inconsistent with controlling state and federal statutes, fundamental principles of administrative law require that it be declared invalid, and its further operation may properly be enjoined. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 903, 908-909 [134 Cal.Rptr. 137].)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Respondents argue that the fundamental and time honored policy of ensuring that states do not make assumptions of availability, and of requiring that income and resources be actually on hand or ready for use when needed <em>(Heckler </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 184, \u2014 [84 L.Ed.2d 138, 149, 105 S.Ct. 1138, 1147]), is applicable to income determinations, where there is greater uncertainty as to what funds will be actually made available to the family rather than used for some other purpose, but inapplicable to resources such as realty, which are always \u201cavailable\u201d in the sense that the property itself is the resource\u2014not the proceeds from the sale of those resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The attempted distinction is without substance. The federal and state provisions define both \u201cincome\u201d and \u201cresources\u201d in the same words with respect to their availability. Moreover, ownership of realty as a resource is not necessarily more certain, in terms of providing for a needy child on a day-to-day basis, than is the assumption that income will find its way into the family budget. The chances of converting realty into support and maintenance are perhaps more certain in the long run, but such resources are far less certain to be available soon enough to meet current, day-to-day needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Next, respondents argue that amendments to the AFDC program brought about by enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA) (Pub.L. No. 97-35, 95 Stat. 357) support their April 1982 change in policy. While OBRA did not change the income-and-resources language of section 602(a)(7)(A) (42 U.S.C.),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it added section 602(a)(7)(B), which marked the first time that Congress itself declared a dollar-amount limitation ($1,000) on excess resources. Prior to OBRA, the excess resources limitation ($2,000) was prescribed by regulation only. OB-RA\u2019s addition of section 602(a)(7)(B) also inaugurated an express exclusion of the family home and a limited ownership interest in one automobile from the calculation of resources. <em>(Schrader </em>v. <em>Idaho Dept. of Health and Welfare, supra, </em>768 F.2d 1107, 1109.) Both before and after OBRA, however, the federal regulation defining \u201ccurrently available resource\u201d remained unchanged: \u201cincome and resources are considered available both when actually available and when the applicant or recipient has a legal interest in a liquidated sum and has the legal ability to make such sum available for support and maintenance.\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D).)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Respondents rely on the reasoning of the federal district courts in <em>Schrader </em>v. <em>Idaho Dept. of Health and Welfare </em>(D.Idaho 1984) 590 F.Supp. 554, and <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Lukhard </em>(E.D.Va. 1984) 591 F.Supp. 319, in which OBRA was held to support the elimination of \u201cgrace periods\u201d during which recipients could remain eligible for AFDC assistance while making good faith efforts to liquidate real property or other resources. Respondents acknowledge that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has recently overturned the district court decision in <em>Schrader (Schrader </em>v. <em>Idaho Dept. of Health and Welfare, supra, </em>768 F.2d 1107), but they represent to this court that they will not consider the issue resolved until all potential for review in the United States Supreme Court has passed or HHS accedes to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision. They also point out that the district court decision in <em>Davis </em>is currently pending before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and is as yet unresolved, thus creating the potential for conflicting federal circuit court authority pending possible United States Supreme Court resolution. Under these circumstances, we find it appropriate to undertake our own analysis of the district court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The district court in <em>Schrader, supra, </em>examined the validity of a state regulatory amendment eliminating a previously allowed grace period\u2014an amendment reflecting the post-OBRA policy of the Secretary of HHS (Secretary) prohibiting such grace periods. (590 F.Supp. 554, 555-556.) Denying injunctive relief to class action plaintiffs, the court upheld the Secretary\u2019s regulation (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D)) as consistent with OBRA and her current interpretation as consistent with the regulation. The court read the regulatory language in the disjunctive so that <em>two </em>distinct categories of resources were deemed countable toward the resource limit: (1) those which are \u201cactually available\u201d <em>or </em>(2) those as to which the applicant has a legal interest and the legal ability to make available. The twin categories were found to be consistent with OBRA\u2019s purpose \u201cto bring the rapid growth of federal spending under control\u201d (p. 558), and the Secretary\u2019s policy forbidding grace periods was found to be consistent with the \u201csecond\u201d category of resources, those which though not \u201cactually available,\u201d satisfy the \u201clegal interest\u201d and \u201clegal ability\u201d language (pp. 558-559). In essence, the court in <em>Schrader </em>viewed actual availability as an alternative rather than an overriding principle. The court reasoned further that the \u201ccurrently available\u201d language of the regulation was not violated in cases of hard-to-liquidate resources because \u201c[ejven \u2018hard-to-liquidate\u2019 resources may be converted to cash if offered at the right price.\u201d (P. 559.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The federal district court in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Lukhard, supra, </em>591 F.Supp. 319, also upheld the amendment of a state regulation to comply with the Secretary\u2019s post-OBRA policy of disallowing grace periods. The court reached the same result as the district court in <em>Schrader, </em>although by a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>analysis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Reasoning that the 97th Congress, in enacting OBRA, was presumptively aware of \u201cthe longstanding State practice of allowing AFDC households a grace period for the disposal of excess property\u201d and that the statutory purpose of AFDC (to promote self-support and personal independence (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601)) was unchanged by the OBRA amendments, the court concluded that Congress, by imposing a $1,000 limitation on resources and by specifically excluding only the family home and one automobile in section 602(a)(7)(B), \u201cevidenced its intent to have every other kind of asset, regardless of its supposed liquidity, count toward determining . . . eligibility.\u201d (591 F.Supp. at pp. 325-326.) The <em>Davis </em>court also relied on <em>Schrader {id., </em>at pp. 324-325) and on circuit court decisions holding that, after OBRA, mandatory deductions from salary are included in determining a wage-earning recipient\u2019s eligibility, notwithstanding the fact that such deductions are (except for possible refunds) not actually available to the recipient. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 326-327, citing <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Massinga </em>(4th Cir. 1983) 721 F.2d 131, 133, and <em>James </em>v. <em>O\u2019Bannon </em>(3d Cir. 1983) 715 F.2d 794, 807; see also <em>Dickenson </em>v. <em>Petit </em>(1st Cir. 1984) 728 F.2d 23, 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">While we acknowledge the persuasive value usually accorded to federal district court decisions <em>(Central Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 962, 967 [106 Cal.Rptr. 912]), we respectfully disagree with the reasoning and conclusions in <em>Schrader </em>and <em>Davis. </em>The focal question in this case is whether the state may validly dispense with the element of actual availability in making excess resource determinations. The district court in <em>Schrader </em>never squarely addressed the problem since it adopted at the outset\u2014and without discussion\u2014the position of the Secretary of HHS that, based on a disjunctive reading of the Secretary\u2019s own regulation, actual availability and legal interest/ability are <em>alternative </em>bases for finding availability. (See also <em>Schrader </em>v. <em>Idaho Dept. of Health and Welfare, supra, </em>768 F.2d 1107, 1113-1114 &amp; fn. 8 [Secretary\u2019s reliance on the \u201cliquidated sum\u201d prong of the regulation is misguided because HEW had rejected such a construction in 1975 and because real property is, at best, a <em>liquidatable </em>resource rather than a <em>liquidated </em>sum].) The district court\u2019s further observation that any resource can be converted to cash if offered at the \u201cright price\u201d is no doubt true in most cases. However, as noted in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion, that analysis \u201cfailed to give adequate weight to the requirement embodied in Regulation \u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(E) that resources be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>reasonably evaluated. To say that there is some \u2018right price\u2019 at which any resource can be liquidated hardly establishes the \u2018equity value\u2019 of the resource, absent a testing of its worth on the market. Real estate in particular demands such testing before its value can be assumed.\u201d (Fn. omitted, <em>Schrader </em>v. <em>Idaho Dept, of Health and Welfare, supra, </em>768 F.2d at p. 1113.) Furthermore, \u201cthe self-sufficiency aimed for by AFDC, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601, would not be served by forcing families to dispose of their assets for far less than they are worth in nonpanic circumstances.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In addition, at least in California, a recipient or applicant who disposes of excess resources at below market value runs the risk of ineligibility for having transferred the property for less than \u201cfair consideration.\u201d (Eligibility and Assistance Standards, \u00a7\u00a7 42-22.21, 42-221.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Next, we disagree with the <em>Davis </em>rationale that the statutory imposition of a resources limitation together with the specific exemption of a home and automobile signal a congressional intent to abandon actual availability. The resource limitation of $1,000 shows the intent to establish a uniform ceiling lower than that previously promulgated by regulation, and that is in keeping with the spending reduction goal of OBRA. However, imposition of a ceiling on available resources does not logically suggest a change in the way that those resources are determined to be available. Adding to the ceiling the exemptions for home and auto still leaves no solid basis for implying the intent found in <em>Davis. </em>The presumption that Congress acts with awareness of long established judicial or administrative interpretations, the rule of construction employed in <em>Davis, </em>actually militates against such an implication. We are confident that Congress, faced with over 40 years of consistent judicial and administrative policy, would legislate a change of this magnitude in a less subtle way than might be implied from section 602(a)(7)(B) alone. Also, the <em>Davis </em>court misplaced its reliance on decisions allowing post-OBRA treatment of mandatory payroll withholdings as countable income regardless of actual availability. As those decisions and the more recent high court decision in <em>Heckler </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 184 [84 L.Ed.2d 138, 105 S.Ct. 1138], make clear, mandatory payroll withholdings escape the actual availability principle, not because of any post-OBRA demise of the principle, but because Congress has elected to now treat such sums as a work expense encompassed within the flat-sum disregard of section 602(a)(8)(A)(ii) rather than as a separate item deductible from \u201cincome\u201d under section 602(a)(7)(A). <em>{Id., </em>at pp. \u2014, \u2014 [84 L.Ed.2d at pp. 146-147, 156-157, 105 S.Ct. at pp. 1144-1145, 1152-1153]; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Massinga, supra, </em>721 F.2d 131, 133; <em>James </em>v. <em>O\u2019Bannon, supra, </em>715 F.2d 794, 807.) The actual availability principle remains vital <em>(Heckler </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>470 U.S. at p. \u2014 [84 L.Ed.2d at pp. 149-150, 105 S.Ct. at pp. 1147-1148]), and the resources at issue in this case do not fall within any exemption to section 602(a)(7)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Finally, it would be inappropriate in this case to defer to the interpretation of either the HHS or DSS.  \u201cAn agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to considerable deference by the courts. [Citation.] But an agency\u2019s interpretations are not conclusive, and courts are not bound by them. [Citation.] In particular, the deference due an administrative interpretation depends upon its consistency with earlier pronouncements, [citation], the purpose and wording of other agency regulations, [citation], and the purposes of the relevant statutes. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McGoog by and through Ferguson </em>v. <em>Hegstrom </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 690 F.2d 1280, 1284.) The record in this case and the district court decisions in <em>Schrader </em>and <em>Davis, </em>both <em>supra, </em>show that respondents\u2019 would-be practice (stayed by the Supreme Ct. pending this review, see fn. 4, ante) began abruptly in 1982, in response to the OBRA amendments to AFDC, and represents a complete about-face from years of prior administrative practice based, ironically, on the same regulation (unchanged after OBRA) relied on now to justify the new policy. In these unusual circumstances, no deference is due the new interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In conclusion, we find no persuasive federal or state support for respondents\u2019 administrative practice of, in essence, conclusively presuming that property interests whose disposition is not legally barred are resources which are actually available to meet the family\u2019s current needs. That practice contradicts consistent and longstanding policies of the federal government and this state. The paramount goal of providing assistance to needy children and their families is hindered by a practice which denies an applicant or recipient the opportunity to demonstrate that unliquidated resources are not actually available despite diligent and good faith efforts to convert those resources and apply them to family needs.  Finally, Welfare and Institutions Code section 11150 expresses our state Legislature\u2019s intent that, in formulating and administering regulations with regard to property qualifications, \u201cconsideration shall be given to the ability and circumstances of the applicant or recipient in order that undue hardship is not imposed upon [them] in making plans to comply\u201d with code provisions. <em>(Steilberg </em>v. <em>Lackner </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 780, 788 [138 Cal.Rptr. 378].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Respondents\u2019 practice simply ignores hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Having concluded that the practice of respondents contravenes state and federal policy, we examine an intervening amendment to the Social Security Act occasioned by enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DRA) (Pub.L. No. 98-369 (July 18, 1984) 98 Stat. 494, 1984 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 697). Effective October 1, 1984, states are required to exclude from the AFDC\u2019s $1,000 resource limit, \u201cfor such period or periods of time as the Secretary may prescribe, <em>real property which the family is making a good-faith effort to dispose of, </em>...\u201d (Italics added, Pub.L. No. 98-369, \u00a7 2626, 98 Stat. 1136, amending 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(7)(B).) The amendment conditions AFDC aid on eventual disposal of the property, at which time such aid is recoverable by the state as overpayment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>{Ibid.) </em>Interim final regulations, also effective October 1, amend section 233.20(a)(3) of the Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, by requiring that states respect a family\u2019s good faith disposition efforts for a period of at least six months and, at the state\u2019s option, up to three months more. (49 Fed.Reg. 35599-35600 (Sept. 10, 1984).)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The amended regulation applies to both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>applicants and current recipients. (49 Fed.Reg. 35590 (Sept. 10, 1984).) By urgency legislation effective September 26, 1984, our state Legislature has codified the DRA provisions in Welfare and Institutions Code section 11257.5, adopting a six-month period of time at the end of which any real property which is unsold counts toward the eligibility ceiling of $1,000. (Stats. 1984, ch. 1447, \u00a7 6, No. 12 West\u2019s Cal. Legis. Service, p. 632, No. 7 Deering\u2019s Adv. Legis. Service, p. 903.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">These developments, in our view, make prospective relief in the form of the preliminary injunction and original writ sought here inappropriate. The federal and state schemes are now clearly expressed and implemented, they are now binding on respondents in their subsequent actions toward even \u201ccurrent recipients,\u201d and respondents\u2019 practice of basing eligibility on bare \u201clegal\u201d availability is obviously incompatible\u2014at least in the first six months of each case. Appellants nevertheless request prospective relief, anticipating that, should their good faith efforts fail to produce a sale within the allotted six months, respondents will find them ineligible without further cooperative efforts (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11257.5), and arguing that the principle of actual availability demands further such efforts extending into the indefinite future, notwithstanding the six- or nine-month outside limit seemingly set by the DRA amendments. We conclude that it would be premature and advisory to address this contention now, when there is no reason to believe that any of appellants will find themselves in that situation. Appellant Galster, it will be remembered, remains in this action solely as a taxpayer seeking injunctive relief, the community property interest that initially rendered her ineligible under respondents\u2019 policy being no longer a bar to benefits. We note, however, that our state Legislature has since acted to similarly remedy the very problem that she faced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Having examined the DRA, we incidentally reject respondents\u2019 suggestion that its provisions, by setting up the good-faith-efforts amendment as an \u201cexception\u201d within a general rule of ineligibility (see text of amended section in fn. 12, <em>ante), </em>shows that Congress\u2019 pre-DRA intent must have been to deem nonexempt real property interests to be currently available despite practical difficulties in disposing of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Settled principles of statutory construction generally prevent deducing the intent behind one act of Congress from implications of a second act passed years later. <em>(Penn Mutual Co. </em>v. <em>Lederer </em>(1920) 252 U.S. 523, 537-538 [64 L.Ed. 698, 704-705, 40 S.Ct. 397].) Even where the later enactment specifically purports to clarify prior legislative intent\u2014and here the DRA provision does not<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>\u2014that expression of intent is not binding but is merely one factor for a court to consider. <em>(Eu </em>v. <em>Chacon </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 465, 470 [128 Cal.Rptr. 1, 546 P.2d 289]; <em>Bd. of Soc. Welfare </em>v. <em>County of L. A. </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 90, 97 [162 P.2d 635]; cf. <em>Heckler </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>470 U.S. 184, \u2014 [84 L.Ed.2d 138, 156-157, 105 S.Ct. 1138, 1152-1153]; <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>GTE Sylvania </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 102, 117-118 &amp; fn. 13 [64 L.Ed.2d 766, 777-778, 100 S.Ct. 2051].) As an illustration of why that rule of construction exists, this case demonstrates that such deductions are frequently two-sided and hence inconclusive. Respondents view the good-faith-efforts amendment as Congress\u2019 first departure from a priorly inflexible rule of presuming current availability; but appellants view the amendment as Congress\u2019 first constraint (i.e., by time limits and conditioned benefits) on a longstanding policy of looking to actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>or practical availability. Absent a stronger indication of congressional intent, we decline to draw an inference either way.

The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Schrader, </em>a case to which the federal agency (HHS) is a party, offers clear \u201cdeclaratory relief\u201d concerning the federal agency and, a fortiori, state agencies that must comply with the mandates of federal law. Also, as appellants themselves note, California is required by federal regulation to prompty correct AFDC underpayments, apparently without time limits for making retroactive correction. (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a)(13)(ii); cf. <em>id., </em>\u00a7 233.20(a)(12)(ii)(a) [in programs <em>other than </em>AFDC, retroactive correction of underpayments limited to the 12 months preceding discovery of underpayment].) Respondents represent, further, that they intend to abide by that requirement. In summary, we have no reason to believe that DSS will not accede to our decision, and there is accordingly no need for the requested coercive remedy. <em>(Assembly </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 638, 679 [180 Cal.Rptr. 297, 639 P.2d 939], app. dism. and cert, den., 456 U.S. 941 [72 L.Ed.2d 463, 102 S.Ct. 2003]; <em>Legislature </em>v. <em>Reinecke </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 396, 407 [110 Cal.Rptr. 718, 516 P.2d 6].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Although the Supreme Court granted appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing for purposes of issuing the stay and retransferring the cause to this court, no alternative writ ever issued.
