We hold the insurer is not liable for damages for failure to settle under such circumstances and shall affirm the summary judgment in favor of defendants from which plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Plaintiff, injured when she slipped and fell while visiting a patient at the Dameron Hospital in Stockton, sued the hospital for damages for her personal injuries. The hospital was insured under a comprehensive hospital liability policy issued to the California Hospital Association by Truck Insurance Exchange (Truck). (See <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 426 [204 Cal.Rptr. 435, 682 P.2d 1100].) Under the policy, the hospital was liable for a proportional share of any damages paid to a claimant. The policy further contained a provision prohibiting settlement of any claim against the hospital without the hospital\u2019s consent. The hospital\u2019s administrator refused to settle with plaintiff, the matter proceeded to trial, with plaintiff receiving a judgment for $6,851.72 in damages and $180.50 for costs. The hospital paid $3,616.11 of the judgment; Truck paid the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Plaintiff then filed a complaint against several insurance companies, including Truck,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the hospital and its administrator, alleging violation of Insurance Code section 790.03 and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Specifically, plaintiff alleged defendants violated Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h)(3), in \u201c[flailing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation and processing of claims arising under insurance policies\u201d; and subdivision (h)(5), in \u201c[n]ot attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.\u201d Compensatory damages and punitive damages in the sum of $10 million were sought. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3294.) The parties stipulated to strike from the complaint any reference to subdivision (h)(3) of section 790.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The insurance companies moved for summary judgment or, alternatively, for summary adjudication of the issue of punitive damages, asserting the insurance policy issued by Truck required it to secure the hospital\u2019s approval before settling plaintiff\u2019s claim and that a representative of Truck had discussed settlement of plaintiff\u2019s claim with the hospital administrator, Dr. Arismendi, but Dr. Arismendi adamantly refused to settle as he believed the hospital was not liable. Further that in view of Dr. Arismendi\u2019s sincerely held belief and his insistence on a trial, Truck did not pressure or coerce him to accept settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Defendants attached declarations by Dr. Arismendi and Roland Gatheral, a Truck claims manager. Dr. Arismendi stated that at all times he believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>the hospital did not act negligently or improperly toward plaintiff in connection with her injury; that he believed the hospital would prevail on plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit; that he discussed the case with a representative of Truck and the hospital\u2019s attorney, and requested that the hospital be \u201cgiven its day in court\u201d; and that the hospital refused to settle. Mr. Gatheral stated he discussed settlement possibilities with Dr. Arismendi; that the hospital would not consent to a settlement; that Dr. Arismendi believed the hospital was not negligent and would prevail at trial; that defense counsel believed the hospital had a \u201crespectable\u201d chance of a favorable verdict; and that in view of Dr. Arismendi\u2019s beliefs, he (Mr. Gatheral) was \u201cdisinclined\u201d to pressure the hospital to settle and waive its right to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">In opposition to defendants\u2019 motion, plaintiff contended Truck violated its duty to attempt in good faith to effectuate settlement by, inter alia, failing to arbitrate the issue of settlement with the hospital when liability was reasonably clear, and failing to adequately investigate plaintiff\u2019s claim. Plaintiff attached a copy of the policy issued by Truck, which provides that in the event Truck and the hospital disagree as to whether to settle a particular claim, the matter shall be submitted to a board to be appointed by the California Hospital Association whose decision will be final. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Mr. Belz, filed a declaration that on several occasions plaintiff offered to settle for $4,500 and was told by defendants\u2019 attorney this was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">After an <em>in camera </em>inspection, the court permitted plaintiff discovery of several documents from the file of defendants\u2019 attorney relating to the settlement negotiations. These documents disclose that as of May 28, 1980, the accident having occurred in May 1979, plaintiff had made a settlement offer of $4,000. Truck\u2019s counsel believed \u201cthis is a case of liability\u201d and the settlement offer \u201cis indeed reasonable.\u201d In an interoffice correspondence dated September 3, 1980, Mr. Bansmer, a Truck claims adjuster, noted the settlement demand was $4,000 and that Dr. Arismendi refused to settle. Mr. Bansmer stated Truck\u2019s attorney believed it had a \u201cone out of four\u201d chance of prevailing at trial and it would probably lose in any arbitration with plaintiff. Mr. Bansmer believed \u201cthis is a <em>case to </em>settle. \u201d (Original italics.) On February 26, 1981, defendants\u2019 attorney reiterated his opinion that \u201cthis is a case of liability\u201d but believed there was \u201csome chance\u201d of prevailing at trial. On April 7, 1981, Mr. Gatheral noted in an interoffice correspondence that Dr. Arismendi still refused to settle. He requested authority \u201cto do what the administrator wants\u201d and noted defendants\u2019 counsel believed that they had a one in four chance of prevailing. A final memo dated October 16, 1981, reveals the settlement demand was reduced to $2,725.47 but Dr. Arismendi still refused to settle.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>The court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, concluding \u201cas a matter of law\u201d the hospital\u2019s refusal to settle precluded Truck from being liable for violation of the Insurance Code; further, that Truck\u2019s failure to press arbitration of the settlement issue was \u201cabsolutely no evidence of a violation of section 790.03 (h)(5).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">\u201cSummary judgment is granted when all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c.) It is a drastic remedy eliminating trial and therefore the moving party\u2019s declarations must be strictly construed and the opposing party\u2019s declaration liberally construed. [Citation.] If there is any issue of material fact to be tried, summary judgment must be denied. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hepp </em>v. <em>Lockheed-California Co. </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 714, 717 [150 Cal.Rptr. 408].)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is premised on a violation of the Insurance Code provisions which prohibit persons who engage \u201cin the business of insurance\u201d from committing specified unfair and deceptive claims practices. Specifically, plaintiff brought her action under Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h)(5), which prohibits insurers from \u201cknowingly,\u201d or \u201cwith such frequency as to indicate a general business practice,\u201d \u201c[n]ot attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">We note initially that under Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h)(5), \u201c[t]he insurer is not <em>required </em>to settle claims in which liability is reasonably clear, it is simply required to make a good faith <em>attempt </em>to reach settlement.\u201d <em>(Beckham </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 691 F.2d 898, 903, fn. 3, italics added.) It is undisputed that Truck believed this was a case of liability and it considered plaintiff\u2019s offer reasonable. It attempted to settle by discussing the matter with Dr. Arismendi, but Dr. Arismendi was convinced the hospital was not liable and refused to settle. Truck, respecting the hospital\u2019s right to defend its position in court, did not further attempt to settle. In so doing, Truck acted in accordance with the term of the policy which prohibits it from negotiating or reaching a settlement without the consent of the hospital.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>Plaintiff contends Truck acted in bad faith by failing to submit the matter to arbitration under the terms of the contract. (See fn. 3, ante.) In effect, plaintiff contends a triable issue of an insurer\u2019s bad faith toward a third party claimant is raised solely by the fact the insurer legitimately accedes to the wishes of its insured instead of compelling arbitration. Plaintiff thereby seeks to enforce a provision of the insurance contract not intended for her benefit. \u201cGenerally, a policy of indemnity insurance will not inure to a third party\u2019s benefit unless the contract makes such an obligation express, and any doubt should be construed against such intent.\u201d <em>(American Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 951, 967 [175 Cal.Rptr. 826].) \u201cA third party should not be permitted to enforce covenants made not for his benefit, but rather for others. He is not a contracting party; his right to performance is predicated on the contracting parties\u2019 intent to benefit him. [Citations.] As to any provision made not for his benefit but for the benefit of the contracting parties ... he becomes an intermeddler. Permitting a third party to enforce a covenant made solely to benefit others would lead to the anomaly of granting him a bonus after his receiving all intended benefit.\u201d <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 937, 944 [132 Cal.Rptr. 424, 553 P.2d 584].)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">When Truck and the hospital paid the judgment in the original action, plaintiff \u201creceived all benefit contemplated by the policy.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>The arbitration clause exists solely for the benefit of Truck and the hospital as a means of resolving disagreements between themselves. In attempting to invoke the clause for her own benefit, plaintiff becomes an \u201cintermeddler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Plaintiff asserts she is not attempting to enforce the contract but her statutory rights under Insurance Code section 790.03. This statute imposes on the insurer only a duty to <em>attempt </em>in good faith to settle the claim. The statute does not specify what the insurer must do before it reaches the threshold of good faith. Plaintiff seeks to define that standard of conduct by the terms of the contract by asserting that an insurer must arbitrate all disagreements with the hospital or face possible liability for bad faith. Plaintiff, in short, urges she has the right to enforce the arbitration clause for her own benefit. We find no such right.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Truck was given a settlement offer of $4,000. It believed it was a case of liability but felt it had a 25 percent chance of prevailing at trial. It discussed settlement with Dr. Arismendi. He insisted in apparent good faith that the hospital was not liable, refused to settle at any sum, and stayed firm on proceeding to trial. Truck, respecting the sincerity of Dr. Arismendi\u2019s beliefs and his right to a trial, did not arbitrate its disagreement over settlement. In accordance with the terms of the contract, Truck did not further negotiate or attempt to settle with plaintiff against the hospital\u2019s wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Under these circumstances, there is no triable issue with respect to the good faith of Truck. To accept plaintiff\u2019s position would compel insurers to take every step within their power to settle before they are deemed to have acted in good faith. The statute imposes no such requirement. Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and the declarations attached thereto establish Truck attempted in good faith to settle plaintiff\u2019s claim. Plaintiff\u2019s responsive papers do not raise a triable issue of material fact. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment. <em>(LaRosa </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 741, 745 [176 Cal.Rptr. 224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">II-III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Puglia, P.
