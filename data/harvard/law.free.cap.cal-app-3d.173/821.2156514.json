Under the circumstances of this case, we find the insurer is estopped, by the provisions in the employee\u2019s certificate of insurance, to claim immunity from California law. We further determine, in the unpublished portion of this opinion, summary judgment was improperly granted on the tort causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">On April 1, 1979, Robbie Cross\u2019 employer, Pharmaceutical Associates, Inc., (Pharmaceutical) replaced its group insurance policy with participation in one underwritten by Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company (Mutual). The Mutual master policy was originally issued in 1970 to the trustees of the Retail Industry Trust Fund, a multiple employer trust located in Rhode Island. The policy disclaimed coverage for injury or sickness for which an insured had consulted a physician within the three-month period prior to inception of the policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Pharmaceutical \u2019 s application form noted the inclusion of this limitation but provided it would be waived up to a $2,000 maximum for certain employees, including Cross. Pharmaceutical received, and distributed to its employees, certificates evidencing coverage under the policy; the certificates also contained a notice of nonliability for preexisting conditions but indicated Pharmaceutical was the policyholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Later in April, Cross became ill and incurred substantial medical expenses. Although the previous policy would have allowed reimbursement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>the claims submitted to Mutual were denied because Cross\u2019 medical problems preexisted the effective date of the Mutual policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">In November, Cross\u2019 attorney contacted Mutual, demanding full payment (she had received the $2,000 maximum allowed under the preexisting condition clause) pursuant to Insurance Code section 10128.3, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The section provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, and except to the extent that benefits for the condition would have been reduced or excluded under the prior carrier\u2019s policy, no provision in a succeeding carrier\u2019s policy of replacement coverage which would operate to reduce or exclude benefits on the basis that the condition giving rise to benefits preexisted the effective date of the succeeding carrier\u2019s policy shall be applied with respect to those employees and dependents validly insured under the prior carrier\u2019s policy on the date of discontinuance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Mutual replied the policy was not subject to the section because the prohibition against preexisting condition limitations only applies to \u201cpolicies issued, delivered, amended, or renewed in this state after January 1, 1977.\u201d (\u00a7 10128.4.) Cross approached the California Insurance Commissioner for an opinion but was instructed as follows: \u201cThis coverage appears to be a non-California group coverage. Therefore the courts must decide the issue</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Cross filed a complaint for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duties, common law fraud and breach of statutory duties. Mutual answered and thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming section 10128 did not apply to its policy and no triable issues of fact existed as to the tort causes of action. Plaintiff, on cross-motion for summary judgment, contended the section was applicable and precluded denial of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">The court declared the code was applicable to the policy but dismissed the tort causes of action, granting leave to amend the complaint to allege breach of the insurance contract. Judgment was delayed until Cross\u2019 amended complaint was filed and her motion to state a class action heard. Cross filed her amended complaint and, in October, requested leave to file a second amended complaint to state a class action. The motion was denied. Judgment was eventually entered in Cross\u2019 favor on the amended complaint for breach of the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Cross appeals the summary judgment granted to Mutual, finding no triable issues on the tort causes of action, and the denial of her motion to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>class action. Mutual appeals the court\u2019s ruling finding California law applicable to its policy and allowing judgment in Cross\u2019 favor on the first amended complaint for breach of the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Applicability of Section 10128</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Mutual claims section 10128.3 cannot apply to this policy because Cross\u2019 employer obtained the coverage through participation in a multiple-employer trust situated in Rhode Island. The policy was issued to the Rhode Island trust, signed by Mutual officers in New Jersey, and delivered to Rhode Island. The trust retained possession of the master policy. All amendments were formulated and endorsed in Rhode Island; there has been no renewal. Therefore, Mutual argues, the policy does not fall within the parameters of section 10128.4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">However, there remains the issuance of the certificate of insurance in California. Mutual insists, and we agree, mere delivery of certificates cannot constitute delivery of the policy. Mutual relies on <em>Boseman </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. </em>(1937) 301 U.S. 196 [81 L.Ed. 1036, 57 S.Ct. 686, 110 A.L.R. 732]. There, a Texas employee of Gulf Oil received a certificate of insurance, under a policy issued in Pennsylvania, containing a clause disallowing any payment after termination unless notice was given within 60 days. The clause was not valid in Texas. Filing for benefits after the 60-day period, the employee was not entitled to payment. The employer had requested <em>issuance and delivery </em>to it in Pennsylvania and had requested the policy be subject to Pennsylvania law. Thus, between the insurer and the employer, Pennsylvania law controlled. However, the issue was which law, as between the insurer and the plaintiff employee, controlled. The plaintiff was not a party to the negotiations or the execution of the contract. By his application (to his employer) he \u201caccepted the provisions of the policy . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 203 [81 L.Ed. at p. 1040].) Moreover, the court was concerned with the intent of the <em>employer, </em>whose employees were situated throughout the United States, \u201cthat everywhere it shall have the same meaning and give the same protection, . . .\u201d (Id., at p. 206 [81 L.Ed. at p. 1042].)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The court did not accept the employee\u2019s argument the certificate delivered to him in Texas made that state\u2019s law applicable. The certificate was not a part of the contract. As noted in the policy, \u201c[i]t did not affect any of the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 203 [81 L.Ed. at p. 1040].) Here, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>other hand, the certificate contained different information than the policy; the face page of the certificate named Pharmaceutical as the policyholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Similarly, 44 Opinions of the Attorney General of California 55 (1964), upon which Mutual relies, is distinguishable. There was no discrepancy there between the policy and the certificate. A New York insurance company issued and delivered a policy to a New York trust company covering mortgage indebtedness in California. The policies were in an amount exceeding that allowed in California. Citing <em>Boseman, </em>the opinion declared the policy, because it was not issued and delivered in this state, did not violate the code. It also determined the certificate of insurance was not a part of the policy and continued, \u201cMoreover, the certificate contains no insuring clauses or undertakings <em>beyond the provisions of the policy. </em>\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 58, italics added.) Again, the certificate was not a part of the policy and, standing alone without variance from the policy, cannot comprise the \u201cissuance\u201d necessary to bring California law into play. Cross\u2019 certificate determines the coverage to which she is entitled. We so conclude <em>not </em>because of the situs of issuance, but because the certificate varies from the master policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We find this situation more closely analogous to that addressed in <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 527 [63 Cal.Rptr. 50, 432 P.2d 746]. The certificate issued to Humphrey provided, under the construction given to it by the court, greater benefits than the master policy. The court determined the certificate prevailed over the provisions of the master policy despite the policy\u2019s statement to the contrary and the requirements of section 10207.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe purpose of the section [section 10209 requiring issuance of a certificate to the insured employee] is to provide persons insured under group policies with information regarding the coverage afforded. Obviously, only <em>accurate </em>information will satisfy the statutory requirement. To hold that an incorrect description of coverage is adequate would thwart the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 533, italics added.) The court justified its holding \u201cupon the grounds that the individual certificate is the only document which the employee sees or is given at any time and that the insurer, who drafts the instrument in language it selects, cannot thereafter complain that it does not express the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Cross\u2019 application noted Pharmaceutical would be the policyholder; the box for insertion of \u201cEmployer, if different from Policyholder\u201d was left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>blank. Her certificate, issued by Mutual, stated Pharmaceutical was the policyholder. It contained in bold letters, on its face, the following notice: \u201cPolicyholder Pharmaceutical Associates.\u201d \u201c \u2018Policyholder\u2019 means the entity to which a policy or contract specified in Section 10128 is issued. \u201d (\u00a7 10128.1, subd. (g), italics added.) No insurance company <em>issuing </em>a policy in this state (\u00a7 10128.4) which contains a preexisting condition limitation provision may apply that provision \u201cwith respect to those employees and dependents validly insured under the prior carrier\u2019s policy on the date of discontinuance . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 10128.3, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Whether by mistake or inadvertence, Mutual provided a certificate indicating on its face Cross\u2019 employer was the policyholder. It cannot now claim reliance on a policy, never given to Cross, which provides otherwise.  The California Supreme Court has held \u201cthat in the event of a conflict or ambiguity between [the master policy and the individual certificate], \u2018the terms of the <em>certificate </em>are binding on the insurer. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>American Cas. Co. </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 266, 271, fn. 2 [98 Cal.Rptr. 814, 491 P.2d 398], italics in original.) The trial court properly found California law applicable to this policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Tort Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Summary judgment on the tort causes of action is reversed.

If that were necessary, we would be persuaded by the following: Mutual is authorized to do business in California; its agents, as brokers and claims representatives, are located in California; all negotiations took place in California; Pharmaceutical is a California employer obtaining insurance for California employees, who will qualify for, and be paid benefits in, California; Cross\u2019 claim was reviewed and initially denied by the Los Angeles office. California has a strong public policy interest, clearly expressed by the Legislature, in protecting its citizens from a lapse in their insurance coverage merely because their employer changes insurers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 821.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
