Cooper (applicant) seeks review of the decision of respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) setting aside the finding of the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) that applicant sustained injury to his psyche in the course of his employment by respondent General Electric Company (GE).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">We hold that the Board\u2019s decision must be annulled since the WCJ correctly found that applicant sustained psychiatric injury in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Applicant Billy M. Cooper filed an application for adjudication of claim alleging industrial injury to his ears, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, and gastrointestinal system while employed as an inspector repairman with GE from June 11, 1946, through July 30, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">In early 1973, applicant\u2019s union at GE provided medical evaluations for employees who had asbestos exposure. Applicant testified that this medical examination was paid for by GE. At that time applicant was examined by Drs. Merliss and Dahlgren. Dr. Merliss opined that applicant suffered from a \u201cdiffuse pulmonary disorder . . . due in part to smoking and in part to the inhalation of asbestos.\u201d Dr. Dahlgren diagnosed applicant\u2019s condition as \u201casbestosis from which he is permanently and totally disabled.\u201d Applicant thereafter continued under the care of Dr. Dahlgren.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Dr. Patrick A. Mauer opined applicant did not have any evidence of asbestos related disease but rather chronic bronchitis due to smoking. In his discussion, Dr. Mauer further stated; \u201c. . . . Because of all of the procedures and Dr. Dahlgren\u2019s firm conviction that Mr. Cooper does have asbestosis, Mr. Cooper is firmly convinced that he is dying of asbestosis .... Even if Mr. Cooper does have some degree of asbestos disease, there is certainly no evidence that he is dying of it, and on the basis of his pulmonary function studies there is absolutely no reason to believe that he is disabled in the least by it. I think it is indeed unfortunate that Mr. Cooper has found himself in the position of being convinced that he has a fatal illness on such meagre grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Dr. John F. Miley, the independent medical examiner (IME), concluded that applicant had \u201cno significant lung disease at all and is not remotely disabled. . . .\u201d Dr. Miley was of the opinion that applicant suffered from \u201cconversion hysteria with moderate to marked depression and anxiety\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>which was in \u201cno way industrial in causation and/or aggravation\u201d and was purely the result of a \u201cmistaken diagnosis rendered to the patient by Dr. Reuben Merliss and Dr. James Dahlgren . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Relying on the medical reports of Drs. Mauer and Miley the WCJ concluded applicant was not suffering from asbestosis. However, with regard to the psychiatric injury the WCJ concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">\u201cIt is unrebutted that applicant was exposed to some asbestos, which was used in electric cords until 1972. It was because of this exposure that applicant was referred to a physician to determine if this asbestos exposure represented a health hazard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">\u201cIt is because of this asbestos exposure, coupled with the medical evaluation, that has produced the injury to the psyche. This thread of events has its beginning in a concern for the exposure to asbestos in the employment environment. The diagnosis precipitated the psychiatric disability ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">\u201cIt is the fact the employment environment contained asbestos which triggered the events herein. It was this which proximately caused the psyche injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The Board granted reconsideration and, in a 2-1 decision, set aside the WCJ\u2019s findings and award. The Board majority opined the evidence failed to justify the finding of an industrial psychiatric injury, reasoning that applicant\u2019s \u201cpsychiatric difficulties were precipitated not by any condition at work but by the diagnosis of asbestos disease (which may be incorrect) reached by his own evaluating physician. It has not been established that there was harmful exposure of <em>any kind </em>(physical or emotional) at applicant\u2019s work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\"> Applicant\u2019s contention that the finding of no industrial pulmonary injury is not supported by substantial evidence was not raised on reconsideration before the Board and is thus waived. (Labor Code, \u00a7 5904; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>U.S. Auto Stores </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 469, <em>477 </em>[93 Cal.Rptr. 575, 482 P.2d 199].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">To be compensable, an injury must arise out of the employment, occur in the course of employment and be proximately caused by the employment. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 778, 782-783 [190 Cal.Rptr. 560].)  The crucial question in the instant action is whether there is a sufficient causal connection between applicant\u2019s employment and his psychiatric condition to establish that his psychiatric illness was work-related and thus arose out of his employment within the meaning of Labor Code section 3600. <em>(Rodgers </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 567, 574 [214 Cal.Rptr. 303].)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Preliminarily, we note that Labor Code section 3600, a provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, is to be liberally construed in favor of extending compensation benefits to the injured worker, and all reasonable doubts whether the injury arose out of the employment are to be resolved liberally in favor of the employee. (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4; Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202; <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 621, 626-627 [170 Cal.Rptr. 32, 620 P.2d 618]; <em>Garza </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 312, 317 [90 Cal.Rptr. 355, 475 P.2d 451]; <em>Industrial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 633, 637-638 [211 Cal.Rptr. 683]; <em>Laines </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 872, 878 [122 Cal.Rptr. 139].) The Supreme Court \u201chas repeatedly recognized that a rule of liberal construction should be applied to all aspects of workers\u2019 compensation law.\u201d <em>(LeBoeuf v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 234, 241 [193 Cal.Rptr. 547, 666 P.2d 989]; <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 626; <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at p. 638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Labor Code section 3600 imposes workers\u2019 compensation liability on the employer, regardless of negligence, when the employment is one of the contributing causes without which the injury would not have occurred. <em>(Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 308, 316 [182 Cal.Rptr. 304].) The phrase \u201cproximately caused by the employment\u201d in section 3600 merely means that the injury must be employment-caused or connected in the sense that there be a cause and effect relationship between the employment and the injury. <em>(Rodgers </em>v. <em>Worker\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at p. 574.) The narrow definition of causation in tort law has been rejected in workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">But for applicant\u2019s asbestos exposure in his workplace at GE, he would not have been referred by his union to a medical examination to detect the presence of an asbestos-related disease. Statutory authority permits an applicant to seek medical treatment for what he perceives to be an industrial injury. <em>(Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>131 Cal.App.3d at p. 315.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Submitting to this medical survey, applicant was diagnosed as having asbestos disease whereupon he also developed a psychiatric disorder. This medical treatment of asbestosis precipitated the applicant\u2019s psychiatric disability, irrespective of the subsequent determination by the WCJ that he was not in fact suffering from asbestosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Thus, but for the employment related diagnosis of asbestosis, applicant\u2019s psychiatric disability would not have occurred. (See <em>Rodgers </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at p. 574.) Hence the psychiatric disability was proximately caused by the employment within the meaning of Labor Code section 3600, despite the WCJ\u2019s conclusion that there was no underlying lung damage. Accordingly, the Board erred in setting aside the WCJ\u2019s finding of industrial psychiatric injury which was supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>by substantial evidence in light of the entire record, especially when considered in light of the Labor Code section 3202 policy of liberal construction in favor of the employee. <em>(Maher </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 729, 732-733 [190 Cal.Rptr. 904, 661 P.2d 1058]; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 274, at pp. 280-281 [113 Cal.Rptr. 162, 520 P.2d 978].)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">In view of our conclusion that the Board erred as a matter of law in setting aside the WCJ\u2019s finding that applicant\u2019s psychiatric injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, the Board\u2019s decision must be annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The December 14, 1984 decision after reconsideration of respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board is annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Had this issue properly been brought before this court on review, the WCJ\u2019s finding of no industrial pulmonary injury would have been upheld. In light of the well-settled principle that the relevant and considered opinion of one physician, though inconsistent with others, may constitute substantial evidence <em>(Market Basket </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 137, 144 [149 Cal.Rptr. 872]; cf. <em>Braewood Convalescent Hospital </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 159, 169 [193 Cal.Rptr. 157, 666 P.2d 14]), based on a review of the entire record, the opinions of Dr. Mauer and Dr. Miley constituted substantial evidence justifying denial of benefits for applicant\u2019s alleged asbestos-related disease. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5952, subd. (d); <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp.

(Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3202.5, 3600, 5705; <em>Wehr </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 188, 193 [211 Cal.Rptr. 321]; <em>California State Polytechnic University </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp.

Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1985) \u00a7 8.45, p. 316.) \u201c \u2018Preponderance of the evidence\u2019 means such evidence as, when weighed with that opposed to it, has more convincing force and the greater probability of truth.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202.5; see <em>Wehr </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at pp. 193-194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">It is well settled that to be compensable under Labor Code section 3600, an injury must both <em>\u201carise out of </em>and be <em>in the course of </em>employment.\u201d <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 643, 652 [184 Cal.Rptr. 111], original italics.) Generally, the phrase, \u201carise out of employment,\u201d refers to a causal connection between the employment and the injury. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">In determining whether applicant met his burden of proving a causal connection between his employment and the psychiatric injury so as to establish that his injury arose out of the employment, the Board, as ultimate trier of fact, was empowered to rescind the WCJ\u2019s decision upon concluding that applicant did not meet his burden of proof by a preponderance of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>dence. (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3202.5, 5906, 5907; <em>Wehr </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at p. 194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Here, in correctly concluding that applicant did not meet his burden of proving industrial causation, the Board stated in its decision: \u201cApplicant\u2019s psychiatric problems are not industrial. The record is, to say the least, insufficient upon which to conclude that he contracted asbestos disease or any other physical ailment due to his work environment, and the workers\u2019 compensation judge found no work-related <em>physical </em>problems. His psychiatric difficulties were precipitated not by any condition at work but by the diagnosis of asbestos disease (which may be incorrect) reached by his own evaluating physician. It has not been established that there was harmful exposure of <em>any kind </em>(physical or emotional) at applicant\u2019s work.\u201d (Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The majority\u2019s reliance on the Labor Code section 3202 rule of liberal construction in annulling the Board\u2019s decision is misplaced. The Legislature has expressly provided that \u201c[njothing contained in Section 3202 shall be construed as relieving a party from meeting the evidentiary burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (Lab.
