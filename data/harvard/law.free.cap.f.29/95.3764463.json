The bill further alleges that, by reason of the said false statements, those who desire to purchase and use the apparatus made and sold by the complainants aro deterred from so doing through fear of litigation, and the business of the complainants is thereby injured; and prays for an injunction. To this bill respondents demur.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">We think the demurrer is well founded. There is no jurisdiction in a court of equity to enjoin libel on the rights or title of the complainant. We understand this to be the settled law both in England and in this country, in the absence of statutory provisions conferring such jurisdiction. The question is so fully and clearly discussed in the leading decisions that we do no more than cite them. <em>Prudential Assur. Co.v. Knott, </em>L.
