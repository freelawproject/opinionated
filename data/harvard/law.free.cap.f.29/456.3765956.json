Easels made of the natural cat-tails thus crossing are old. In defendant\u2019s design, the standards are not crossed, but held together by a band. <em>Meld, </em>no infringement, since the plaintiff was not the first to use cat-tails, and defendant\u2019s design did not infringe his specific device of crossing them.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-11\">In Equity.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-12\"><em>C.

The leading feature of the design consists in the upright standards of the easel crossed near their upper ends, and representing the stems and flowers of the cat-tail plant or flag. The claim is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u201cThe design for an easel herein shown and described, the same consisting of the upright standards of an easel crossing each other near their upper ends, and representing the stems and flowers of the cat-tail plant or flag.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Easels made of natural cat-tails crossing each other near their upper ends are old. In view of this, the Crocker design must be limited to the mode of crossing the standards described in the patent. In defendant\u2019s design the standards are not crossed, but they are held together near tlie top by a band, from which point, by bending, they are spread out so as to present a fan-like appearance. If Crocker liad been the first to design an easel made of cat-tails crossing each other, it might properly be held that the defendant\u2019s design infringed from the general resemblance between the two. In view, however, of what was old, we have grave doubts whether the claim of the paient constitutes any invention; but, assuming the patentability of the design, we are clear that it must be limited to the mode of crossing the standards found in the specification and drawing, and, the defendant not using any form of crossing the standards, there can be no infringement, and the bill must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
