We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On June 18, 1993, the victim was working as a dancer in a nightclub. After she finished work, the victim and the defendant decided to leave the nightclub together to eat. They went to a local bar where the victim consumed alcoholic beverages but no food. While in the bar, the defendant spoke of his marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>difficulties and his attempts to reconcile with his wife. After they left the bar, they went to the defendant\u2019s home to smoke marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">At the defendant\u2019s home, the victim became nauseated and vomited and lost consciousness in the defendant\u2019s bathroom. She awoke when the defendant dragged her by the hair into his living room, where she again lost consciousness. She later awoke naked on the living room floor with the defendant on top of her, engaging in sexual intercourse. The victim screamed and attempted to push the defendant away. She was able to get up and ran naked to the house of a neighbor, who called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Officer James Baraja of the Bridgeport police department arrived at the neighbor\u2019s home and observed the victim in a hysterical state with bruises on her face and arms. She was taken to a hospital where she underwent an examination. Samples of fluids from the victim\u2019s vagina indicated the presence of semen. Baraja went to the defendant\u2019s house and woke him up. When Baraja asked the defendant several questions, the defendant replied that he had nothing to say. Baraja arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his Practice Book \u00a7 902<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> motion for a new trial. The defendant argues that the motion for a new trial should have been granted because defense counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>intoxicated during trial, thereby rendering any assistance of counsel ineffective and depriving the defendant of a fair trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 4065 (d) (3) requires the defendant to include in either his brief or an appendix the pertinent ruling to which he objects.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither the defendant\u2019s brief nor his appendix contains the trial court\u2019s ruling on his \u00a7 902 motion. It is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4061.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Youdin, </em>38 Conn. App. 85, 95, 659 A.2d 728 (1995). Because the defendant has not satisfied his burden of providing an adequate record regarding his \u00a7 902 motion, we decline to review this claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court denied him due process by permitting the state to cross-examine him regarding prior unrelated misconduct. The defendant did not raise this claim at trial but, rather, objected only to the relevance of the evidence. The defendant argues, however, that he is entitled to appellate review of the unpreserved constitutional claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that the cross-examination constituted plain error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">On appeal, the claim must meet all four prongs of the <em>Golding </em>analysis to be successful. Id., 239-40. We have stated previously that \u201c[w]e are free, however, to dispose of the claim by focusing on the condition that appears most relevant under the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>29 Conn. App. 533, 537, 616 A.2d 1148 (1992), cert. denied, 224 Conn. 924, 618 A.2d 531 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The defendant must show that his claim is of constitutional magnitude involving the violation of a fundamental constitutional right pursuant to the second prong of <em>Golding. State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239. The defendant fails, however, to identify a fundamental constitutional right. The defendant\u2019s sole basis for raising this claim relates to the inappropriateness of cross-examining him regarding prior misconduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>As demonstrated by an extensive list of cases cited in the defendant\u2019s brief, his claim on appeal deals with an evidentiary issue, not the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>219 Conn. 93, 98, 591 A.2d 1246 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>213 Conn. 422, 429, 568 A.2d 448 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Busque, </em>31 Conn. App. 120, 128, 623 A.2d 532 (1993), appeal dismissed, 229 Conn. 839, 643 A.2d 1281 (1994). \u201c[0]nce identified, unpreserved evidentiary claims masquerading as constitutional claims will be summarily dismissed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim also does not merit review under the plain error doctrine of Practice Book \u00a7 4185.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Where a trial court\u2019s action does not result in any manifest injustice, a defendant\u2019s claim under the plain error doctrine does not warrant review. \u201cPlain error review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Webb, </em>37 Conn. App. 722, 730-31, 657 A.2d 711 (1988). We conclude that the cross-examination of the defendant regarding prior misconduct did not result in manifest injustice and accordingly does not warrant review.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding \u201cconsciousness of guilt.\u201d The defendant argues that no adequate basis existed for giving the instruction. In addition, he challenges the constitutionality of the instruction. The defendant has not adequately preserved this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>At trial, the defendant objected to the jury instruction regarding \u201cconsciousness of guilt.\u201d The defendant\u2019s brief, however, does not comply with the appropriate procedure for raising this claim. Practice Book \u00a7 4065 (d) (2)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> requires that the defendant\u2019s brief or appendix contain \u201ca verbatim statement of all relevant portions of the charge and all relevant exceptions to the charge.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>37 Conn. App. 180, 186-87, 655 A.2d 782 (1995). The appellant is responsible for providing an adequate record for review. Practice Book \u00a7 4061. The defendant has failed to meet his burden of providing an adequate record for review in failing to include the jury charge in his brief or appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The defendant also seeks to explore on appeal the constitutionality of the \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d charge. The defendant neither preserved this issue at trial, nor sought review under <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine. We decline to review this unpreserved claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The defendant claims finally that the trial court violated his fifth amendment right of silence when it permitted the state to cross-examine him concerning his silence when questioned by police at his home. Although the defendant did not object to the cross-examination at trial, the defendant claims the issue is reviewable under <em>Golding </em>and the plain error doctrine. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">The defendant asserts that constitutional error occurred when the trial court permitted the state to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>cross-examine him regarding his failure to answer questions posed by police officers. The defendant replied to the questions by stating that he had nothing to say. The defendant claims that this cross-examination regarding his silence violated his fifth amendment right of silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">To be successful under <em>Golding, </em>the defendant must meet all four prongs of the <em>Golding </em>analysis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. As noted in part II of this opinion, \u201c[w]e are free ... to dispose of the claim by focusing on the condition that appears most relevant under the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The third prong of the <em>Golding </em>analysis requires that \u201cthe alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. It is well established that questioning regarding a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence is a constitutional violation if a <em>Miranda)</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>warning preceded the silence. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976). The record presented by the defendant in this case does not indicate when police gave <em>Miranda </em>warnings to the defendant. When a defendant is cross-examined regarding his silence after being arrested, unless the record showed that the defendant\u2019s silence is preceded by a <em>Miranda </em>warning, the cross-examination does not violate a constitutional right. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 531, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">\u201cThe defendant bears the responsibility for providing a record that is adequate for review of his claim of constitutional error. If the facts revealed by the record are insufficient, unclear or ambiguous as to whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>constitutional violation has occurred, we will not attempt to supplement or reconstruct the record, or to make factual determinations, in order to decide the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240. \u201cAn adequate factual record is especially crucial when dealing with a claim that was not preserved at trial, since consideration is being sought for review of a claim for which we lack a trial court ruling.\u201d Id., 240 n.10. Because the record presented by the defendant does not indicate when the defendant received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, an adequate record for review of the claim does not exist. The defendant\u2019s failure to provide an adequate record for review is fatal to his claim that a constitutional violation clearly exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The defendant also seeks review claiming that cross-examining him regarding his silence when he was placed in custody constituted plain error. The plain error doctrine is \u201creserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 37 Conn. 730-31. Because this claim has no merit, we decline review on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-7\"> (Tenoral Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person (1) compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such olher person or a third person, or by the threat of the use of force against, such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of unlawful restraint in the first degree when he restrains another person under circumstances which expose such other person to a substantial risk of physical injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b857-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the third degree when: (1) With intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b858-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 902 provides in pertinent: \u201cUpon motion of the defendant, the judicial authority may grant him a new trial if it is required in the interests of justice.

Since the record is factually inadequate to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, evidence would be needed in order to pursue this claim. \u201cA motion for a new trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902 is limited to trial errors appearing on the record.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Murdick, </em>23 Conn. App. 692, 704, 583 A.2d 1318, cert. denied, 217 Conn. 809, 585 A.2d 1233 (1991). When a party seeks to offer evidence, a petition for a new trial is directed under Practice Book \u00a7 904. <em>State </em>v. Jones, 205 Conn. 723, 730, 535 A.2d 808 (1988). Moreover, \u201c[cjlaims of ineffective assistance of counsel should be brought in collateral proceedings, either by way of a [\u00a7 904] petition for a new trial or a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Murdick, </em>supra, 705. This allows those claims supported by the record to be tried concurrently with those claims requiring an evidentiary hearing thereby avoiding piecemeal resolution of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 541-42, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S.
