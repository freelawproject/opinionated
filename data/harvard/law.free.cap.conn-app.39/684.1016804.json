The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) allowed the plaintiff to offer in the deficiency hearing an expert witness who had not been disclosed to the defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D), (2) denied the defendant a jury trial for the deficiency hearing, (3) found that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>presented sufficient evidence to justify a deficiency judgment, (4) awarded the plaintiff damages pursuant to a prepayment clause in the mortgage note, (5) permitted the plaintiff to present additional evidence after the close of its case, and (6) admitted microfiche copies of checks into evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. In September, 1988, the defendant assumed a promissory note secured by a mortgage deed, a conditional assignment of leases and rentals, a security agreement, and a UCC-1 financing statement, all of which had been executed to Connecticut Savings Bank (CSB). In November, 1991, Centerbank acquired the right, title and interest of CSB in the note and security instruments. On May 6, 1992, Centerbank commenced a foreclosure action against the defendant alleging that the defendant had defaulted on his obligation to the bank. On June 5, 1992, Centerbank filed a request for disclosure of defense. On July 6,1992, the trial court entered a default for failure to disclose a defense against the defendant. By motion filed October 15,1992, CTB Ventures 55, Inc. (CTB), was substituted as the plaintiff in the foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On November 16, 1992, the trial court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure against the defendant. The court found a debt of $911,948.01, which represented $773,073.89 of principal on the note, $100,220.43 of accrued interest, and a $38,653.69 prepayment fee. The court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees of $3200, title search fees of $150 and appraiser\u2019s fees of $2500. The defendant did not redeem on his law day, and title to the mortgaged property, condominium units 201, 203, 204 and 205 at 60 Washington Street, Hamden, vested in CTB on January 28, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">On February 11, 1993, CTB moved for a deficiency judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-14. On Feb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ruary 18, 1993, the defendant filed a claim for a jury trial. On June 24, 1993, the trial court held a deficiency hearing and found the value of the property on the date that title vested in CTB to be $720,000. On November 7, 1994, the court took additional evidence and found the total debt as of the day title vested in CTB to be $1,005,524.10, including the principal, interest, attorney\u2019s fees, and appraisal fees that had been awarded at the time of the judgment of strict foreclosure, plus additional interest, attorney\u2019s fees, appraisal fees, and common charges and real estate taxes encumbering the property. This left a deficiency of $285,524.10. The court rendered a deficiency judgment against the defendant in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly allowed the plaintiff to offer, at the June 24, 1993 deficiency hearing, an expert witness who had not been disclosed to the defendant in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant argues that a deficiency hearing is a trial for purposes of \u00a7 220 (D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>ant further argues that to hold otherwise allows parties to practice trial by ambush in deficiency hearings. We find no merit to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this issue. On June 22,1993, the defendant moved that the trial court preclude the appraisal testimony of Timothy J. Breda, a commercial real estate appraiser with the Jerry R. Adkins Company. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff failed to disclose Breda until June 14, 1993, despite the plaintiffs filing of a motion for deficiency judgment on February 17, 1993. At the June 24, 1993 deficiency hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion and allowed Breda to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny plaintiff expecting to call an expert witness at trial shall disclose the name of that expert, the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify, and a summary of the grounds for each opinion, to all other parties within 60 days from the date the case is claimed to a trial list. ... If disclosure of the name of any expert expected to testify at trial is not made in accordance with this subsection, or if an expert witness who is expected to testify is retained or specially employed after that date, such expert shall not testify except in the discretion of the court for good cause shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>As we have recently stated, deficiency proceedings are statutory creations. See <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Voll, </em>38 Conn. App. 198, 205, 660 A.2d 358 (1995). Connecticut enacted its first deficiency judgment statute in 1833. Id., citing <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Durham Realty, Inc., </em>34 Conn. App. 204, 207, 640 A.2d 1017 (1994). In 1979, however, \u201c[t]he statute was declared unconstitutional on the ground that the failure to provide for an evidentiary hearing violated due process. The legislature accordingly amended the statute to provide that the court hears evidence on the value of the property from both parties and establishes a conclusive valuation of the property.\u201d <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Voll, </em>supra, 209. General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 (a) now provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]t any time within thirty days after the time limited for redemption has expired, any party to a mortgage foreclosure may file a motion seeking a deficiency judgment. Such motion shall be placed on the short calendar for an evidentiary hearing. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\u201cStatutes are to be applied as their words direct. . . . [I]f the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>River Rock &amp; Pile, Inc. </em>v. O <em>&amp; G Industries, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 787, 805, 595 A.2d 839 (1991). The plain language of \u00a7 49-14 clearly authorizes an \u201cevidentiary hearing\u201d as \u201cthe only available means of satisfying a mortgage debt when the security was inadequate to make the plaintiff whole. <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>[227 Conn. 270, 278 n.10, 630 A.2d 1010 (1993)], citing D. Caron, Connecticut Foreclosures (2d Ed. 1989) \u00a7 9.05A, p. 158.\u201d <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Voll, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 205-206. Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D), which applies only to trials, does not require the disclosure of expert witnesses who testify at deficiency hearings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly refused to afford the defendant a jury trial for the deficiency proceeding. The record on appeal fails to disclose any ruling by the trial court on the defendant\u2019s February 18, 1993 claim for a jury trial. In fact, at the June 24, 1993 deficiency hearing, defendant\u2019s counsel indicated to the trial court that he was prepared to go forward with the hearing despite the lack of a ruling from the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">\u201cWe have repeatedly held that this court will not consider claimed errors on the part of the trial court unless it appears on the record that the question was distinctly raised at trial and was ruled upon and decided by the court adversely to the appellant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Glass Container Corp., </em>197 Conn. 428, 431, 497 A.2d 763 (1985); <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn. App. 52, 57, 597 A.2d 839, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 902, 600 A.2d 1029 (1991). A party must \u201cadvance his argument of [this issue] at trial in compliance with our rules. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em>223 Conn. 207, 237, 613 A.2d 224 (1992).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the defendant did not request a ruling from the trial court, we decline to review this claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Zollo, </em>36 Conn. App. 718, 726, 654 A.2d 359, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 906, 660 A.2d 859 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly rendered a deficiency judgment in favor of the plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-14, when the court adopted the value presented by the defendant\u2019s expert witness to establish the value of the foreclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>property on the day that title vested in the plaintiff. The defendant argues that the plaintiff did not meet its burden of presenting sufficient evidence for the trial court to determine the value of the property, and that the court should have directed a verdict<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the defendant\u2019s favor. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s characterization of the evidence and find the defendant\u2019s claim lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this issue. At the June 24, 1993 deficiency hearing, the plaintiff called Breda as its only witness. Breda testified that on November 3, 1992, he prepared an appraisal of condominium units 201, 203, 204 and 205 at 60 Washington Street, Hamden. Breda further testified that he also prepared an update of that appraisal to establish the property\u2019s value as of January 28, 1993, the day title vested in the plaintiff.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Breda testified that he used two methods to ascertain the value of the property as of January 28,1993. He used the sales comparison approach to value the property at $550,000, and the income approach to value the property at $250,000. Breda concluded that the value of the property was $450,000 as of January 28, 1993. On cross-examination, Breda testified that the 1991 assessed value of the property for tax purposes was $551,600, representing 70 percent of a purported fair market value of $788,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Following Breda\u2019s testimony and after the plaintiff rested, the defendant moved for a dismissal, claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case. The defendant specifically argued to the court that Breda had failed to justify his conclusions. The trial court, in an oral ruling from the bench, denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court ruled that the defendant\u2019s argument went to the weight that the court should give Breda\u2019s appraisal, not to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The defendant then presented the testimony of Robert J. Nocera, an appraiser. Nocera appraised the property as of January 28, 1993, at $720,000. Following the close of evidence, the court also took judicial notice of an appraisal prepared by Durocher Associates, Inc.,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which valued the property for purposes of the November 16, 1992 foreclosure judgment at $633,000. In rendering a deficiency judgment against the defendant, the court accepted Nocera\u2019s fair market valuation of the property. In its decision, the court stated that it \u201csincerely questions the reliability of the conclusions reached by [Breda]. I do not accept [$450,000] as the fair market value as of January 28, 1993.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The defendant now claims that, as a matter of law, where the court had rejected the plaintiffs evidence and accepted, instead, the defendant\u2019s evidence that this court should hold that the plaintiff did not meet its burden of proof. For support, the defendant cites our Supreme Court\u2019s holding <em>in Eichman v. J &amp; J Build</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number><em>ing Co., </em>216 Conn. 443, 582 A.2d 182 (1990). <em>In Eichman, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cimplicit in General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 is the requirement that the party seeking a deficiency judgment satisfy [its] burden of proof regarding the fair market value of the property as of the date title vests in [that party].\u201d Id., 445. Furthermore, \u201c[i]mplicit in the purpose of the statute is the initial prerequisite that the plaintiff provide the court with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she is entitled to a deficiency judgment. Indeed ... in a deficiency judgment proceeding . . . the trier may not decide an issue which is wholly unsupported by the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">It is also clear, however, that \u201c[t]he determination of [a property\u2019s] value by a court is the expression of the court\u2019s opinion aided ordinarily by the opinions of expert witnesses, and reached by weighing those opinions in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing upon value and its own general knowledge of the elements going to establish it. . . . [T]he determination of the credibility of expert witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony is within the province of the trier of facts, who is privileged to adopt whatever testimony he reasonably believes to be credible.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 451-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In this case, the trial court considered the following four valuations of the property: (1) the 1991 valuation by the town of Hamden in the amount of $788,000; (2) the November 16, 1992 valuation by Durocher in the amount of $633,000; (3) the January 28, 1993 valuation by Breda in the amount of $450,000; and (4) the January 28, 1993 valuation by Nocera in the amount of $720,000. At the close of the plaintiffs evidence, the court had been presented with the 1991 valuation by the town of Hamden in the amount of $788,000 and the January 28, 1993 valuation by Breda in the amount of $450,000. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>defendant then presented Nocera\u2019s January 28, 1993 appraisal of $720,000, which the court accepted as the market value of the property on the day that title vested in the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">While we note that the trial court questioned the reliability of the conclusions reached by Breda, \u201c[t]his court cannot retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Holy Trinity Church of God in Christ </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>214 Conn. 216, 223, 571 A.2d 107 (1990). \u201cAs the finder of fact, the trial court had discretion to accept or reject any or all of the testimony of the opposing expert appraisers.\u201d <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Fordham, </em>36 Conn. App. 630, 630-31, 651 A.2d 1350 (1995). The trial court properly exercised its discretion in finding that the value of the property was $720,000. Its decision to do so does not require a conclusion that the plaintiff failed to present a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly awarded the plaintiff damages pursuant to a prepayment clause in the mortgage note. The defendant argues that the strict foreclosure of the defendant\u2019s interest in the property does not trigger the note\u2019s prepayment clause, and that, even if it did, the clause is an unenforceable penalty. We do not reach the defendant\u2019s claim, however, because the defendant\u2019s appeal on this issue is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">A review of the procedural facts is necessary for disposition of this claim. On July 6,1992, the defendant was defaulted for failure to disclose a defense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>plaintiff, thereafter, offered into evidence, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 527,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> an affidavit of debt, which included a $38,653.69 prepayment fee.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On November 16, 1992, the trial court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure in favor of the plaintiff based on the affidavit of debt. On February 11, 1993, the plaintiff moved for a deficiency judgment against the defendant. On June 24, 1993 and November 7, 1994, a deficiency hearing was held, and on November 7, 1994, the trial court rendered a deficiency judgment of $285,524.10 against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The defendant now attempts to appeal the awarding of the prepayment fee. The defendant argues that he reserved his right to appeal by filing a notice of intent to appeal on November 24, 1992, within twenty days of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>notice of the strict foreclosure judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant specifically stated in his notice of intent to appeal that he intended to challenge the trial court\u2019s awarding of the $38,653.69 prepayment fee.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The appeal period of a final judgment may be extended either pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4009 by filing a motion \u201cwhich, if granted, would render the judgment or decision ineffective,\u201d or pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4040 by filing a motion for an extension of time. <em>Wilton </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>33 Conn. App. 517, 518-19, 636 A.2d 870, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 928, 640 A.2d 116 (1994). Because the defendant did not properly move to extend the appeal period or file an appeal within twenty days of the notice of final judgment, the prepayment fee was no longer appealable. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The defendant claims that he is not challenging his liability on the mortgage debt, but, rather, that he is challenging the trial court\u2019s awarding of the prepayment fee when the deficiency judgment was increased by the amount of the fee. This claim, however, is inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s assertion that he reserved his right to appeal the prepayment fee by filing a notice of intent to appeal the strict foreclosure judgment. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>while we have observed that \u201c \u2018the procedure used to obtain a deficiency judgment [in a foreclosure action] is also part of the main action\u2019 <em>Bank of Stamford </em>v. <em>Alaimo, </em>31 Conn. App. 1, 8, 622 A.2d 1057 (1993), quoting <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Bilmor Building Corp., </em>28 Conn. App. 809, 822, 614 A.2d 456 (1992); \u201c[t]he proceedings on a motion for a deficiency judgment ... do not implicate the integrity of the prior, final judgment of strict foreclosure.\" Federal <em>Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Retirement Management Group, Inc., </em>31 Conn. App. 80, 86, 623 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 226 Conn. 908, 625 A.2d 1378 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\u201cOur Supreme Court has held that \u2018[i]n the hearing contemplated under \u00a7 49-14 to obtain a deficiency judgment, the court, after hearing the party\u2019s appraisers, determines the value of the property and determines any deficiency. This deficiency judgment procedure presumes the amount of the debt as established by the foreclosure judgment and merely provides for a hearing on the value of the property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vignot </em>v. <em>Bank of Mystic, </em>32 Conn. App. 309, 313, 628 A.2d 1339 (1993), quoting <em>First Bank </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>199 Conn. 369, 373, 507 A.2d 997 (1986). The defendant\u2019s challenge to the prepayment fee amounts to a challenge of the debt and does not fall within the limited nature of the deficiency hearing. <em>Vignot </em>v. <em>Bank of Mystic, </em>supra, 313. The awarding of the prepayment fee, therefore, cannot be challenged in an appeal from the deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The trial court entered a judgment of strict foreclosure, including the prepayment fee, on November 16, 1992.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On November 21, 1994, the defendant filed this appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 4009 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe party appealing shall, within twenty days . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>from the issuance of notice of the rendition of the judgment or decision from which the appeal is taken file an appeal . . . .\u201d The appeal, filed two years after notice of the judgment issued, is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the plaintiff to return for a \u201csecond\u201d deficiency hearing and introduce evidence of real estate taxes and condominium fees after the close of evidence in the \u201cfirst\u201d deficiency hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s admission of additional evidence was improper because the plaintiff did not show that its omission of the evidence at the first hearing was by inadvertence or mistake. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">This claim stems from the following additional facts. At the close of the June 24, 1993 deficiency hearing, the trial court found the fair market value of the subject property to be $720,000 as of the date title vested in the plaintiff. Before the court established a deficiency judgment, however, the plaintiffs counsel claimed that the plaintiff was entitled to taxes and condominium fees as outlined in an affidavit that the plaintiff had earlier submitted to the trial court. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected, arguing that the plaintiff had failed to present evidence of these charges to the court properly. The court declined to make an evidentiary ruling on the affidavit and adjourned the proceedings. The court stated that it would be \u201cavailable\u201d at some later time to hear evidence on the taxes and fees if the parties could not reach an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>On November 7, 1994, the parties appeared before the trial court to complete the deficiency hearing. The defendant renewed his objection to the presentation of further evidence by the plaintiff. The court, however, took notice of its own statement that it would allow additional evidence if the parties failed to reach an agreement and noted that the additional evidence concerned \u201ccollateral issues\u201d to the hearing\u2019s primary concern of establishing a fair market value of the subject property as of the date title vested. The plaintiff then presented evidence that the defendant owed $9743.16 in condominium fees and $22,430.65 in real estate taxes to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">\u201cWhether or not a trial court will permit further evidence to be offered after the close of testimony in the case is a matter resting within its discretion. ... In the ordinary situation where a trial court feels that, <em>by inadvertence or mistake, </em>there has been a failure to introduce available evidence upon a material issue in the case of such a nature that in its absence there is a serious danger of a miscarriage of justice, it may properly permit that evidence to be introduced at any time before the case has been decided.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Suffield Bank </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>228 Conn. 766, 782-83, 639 A.2d 1033 (1994), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmquist, </em>173 Conn. 140, 152, 376 A.2d 1111, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 306, 54 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Our review of the record reveals that the plaintiff claimed to have filed an affidavit with the court that set forth the fees and taxes, but that the defendant objected to the court\u2019s taking notice of the affidavit as evidence. \u201cIn determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. <em>DiPalma </em>v. <em>Wiesen, </em>163 Conn. 293, 298,303 A.2d 709 [1972]. Reversal is required only where an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>169 Conn. 692, 702, 364 A.2d 186 [1975].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Suffield Bank v. Berman, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 783, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmquist, </em>supra, 173 Conn. 152-53. The court did not rule on the admissibility of the offered affidavit at the June 24,1993 hearing. It is reasonable to conclude that the trial court believed, in light of the available evidence, that the parties could reach an agreement among themselves, and that if the parties did not reach an agreement no injustice would be done by continuing the hearing on a future date. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence microfiche copies of checks offered by the plaintiff. The defendant argues that the copies did not satisfy the best evidence rule or qualify as business records pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-180.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>\u201cSection 52-180 should be liberally construed, and review is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting a document under that section.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>30 Conn. App. 827, 832, 622 A.2d 1040 (1993). \u201cPursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-180 (c), reproductions of business records are admissible as originals if the conditions set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-180 (a) are satisfied. <em>Burkert </em>v. <em>Petrol Plus of Naugatuck, Inc., </em>5 Conn. App. 296, 299, 497 A.2d 1027 (1985); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 10.10. \u2018A copy of a business record is admissible under the statute if (1) the copy was made in the ordinary course of business and (2) the copy accurately reproduced the original on a durable medium.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumble, </em>24 Conn. App. 57, 69, 585 A.2d 1245, cert. denied, 218 Conn. 902, 588 A.2d 1077 (1991).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pearl, </em>28 Conn. App. 521, 534, 613 A.2d 304 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The evidence claimed by the defendant to have been erroneously admitted consisted of microfiche copies of checks showing the real estate taxes and condominium fees that the plaintiff paid on the foreclosed property. Christopher Ursini, a commercial loan officer for the plaintiff, testified that he was the officer responsible for handling the loan on the property involved in this case, and that he arranged to have the checks processed. The checks would have been dated at the time that they were prepared by an employee of the plaintiff. Ursini further testified that after the checks are cashed they are returned to the bank and microfilmed, and the originals are placed in storage. We conclude that the trial court properly allowed the microfiche copies of the checks in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-14\"> Other defendants in the action include the original mortgagors and subsequent lienholders. We will refer in this opinion to Charles Rubenstein as the defendant</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> We initially note that, although the trial court questioned the reliability and rejected the conclusion as to fair market value of this expert witness, the trial court did not reject all of this expert witness\u2019 testimony. The expert witness\u2019 testimony covered preliminary matters that the trial court considered. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant was aggrieved by the trial court\u2019s decision to allow an expert witness who had not been disclosed in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D) to testily. <em>Windham Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>234 Conn. 513, 523, 662 A.2d 1281 (1995) (\u201cfirst, the party claiming aggrievement must demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest shared by the community as a whole; second, the party claiming aggrievement must establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\"> The defendant also argues that Practice Book \u00a7 528 requires the disclosure of an expert witness who may testify at a deficiency hearing. Practice Book \u00a7 528 provides in relevant part that \u201c[wjhenever a deficiency judgment is claimed in a foreclosure action, the party claiming such judgment shall file with the clerk of the court within the time limited by statute a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>motion setting forth the facts relied on as the basis for the judgment . . . .\u201d The plaintiff contends, however, that the defendant failed to raise this claim at the deficiency hearing. We examine the record to determine whether the defendant raised the issue in question at the deficiency hearing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zollo, </em>36 Conn. App. 718, 726, 654 A.2d A.2d 359, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 906, 660 A.2d 859 (1995). We decline to address the defendant\u2019s claim because Practice Book \u00a7 528 was not the basis for the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude testimony and was not raised in the trial court. See <em>Heritage Village Master Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Heritage Village Water Co., </em>30 Conn. App. 693, 703, 622 A.2d 578 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\"> Compare <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co., N.A. v. Reckert, </em>33 Conn. App. 702, 638 A.2d 44 (1994), in which this court applied Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D) to the trial of a foreclosure action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b714-9\"> We also note that we recently decided that article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution does not mandate a right to a jury trial in a deficiency proceeding. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Voll, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 198. If this claim were reviewable, we would be guided by that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\"> While there is no formally established procedure to move for the dismissal of a motion for a deficiency judgment, our Supreme Court recognized in <em>Eichman v. J &amp;J Building Co., </em>216 Conn. 443, 582 A.2d 182 (1990), that the trial court may dismiss such a motion if the plaintiff fails to establish a prima facie case. Although a deficiency proceeding is not a trial, the motion to dismiss a deficiency judgment for a failure to state a prima facie case is akin to, and has the same effect as, a Practice Book \u00a7 302 motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\"> The appraisal and the update were both admitted as exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\"> The plaintiff had submitted this appraisal in support of its motion for judgment for judgment of strict foreclosure. In <em>Eichman v. J &amp; J Building Co., </em>216 Conn. 443, 457, 582 A.2d 182 (1990), our Supreme Court held it to be error, albeit harmless error, for the trial court to draw inferences from the value placed on the property for the purposes of rendering judgment of strict foreclosure in order to determine the value of the property for the purposes of rendering a deficiency judgment. In this case, however, neither party objected to the trial court\u2019s taking judicial notice of the appraisal prepared by Durocher Associates, Inc. Any such error, therefore, is not before this court. <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Glass Container Corp., </em>supra, 197 Conn. 428, 431; <em>Biggs v. Warden, </em>supra, 26 Conn. App. 57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 236 provides: \u201cIn any action to foreclose or discharge any mortgage or lien or to quiet title, or in any action upon any written contract, in which there is an appearance by an attorney for any defendant, the plaintiff may at any time file and serve in accordance with Sec. 120 a written demand that such attorney present to the court, to become a part of the file in such case, a writing signed by him stating whether he has reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>believe and does believe that there exists a bona fide defense to the plaintiffs action and whether such defense will be made, together with a general statement of the nature or substance of such defense. If the defendant fails to disclose a defense within five days of the filing of such demand, the plaintiff may file a written motion that a default be entered against the defendant by reason of the failure of the defendant to disclose a defense. If no disclosure of defense has been filed, the court may order judgment upon default to be entered for the plaintiff at the time the motion is heard or thereafter, provided that in either event a separate motion for such judgment has been filed. The motions for default and for judgment upon default may be served and filed simultaneously but shall be separate motions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 527 provides: \u201cIn any action to foreclose a mortgage where no defense as to the amount of the mortgage debt is interposed, such debt may be proved by presenting to the court the original note and mortgage, together with the affidavit of the plaintiff or other person familiar with the indebtedness, stating what amount, including interest to the date of the hearing, is due, and that there is no setoff or counterclaim thereto.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\"> The plaintiffs complaint requested, inter alia, \u201c[pjayment of all sums due and owing.\u201d The defendant argues that he could not be expected to disclose his defense to the prepayment penalty fee prior to the plaintiffs filing of an affidavit of debt because the complaint did not provide notice of such a claim. We have stated, however, that \u201c[i]n the absence of a request for a more specific statement the complaint need not detail the elements constituting the mortgage debt. \u201d <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank of New Britain </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 369, 375, 439 A.2d 396 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b720-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4002 (a) provides that parties may reserve their right to appeal judgments pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this rule. Practice Book \u00a7 4002 (b) refers to complaints, counterclaims, cross complaints and counts therein that are stricken pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 157; \u00a7 4002 (c) refers to complaints, counterclaims, cross complaints and counts therein that are dismissed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 142 or a summary judgment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 378. The November 16,1992 judgment of strict foreclosure does not fall within \u00a7 4002 (b) or (c). The defendant, therefore, could not reserve his right to appeal the judgment of strict foreclosure. As we have stated, \u201cdue to the nature of foreclosure actions, the spirit of the rules is to expedite matters.\u201d <em>Suffield Bank </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>25 Conn.
