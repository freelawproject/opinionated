Pacelli appeals from the judgment of strict foreclosure of a mechanic\u2019s lien rendered in favor of the plaintiff. Pacelli\u2019s sole claim is that the trial court improperly awarded damages for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>work performed after the lien was filed when, he argues, the complaint sounded only in foreclosure of a mechanic\u2019s lien and the case was tried solely on that theory. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">On December 28, 1987, the plaintiff, a construction company, entered into contracts with Pacelli and three others who were principals in Mary Ellen Drive Associates and T.K.P. Associates, two general partnerships. The contract was for site development of a residential subdivision known as Nicole Estates in Milford. The plaintiff contracted to build the roadways for the subdivision. On March 23, 1988, the plaintiff and the defendants signed a waiver of mechanic\u2019s lien related to the subdivision. On April 1, 1988, the plaintiff commenced work. The plaintiff stopped work on March 2, 1989, due to nonpayment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At this time, there remained an estimated $150,000 of work left to complete the job. On April 26, 1989, the plaintiff filed a mechanic\u2019s lien in the amount of $400,164.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff subsequently returned to the site to perform additional work and services.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">On September 13, 1989, the plaintiff commenced this action against several defendants seeking to foreclose the mechanic\u2019s lien in the original principal amount of $400,164. The complaint, and each of the amended complaints as filed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleged work performed after the date of the filing of the lien.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The prayer for relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>claimed money damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The case was tried before a state trial referee on December 2 and 3, 1992. The first issue presented to the court was whether the plaintiff, by executing the March 23,1988 lien waiver, had waived its right to file and foreclose the mechanic\u2019s lien. The court held that there was no waiver of the lien by the plaintiff. The court then analyzed whether the plaintiffs lien had priority over competing claims by the defendant UST Bank/Connecticut, a bank that held a mortgage on the property. The court held that the plaintiffs lien did have priority over the mortgage of UST Bank/CT.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court found for the plaintiff in the amount of $315,164<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for work done prior to the filing of the hen and $87,441.42 for work performed after the filing of the hen. On January 3, 1994, the trial court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure in favor of the plaintiff. It is the court\u2019s award of damages for work performed after the fihng of the hen that Pacelli contests on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On appeal, Pacelh argues that the plaintiff made no claim in the complaint for damages stemming from work performed after the fihng of the lien. The defendants filed no pleading, seeking to contest the legal sufficiency of the allegations of the complaint<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or the prayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>for relief. The defendants, at no time, sought to contest the joining of two or more causes of action, or made claim of lack of compliance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-91.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 49-33<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> allows a claim for materials furnished or services rendered to be a lien on the property subject to the payment of that claim. A mechanic\u2019s lien may not attach to any real estate in an amount greater than the price that the owner has agreed to pay the contractor for the improvements to the real estate. <em>Rene Dry Wall Co. </em>v. <em>Strawberry Hill Associates, </em>182 Conn. 568, 572, 438 A.2d 774 (1980). The amount is diminished by payments made prior to the notice of the mechanic\u2019s lien, and the owner is also allowed credit for the reasonable cost to complete the contract satisfactorily. Id., 575. That credit should be disallowed if the work is actually done, completing the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\u201cThe legislature has not provided for a separate certificate for materials and services rendered by one party upon a lienable unit under each of several separate contracts, nor for separate certificates for lienable operations on each of several buddings. It has only provided that there must be a lienable claim for materials and services rendered. Where there is a lienable claim arising from distinct contracts as to the same lienable unit of land and buildings, and where these contracts are carried out in a continuous and overlapping employment, the fair and reasonable intent of the statute is to permit the builder to file a certificate of lien for the entire claim arising under all the contracts, without reference to when the work under any particular contract was begun or ended.\u201d <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>98 Conn. 745, 749, 120 A. 505 (1923). The applicable statutes contain no language that would preclude a mechanic\u2019s lien from covering work performed after the filing of the hen.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The plaintiff argues that it returned to perform work because it was obligated to do so, having posted a performance bond. It argues that the defendants were aware of the continuing improvement work, and derived benefit from this work. We agree that to hold that the lien does not attach to the subsequent work would penalize the plaintiff and require additional cost and expense for filing additional liens each time the plaintiff returned to perform additional work. \u201c[I]t is contrary to equity and good conscience for the defendant to retain a benefit which has come to him at the expense of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>National CSS, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>195 Conn. 587, 597, 489 A.2d 1034 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Our mechanic\u2019s hen statute is to be liberally construed so as reasonably and fairly to carry out its remedial intent, that is, to provide a contractor with security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>for his labor and services. <em>Nickel Pine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Sakal, </em>217 Conn. 361, 364-65, 585 A.2d 1210 (1991). The purpose of the mechanic\u2019s lien is to give one who furnishes materials or services \u201c \u2018the security of the building and land for the payment of his claim by making such claim a lien thereon . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>H &amp; S Torrington Associates </em>v. <em>Lutz Engineering Co., </em>185 Conn. 549, 553, 441 A.2d 171 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The facts of the allegations contained in the complaint must be construed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>182 Conn. 80, 82, 438 A.2d 6 (1980). Our review of the pleadings leads us to conclude that the trial court acted properly in rendering judgment on the basis of the pleadings and evidence as presented for work done to the property after the filing of the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In this opinion O\u2019CONNELL, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-6\"> The total of the plaintiffs claim for materials furnished and services rendered was $1,446,389.

I concur in the result reached by the majority because I agree that the allegations of the complaint and the prayer for relief are sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s judgment awarding damages. I write separately because the issue of whether the mechanic\u2019s lien secured the debt for work performed after the lien was filed was not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The appeal raises only one issue: \u201cDid the court err in awarding $87,441.42 in damages to plaintiff for posthen work when the complaint sounded only in foreclosure of a mechanics lien and when the case was tried solely on that theory?\u201d In disposing of this issue, there is no need to address the mechanic\u2019s lien at all. The $315,164 debt that the lien secured was separately stated in the judgment, and it did not include the $87,441.42 that was awarded as damages. The court rendered a judgment foreclosing the mechanic\u2019s lien and rendered a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>award of damages. The defendant Patrick R. Pacelli complains only of the latter. Having disposed of that issue on the ground that the plaintiffs claim for damages for work performed after the lien was filed was raised sufficiently in the pleadings, we need not decide whether the mechanic\u2019s lien secured the debt for work performed after is was filed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
