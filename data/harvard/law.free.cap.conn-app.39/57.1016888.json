On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly distributed the proceeds of that sale pendente lite without holding an evidentiary hearing and without considering the factors enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The following facts are necessary for the resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff and the defendant were married in 1983 and became partners in an antiques dealership known as Sergeant Antiques. The parties operated their antiques business out of two shops in New Preston and used their marital residence as a third location where their inventoiy of antiques could be stored, displayed and sold.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">On January 11, 1993, the plaintiff instituted an action seeking a dissolution of her marriage to the defendant. Pending the dissolution, the defendant voluntarily left the marital residence and the parties entered into a stipulation that granted the plaintiff exclusive possession of the marital home. The defendant unilaterally dissolved Sergeant Antiques and the parties began to maintain the two shops in New Preston separately. Both the plaintiff and the defendant maintained records of the items sold and made regular accountings to each other of their sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">On May 28, 1993, a hearing was held on each parties\u2019 motion to enjoin the other from disposing of the inventory of Sergeant Antiques. The defendant testified to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>concern that the plaintiff was removing inventory from the marital residence and selling it without his input as to price. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff might have been selling items at a price lower than the item\u2019s value and sought an order of the court that any items for which the parties could not agree on a price would not be sold. In response, the plaintiff argued that such an order would allow the defendant to prohibit the sale of all of the antiques stored in the marital residence by refusing to agree with the plaintiff as to price. The plaintiff suggested that, in the event of disagreement as to price, a third party appraiser could be used and the parties could be bound by that appraisal. The trial court urged the parties to come to an agreement on the issue and declared a recess to give the parties an opportunity for further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">During the recess, the parties came to an agreement, which they reported to the court. In the agreement, the parties stipulated that they would try to agree on the value of as many items as possible and that an expert appraiser, Ron Bourgeault, would appraise and value any items on which the parties could not agree. Until the items were valued, the parties stipulated that they would be held at the marital home and would not be sold. Items for which the parties had agreed on a price could, however, be sold by the parties. The parties further stipulated that the proceeds of the sale of these items would be distributed as follows: each party would receive one half of the proceeds of any items selling for more than $5000; the proceeds of items selling for less than $5000 could be kept and used by the party selling the item, but monthly accountings would be made to the other party. The trial court accepted the agreement of the parties and entered it as an order of the court. No appeal was taken within twenty days of the issuance of this order nor were any motions filed within the appeal period that would have extended the time to appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4009 and 4040.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Nearly ten months later, no appraisal had been conducted and the parties had not agreed on the price of any of the antiques held for resale in the marital residence. On March 16, 1994, the defendant filed a motion for a further restraining order seeking to enjoin the plaintiff from selling any of the items located in the marital residence until \u201cwritten agreement of the parties or further order of the court.\u201d The defendant interpreted the May 28 order to allow only for the sale of those items for which the parties could agree on the price. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff had threatened to sell the items located in the marital residence once they had been appraised and a value established. In opposition, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had refused to cooperate in the pricing of the items located in the marital residence and had interfered with efforts to obtain the third party appraisal by Bourgeault. After hearing arguments, the trial court ordered that Sotheby\u2019s be substituted to appraise the items and, upon appraisal, they could then be sold by the plaintiff for not less than the appraised value. The order further provided that the proceeds of those items would be distributed as provided in the original order that was entered by stipulation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On April 29,1994, the defendant appealed, raising only the issue of whether the trial court properly ordered distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the co-owned assets. The plaintiff timely moved to dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal as untimely filed and for lack of a final judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We denied the plaintiffs motion without prejudice to his right to raise the issues at the time of full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We now dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal as untimely filed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u201cThe right of appeal is purely statutory and is accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute and the rules of court for taking and prosecuting the appeal are met. . . . Practice Book [\u00a7 4009] sets forth a clear and specific timetable for the filing of an appeal from a judgment of the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DeTeves </em>v. <em>DeTeves, </em>202 Conn. 292, 295, 520 A.2d 608 (1987). \u201cPursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4009,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a party appealing shall file an appeal within twenty days from the issuance of notice of the rendition of the judgment or decision from which the appeal is taken.\u201d <em>Matka Corp. </em>v. <em>Automated Material Handling, Inc., </em>34 Conn. App. 723, 725, 643 A.2d 276 (1994). The period in which to file an appeal may be extended by filing a motion for extension of time to appeal; Practice Book \u00a7 4040;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>by filing a motion \u201cwhich, if granted, would render the judgment or decision [appealed from] ineffective . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4009.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Here, the defendant appealed only from the trial court\u2019s order regarding the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the parties\u2019 antiques. This order was entered, by stipulation of the parties, on May 28, 1993.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant did not file an appeal from this judgment within the twenty day appeal period, and did not file any motion during the appeal period which, if granted, would have rendered the judgment or decision ineffective. See Practice Book \u00a7 4009. Nor did the defendant file a motion for extension of time to file an appeal within the time provided by Practice Book \u00a7 4040. The trial court\u2019s orders dated April 18, 1994, did nothing to affect the manner in which the proceeds were distributed, but ordered only that the sale of the items appraised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Sotheby\u2019s would become part of the original order. We, therefore, dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal, which attacks only the order of distribution, as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4(ib-81 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) At the time of entering a decree annulling or dissolving a marriage or for legal separation pursuant to a complaint under section 46b-45, the superior court may assign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>to either the husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other. The court may pass title to real property to either party or to a third person or may order the sale of such real property, without any act by either the husband or the wife, when in the judgment of the court it is the proper mode to carry the decree into effect. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u201c(c) In fixing the nature and value of the property, if any, to be assigned, the court, after hearing the witnesses, if any, of each party, except as provided in subsection (a) of section 46b-51, shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the annulment, dissolution of the marriage or legal separation, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income.
