On appeal, the plaintiff asserts that the trial court\u2019s modification of the alimony was improper because (1) the evidence did not support a finding of a substantial change in circumstances, and (2) the court considered the defendant\u2019s motion for modification prior to rendering a decision on the plaintiffs motion for contempt. We disagree with both of the plaintiffs assertions and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The pertinent facts are as follows. In 1991, the plaintiff brought an action for dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage. On January 7, 1993, the trial court granted a dissolution of the nineteen and one-half year marriage. Pursuant to a stipulation that was made part of the judgment, the trial court ordered the defendant to maintain the plaintiff on his medical insurance plan for three years under COBRA, but ordered the plaintiff to pay for the cost of the insurance. The trial court further ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $271 per month as alimony, \u201cwhich shall be nonmodifiable as to amount . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of the judgment, the plaintiff was unemployed. On July 19, 1993, the defendant filed a motion to open the judgment claiming that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>plaintiffs recent employment constituted a substantial change in circumstances. The parties subsequently entered into a stipulation on August 2, 1993, whereby they agreed to terminate the order requiring the defendant to maintain medical insurance for the plaintiff. The stipulation was silent as to alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">On September 23, 1993, the defendant filed a motion to open and correct the judgment, a motion to reform the separation agreement, and a motion for modification. On December 21, 1993, the plaintiff filed a motion for contempt, alleging that the defendant was in arrears on his alimony and child support payments. On June 15, 1994, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to open and correct the judgment and his motion to reform the separation agreement. The trial court, however, granted the defendant\u2019s motion for modification and modified the alimony to \u201czero dollars as of September 19, 1993.\u201d The trial court took no action on the motion for contempt and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The plaintiff first maintains that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there was not a substantial change in circumstances to warrant the termination of alimony. The plaintiff contends that the trial court should have focused on the time period between the August 2, 1993 stipulation and the defendant\u2019s September 23, 1993 motion for modification in determining whether there had been a substantial change in circumstances. She further asserts that the trial court improperly considered the time period between the original judgment and the defendant\u2019s motion for modification in making its determination. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The plaintiff principally relies on language in commentary that states: \u201cOnce there has been a modifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>tion of the original decree, any subsequent modification depends upon changed circumstances arising not since the original decree but since the date of the earlier modification.\u201d 7 A. Rutkin, E. Effron &amp; K. Hogan, Connecticut Practice Series: Family Law and Practice with Forms (1991) \u00a7 34.8, p. 583. Because the stipulation of August 2,1993, constituted a modification of the original decree, the plaintiff maintains that the trial court should have used the date of the stipulation, and not the date of the original decree, in determining the appropriate time period for reviewing whether there was a substantial change in circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The plaintiffs reliance on that particular language in the commentary is misplaced. The language that immediately follows in the commentary states: \u201cIt is not sufficient for there simply to have been a substantial change of circumstances since the time of the immediately previous court proceeding. Rather, the change must be since the most recent prior proceeding <em>in which an alimony order was </em>entered.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Although the stipulation entered into by the parties modified the original judgment with respect to medical insurance and child support, the stipulation was silent as to alimony. The most recent prior proceeding in which an alimony order was entered was the original judgment awarding the plaintiff alimony of $271 per month. Accordingly, it is the date of that judgment that must be used in determining whether a change in circumstances warranted a modification of the alimony award. The record reflects that after the date of the original judgment, the plaintiff was able to secure full-time employment as well as health benefits. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding a substantial change in circumstances and, consistent with that finding, in modifying the alimony order.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The plaintiff next claims that pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 464 (a), the trial court was required to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>her motion for contempt prior to, or concurrent with, the defendant\u2019s motion for modification. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 464 (a) provides that \u201c[u]pon an application for a modification of an award of . . . alimony . . . filed by a person who is then in arrears under the terms of such award, the court shall, upon hearing, ascertain whether such arrearage has accrued without sufficient excuse so as to constitute a contempt of court, and, in its discretion, may determine whether any modification of current alimony . . . shall be ordered prior to the payment, in whole or in part as the court may order, of any arrearage found to exist.\u201d The plaintiff maintains that this language mandates that the trial court consider the motion for contempt prior to the motion for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Our cases have held that Practice Book \u00a7 464 (a) is merely directory. \u201cThe court [has] discretion in deferring action on the motion for modification until the contempt proceeding [has] been resolved.\u201d <em>Mays </em>v. <em>Mays, </em>193 Conn. 261, 267, 476 A.2d 562 (1984); see also <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>228 Conn. 630, 639, 637 A.2d 1111 (1994). We are also guided by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-8 and our Supreme Court\u2019s recent interpretation of that statute. Section 46b-8 provides that \u201c[w]henever a motion for modification of an order for support and alimony is made to the superior court by a moving party against whom a motion for contempt for noncompliance with such order is pending, the court shall accept such motion and hear both motions concurrently.\u201d In <em>Bryant, </em>the Supreme Court, in deciding whether \u00a7 46b-8 is mandatory or directory, concluded that \u201c[\u00a7] 46b-8 merely sets forth a procedure whereby the trial court <em>may </em>consider a motion for modification jointly with a motion for contempt when doing so would be in the interests of the orderly and efficient resolution of the two motions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 639. Although the court in <em>Bryant </em>addressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>issue of whether \u00a7 46b-8 is mandatory or directory, the court, in concluding that the statute was directory, emphasized that \u201c[t]his conclusion is also consistent with Practice Book \u00a7 464 (a) . . . .\u201d Id., 639 n.7. Therefore, the right of the trial court to defer action on the motion for modification under \u00a7 46b-8, and likewise under Practice Book \u00a7 464 (a), is discretionary. Granting the defendant\u2019s motion for modification prior to taking action on the plaintiffs motion for contempt was an appropriate exercise of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\"> The plaintiff makes no claim in her brief that this language precluded the trial court from modifying the alimony pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a). Section 46b-86 (a) provides in pertinent part: <em>\u201cUnless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification, </em>any final order for the periodic payment of permanent alimony . . . may at any time thereafter be continued, set aside, altered or modified by said court upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Rather, the plaintiff claims that modification was improper because there was not a substantial change in circumstances and because the parties did not intend \u201cthat the plaintiffs alimony be tied to reemployment and ability to obtain health insurance . . . .\u201d Accordingly, since the plaintiff has failed to brief the issue as to whether the nonmodifiable clause precluded modification, we must treat the issue as abandoned. <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 115, 653 A.2d 782 (1995); <em>Allstate Ins.
