We grant the plaintiffs request for sanctions in the form of attorney\u2019s fees, but deny all other relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">After the defendant filed an appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment in this case, the parties were scheduled to appear before former Justice Robert D. Glass, state trial referee, for a preargument settlement conference on August 29,1995. The appeal form indicates that Ralph Crozier is appellate counsel for the defendant. When Crozier failed to appear at the scheduled preargument conference, Judge Glass waited with the plaintiffs counsel for over one hour, while attempting unsuccessfully to reach Crozier by telephone. Thereafter, Judge Glass made further attempts to contact Crozier to reschedule the conference, but Crozier failed to return any of Judge Glass\u2019 telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">During this court\u2019s hearing on the plaintiffs request for sanctions, Crozier did not appear. Instead, a partner of his appeared, but could give no reasonable explanation as to why Crozier did not attend the preargument settlement conference. The plaintiffs counsel stated, however, that while she and Judge Glass were waiting on August 29, 1995, Judge Glass asked her to look for Crozier. Because she could not find him, the plaintiffs counsel tried to reach Crozier by telephone, and his secretary said that he was somewhere in the building. Crozier did not contact the plaintiffs counsel to excuse his absence or to discuss this matter with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Crozier\u2019s partner who was present at the hearing before this court indicated that he had an unsigned affidavit from Crozier stating that he had been out of the country at the time of the scheduled preargument settlement conference. A signed affidavit from a law student who had worked on this case for Crozier was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>filed with this court before the October 25,1995 hearing. That affidavit states that Crozier was on vacation during the week of September 7, 1995. These affidavits fail to explain adequately why Crozier could not be present at a preargument settlement conference on August 29, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\u201cThere are three possible sources for the authority of courts to sanction counsel and pro se parties. These are inherent power, statutory power, and the power conferred by published rules of the court. The power of a court to manage its dockets and cases by the imposition of sanctions to prevent undue delays in the disposition of pending cases is \u2018of ancient origin, having its roots in judgments . . . entered at common law . . . and dismissals . . . .\u2019 That power may be expressly recognized by rule or statute but it exists independently of either and arises because of the control that must necessarily be vested in courts in order for them to be able to manage their own affairs so as to achieve an orderly and expeditious disposition of cases. . . . Simply stated, \u2018[t]he inherent powers of . . . courts are those which \u201care necessary to the exercise of all others.\u201d . . . (Citations omitted.) <em>In the Matter of Presnick, </em>19 Conn. App. 340, 347, 563 A.2d 299, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 801, 567 A.2d 833 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Practice Book \u00a7 4103 provides in relevant part that the \u201c[f]ailure of counsel to attend apreargument conference may result in the imposition of sanctions under Sec. 4184.\u201d The sanctions imposed are left to the discretion of this court, and may include payment of attorney\u2019s fees to the opposing party. Practice Book \u00a7 4184. We conclude that sanctions in the form of attorney\u2019s fees are warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The plaintiffs motion is granted in part and Ralph Crozier, counsel for the defendant, is ordered to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>to the plaintiffs counsel, Belinkie and Lax, attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $750 within thirty days of the issuance of this order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-15\"> The plaintiffs motion to dismiss also asserts that the defendant filed this appeal only as a dilatory tactic and that the defendant has included certain factual misrepresentations in his appellate brief. We deny any relief sought on those grounds. The sanction of dismissal based on the failure to appear at the preargument settlement conference is also denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-17\"> At the hearing of October 25, 1995, the plaintiffs counsel submitted an affidavit in support of her request for counsel fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
