The issues raised by the defendants are all factual and cannot be retried on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Local 884, Council 4, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, </em>38 Conn. App. 709, 713, 662 A.2d 818 (1995)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">Although the parties initially waived oral argument before this court, our examination of the record and briefs disclosed the presence of a serious issue of law that had not been briefed. Plain error review under Practice Book \u00a7 4185<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is warranted because the unad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>dressed issue implicates interests of fundamental justice. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Granby Holdings, </em>230 Conn. 95, 99, 644 A.2d 325 (1994). The unbriefed issue concerns the power of a trial court to render judgment for an amount in excess of the sum stated in the plaintiffs amount in demand. The parties were given notice and ordered to file supplemental briefs. See id.; <em>LoSacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>210 Conn. 503, 509-10, 555 A.2d 986 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The following facts are pertinent to our resolution of this appeal. In compliance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-91<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 131<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff annexed to its complaint a statement that the amount \u201cin demand is more than Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) but <em>less than $15,000.00 </em>exclusive of interest and costs.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Despite this statement of the amount in demand, the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $146,588.57, attorney\u2019s fees of $3767 and costs of $849.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Our decision in the present case is controlled by <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>15 Conn. App. 185, 543 A.2d 785 (1988). Following a thorough, detailed analysis, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>court held that the trial court improperly awarded damages in excess of the amount sought in the statement of the amount in demand. Id., 189-93. We reaffirm our decision in <em>Davis, </em>and hold that the trial court in this case improperly awarded damages in excess of $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The judgment is reversed as to the award of damages and the case is remanded with direction to modify the judgment so that it totals no more than $15,000 plus costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-13\"> The defendants raised the following issues: whether the trial court improperly found that (1) the plaintiff had made reasonable efforts to mitigate damages, (2) the plaintiffs construction activities breached the lease, and (3) the defendant Louis Ursini, president and chief executive officer of Silver Dollar Stores, Inc., executed the lease in his individual capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-14\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4185 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-91 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe first pleading on the part, of the plaintiff shall be known as the complaint and shall contain ... on a separate page of the complaint, a demand for the relief, which shall be a st atement of the remedy or remedies sought.
