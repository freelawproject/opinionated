We conclude that the board has the right to intervene in this appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-249c, and, therefore, we grant the board\u2019s motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The plaintiff, upon leaving her employment as a mental retardation worker at the Southbury Training School, applied to the administrator of unemployment compensation and was granted benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-241. The appeals referee affirmed the administrator\u2019s decision. The employer then appealed to the board, which sustained the appeal. Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court. The court reversed the board\u2019s decision and remanded the case to the board for de novo proceedings. From that judgment, the defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The board moves to intervene in this appeal pursuant to \u00a7 31-249c on the ground that the Superior Court\u2019s decision restricts the board\u2019s authority. The board represents that it did not move to intervene in the plaintiffs appeal to the Superior Court because the board did not know that the appeal involved issues affecting its authority until the trial court issued its memorandum of decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whether a party may intervene at this level of appellate review pursuant to \u00a7 31-249c is a question of first impression for this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Section 31-249c provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he board shall have the right to intervene as a party in any proceeding under this chapter before a reviewing court.\u201d The statutory scheme governing administrative proceedings provides for two levels of appellate review. General Statutes \u00a7 31-249b. The issue before us is whether the term \u201creviewing court\u201d in \u00a7 31-249c encompasses this court as well as the Superior Court in the context of this administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In construing \u00a7 31-249c, we must adhere to \u201cwell defined principles of statutory interpretation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>require us to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... To determine the intent of the legislature, we first consider whether the statutory language yields a plain and unambiguous resolution. . . . If the words are clear and unambiguous, it is assumed that [they] express the intention of the legislature . . . and we need inquire no further. . . . The words of a statute must be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning unless their context dictates otherwise.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>210 Conn. 573, 576, 556 A.2d 584 (1989); see also General Statutes \u00a7 l-l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Section 31-249c gives the board the right to intervene \u201cin <em>any </em>proceeding . . . before a reviewing court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the word \u201cany\u201d in this section indicates a clear legislative intent not to limit the right to intervene in appeals to the Superior Court. This conclusion is supported by the provision in \u00a7 31-249b allowing for \u201c[a]n appeal [to] be taken from the decision of the superior court to the appellate court . . . .\u201d Because the language of \u00a7 31-249c is clear and unambiguous, we conclude that the legislature intended the board to have the right to intervene in appeals to the Superior Court and to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We note that the legislative history can be read to support a more limited scope of the statute to allow the board to intervene in only those cases where its interests are adverse to or more significant than those of the administrator. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 3, 1991 Sess., pp. 967-68. Because our interpretation of \u00a7 31-249c, however, must be guided by the unambiguous language of the statute, which extends the statutory scope to \u201cany proceeding . . . before a reviewing court,\u201d the legislature must alter this construction should our con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>elusion be contrary to legislative intent. <em>Enquist </em>v. <em>General Datacom, </em>218 Conn. 19, 25, 587 A.2d 1029 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In this case, the board has moved to intervene as a defendant. In an appeal before this court, however, the board would be either an appellant or an appellee. Because the board seeks to challenge the Superior Court\u2019s decision, we presume the board intends to intervene as an appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The motion to intervene is granted and the board is granted permission, sua sponte, to file an intervenor-appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\"> The plaintiff\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court alleged that the board \u201cerred in reversing the decision of the appeals referee because the board misapplied the law to the facts of this particular case and its decision is arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of its discretion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
