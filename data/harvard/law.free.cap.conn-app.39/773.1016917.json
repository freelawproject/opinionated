See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 189, 640 A.2d 601 (1994); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>38 Conn. App. 99, 659 A.2d 195, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 920, 661 A.2d 100 (1995); see also <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The habeas court\u2019s dismissal of the petitioner\u2019s writ was predicated on a factual review of the petitioner\u2019s claim and a determination that the petitioner had failed to rebut the \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct f[ell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>223 Conn. 180, 193, 612 A.2d 1161 (1992). The habeas court also found as a fact that it was the petitioner himself who had failed to exercise his appellate rights after having been advised of those rights in open court by both counsel and the trial court, and after the trial court had ordered a sheriff to deliver to the petitioner the written notice of his right to appeal. The petitioner had walked away from the clerk when the clerk had attempted to hand the notice to the petitioner. The notice that was delivered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>the petitioner stated the time limit for appeal and that indigent persons have the right to apply for a waiver of fees, costs and expenses and for the appointment of counsel to prosecute the appeal.
