On October 30, 1991, John Hart reported that his silver and maroon 1989 Chevrolet Astro van, valued at $13,200, had been stolen from outside his place of employment in East Fishkill, New York. The van was a \u201cconversion\u201d model, to which Hart had added a color television, a special console, wood trim, a special paint job and Venetian blinds.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">On November 5, 1991, police officers assigned to an automobile theft task force that operated out of Bridgeport observed the van parked behind the defendant\u2019s residence in Bridgeport. On November 27, several of the police officers returned to the location and one of them noticed that the vehicle identification number (VIN) plate looked as if it had been replaced and that there was a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign on the van. The name Papo and a telephone number were on the sign. While the officer was surveying the van, the defendant emerged from his residence and asked whether there was a problem. After the defendant asserted that he did not own the van, the officer arranged to have the van towed to the Bridgeport police garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">At the garage, an inspection of the van revealed that the ignition had been damaged in such a way that the vehicle could be operated without a key; the rivets on the VIN plate were scratched, indicating that the VIN plate was not factory installed; the driver\u2019s side door lock had been removed; the passenger\u2019s side door panels were torn apart; the exterior of the van was heavily scratched; the decals and emblems indicating a conversion model had been removed; and the windshield was cracked. From inside a compartment beneath the rear seat of the van, the police recovered several documents establishing that Hart was the van\u2019s owner. This fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>was corroborated by a check of the secondary VIN, the location of which is known only by the manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Inside the van\u2019s glove compartment, the police found a registration card and an insurance card in the name of Edwuin Alvino. These documents pertained to a 1985 Chevrolet Astro van, not to the 1989 van owned by Hart. The newly attached VIN also related to the 1985 van. A search of the chain of title of the 1985 van revealed that the defendant had purchased it in 1991 and thereafter sold it to Alvino. Upon further investigation, the police discovered that no one at Alvino\u2019s purported address had any knowledge of him and that the insurance card in his name was fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The defendant, who refers to himself as Papo, later told the police that Alvino asked him to sell the van and that he was unaware of Alvino\u2019s whereabouts. A subsequent search of the defendant\u2019s residence produced a telephone bill that revealed that the defendant\u2019s telephone number was the same as that on the for sale sign. The search also yielded various implements commonly used in the theft of vehicles and alteration of VINs.'</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court twice commented improperly on his failure to testily. He asserts that the comments, which went beyond the \u201cno adverse interest\u201d instruction mandated by General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> violated his rights against self-incrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>nation and to due process pursuant to the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The following facts are pertinent to our analysis of this claim. The defendant did not testify at trial. During closing argument, counsel for the defendant attempted to explain the defendant\u2019s reaction after the prosecutor had asked Hart on direct examination whether the defendant had permission to drive the van. Defense counsel stated: \u201cYou notice that [the defendant] got all upset and you saw me, probably saw me shoosh him. . . . [The prosecutor\u2019s question is] a standard question because obviously if you have permission to have that vehicle, then there\u2019s no crime. . . . But my client doesn\u2019t understand this. You know, he took it literally. \u2018I don\u2019t, you know, I don\u2019t drive that thing.\u2019 \u201d In response to an objection by the state as to the defendant\u2019s purported statement, the trial court instructed the jury: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to disregard any comments made in argument of what [the defendant] said. [The defendant] has not said anything. . . . There\u2019s no evidence in this case about [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The defendant also challenges a remark made by the trial court in its charge to the jury. While reviewing the evidence presented at trial, the court stated: \u201cWhile it is acknowledged that . . . there [are] other uses for [the items seized from the defendant\u2019s residence] . . . there hasn\u2019t been any demonstration as to any use here, except that they were in possession, in the apartment of the defendant at the time the search warrant was executed. So, you have to go over that testimony. Go through that stuff. Take your time. Become familiar with it. Know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>what the claims of the state are in regard to it. <em>Know the claims of the defendant, but they were made in his argument and cross-examination of Detectives Meehan and MaeNamara.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">As a threshold matter, we note that the defendant failed to object at trial to either of the remarks that he now challenges. A review of the case law makes it clear, however, that his claim is nonetheless entitled to plenary review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>206 Conn. 300, 306-307, 537 A.2d 1021 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 71, 327 A.2d 576 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delosantos, </em>13 Conn. App. 386, 391, 536 A.2d 609 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u201cThe fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution forbid comment by the prosecution or the court about a defendant\u2019s failure to testify in his own behalf. <em>[Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1965)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartino, </em>7 Conn. App. 292, 508 A.2d 809 (1986); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>223 Conn. 52, 612 A.2d 755 (1992). The Connecticut legislature has affirmed this constitutional right by mandating that, unless the accused requests otherwise, the court must instruct the jury that it may draw no unfavorable inferences from an accused\u2019s failure to testify. General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b).\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>34 Conn. App. 153, 162, 640 A.2d 1007 (1994).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u201cThe test to determine whether the comment violated the fourteenth amendment is whether a jury would naturally and necessarily understand the remarks to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify. <em>State </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>33 Conn. App. 457, 636 A.2d 860 (1994).\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Turning first to the court\u2019s remarks during the defendant\u2019s closing argument, we conclude that the jury would not \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d have interpreted them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. During closing remarks, counsel for the defendant improperly interjected evidence that had not been admitted at trial \u2014namely, the defendant\u2019s alleged statement that he had never driven the van. Upon objection by the state, the court properly instructed the jury to disregard the statement, as it was not based on any evidence properly in the case. The challenged remarks served to underscore that fact and, in context, were likely understood by the jury to be an explanation of why it must ignore defense counsel\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The defendant also challenges the trial court\u2019s remark in its charge to the jury, where it stated \u201cthe claims of the defendant were made in his argument and cross-examination of Detectives Meehan and MacNamara.\u201d A fair reading of the remark leads us again to conclude that the jury would not \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d have interpreted it as a substantive comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Rather, the jury most likely interpreted the statement as a directive as to where in the evidence the defendant\u2019s arguments could be found. For these reasons, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for judgment of acquittal. He argues that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that the defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt, knew or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>believed that the van in his possession was probably stolen. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u201cIn reviewing a jury verdict that is challenged on the ground of insufficient evidence, we employ a two part analysis. We first review the evidence presented at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts expressly found by the trial court or impliedly found by the jury. We then decide whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the trial court or the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The evidence must be construed in a light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>230 Conn. 686, 692, 646 A.2d 147 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Section 53a-119 (8) provides in part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of larceny by receiving stolen property if he receives, retains, or disposes of stolen property knowing that it has probably been stolen or believing that it has probably been stolen, unless the property is received, retained or disposed of with purpose to restore it to the owner.\u201d In order to obtain a conviction, the state needed to prove (1) that the defendant received, retained or disposed of the van, (2) that the van was stolen and (3) that the defendant knew or believed that the van was probably stolen when he received, retained or disposed of it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 473 A.2d 300 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Taft, </em>25 Conn. App. 149, 154, 593 A.2d 973, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 918, 597 A.2d 343 (1991) (language \u201cunless the property is received, retained or disposed of with purpose to restore it to the owner\u201d does not describe essential element of crime); <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>12 Conn. App. 408, 530 A.2d 1110 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>In this case, there is no dispute on appeal that the defendant retained the van, that the van was stolen property or that it was valued in excess of $10,000. Our inquiry is thus limited to whether the state presented sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew or believed that the van was probably stolen. \u201cOrdinarily, guilty knowledge can be established only through an inference from other proved facts and circumstances. The inference may be drawn if the circumstances are such that a reasonable man of honest intentions, in the situation of the defendant, would have concluded that the property was stolen.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>8 Conn. App. 13, 25, 511 A.2d 348, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 808, 515 A.2d 379 (1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 917, 107 S. Ct. 1370, 94 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u201cAdditionally, we note that possession of recently stolen property \u2018raises a permissible inference of criminal connection with the property, and if no explanation is forthcoming, the inference of criminal connection may be as a principal in the theft, or as a receiver under the receiving statute, depending upon the other facts and circumstances which may be proven.\u2019 State v. <em>Palkimas, </em>153 Conn. 555, 559, 219 A.2d 220 (1966).\u201d Id., 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Our review of the evidence in this case, undertaken in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, reveals a number of facts supporting the inference that the defendant knew or believed that the van had probably been stolen. The police observed the van behind the defendant\u2019s residence less than one week after its theft. At the time of its discovery, the van was in a condition that would indicate to a reasonable person of honest intentions that it had not been acquired by lawful means. Among other things, the van\u2019s ignition had been tampered with, rendering the vehicle operable without a key, the driver\u2019s side door lock had been removed and the YIN plate showed obvious signs of tampering. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>over, the discovery in the defendant\u2019s residence of several implements commonly used in the theft of vehicles supports the inference that the defendant was familiar with the indicia of a stolen vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We conclude, on the basis of the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew or believed that the van had been stolen. The trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In his final claims, both unpreserved, the defendant asserts that the trial court improperly charged the jury when it instructed (1) that \u201c[a] reasonable doubt is a doubt for which you can assign a valid reason\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe law is made to protect society and innocent persons, and not to protect guilty ones.\u201d He maintains that the latter instruction undermined his right to a presumption of innocence and lessened the state\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant seeks review of his claims pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Since the filing of this appeal, our Supreme Court has considered whether instructions identical to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>challenged by the defendant violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>232 Conn. 691, 693 n.5, 657 A.2d 1099 (1995). The court affirmed the line of cases holding that, in the context of a charge that is sound in its entirety, such instructions do not dilute the state\u2019s burden of proof or the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence. Id., 705-706. In light of <em>Ellis, </em>and after reviewing the trial court\u2019s entire charge to the jury, we conclude that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial, as required by the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-11\"> The state charged the defendant by long form information with larceny in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-119 and 53a-122 (a) (3). In its request to charge, the state particularized its allegation to subsection (8) of \u00a7 53a-119. The court subsequently charged the jury only on the elements of larceny in the first degree by receiving stolen property in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-119 (8) and 53a-122 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 (8) provides in relevant part: \u201cReceiving stolen property. A person is guilty of larceny by receiving stolen properly if he receives, retains, or disposes of stolen properly knowing that it has probably been stolen or believing that it has probably been stolen, unless the property is received, retained or disposed of with purpose to restore it to the owner. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of larceny in the first degree when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119 and . . . (3) the property consists of a motor vehicle, the value of which exceeds ten thousand dollars . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 provides: \u201c(a) Any person on trial for crime shall be a competent witness, and at his or her option may testify or refuse to testify upon such trial. The neglect or refusal of an accused party to testify shall not be commented upon by the court or prosecuting official, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">\u201c(b) Unless the accused requests otherwise, the court shall instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify. In cases tried to the court, no unfavorable inferences shall be drawn by the court from the accused\u2019s silence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\"> While the defendant also invokes article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, he has failed to provide an independent analysis of his claim thereunder. Consequently, we limit our review to a consideration of his claim pursuant to the federal constitution. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 140-41 n.16, 646 A.2d 169 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\"> In this case, the trial court complied with the mandate of \u00a7 54-84 (b) by instructing the jury that \u201c[y]ou may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\"> Even if the trial court\u2019s remarks did emphasize the defendant\u2019s failure to testily, they do not necessarily violate the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>485 U.S. 25, 108 S. Ct. 864, 99 L. Ed. 2d 23 (1988), the United States Supreme Court held that a direct comment on the silence of an accused was permitted when made in response to a defense argument. The trial court\u2019s remarks in this case were part of a corrective ruling, necessitated by defense counsel\u2019s improper statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\"> Pursuant to \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (3), the state also needed to prove that the van was valued in excess of $10,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b129-9\"> Under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, the defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error \u201conly if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
