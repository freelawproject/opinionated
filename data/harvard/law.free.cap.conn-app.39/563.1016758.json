The defendant was also convicted of carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35, but does not challenge that conviction on appeal. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) instructed the jury on the issue of self-defense, and (2) admitted into evidence a photograph of the victim taken immediately before she had undergone surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The jury could have reasonably found the following facts. On February 13,1992, the defendant was walking down Cedar Street in New Haven armed with a .45 caliber pistol. According to the defendant, he was carrying the pistol because he had heard that several members of the Island Brothers gang, including Boo Battle, were looking for him. As the defendant approached the intersection of Cedar and Spring Streets, he noticed a car pass by him that resembled the car that Battle drove. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The defendant crossed the intersection and began walking down Spring Street, watching for the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">As he proceeded down Spring Street, the defendant noticed that the car stopped on the opposite side of the street. Three men got out of the car, one of whom the defendant recognized as Battle. The defendant hid behind a tree, pulled out his pistol and took aim at Battle and his companions.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">At that time, the victim, five year old Jasmine Booze, was seated in the front passenger seat of a car driven by her grandmother, Morine Bivens. As the defendant was about to open fire, Bivens\u2019 car- turned left onto Spring Street. Bivens first noticed Battle and his companions running near a building to the left of her car. As Bivens continued to drive along Spring Street, she then saw the defendant, who was standing next to a tree on the right side of her automobile waving his arm up and down. Bivens did not realize that the defendant was brandishing a pistol until she heard gunfire from the right side of her car where the defendant was located. Bivens testified that no other shots were fired prior to those.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">One of the first shots shattered the right front passenger window of Bivens\u2019 car and struck the victim\u2019s face. The victim fell onto her seat, slumping against Bivens. When Bivens realized that her granddaughter had been hit by a bullet and was bleeding, she sped away from the scene. As she drove away down Spring Street, Bivens heard several gunshots, but was unable to pinpoint the direction from which they were fired. The bullet shattered the victim\u2019s jawbone, dislodged several teeth, damaged other teeth and lacerated her right cheek. At trial the defendant presented the affirmative defense of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The defendant first raises two issues concerning the trial court\u2019s instructions on self-defense under General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 53a-19.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the charge on self-defense contained two misstatements of the law, namely, on the definition of \u201cinitial aggressor\u201d and on the \u201cduty to retreat,\u201d which, when taken individually or together, could have misled the jury. The defendant failed either to file a request to charge on self-defense or promptly to take exception to the charge after it was delivered. As a threshold matter, we must first decide whether these issues are properly reviewable by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">This court is not bound to review claims of error in jury instructions if the party raising the claim neither submitted a written request to charge nor excepted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>the charge given by the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 852.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant, however, seeks review under the standard set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), because jury instructions that misstate the statutory defense of self-defense violate a defendant\u2019s fourteenth amendment right to establish a defense. See <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967). Under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40, a defendant cannot prevail on his unpreserved claims unless (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error, (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude, (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a constitutional right, and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We find the record in this case adequate to support review of this claim, which encompasses claims that the trial court\u2019s definition of \u201cinitial aggressor\u201d was incorrect and that its instruction on the \u201cduty to retreat\u201d was also incorrect. These claims apply to both assault charges of which the defendant was convicted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant that this claim is of constitutional magnitude because the fundamental right to establish a defense \u201cincludes proper jury instructions on the elements of self-defense so that a jury may ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>tain whether the state has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was not justified.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>231 Conn. 484, 492-93, 651 A.2d 247 (1994); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The defendant claims that, in the instruction to the jury on self-defense on both charges of assault in the first degree, the trial court made two misstatements of the law and that it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. Because the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s instructions clearly deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to establish a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In the course of its charge, the trial court instructed the jury that: \u201cA defendant is not justified in using physical force on another person, if he is the initial aggressor, <em>that is, the first one to use physical force.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>228 Conn. 335, 338-42, 636 A.2d 782 (1994), the Supreme Court found that a jury instruction defined initial aggressor as the first actor to use physical force was an incorrect statement of the law under \u00a7 53a-19. \u201cRead according to its plain language, and as a whole, doubtlessly \u00a7 53a-19 contemplates that a person may respond with physical force to a reasonably perceived threat of physical force without becoming the initial aggressor and forfeiting the defense of self-defense.\u201d Id., 341. Thus, the trial court\u2019s instruction defining \u201cinitial aggressor\u201d as the first one to use physical force was an incorrect statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Because the trial court\u2019s instruction defining initial aggressor was incorrect, our next inquiry is whether it was reasonably possible that the incorrect definition misled the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 341. Where the claimed error is one of constitutional magnitude, we must determine whether, in light of the charge as a whole, it is reasonably possible that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Utz, </em>201 Conn. 190, 196-97, 513 A.2d 1191 (1986). \u201cIn determining whether the jury was misled, [i]t is well established that [a] charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 493-94. \u201c[T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Leroy, </em>232 Conn. 1, 8, 653 A.2d 161 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>35 Conn. App. 699, 709-10, 647 A.2d 17, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 932, 649 A.2d 254 (1994), this court found that an identical definition of initial aggressor in a charge was not misleading because all of the evidence clearly demonstrated that the defendant was not the first to use physical force. Although the charge was not accurate when tested by the legal principles stated by our Supreme Court, it was not reasonably possible that the instruction, viewed in its entirety, misled the juiy because the question of who was the initial aggressor was not an issue in the case. Conversely, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 342, the same instruction was clearly misleading to the jury because it was undisputed that the defendant was the first to use physical force and the definition of initial aggressor was central to the applicability of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In this case, the factual issue of whether the defendant was the first to use physical force was left for the jury to decide. The jury could have reasonably found that the defendant was the first to use physical force, but that he was defending himself from what he reasonably believed to be the imminent use of physical force. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>These facts are similar to those in <em>Jimenez </em>because the definition of initial aggressor, if the jury believed the defendant was the first to use physical force, would be crucial to his defense of self-defense. It is reasonably possible, therefore, that the incorrect instruction misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The court also instructed the jury that: \u201c[A] defendant is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating. The law does not encourage the use of deadly force and in most circumstances a person <em>must retreat from the perceived harm if they are able to retreat in complete safety.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We conclude that the claim is reviewable and, therefore, we must decide whether the claimed error clearly deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to establish a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The defendant claims that as a result of the trial court\u2019s inaccurate charge to the jury on the duty to retreat, it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. Section 53a-19 provides for the defense of self-defense and sets forth the circumstances justifying the use of physical force. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 53a-19 does impose an objective reasonableness requirement, providing in relevant part that \u201cdeadly physical force may not be used unless the actor reasonably believes that such other person is (1) using or about to use deadly physical force, or (2) inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.\u201d Subsection (b) of that statute, which specifically sets out the duty to retreat, however, imposes only a subjective requirement. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 53a-19 provides in part that a person is not justified in using deadly physical force \u201cif he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety (1) by retreating . . . .\u201d \u201cThe statute requires <em>both </em>that a retreat in complete safety be available <em>and </em>that the defendant know of it. \u2018The self-defense statute, i.e., Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 . . . focuses on the person . . . claiming self-defense. It focuses on what <em>he </em>reasonably believes under the circumstances and presents a question of fact [as to whether a safe retreat was available and whether he knew of it]. . . . This statutory emphasis upon the defendant further demonstrates the function of the jury in their evaluation of the self-defense claim.\u2019 . . . \u2018[Section] 53a-19 (b) requires recourse to retreat in lieu of the use of physical force only when the actor himself \u201cknows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety . . . \u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>209 Conn. 34, 46, 547 A.2d 534 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In instructing the jury concerning the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat, the trial court gave the following charge: \u201cIn addition to the three exceptions that I just stated, a defendant is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another if he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating. The law does not encourage the use of deadly force and in most circumstances a person must retreat from their perceived harm <em>if they are able </em>to retreat with complete safety.\u201d (Emphasis added.) These words incorrectly suggested that the statute permitted the jury to measure the defendant\u2019s knowledge of his ability to retreat according to an objective standard of reasonableness rather than the subjective standard of the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 46. The parties do not dispute the fact that the jury was charged in this manner. \u201cThe parties do disagree, however, about whether these statements, when viewed in the light of the trial court\u2019s other instructions regarding the duty to retreat and the charge as a whole, and viewed in the context of the contested facts of the case, made it reasonably possible that the jury was misled.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The state argues that the trial court\u2019s misstatements were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because they were preceded and followed by correct statements of law. The state proposes that the trial court\u2019s improper references to an objective standard were cured by the remainder of the charge on the duty to retreat. We disagree. In accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 496, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s subsequent use of the proper standard, \u201cat best, further muddied the jury\u2019s understanding of the proper subjective standard and, at worst, suggested to the jury that it could reject the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense\u201d if it found that he was able \u201cbut did not actually know that he could have avoided using deadly physical force in complete safety by retreating.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The state further argues that the trial court\u2019s improper charge concerning the duty to retreat was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 34, which held that the trial court\u2019s improper injection of an objective standard into its instructions on the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat under the self-defense statute was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because \u201c \u2018[t]he principal factual issues . . . were not classically dependent upon [the subtleties of the law of self-defense] for their proof, as is true in cases where the principal factual issue is the . . . [defendant\u2019s subjective knowledge of the availability of safe escape].\u2019 \u201d Id., 47-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The case at hand is distinguishable from <em>Quintana </em>and is similar to <em>Ash, </em>in that the present case \u201chingefs] substantially on whether the defendant, at some point either prior to or during the fatal altercation, failed to retreat within the meaning of the self-defense statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 498. <em>In State v. Quintana, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 47-48, the jury convicted the defendant of felony murder after being presented with two different theories on why the defendant stabbed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>victim. The defendant\u2019s witness had testified that the defendant had stabbed the victim in self-defense to thwart the victim\u2019s unprovoked attack. Id., 47. Another witness contradicted this testimony, claiming that the defendant had stated that he used the knife while robbing the victim. Id. The Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s verdict can fairly be read to indicate a choice between these two inconsistent versions of the stabbing . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. Because the principal factual issues of the present case are dependent on the law of self-defense, <em>Quintana </em>is not dispositive of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The facts presented at trial raised a significant question about whether the defendant subjectively knew he could avoid the use of force with complete safety by retreating. The trial court\u2019s charge on this question, which instructed the jury that if it found the defendant could objectively have effected his retreat in complete safety as soon as Battle\u2019s confederate opened fire, precluded the defendant from claiming self-defense. We conclude that it was reasonably possible that the trial court\u2019s instructions could have misled the jury by barring it from considering the crucial factor of whether the defendant subjectively knew he could retreat in complete safety when Battle\u2019s confederate started shooting. In addition, we conclude when the charge on self-defense is taken as a whole in light of the facts of this case, the misstatement of the law on initial aggressor and the duty to retreat make it reasonably possible that the jury was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court, improperly admitted into evidence a photograph of the victim\u2019s gunshot wounds taken prior to reconstructive surgery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\u201cThe trial court exercises a broad discretion in admitting such evidence, and its determination will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>disturbed on appeal unless a clear abuse of that discretion is shown. <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 700-701, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>[174 Conn. 118, 123, 384 A.2d 347 (1977)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>183 Conn. 394, 408, 439 A.2d 387 (1981). \u201cThe great weight of authority is that photographs, even though gruesome, are admissible in evidence when otherwise properly admitted if they have a reasonable tendency to prove or disprove a material fact in issue or shed some light on some material inquiry. Note, 73 A.L.R.2d 769, 787. A photograph, the tendency of which may be to prejudice the jury, may be admitted in evidence if, in the sound discretion of the court, its value as evidence outweighs its possible prejudicial effect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 381, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>supra, 407. The test for determining the admissibility of challenged evidence is not whether the potentially inflammatory photographic evidence is essential to the prosecution\u2019s case, but rather whether it is relevant to the prosecution\u2019s case. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 381. Upon an objection from the defendant, the prosecution must show that the photographic evidence offered is relevant. Id., 382. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling that the photograph was relevant as to whether the victim sustained a serious physical injury and that its probative value on that issue outweighed any possible prejudicial effect was not an abuse of discretion. The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, that the photograph should not have been admitted, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The judgment is reversed as to the conviction of two counts of assault in the first degree and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">In this opinion LANDAU, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument; or . . .

I agree that the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable under the precepts of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), because there is an adequate record to review the claim and because the claim is of constitutional magnitude. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>33 Conn. App. 763, 769, 638 A.2d 1084, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 913, 642 A.2d 1209 (1994). An improper instruction as to an element of a defense is a constitutional deprivation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>supra, 493. I do not agree, however, that the state has failed to demonstrate the harmlessness of the alleged instruction, and conclude, therefore, that the defendant cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\u201c[Tjhe question of harmlessness of a jury instruction is properly gauged by reference to both the language of the entire charge and the evidence in the case . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.)

The instruction in this case, however, differs from that given in <em>Ash. </em>In <em>Ash, </em>the only colorable subjective test employed in the charge was whether the defendant \u201ccould perceive\u201d that physical force could be avoided. The Supreme Court found those words to be insufficient to allow the jury to evaluate the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense properly. In the present case, the trial court made numerous references to the situation from the subjective point of view of the defendant. The court stated that the defendant\u2019s belief of the situation was to be tested by what a \u201creasonable person\u201d would have believed \u201cunder the circumstances from the perspective of the defendant\u201d and that \u201cthe danger or apparent danger claimed by the defendant <em>is to be determined from his standpoint at the time of the incident </em>considering all the existing circumstances. The act leading to the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense need not be an actual threat or assault but only some act that a reasonable person <em>seeing it from the defendant\u2019s perspective </em>would reasonably believe to be an assault or threat.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court further stated that \u201ca defendant is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if <em>he knows </em>that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court\u2019s emphasis throughout its charge was on the subjective test, and I would not reverse the conviction on the ground that the jury was misled by the charge on the duty to retreat.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>The defendant also claims that the jury was misled by one sentence of the charge that improperly instructed the jury that the \u201cdefendant is not justified in using physical force on another person if he is the initial aggressor, that is, the first person to use physical force.\u201d It was improper because the first person to use physical force is not necessarily, but may be, the initial aggressor within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (c). <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>228 Conn. 335, 342-43, 636 A.2d 782 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>35 Conn. App. 699, 709, 647 A.2d 17, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 932, 649 A.2d 254 (1994). Although the statement quoted previously was incorrect, it is not reasonably possible that it misled the jury. After the statement, the court then twice instructed the jury \u201cthat a person is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person to defend himself from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force and he may use such degree of force which he reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose.\u201d The words \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cimminent use\u201d of physical force as employed in the instruction make it clear that the defendant could either believe that he needed to use force where none had yet been employed against him or that he needed to use force because force had already been used against him, and still be entitled to the defense of self-defense. The court thus clarified that being the first to use physical force is not the paramount factor in the determination of who was the initial aggressor. Instead, the paramount factor is whether the use of physical force by the defendant was reasonable regardless of which person struck the initial blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 338, the court specifically instructed the jury that if it found that the defendant was the first to use physical force, then the state would have disproved the defense of self-defense. In <em>Jimenez, </em>the undisputed facts showed that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>was the first to use physical force and the defendant himself testified that he was the first to use physical force. Upon review of the claim, which had been preserved, the Supreme Court held that a new trial was necessary because the instruction specifically told the jury not to consider the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense if the jury concluded, in accordance with the undisputed facts, that the defendant was the first to use physical force. Id., 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In the present case, the court did not instruct the jury that if it found that the defendant was the first to use physical force, then the state would have disproved the defense of self-defense. The court left it to the jury to decide if the defendant was the initial aggressor. Also, it was not undisputed that the defendant was the first to shoot. In fact, the defendant\u2019s statement was that someone shot at him without provocation and that it was only then that he returned a shot. I would not conclude, therefore, that <em>Jimenez </em>applies and would not conclude that the instruction as to initial aggressor, when read as a whole, misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Reviewing the charge as a whole, I believe there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled and I would uphold the convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\"> I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that it was not improper to admit the victim\u2019s photograph into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\"> The majority does not discuss and the parties have not raised the issue of whether the defendant could be convicted of both General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (3), respectively. Because the statutory definition of intentional and reckless are mutually exclusive and inconsistent, a defendant usually cannot be guilty of two crimes arising out of the same act that require such mutually exclusive states of mind as essential elements. <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>216 Conn. 585, 594, 583 A.2d 896, on appeal after remand, 218 Conn. 747, 591 A.2d 813 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Although the defendant was convicted of violating \u00a7 53a-59 (a) under both subdivision (1), a crime requiring intent, and subdivision (3), a crime requiring an extreme indifference to human life and recklessness, both convictions should be upheld because the jury could find that the defendant intended to cause serious physical irqury to Boo Battle, while <em>simultaneously </em>engaging in reckless conduct by shooting into a public street. See <em>State v. Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 314, 630 A.2d 593 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
