On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly (1) increased his child support obligation in response to the plaintiffs motion, (2) retroactively modified a prior judge\u2019s order concerning child support payments, and (3) proceeded with the hearing on the plaintiffs motion in the absence of sworn affidavits from both parties. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s arguments and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The record reveals the following facts. On June 4, 1991, the plaintiff brought this action seeking the dissolution of her fifteen year marriage to the defendant. The trial in this matter was held on March 10, 1992, and by decision dated March 18, 1992, the trial court, <em>Karazin, J., </em>rendered judgment dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage. At the time of the dissolution, the trial court ordered, inter alia, the continuation of a prior order of unallocated alimony and child support of $250 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">On May 12, 1993, the parties appeared in court on the plaintiffs motion for emergency financial relief. After a hearing on the motion, the trial court, <em>Moran, J., </em>ordered the defendant to pay $595 per week to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>plaintiff as child support effective as of that date. On June 8, 1993, Judge Moran entered further orders continuing the child support at $595 per week and modifying the alimony award to $365 per week, effective immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to modify the child support, dated September 14, 1993, which is the subject of this appeal. In that motion, the plaintiff requested that her award of child support be increased to $652 per week because the defendant had \u201cconsistently and substantially understated his net monthly income and overstated his federal tax withholding for the purpose of defrauding his children of the support to which they are entitled under the Child Support Guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A hearing was held on the motion on November 17, 1993. At the conclusion of this hearing, the trial court, <em>Petroni, J., </em>ordered that for the fourteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>week period between the date of Judge Moran\u2019s order, May 12, 1993, through August 31, 1993, the defendant was required, pursuant to the child support guidelines, to pay child support in the amount of $652 rather than the $595 that originally had been ordered. The trial court therefore ordered that the difference of $57 be paid and added to the defendant\u2019s support obligation. The trial court further ordered, on the basis of the documentation submitted at the hearing, that as of the date of the modification hearing, the defendant\u2019s child support obligation be increased to $670 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The defendant first argues that the trial court improperly increased his child support obligation in response to the plaintiffs motion to modify. Specifically, the defendant argues that neither the motion to modify nor the trial court\u2019s decision was based on the criteria for modification set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> namely, a substantial change of circumstances or a deviation from the child support guidelines. According to the defendant, if there was an error in Judge Moran\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>support order, the plaintiff should have filed a motion to open the judgment within four months of the date of the judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since the plaintiff did not do this, the defendant argues that the plaintiff was required to prove fraud in order to justify opening the judgment. Because the court did not make a finding of fraud, the defendant therefore argues that it had no authority to modify the support order since the motion was filed more than four months after the date of Judge Moran\u2019s order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree with the defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The plaintiffs motion to modify alleged that the defendant\u2019s sworn statements concerning his alleged federal tax withholding were false. At oral argument on the motion, the plaintiff stated that she was alleging fraud.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the hearing on the motion, and after consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ering the evidence, Judge Petroni, without making a finding of fraud, concluded that the defendant had improperly determined his tax exemptions, resulting in a lesser amount of child support due for the four minor children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court therefore modified the award so that it complied with the standard established by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>child support guidelines. We conclude that the court acted within its discretion in so ordering.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u201cCourts have intrinsic powers, independent of statutory provisions authorizing the opening of judgments, to vacate any judgment obtained by fraud, duress or mutual mistake.\u201d <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>224 Conn. 263, 283, 618 A.2d 1 (1992). In the present case, we conclude that Judge Petroni properly vacated Judge Moran\u2019s decision on the ground of mutual mistake.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u201cThe support guidelines create a rebuttable presumption that the amount of support calculated thereunder is the appropriate amount of support to be ordered by the court. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215b. This presumption can be rebutted only if the trial court finds, on the record, that it would be inequitable or inappropriate to apply the guidelines because of evidence satisfying one of the guidelines deviation criteria.\u201d <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Feliciano, </em>37 Conn. App. 856, 858-59, 658 A.2d 141, cert. granted, 234 Conn. 915, 661 A.2d 96 (1995); see <em>Favrow </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>222 Conn. 699, 712-13, 610 A.2d 1267 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">At oral argument before this court, <em>the defendant conceded that, taking judicial notice of the child support guidelines in effect at the time, and using the defendant\u2019s affidavit submitted to the court for the May 12,1993 hearing, the appropriate amount of child support equals $652. </em>This is the amount that Judge Petroni ordered so as to correct what he considered the defendant\u2019s improper conduct in claiming his tax exemptions. The record supports the conclusion that Judge Petroni found that a mutual mistake had been committed in the prior financial orders entered by Judge Moran due to the format of the defendant\u2019s affidavit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The record further supports the conclusion that Judge Petroni corrected the parties\u2019 mutual mistake and increased the defendant\u2019s required payments to comply with the standard required by the child support guidelines. Considering the policy of the child support guidelines, we conclude that Judge Petroni properly corrected the mathematical error in Judge Moran\u2019s decision and properly increased the defendant\u2019s support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The defendant next argues that Judge Petroni lacked the authority, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86, to modify retroactively Judge Moran\u2019s order concerning support payments. We conclude, however, that the trial court did not retroactively modify the support order and, therefore, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">We agree with the defendant that retroactive modification of a support order is prohibited. See <em>Sanchione </em>v. Sanchione, 173 Conn. 397, 406, 378 A.2d 522 (1977). We previously concluded, however, that Judge Petroni acted within his discretion in correcting the parties\u2019 mutual mistake in the support order based on the incorrect information submitted by the defendant at the May 12, 1993 hearing. The court, upon discovering the mistake, entered the order that was mandated by the child support guidelines effective as of the date of the original order. We conclude that this correction does not amount to a retroactive modification of the support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Judge Petroni further ordered a prospective modification of the defendant\u2019s support obligation to $670 per week based on evidence that his weekly salary had increased from $1370 to $1430. This order likewise does not violate the prohibition against retroactive modification of a support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly proceeded with a hearing on the plaintiffs motion in the absence of sworn financial affidavits from both parties pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 463.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues in response that the purpose of her motion was not to effect a change in circumstances but rather was intended to conform the support order to the true income of the defendant. She therefore argues that the trial court acted within its discretion in not requiring her to file a new financial affidavit. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In <em>Glinski </em>v. <em>Glinski, </em>26 Conn. App. 617, 623, 602 A.2d 1070 (1992), we noted that \u201c\u00a7 463 specifically allows a court to render permanent financial orders in the absence of the opposing party\u2019s financial affidavit. See <em>Sachs </em>v. <em>Sachs, </em>22 Conn. App. 410, 419, 578 A.2d 649, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 815, 580 A.2d 60 (1990).\u201d We conclude, in the circumstances of this case, that it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to consider the plaintiff\u2019s motion based on the documentation that was already before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\"> The plaintiffs motion asserted the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">\u201c1. Child support for the four (4) minor children of this marriage . . . was set by this Court <em>(Moran, J.~) </em>earlier this year at $595 per week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">\u201c2. The said order was based on financial affidavits submitted by the defendant wherein the defendant swore that $913 per month was being deducted from his gross pay for federal taxes. Said affidavits were submitted to this court on three separate occasions in 1993, and they are dated April 22, 1993, and July 12, 1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">\u201c3. Based upon his aforesaid sworn statement concerning his alleged federal tax withholding, the defendant swore to this court on April 22, 1993, that his total net monthly income was $5,170. On the same basis, the defendant swore on July 12, 1993, that his total net monthly income was $4,873. These statements were false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">\u201c4. On September 7,1993, pursuant to the plaintiffs subpoena, the defendant produced in this court his pay stubs for the period of May 1, 1993 to September 1,1993. Those pay stubs were marked as exhibits for the plaintiff at the hearing conducted that day before Judge Moran on the plaintiffs motion for contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">\u201c5. The said pay stubs establish that at all times in the months of May through August, 1993, the federal tax deductions from the defendant\u2019s pay have been only $160.65 per month in each and every month of that time period. The said pay stubs further establish that the defendant\u2019s average <em>net </em>monthly pay for the months of May through August, 1993, was $5,934.85.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification, any final order for the periodic payment of permanent alimony or support or an order for alimony or support pendente lite may at any time thereafter be continued, set aside, altered or modified by said court upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or upon a showing that the final order for child support substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, unless there was a specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any deviation of less than fifteen per cent from the child support guidelines is not substantial and any deviation of fifteen per cent or more from the guidelines is substantial. ...

On June 8, 1993, the court, in ruling on the plaintiffs motion to modify support and alimony dated April 16,1993, continued the child support order at $595 per week and modified the alimony award to $365 per week. At oral argument on the plaintiffs motion on November 17, 1993, her counsel indicated that she sought to modify the order of May 12, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b286-9\"> The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">\u201cMr. Williams [Plaintiffs Counsel]: It is my contention that when Judge Moran entered his support order earlier this year he did so upon the basis of inaccurate statements by the defendant about . . . the nature of his withholding and his net pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">\u201cThe Court: So you are saying there was either an intentional fraud or a negligent act, something in negligence that was submitted at that time upon which orders were based?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">\u201cMr. Williams: That\u2019s right, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">* 0! *</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">\u201cMr. Williams: We are not alleging a material change in circumstances.
