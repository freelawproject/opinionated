The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) distributed marital property between the parties by (a) failing to award her any share of the plaintiffs medical practice, pension or profit sharing plan, (b) giving the plaintiff unbridled discretion in selling the marital residence, and (c) ordering the plaintiff to be compensated for payments on the mortgage of the marital residence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>during the pendente lite period; (2) failed to award her alimony for a sufficient period of time; (3) ordered the parties to use marital property to establish a trust fund for the education of the minor children; (4) ordered her to obtain and maintain life insurance policies in the amount of $600,000; (5) delegated postjudgment authority to the attorney for the minor children; and (6) failed to award her attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The defendant\u2019s first set of claims involves the distribution of marital property. The defendant first contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award her any share of the plaintiffs medical practice, pension or profit sharing plan. She argues that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to take into consideration her contributions as a homemaker and as the primary caretaker of the minor children. The defendant also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in giving the plaintiff sole authority to determine the price at which the marital residence would be sold, and in crediting the plaintiff for pendente lite mortgage payments on the marital residence. She argues that these orders are inequitable and could influence her overall financial award.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">A trial court is accorded wide discretion in determining the proper allocation of the assets of the parties in a dissolution proceeding. <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Rummel, </em>33 Conn. App. 214, 220, 635 A.2d 295 (1993); <em>Siracusa </em>v. <em>Siracusa, </em>30 Conn. App. 560, 567-68, 621 A.2d 309 (1993). This discretion, however, must be exercised in conformity with General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>trial court to consider several enumerated factors, including nonmonetary contributions of the parties, in making assignments of marital property. <em>Siracusa </em>v. <em>Siracusa, </em>supra, 567; <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>13 Conn. App. 300, 311, 536 A.2d 978, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 806, 540 A.2d 374 (1988). While the trial court is required to consider all the enumerated statutory factors, it \u201cneed not give each factor equal weight ... or recite the statutory criteria that it considered in making its decision or make express findings as to each statutory factor.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Siracusa </em>v. <em>Siracusa, </em>supra, 567. As long as our review of the record reveals that the trial court considered all the statutory factors, we will not reverse the orders of the trial court unless there has been an abuse of discretion, or unless the findings of the trial court have no reasonable basis in the facts. Id., 566. In addition, it is the appellant\u2019s duty to demonstrate that the trial court failed to exercise its discretion in accordance with the law. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We conclude that the trial court considered all of the required factors in making orders concerning the distribution of marital property in this case. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court expressly found that the plaintiffs medical practice \u201cwas created, developed and operated solely by the plaintiff,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll assets of the parties with the exception of certain pension and retirement plans in the defendant\u2019s name, were obtained through the practice of his profession.\u201d The trial court also considered the defendant\u2019s work history, the presence of domestic help in the home, and other evidence of how the defendant elected to spend her time. We conclude that the trial court did consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>nonmonetary contributions of the defendant, as well as the other factors enumerated in \u00a7 46b-81 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The order to allow the plaintiff to retain his practice, pension and profit sharing plan should be viewed in the context of its place among all the orders distributing the assets of the marriage. In the context of the entire property distribution scheme, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision not to award the defendant any part of the plaintiffs medical practice, pension and profit sharing plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Likewise, we conclude that the statutory factors were considered and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its orders relating to the division of the parties\u2019 real property. In distributing the real property and the assets therefrom, the trial court awarded the defendant the residential property where she resided with the parties\u2019 children. The defendant was also awarded one half of the proceeds of the sale of both the marital residence and a condominium in Clinton. The plaintiff was awarded the other half of the proceeds from the marital residence and the condominium, in addition to the office condominium in which his practice was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The defendant does not challenge any of these orders, but claims that the trial court improperly gave the plaintiff sole authority to determine the sale price of the marital residence. An order giving one party the authority to sell marital property can be fair and reasonable. Such an order avoids possible conflict between the parties, which could result in one of the parties thwarting the orders of the court. Thus, it is not error per se that the trial court ordered that the plaintiff would have sole authority in the sale of the house. The defendant has not convinced us that the trial court abused its discretion in entering this order. See <em>Siracusa </em>v. <em>Sira-cusa, </em>supra, 30 Conn. App. 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The defendant also challenges the trial court\u2019s order that, before the proceeds from the sale of the marital residence were divided, the plaintiff would be credited for the reduction in the balance of the mortgage during the pendente lite period. In November, 1992, in response to the defendant\u2019s motion for custody, support and alimony pendente lite, the trial court ordered the plaintiff to make the mortgage payments on the marital residence where the defendant continued to reside. In the dissolution decree, the trial court ordered that after the marital property was sold, the plaintiff should be credited with the amount he paid on the mortgage balance pursuant to the pendente lite order. Because the order constitutes a retroactive modification of a pendente lite support order, it is impermissible. <em>Trella </em>v. <em>Trella, </em>24 Conn. App. 219, 221-23, 587 A.2d 162, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 902, 593 A.2d 132 (1991); <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Weinstein, </em>18 Conn. App. 622, 640-41, 561 A.2d 443 (1989). Accordingly, this order must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to award her alimony for a period of time sufficient to allow her to become fully self-supporting. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">At the time of the dissolution decree, the trial court found that the plaintiff, a dermatologist in private practice, had the ability to earn $344,318 per year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court found that the defendant at that time was netting $454 per week as a resident in psychiatry and that the residency was scheduled to end in 1994. The trial court projected that upon completing her residency, the defendant would be able to earn approximately $140,000 per year as a full-time psychiatrist. The trial court also found that if she instead chose to utilize her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>training in radiology the defendant could earn approximately $422,005 per year. The trial court ordered the plaintiff to pay alimony in the amount of $1200 per week for the first year, $1100 per week for the second year, and $750 per week for the third year, after which time the alimony payments would cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">As in the distribution of marital assets, the trial court is afforded broad discretion in making awards of alimony. <em>Askinazi </em>v. <em>Askinazi, </em>34 Conn. App. 328, 330-31, 641 A.2d 413 (1994). Although this discretion must be exercised after consideration of the factors enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we will \u201cindulge every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s action . . . .\u201d Id., 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">It is clear from the memorandum of decision that the trial court considered all the appropriate statutory factors in making the award of alimony. The defendant contends, nonetheless, that it will take her longer than the three years during which alimony was awarded to complete her residency and to establish a psychiatric practice capable of supporting herself and the children, and that she should not be expected to secure full-time employment or develop a full-time practice until her youngest child becomes a teenager.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The trial court noted in its decision that it was basing the alimony award on the defendant\u2019s earning capacity, and not necessarily on her stated desires regarding employment. This is a permissible rationale for an alimony award. <em>Vandal </em>v. Vandal, 31 Conn. App. 561, 566, 626 A.2d 784 (1993). Although the defendant testified that she wanted to work only part-time in order to devote time to her children, the trial court did not find her testimony credible, noting that the defendant\u2019s schedule at the time of the judgment involved leaving her house at 8 a.m. and returning at 6 p.m. The children were cared for by a housekeeper or a babysitter while the defendant was working. Thus, the alimony award fashioned by the court provided an opportunity for the defendant, by allowing her to complete her residency and to develop a practice, to realize a standard of living similar to that achieved during the parties\u2019 marriage. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in making this award. See <em>Wolfburg </em>v. <em>Wolfburg, </em>27 Conn. App. 396, 400, 606 A.2d 48 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court lacked authority to order the parties to utilize marital property to establish a trust fund for the education of the minor children. This claim concerns the following order of the trial court at the time of the judgment of dissolution: \u201cStock currently in the marital estate designated as the Raymond James Account in the aggregate amount of $123,000 shall be designated as the children\u2019s property in trust for educational expenses. . . . The stock shall be transferred at the time of the divorce as a gift to the trust to be administered by a trustee mutually acceptable to the parties. Each child\u2019s trust shall terminate one month prior to the child\u2019s eighteenth (18th) birthday and the monies distributed to the child. This trust is hereby set up by judicial decree.\u201d The defendant argues that through this order the trial court impermissibly assigned marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>property to individuals other than the parties to the marriage. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Section 46b-81 (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> empowers the trial court in a dissolution action to assign any part of the marital estate to either of the parties and explicitly authorizes the trial court to pass title to <em>real property </em>to either party or to a third person. There is no such authorization concerning the disposition of other forms of marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">We construe statutes in accordance with their plain, unambiguous language. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986). We find no ambiguity in the language of \u00a7 46b-81 (a). Accordingly, we interpret the statute to mean that marital property other than real property can be assigned only to the parties to the marriage. Therefore, an award of marital property to the children of the marriage is beyond the authority of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The plaintiff and the counsel for the minor children urge us to find that in this case, the trust fund is not an award of property to the minor children but a form of child support, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to ensure that the education of the children will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>paid for by the parties. The plaintiff and counsel for the minor children suggest that this case is controlled by <em>Louney v. Louney, </em>13 Conn. App. 270, 535 A.2d 1318 (1988), in which this court upheld the order of the trial court establishing a trust fund for the benefit of the minor children of the marriage. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In <em>Louney, </em>the trial court ordered that the wife act as trustee and utilize funds from revocable joint accounts held by the parties\u2019 children with their mother for the education of the children. The court concluded that \u201cthis portion of the court\u2019s order can reasonably be understood as providing for the support and maintenance of the children . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 274-75. The present case cannot be analogized to <em>Louney. </em>The trial court here did not order the parties to use the Raymond James account for the support of the children. The trial court expressly ordered that the funds in the trust account \u201cshall be designated as the children\u2019s property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The trial court was without authority to transfer marital property to the children of the marriage. Therefore, we conclude that the court acted outside the scope of its authority in ordering that the Raymond James account be designated as the property of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s claims that the trial court improperly ordered that she maintain life insurance policies in the combined amount of $600,000 with the parties\u2019 three children named as equal beneficiaries. At the time of the dissolution, the defendant had a life insurance policy in the amount of $100,000. The defendant argues that because the trial court did not hear any evidence on her ability to obtain and pay for policies in the amount of $600,000, there was no basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>on which the trial court could reasonably make such an order. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">This claim is controlled by our decision in <em>Michel </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>31 Conn. App. 338, 624 A.2d 914 (1993). In <em>Michel, </em>we explained that when the trial court orders a party to maintain life insurance as part of a dissolution action \u201cwithout any evidence whatsoever of the cost or the availability of such life insurance,\u201d such action constitutes an abuse of discretion. Id., 341. The most obvious problem with ordering a party to obtain and maintain life insurance without such evidence is that the \u201cthe trial court [may have] entered an order with which the [defendant] may not be able to comply.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The plaintiff argues that the decision in <em>Michel </em>should not control because in that case, the party ordered to obtain and maintain a life insurance policy had no policy at the time of the dissolution, and in the present case, the defendant had a policy, albeit in a lesser amount. We find this argument unavailing. Because the trial court ordered the defendant to obtain and maintain three $200,000 policies on her life, naming each of the minor children as equal beneficiaries thereon, when she had only one $100,000 policy, the logic of <em>Michel </em>directly applies to this case. Not only may it be impossible for the defendant to afford the increased coverage, but it is also possible that \u201c[w]ithout knowing the cost of such insurance, the trial court [may have] entered other financial orders that may be inappropriate, that is, too high or too low depending on the funds required to obtain such insurance.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Without evidence as to the availability and cost to the defendant of acquiring $600,000 worth of life insurance, the trial court did not have a reasonable basis for ordering that the defendant obtain such policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court acted outside the scope of its authority by designating post-judgment authority concerning the education of the parties\u2019 daughter to the attorney for the children. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">While the defendant is correct in noting that the trial court cannot vest the attorney for the children with any postjudgment decision-making authority; <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Weinstein, </em>18 Conn. App. 622, 628-29, 561 A.2d 443 (1989); the defendant is incorrect in arguing that that is what occurred in this case. The trial court ordered that in the event of a disagreement between the parties concerning whether their daughter would attend boarding school, the attorney for the children would talk to their daughter and prepare a report for the trial court regarding the daughter\u2019s preference.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This order is within the scope of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-54 (c), which provides that counsel for a minor child \u201cshall be heard on all matters pertaining to the interests of any child, including the . . . education ... of the child, so long as the court deems such representation to be in the best interests of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">This case can be distinguished from <em>Weinstein </em>because in that case, the trial court ordered the attorney for the child to mediate disputes between the parties, to approve certain expenses to be shared between the parties, and to select the evening of the week that the plaintiff would be allowed to see the children. Thus, the orders in <em>Weinstein </em>\u201camounted to an improper dele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>gation of [the trial court\u2019s] judicial function.\u201d Id., 629. In the present case, the trial court merely ordered the attorney for the children to perform duties in accordance with \u00a7 46b-54 (c), and did not attempt to delegate the judicial role. The defendant cannot succeed on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly failed to order the plaintiff to pay her attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The award of counsel fees in a dissolution action, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62, is normally left to the broad discretion of the trial court. <em>Vandal </em>v. <em>Vandal, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 568. In the absence of a clear abuse of that discretion we will allow the order of the trial court to stand. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bieluch, </em>32 Conn. App. 537, 544, 629 A.2d 1175, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 910, 635 A.2d 1229 (1993). We do not find any evidence that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to order the plaintiff to pay the defendant\u2019s counsel and expert witness fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Because we find that three of the trial court\u2019s marital property distribution orders were improper, it is necessary to remand the case for reconsideration of all the financial matters. <em>Michel </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 341. This is so \u201c[b]ecause the financial orders in an action for dissolution of marriage are of necessity interwoven\u201d and constitute \u201c \u2018a carefully crafted mosaic.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Ehrenkranz </em>v. <em>Ehrenkranz, </em>2 Conn. App. 416, 424, 479 A.2d 826 (1984); see also <em>Sunbury </em>v. <em>Sunbury, </em>210 Conn. 170, 175, 553 A.2d 612 (1989). When we disrupt a single tile in this mosaic, we place in doubt the propriety of other financial orders that the trial court may have deemed equitable in relation to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>entire distribution scheme. <em>Sunbury </em>v. <em>Sunbury, </em>supra, 173-75. Although the trial court may not find it necessary to disturb other financial orders to eliminate the improper modification of the pendente lite mortgage payments, to distribute appropriately the funds from the Raymond James account, or to enter new orders concerning the defendant\u2019s life insurance, it must, nevertheless, have the opportunity to exercise its discretion as to all the financial matters in light of our reversal on these three claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The judgment of the trial court dissolving the marriage and the child custody and visitation orders are affirmed; the case is remanded for reconsideration of all the financial matters, including property distribution, alimony, child support and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c) provides: \u201cIn fixing the nature and value of the property, if any, to be assigned, the court, after hearing the witnesses, if any, of each party, except as provided in subsection (a) of section 46b-51, shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the annulment, dissolution of the marriage or legal separation, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income.
