The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, ruling that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>immune from liability pursuant to the Connecticut Recreational Land Use Act, General Statutes \u00a7 52-557\u00cd et seq.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted the motions for summary judgment because (1) the act as applied to the plaintiff violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>article first, \u00a7 10, of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) the association owed a duty to the plaintiff that is independent of the act, and (3) Dixon and the town failed to make the premises \u201cavailable to the public,\u201d and, therefore, are not entitled to statutory immunity. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u201cThe standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a summary judgment motion is well established. Practice Book \u00a7 384 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Carriage Lane Associates, </em>219 Conn. 772, 780-81, 595 A.2d 334 (1991); <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>219 Conn. 644, 650, 594 A.2d 952 (1991). Although the party seeking summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>judgment has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact; <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980); a party opposing summary judgment must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact, together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 380, 381; <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>[192 Conn. 451, 455, 472 A.2d 1257 (1984)]. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Town Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>176 Conn. 304, 309, 407 A.2d 971 (1978). <em>Strada </em>v. <em>Connecticut Newspapers, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 313, 317, 477 A.2d 1005 (1984). The test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts. <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>186 Conn. 632, 647, 443 A.2d 471 (1982).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Milford Savings Banke v. Roina, </em>38 Conn. App. 240, 243-44, 659 A.2d 1226 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The facts, as viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, are as follows. On June 9, 1986, the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference (conference)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> held a championship tennis tournament for high school girls at the Wilton High School tennis courts. No fee was charged for the use of the tennis courts. During the tennis tournament, the plaintiff, a competitor in the tournament, fell because of an alleged defect in the courts and sustained serious injuries to her knee and ankle. In her personal injury action, the plaintiff alleged that the proximate cause of her injuries was the negligence of Dixon and his staff in maintaining the tennis courts and the negligence of the association in selecting the allegedly faulty court for the tournament.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We first address the plaintiffs claim that the recreational use statute violates the \u201copen courts\u201d provision of article first, \u00a7 10, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She asserts that, \u201c[i]f viewed as a limitation on the right to redress for an injury caused by negligence, the restriction under consideration stands contrary to the mandate of article first, \u00a7 10, and thus must fall.\u201d <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 284, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">This court previously rejected a similar constitutional attack on the recreational use statute in <em>Genco </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>7 Conn. App. 164, 508 A.2d 58 (1986). In <em>Genco, </em>we concluded that the statute \u201cdoes not restrict the right to redress for an actionable injury but, rather, redefines the injury or the class of persons injured to which this constitutional right of redress attaches. . . . Thus, the right of redress for injury is constitutional in its nature but the nature of a specific injury is a right derived from the common law or statute. ... A statute limiting the liability of owners who provide the public with park area for outdoor recreational purposes is a reasonable exercise of legislative power, and it does not violate the constitutional provision that the courts shall be open to every person for redress of any injury.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 173-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-557g provides that an injury caused by negligence or nuisance on land provided for public recreational use is not an actionable injury. Consequently, such injury is not subject to preservation under article first, \u00a7 10, of the Connecticut constitution. \u201cWhat is of constitutional dimensions, then, is the right of redress and not the nature of the particular injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>for which redress is sought. Stated differently, the right to redress in the courts must remain inviolate but it does not attach unless one suffers a recognized injury.\u201d <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>supra, 169 Conn. 284. Consistent with prior cases, we conclude that the act does not violate article first, \u00a7 10, of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The plaintiff next claims that during the tennis tournament the association owes a duty to the athletes that is independent of its role as \u201cowner,\u201d and that such duty is not affected by the immunity protection of \u00a7 52-557g. She argues that a public school \u201cauthority owes a duty of ordinary care under the circumstances to participants in . . . athletic events sponsored, or conducted under the auspices of, such authority.\u201d 35 A.L.R.3d 734 (1971).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The alleged duty turns on the relationship between an academic institution and its students. The plaintiff further claims that this issue involved a finding of fact, and that the trial court erroneously rendered summary judgment in light of the existence of a disputed fact. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-557h provides only two exceptions to immunity from liability under this statute: (1) if a fee is charged for the use of the land; or (2) if the landowner wilfully or maliciously fails to warn against a dangerous condition. The plaintiff does not allege that either of the exceptions apply. It is well settled that a court cannot read additional exceptions into a statute where the legislature has neglected or chosen not to do so. See <em>Vaillancourt v. New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 396, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993); <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>169 Conn. 445, 452, 364 A.2d 167 (1975). Furthermore, in <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Barenz, </em>221 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>256, 603 A.2d 399 (1992), our Supreme Court expressly rejected a similar claim. The court in <em>Manning </em>held that the defendant, employees of the landowner, \u201cmust be considered within the definition of \u2018owners\u2019 by reason of their being \u2018persons in control of the premises\u2019 .... To hold otherwise would render the statute meaningless. The plaintiffs could completely bypass this legislation by simply bringing suit against [an owner\u2019s employees].\u201d Id., 262. The end result could be that the protected parties would be liable for the damages from which they are immune by \u00a7 52-557g.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">To hold that the association owed a supplemental duty of care would effectively circumvent \u00a7 52-557g. That statute explicitly defines an injury on land open to the public for recreational purposes as nonactionable. It provides that \u201cno duty of care\u201d is owed to persons entering the land for recreational purposes and that the landowner does not \u201c[m]ake any representation that the premises are safe for any purpose.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-557g (b) (1). The statute also provides that the landowner does not \u201cassume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-557g (b) (3). The association falls within the statutory definition set forth in \u00a7 52-557f (3) as an \u201cowner\u201d by being a \u201cperson in control of the premises.\u201d The association is consequently immune from liability for the plaintiffs injuries that resulted from her fall on premises covered by the recreational use statute. The plaintiffs claim that an issue of material fact exists is without merit because \u201c[t]he question whether the statute applies is a matter of law and, since no genuine issue of material facts relevant to this determination exists, summary judgment is appropriate.\u201d <em>Jennett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>597 F. Sup. 110, 112 (D. Conn. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The plaintiffs remaining claim is that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the property was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>made available to the public as required by \u00a7 52-557g. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In order to prevail on their motion for summary judgment, Dixon and the town, had the burden of proving that the land was made available to the public for the purposes of recreation and that no fee was charged for the use of the premises pursuant to \u00a7 52-557g. In support of their motion, they submitted the affidavits of town attorney G. Kenneth Bernhard and parks and recreation director Steve Pierce.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fact that no fee was charged was unchallenged. On December 19, 1990, Pierce, in answer to an interrogatory propounded by the plaintiff, stated that the tennis courts were not available to the public during the tennis tournament. In his affidavit of July 15, 1992, however, Pierce stated that \u201csaid tennis courts were open for public/recreational use at the site of the [conference] High School Girls\u2019 Tournament.\u201d The plaintiff claims that this apparent inconsistency is a disputed issue of material fact. Our Supreme Court has previously decided that because only one group of users can access a particular facility at a given time does not mean that the public has no access. It simply means that physical limitations preclude simultaneous unlimited access to a facility at all times by all members of the public. See <em>Scrapchansky </em>v. <em>Plainfield, </em>226 Conn. 446, 452-54, 627 A.2d 1329 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The legislature has defined \u201crecreational purpose\u201d in \u00a7 52-557g as, including, but not limited to, recreational activities, several of which are competitive team sports. \u201cTeam sports are certainly recreational and no less so if teams are organized into a league. . . . Because an amateur sport is organized and played by teams does not deprive it of its recreational qualities. To conclude otherwise would be to impose an overly restrictive meaning on the term \u2018recreational purpose\u2019 in the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ute, a meaning that is not warranted by the \u2018includes, but is not limited to\u2019 language of \u00a7 52-557\u00cd (4).\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 457-58. The Supreme Court in <em>Scrapchan-sky </em>recognized that certain team sports necessarily place limitations on the land\u2019s status as \u201cavailable to the public.\u201d Id., 452-53. There is no inconsistency, and, therefore, there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute. Therefore, the trial court properly granted the town\u2019s and Dixon\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-12\"> Dixon was the parks and recreation director for the town at the time of the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-13\"> The Connecticut Association of Secondary Schools is now named the Connecticut Association of Schools.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b306-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-557\u00cd provides: \u201cAs used in sections 52-557\u00cd to 52-557i, inclusive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">\u201c(1) \u2018Charge\u2019 means the admission price or fee asked in return for invitation or permission to enter or go upon the land;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\u201c(2) \u2018Land\u2019 means land, roads, water, watercourses, private ways and buildings, structures, and machinery or equipment when attached to the realty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">\u201c(3) \u2018Owner\u2019 means the possessor of a fee interest, a tenant, lessee, occupant or person in control of the premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">\u201c(4) \u2018Recreational purpose\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, any of the following, or any combination thereof: Hunting, fishing, swimming, boating, camping, picnicking, hiking, pleasure driving, nature study, water skiing, snow skiing, ice skating, sledding, hang gliding, sport parachuting, hot air ballooning and viewing or enjoying historical, archaeological, scenic or scientific sites.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-557g provides: \u201c(a) Except as provided in section 52-557h, an owner of land who makes all or any part of the land available to the public without charge, rent, fee or other commercial service for recreational purposes owes no duty of care to keep the land, or the part thereof so made available, safe for entry or use by others for recreational purposes, or to give any warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure or activity on the land to persons entering for recreational purposes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-12\">\u201c(b) Except as provided in section 52-557h, an owner of land who, either directly or indirectly, invites or permits without charge, rent, fee or other commercial service any person to use the land, or part thereof, for recreational purposes does not thereby: (1) Make any representation that the premises are safe for any purpose;
