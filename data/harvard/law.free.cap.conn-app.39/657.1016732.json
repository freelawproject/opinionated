The defendant originally appealed to this court from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (B),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and two counts of assault of a peace officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>33 Conn. App. 743, 744, 641 A.2d 131 (1994). In his original appeal to us, the defendant asserted that the trial court had improperly (1) denied his motions for a directed verdict and judgment of acquittal on the count of sexual assault in the third degree, (2) instructed the jury by failing to relate the issues of law to the facts of the case, and (3) instructed the jury on the crime of risk of injury to a child. Id. Concerning the defendant\u2019s first claim, we concluded that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a directed verdict and judgment of acquittal because the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction of the defendant for the crime of sexual assault in the third degree. Id., 747-48A. We agreed with the defendant\u2019s second claim, however, that the trial court improperly failed to relate the issues of law to the facts of the case and on that ground reversed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 748A-54. Because we agreed with the defendant\u2019s second claim, we did not address the defendant\u2019s third claim that the trial court improperly instructed the jury as to the crime of risk of injury to a child. Id., 744, 744 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Our Supreme Court granted the state\u2019s petition for certification. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>230 Conn. 909, 644 A.2d 920 (1994).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court reversed this court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>remanded the case to us with direction to resolve the remaining issues on appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 516. The only remaining claim in this appeal is the defendant\u2019s third claim that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the crime of risk of injury to a child. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 744 n.4. We are not persuaded that the jury instructions as to the crime of risk of injury to a child were improper. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\u201cThe jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On June 20, 1991, the victim, his mother, the defendant, Barbara Tirado and her daughter went to a lake. The victim was eight years old at the time. After staying at the lake, they drove to the home of the defendant\u2019s mother, then to the home of his sister and then to Tirado\u2019s home located on Maple Street in Meriden. The victim\u2019s father later joined the group and the adults all began drinking. The victim fell asleep on the couch in Tirado\u2019s home wearing his pants, shirt and underpants. The victim\u2019s father was asleep on a chair near the couch and the victim\u2019s mother was asleep in another room. The victim awoke to find the defendant placing his hands between the victim\u2019s legs on the outside of the victim\u2019s pants. The defendant was attempting to pull down the victim\u2019s pants. The defendant was behind the victim on the couch and the victim was facing away from the defendant. The defendant told him to be quiet. The victim took off his pants while the defendant continued to touch the outside of the underpants between the legs and then the defendant cut the victim\u2019s underpants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The victim was scared and ran to his mother\u2019s room and told her what had just occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\u201cThe victim\u2019s mother ran into the living room to wake the victim\u2019s father. In the meantime, the defendant, who was wearing only a tee shirt, ran down the stairs and out the backdoor. Tirado caught the defendant outside and asked him \u2018why he did it\u2019 and the defendant responded that he was sorry and the drugs made him do it. Tirado brought the defendant back upstairs. The victim\u2019s father and the defendant then fought while the victim\u2019s mother took off the victim\u2019s underpants and dressed him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The victim then went downstairs with his parents and got into a van. The victim\u2019s father began to drive on Main Street in Meriden to the police station when he obseived the defendant driving a truck with Tirado as a passenger on Maple Street. The victim\u2019s father blocked the defendant\u2019s vehicle and the two vehicles collided. The victim and his mother exited the van and proceeded to the side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\u201cOfficers Michael Merrigan, Mark Masse and Grant Treiber of the Meriden police department arrived at the scene in uniform shortly thereafter. Merrigan approached the father and was informed by him about the events that occurred at Tirado\u2019s home. Masse and Treiber approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle and asked him to exit it. As they attempted to open the door of the defendant\u2019s vehicle and take the keys, the defendant hit Treiber in the face and drove the vehicle in reverse. The officers at that point were hanging onto the doors of the vehicle. The truck veered to the right and almost hit a building on Maple Street. Treiber fell off the side of the truck and Masse hit a door attached to the building with sufficient force to break a hole in the door. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Masse sustained lacerations to his right hand, right forearm, shoulder and back. Treiber sustained bruises and injured his right hand. Treiber then placed the defendant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">\u201cAt the crime scene, Robert Pocobello, a Meriden police detective, seized a pair of scissors and underpants. He discovered the scissors on a coffee table near the couch and the underpants on the couch. Pocobello processed the scissors for fingerprints. The processing revealed the presence of fingerprints that were not clear enough to be identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\u201cTed Standish, another Meriden police detective, employed by the department\u2019s sexual assault unit, interviewed the victim on June 21, 1991. The victim stated that after arriving at Tirado\u2019s home, she told him to sleep on the couch, where the defendant was already sleeping. The victim further told Standish that he awoke when the defendant placed his hands on the victim\u2019s \u2018dinky\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the defendant pulled at the victim\u2019s pants. The victim also told Standish that the defendant told the victim to take off his pants and keep quiet. The victim then told Standish that the defendant tried to make him take off his underpants and when he refused, the defendant cut the underpants with scissors.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">\u201cThe defendant disputed the facts. He testified on his own behalf that he, the victim, Tirado and the victim\u2019s mother arrived at Tirado\u2019s home after they had spent the day at the lake. The defendant also testified that he left Tirado\u2019s at 11 p.m., just after the victim\u2019s father arrived, returned at around 4:30 or 5 a.m., and found Tirado and the victim\u2019s father drinking and the victim asleep on the couch. The defendant also stated that he fell asleep on the couch, \u2018opposite the victim\u2019 and awoke to find the victim\u2019s father with his hand in the pocket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s pants, which the defendant had on, and thought that the victim\u2019s father was attempting to steal money. The defendant then testified that he tried to get up and that the victim\u2019s father jumped on him and hit him in the face. The defendant then testified that Tirado offered to drive him to the hospital and that he accepted Tirado\u2019s offer. He further testified that as Tirado drove him to the hospital, the victim\u2019s father forced their vehicle to a stop on Maple Street. The defendant then testified that he moved into the driver\u2019s seat, placed the track in reverse and police officers tried to grab him, causing the track to move in reverse.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 744-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In the only issue remaining to be resolved, the defendant asserts that the trial court improperly instructed the jury with respect to the law governing the crime of risk of injury to a child. We are unpersuaded. The defendant concedes that this issue was not properly preserved for review in the trial court, but seeks review under the well established principles of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We will not again set out the four prongs of <em>Golding </em>that the defendant must satisfy in order to show entitlement to review. Id., 239-40.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The following additional facts are necessary to the resolution of this appeal. In the third count of the long form information, the state charged the defendant with the crime of risk of injury to a child and alleged that \u201cin the City of Meriden, on or about the 21st day of June, 1991, at or about 5:30 a.m, the said Kenneth Lemoine, Jr. did wilfully or unlawfully perform an act likely to impair the health or morals of a child, to wit: [D.N.], a minor, under the age of sixteen years, by caus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ing the removal or attempted removal of clothing from such a child, and rubbing the genital area of said child in violation of Section 53-21 of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d In its charge to the jury regarding the crime of risk of injury to a child, the trial court focused on the principle that the state had to establish three elements in order to prove the existence of the crime: \u201c(1) that the victim was less than sixteen years of age, (2) that the defendant perpetrated an act upon the victim and (3) that this act was likely to be injurious to his health or morals. The acts prohibited are those acts that are directly perpetrated on the person of a minor and injurious to his health or moral well-being.\u201d The trial court then properly defined the terms health and impair.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The defendant asserts that the trial court, in its jury instructions, failed to limit explicitly the jury\u2019s inquiry to the specific acts alleged by the state in the third count of the information. The defendant claims that this failure unconstitutionally \u201cenlarged\u201d the crime with which the defendant had been charged. The trial court\u2019s instruction regarding the third count of the information, however, is not an instruction that implicates a constitutional violation as enumerated in our enlargement case law. The defendant\u2019s mere assertion that the jury instruction must be subjected to an enlargement analysis does not automatically mandate such an analysis. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>37 Conn. App. 722, 730, 657 A.2d 711, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 915, 660 A.2d 357 (1995) (\u201c \u2018[rjobing garden variety claims of improper jury instructions concerning evidentiary matters in the majestic garb of constitutional claims does not make such claims constitutional in nature\u2019 \u201d). Our enlargement cases involve claims that the trial court expanded the state\u2019s information by instructing the jury on statutory or factual alternatives not charged in the information. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Scognamiglio, </em>202 Conn. 18, 519 A.2d 607 (1987) (statutory alternative); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>222 Conn. 506, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992) (factual alternative). Enlargement cases are properly analyzed under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. \u201c \u2018The sixth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to be informed of the nature of the charge against him \u201cwith sufficient precision to enable him to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise, and ... to enable him to plead his acquittal or conviction in bar of any future prosecution for the same offense . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>178 Conn. 163, 168, 422 A.2d 299 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 154, 460 A.2d 26 (1983).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 490, 508 A.2d 22 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 560, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Scognamiglio, </em>supra, 22. It is incumbent upon the defendant in an enlargement case to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s charge caused him unfair surprise or prejudiced him in the preparation of his defense. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Here, the trial court correctly set forth the elements of the crime of risk of injury, and did not expand the information by instructing the jury on a statutory or factual alternative not charged in the information. An unconstitutional enlargement is therefore not in issue. The instruction involved here is not the kind of instruction that we consider in the context of the test for enlargement to determine whether a constitutional violation exists that clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Although we conclude that no unconstitutional enlargement exists here, we will review the charge as a whole to determine if the charge deprived the defendant of a fair trial. \u201cIn reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instructions, we must consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>223 Conn. 595, 607, 613 A.2d 731 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>[205 Conn. 578, 595 n.11, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 273, 368 A.2d 222 (1976). The test is whether the charge as a whole presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Utz, </em>201 Conn. 190, 196-97, 513 A.2d 1191 (1986). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>225 Conn. 650, 661, 626 A.2d 287 (1993). We will reverse a conviction only if, in the context of the whole, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Scognamiglio, </em>[supra, 202 Conn. 28]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>212 Conn. 387, 408, 563 A.2d 646, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 980, 110 S. Ct. 510, 107 L. Ed. 2d 512 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 268-69, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\u201cA jury instruction is constitutionally adequate if it provides the jurors with a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and affords them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Usry, </em>205 Conn. 298, 316, 533 A.2d 212 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 581, 500 A.2d 539 (1985); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>208 Conn. 125, 132, 545 A.2d 1026, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 895, 109 S. Ct. 235, 102 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1988). An instruction that fails to satisfy these requirements would violate the defendant\u2019s right to due process of law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 36, 561 A.2d 897 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>202 Conn. 520, 537, 522 A.2d 277 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>[supra, 198 Conn. 269-70]. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 602-603.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>\u201cThe test of a charge is whether it is correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury. <em>Berniere </em>v. <em>Kripps, </em>157 Conn. 356, 358, 254 A.2d 496 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>153 Conn. 540, 219 A.2d 218 (1966) .... The primary purpose of the charge is to assist the jury in applying the law correctly to the facts which they might find to be established. <em>Vita </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>158 Conn. 75, 77, 225 A.2d 848 (1969); <em>Worden </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>153 Conn. 578, 579, 219 A.2d 442 (1966). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>[178 Conn. 170]. The purpose of a charge is to call the attention of the members of the jury, unfamiliar with legal distinctions, to whatever is necessary and proper to guide them to a right decision in a particular case. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Tousignant, </em>172 Conn. 54, 59-60, 372 A.2d 151 (1976).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 509-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Here, the defendant was charged in the state\u2019s long form information in nine separate counts. See id., 512-13. \u201cAfter the close of evidence and immediately after the final arguments of counsel, the trial court instructed the jury as to the law applicable to all of the charges against the defendant. The court first instructed the jury on the general principles of law applicable to the case, such as reasonable doubt, direct evidence, circumstantial evidence and other principles typically contained in all criminal jury instructions. The court then instructed the jury accurately as to the elements the state must prove as to each crime charged in the information in order to convict the defendant.\u201d Id., 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We conclude that, in its charge to the jury, the trial court was not constitutionally obligated to articulate that the jury was limited in its consideration of the third count to the specific acts alleged by the state in its long form information. We are not persuaded that it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s failure to do so. \u201cMoreover, the information, which the jury had with it during its deliberations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>clearly stated to which victim each of the nine counts pertained\u201d; id., 514; and to which alleged acts of the defendant each of the nine counts pertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\u201cIn assessing whether a jury reasonably could have been misled by the court\u2019s instructions ... it is always proper to consider whether the issues in the case are complicated.\u201d Id., 514-15. \u201cIn the present appeal, although the defendant was charged with nine separate counts in the information, the evidence related to those charges was not complicated and the charges arose from three separate and distinct incidents. The first three counts against the defendant all related to the minor victim and concerned the incident involving sexual conduct at Tirado\u2019s apartment. The two counts of reckless endangerment arose from the collision of the defendant\u2019s truck with the victim\u2019s father\u2019s van at the comer of Maple Street and Main Street in Meriden. The assault counts involved only the police officers. The three incidents were not similar. Moreover, the final arguments of counsel, delivered immediately prior to the court\u2019s instructions, thoroughly reviewed the testimony elicited from the witnesses.\u201d Id., 515-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">\u201cWe conclude that the court\u2019s jury instructions, when examined as a whole and in the context of the entire trial, achieved their purpose of assisting the jury in applying the law. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 170-71. . . . We also conclude that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions and that no injustice to the defendant resulted by reason of the court\u2019s instructions. See <em>Amato </em>v. <em>Sawicki, </em>159 Conn. 490, 494, 271 A.2d 80 (1970). There was, therefore, no due process violation under either the state or the federal constitution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the third degree when such person (1) compels another person to submit to sexual contact . . .
