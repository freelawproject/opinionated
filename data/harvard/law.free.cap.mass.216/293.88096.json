Milliken. The facts found by the board were these:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Milliken, at the time of his death in October, 1912, and for some twenty-seven years before that time, had been a driver in the employ of A. Towle and Company, the insured, who were teamsters. Some four or five years before his death Milliken, in the course of his employment, fell from his wagon, striking on his head. This caused <em>inter alla </em>an impairment of memory. One afternoon in July, 1912 (three months before his death), Milliken lost his memory while driving his employers\u2019 wagon in Boston, and for half an hour was unable to remember where he was or to identify the streets in which he was driving, although they were streets with which he was \u201cthoroughly familiar.\u201d During the day of October 8, 1912, from a similar failure of memory Milliken did not call for packages, as his duties required, and reported (contrary to the fact) that he had not received them because they were not ready. Thereupon he was directed to drive his wagon to his employers\u2019 stable in Charlestown to be put up for the night. Driving his wagon to the stable for the night was part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of Milliken\u2019s regular work. This order was given to Milliken, at about five o\u2019clock in the afternoon at his employers\u2019 Boston office in Matthews Street near Post Office Square. \u201cAt some place between Post Office Square and the stable in Charlestown he was seized with such a loss of memory and mental faculties that he was unable to recognize streets and places, and on account of such disordered mental condition he became lost and unable to direct the horse to the stable.\u201d About eleven o\u2019clock that night Milliken was seen driving the wagon in a private way in Burlington and was helped back to the public highway, whereupon he drove away in the direction of Lowell. At this time Milliken would not speak. At about six o\u2019clock the following morning Milliken was found lying in a swamp in Woburn and \u2014 with the exception of his head \u2014 covered with mud and water. His hat was found on the \u201cadjacent road\u201d some two hundred feet away, and the horse and wagon were found \u201cby the side of said road about half a mile distant in the direction of Boston.\u201d Milliken was taken to a hospital at Woburn, where he died on October 14, without recovering his memory. He \u201cspoke in a delirium only of looking for his horse.\u201d The cause of his death was pneumonia, brought on by cold and exposure while lying in the swamp.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The Industrial Accident Board found: \u201cThat the loss of memory with which the employee, Milliken, was seized was not in itself a fatal disorder, and that he would not have met his death as he did but for the horse and wagon and his effort to get them to the stable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The dependent\u2019s contention is that Milliken\u2019s death was caused by pneumonia brought on by his falling into the swamp and lying there all night; that under these circumstances falling into the swamp and lying there all night was a personal injury which caused his death; and for this she relies on <em>Alloc Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Drylie, 50 </em>S. L. R. 350, and <em>Kelly v. Auchenlea Coal Co. </em>48 S. L. R. 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The fact that Milliken \u201cwould not have met his death as he did but for the horse and wagon and his effort to get them to the stable,\u201d goes no farther than to show that the personal injury suffered by Milliken was a personal injury \u201cin the course of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The difficulty in the case arises from the provision that the personal injury must be one \u201carising out of\u201d as well as one \u201cin the course of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">It was held in <em>McNicol\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 497, that the provision limiting the personal injuries for which compensation is to be made to those \u201carising out of\u201d the employee\u2019s employment means that the nature and conditions of the employment must be such that the personal injury which in fact happened was one likely to happen to an employee in that employment. In that case it was said that there must be a \u201c causal connection\u201d between the employment and the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">There is nothing in the employment of driving a wagon which makes it likely that the employee will alight from his wagon, wander to and fall into a swamp, and lie there all' night. The distinction between the case at bar and a case within this clause of the act is well brought out by what is suggested by a remark of the majority of the Industrial Accident Board. If the horse driven by Milliken had run away and Milliken had been thereby thrown out and killed, the personal injury in fact suffered in that case would have been one which from the nature of his employment would be likely to arise, and so would be one \u201carising out of his [the employee\u2019s] employment.\u201d But as we have said, there is nothing in the employment of driving a wagon which makes it likely that the employee will alight from his wagon, wander to and fall into a swamp, and lie there all night. <em>Sneddon </em>v. <em>Greenfield Coal &amp; Brick Co. </em>47 S. L. R. 337, much relied on here by the dependent, is another case which brings out the distinction. There a miner got lost in the underground ways of a mine and was killed by the exhaust steam from an engine which was not fenced off. See also <em>Wicks </em>v. <em>Dowell &amp; Co. </em>[1905] 2 K. B. 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">We find nothing in the other cases relied on by the dependent which calls for notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">It seems plain that, if Milliken\u2019s death was caused by a personal injury, it was the one which happened some four or five years before the occurrence here complained of and before the workmen\u2019s compensation act was passed. At that time he fell from his wagon and striking on his head suffered as a result \u201can impairment of his memory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The decree of the Superior Court appealed from is reversed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>and a decree should be entered declaring that the dependent has no claim against the insurer.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b324-4\"><em>W.
