Writ dated March 13, 1912.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Sanderson, </em>J. It appeared that the sidewalk in question adjoined a two apartment house of the defendant, and that a gutter on the house was out of repair, causing water to run upon the sidewalk, where it froze. The house was occupied by two families who were tenants at will. There was evidence that one of the tenants had placed sand and ashes on the ice upon which the plaintiff slipped, and that children in their play had brushed them off. One of the witnesses for the defendant testified \u201cthat he had full charge of the defendant\u2019s building at the time of the accident, and that it was a part of his duty to collect the rents and to have repairs made.\u201d The evidence of the plaintiff is described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-6\">\u201cIt was agreed that the duty of caring for snow and ice on the sidewalk, by the ordinances of the city of Salem, rested upon the tenants or occupants of the premises, if there were any.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-7\">The defendant asked the judge to order a verdict in his favor. The judge refused to do so. The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,250; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-8\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b610-9\"><em>H. R. Bygrave, &amp; W. Rand, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b610-10\"><em>J. J.

As to the negligence of the defendant, the evidence properly warranted findings by the jury that, although the defendant had let different parts of the building to different tenants at will, he nevertheless retained control of the outside of the building, including the roof and the gutters, and that upon him rested the responsibility as to repairs; that the gutter was negligently suffered by the defendant to be out of repair, so that the water flowed upon the sidewalk of a public street and there freezing rendered the walk dangerous to public travel and a nuisance; that the defendant knew or ought to have known this and that the plaintiff, while travel-ling thereon, was injured thereby.
