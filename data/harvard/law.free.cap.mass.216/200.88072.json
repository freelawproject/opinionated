At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-6\">\u201c1. .Upon all the evidence plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-7\">\u201c2. There is no evidence to warrant a finding that Dixon in ejecting the plaintiff was acting as the agent or as the servant of the defendant\u2019s intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-8\">\u201c3. Unless the plaintiff proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s intestate personally ordered the ejection of the plaintiff from personal motives the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-9\"><em>\u201c4. </em>If the orders to keep the plaintiff from the factory were issued because of the complaints of Warner and for the business of the company the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d Warner was an employee of the American Skate Company, who formerly had worked for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-10\">The judge refused to give the first two rulings requested. He gave the third ruling requested, and as to the fourth ruled that \u201cin the light of the evidence this request cannot be given as stated.\u201d The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,200; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-11\"><em>W. B. Farr, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-12\"><em>J. W.

There was no error in the manner in which he dealt with the requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
