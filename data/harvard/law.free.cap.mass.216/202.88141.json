Following <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Page, </em>186 Mass. 600.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-9\">Tort for damage to a wagon of the plaintiffs alleged to have been caused by negligence of a servant of the defendant when driving a horse attached to a wagon of the defendant along Blue Hill Avenue in Boston. Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston, dated September 16, 1912.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-10\">In the Municipal Court <em>Bennett, </em>J., refused to rule that upon all the evidence \u201cthe injury and damage complained of was too remote to recover\u201d and that the collision of the defendant\u2019s horse and wagon with those of the plaintiffs was not the proximate cause of the damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 wagon. He found for the plaintiffs in the sum of $100.25, and at the defendant\u2019s request reported his ruling to the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division made an order that the report be dismissed and that the plaintiffs be awarded double costs. The defendant appealed to this court under St. 1912, c. 649, \u00a7 9.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-11\">The evidence as stated in the report showed the following facts: On the date of the accident the plaintiffs\u2019 team was standing on the right side of Blue Hill Avenue, close to the curbstone, with the wheels fastened. The driver of the team was in a store nearby delivering bread/ The defendant\u2019s team was being driven along the highway by his servant, in the same direction in which the plaintiffs\u2019 team was headed, and, in passing, came into collision with it and the plaintiffs\u2019 horse thereupon ran away. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>horse in running away continued along Blue Hill Avenue in the direction in which he was headed, going for some distance on the right hand side of the street and for another part of the distance in the car tracks. While he was so continuing to run, some person on the highway near the car tracks threw his hands up in the air apparently to \u201cshoo\u201d the horse, and thereafter the plaintiffs\u2019 team came into collision with an electric street car which was moving toward it. The rear wheel of the plaintiffs\u2019 wagon came in contact with the car, the wagon was overturned and the damage complained, of resulted. The evidence showed that the motorman of the car was using every effort to bring the car to a standstill to avoid a collision and that he practically had brought it to a standstill at the time the plaintiffs\u2019 team came into collision with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-6\"><em>A. Blumenthal, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-7\"><em>J. F. McDonald &amp; J. M. Graham,, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b231-8\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A22\">The report shows that the servant of the defendant negligently caused the plaintiffs\u2019 team to run away on a street in Boston and some person \u201cthrew his hands up in the air apparently to \u2018 shoo \u2019 the horse,\u201d and thereafter the team came into collision with an electric car without fault of those in control of the car, whereby the plaintiffs were injured in their property, to recover damages for which this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The injury to the plaintiffs was not too remote from the act of the defendant\u2019s servant. The intervening act of the man throwing up his hands did not break the causal connection between the tortious act of the defendant and the damage done to the plaintiffs. The wrongful conduct of the defendant might have been found to have been the proximate cause of the harm to the plaintiffs. The facts are almost exactly like those in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Page, </em>186 Mass. 600, in which the plaintiff was held entitled to recover. That case is decisive against the contentions of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
